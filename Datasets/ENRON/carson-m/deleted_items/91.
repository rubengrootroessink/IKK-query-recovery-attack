PORN GOES PUBLIC

With sharp economic ups and downs, it is surprising that any company would dare go public now. That is unless you happen to contain the only two money making Internet business models. Jade Entertainment Group (proposed symbol, NASDAQ OTCBB: JENT), announced it's self directed IPO of 500,000 shares of common stock at $3.00 per share recently, and expects to be publicly traded within 60 days.

So why risk an IPO now? Simple. JENT's main web property www.askjade.com merges the much acclaimed pay-per-click search engine model (goto.com and Findwhat.com:FWHT) and the ever-profitable Adult Entertainment Industry (Private: PRVT  and New Frontier Media: NOOF). Askjade.com is a mega adult search engine that allows owners of adult sites to bid on how much they will pay for a click-through to their site. This bid determines the placement within the engine. The higher the bid for particular keywords, the higher the bidder appears in the search results.

With plans to expand into content distribution, and over 300 webmasters already signed up and funding accounts, The company shows great promise of generating major revenues by years end. Already generating enough revenue to cover technical overhead, the company projects short term revenue in the millions. "Going public allows us to quickly generate funds for marketing that will get us where we want to be sooner rather than later", states President Tim Schmidt, "Usually only webmasters and owners of adult sites get rich off of the industry, we are giving the investor a chance to take advantage.

A two-year study by Alexa Research has revealed, Sex-related terms remain quite popular among Internet searches. "Sex" was the most popular term for which people searched. Of all the terms searched for online, 0.3289% -- or roughly 1 of every 300 terms -- were "sex." People search for "sex" more often than "games," "music," "travel," "jokes," "cars," "jobs," "weather" and "health" combined. "Porn" (along with "porno" and "pornography") was the fourth most popular search term. "Nude" (and "nudes"), "xxx," "Playboy" and "erotic stories" (and "erotica") were also among the top 20.
