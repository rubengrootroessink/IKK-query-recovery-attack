, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg=
 or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out =
of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respec=
table, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts U=
pdated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse im=
pact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still ne=
ed to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle aga=
in! st! a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you se=
rviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Da=
ns Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Ari=
zona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB P=
IT - Commissioner Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has imp=
roved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using=
 on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is=
 a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your=
 league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson sh=
ould play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passin=
g game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson w=
ill be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fa=
natics Updated 11/21/01Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to=
 locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definit=
ely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK -=
 Damons Doormats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats =
against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury a=
nd New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another =
alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Update=
d 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. Whil=
e he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for t=
he wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you sh=
ould consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - =
Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for h=
is owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been =
throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a medioc=
re Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/0=
1Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'=
ll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend y=
ou get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - =
Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this seaso=
n, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him =
prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup =
the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated =
11/21/01  There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield fo=
r a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep=
 leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins=
 may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense hon=
est. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been wea=
k against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 1=
1/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawk=
s. While he ha! s ! been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him=
 active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01=
 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of th=
e end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but=
 you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running ba=
ck depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/=
21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seah=
awks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options.=
 He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB K=
C - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back=
 role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the S=
eahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and=
 if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth =
putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/=
21/0!  The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on S=
unday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We =
recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against=
 the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/0=
1 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebo=
und Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this qu=
estionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone=
 quarterback.  Stephen Alexander  , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Ac=
cording to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in the starting line=
up on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent prior to suffer=
ing an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gamble.   Kyle Brady =
, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy =
stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this week against th=
e Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slump.  Rod =
Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held =
down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto th=
e ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, makin=
g him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC=
 - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in=
 Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the possibility o=
f Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardel=
l has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't b=
e counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Woltys Wonde=
rs Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straig=
ht game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your leagu=
e. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough =
to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Joseph , RB =
JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could break off s=
ome long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we=
 only recommend you use him this week if you have no other options at runni=
ng ! ba! ck.  Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Polla=
rd will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulter=
s on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in re=
cent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should=
 probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrence Wilkins ,=
 WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start in place o=
f the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins coul=
d get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Nine=
rs secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other options at=
 wide receiver.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 H=
arrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. Howev=
er, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfi=
eld for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Dans Dawgs Update=
d 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you sho=
uld definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like sta=
ts, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clark , TE DE=
N - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes thrown h=
is way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key member of=
 the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will =
likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to start one it=
 should definitely be Clark.  More Updates   Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]Car=
sons Wildcats Player News  Mark Brunell , Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01 Brune=
ll's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltim=
ore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn=
't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Qui=
nn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you should=
n't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.  Ahman Green , Acti=
ve RB Updated 11/21/01 Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week O=
ne, rushing for 157 yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 =
against those same Lions, whose defense is questionable at best.   Kurt War=
ner , Active QB Updated 11/21/01 Warner had a solid game against New Englan=
d last Sunday, throwing for 401 yards and three touchdowns. He's too good t=
o ever consider benching, and will throw at least two touchdowns against Ta=
mpa Bay's inconsistent secondary.   Shannon Sharpe , Active TE Updated 11/2=
1/01 Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one rece=
iving touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced =
Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe i=
nto your active lineup every week.  Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 11/21/01=
 Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend agains=
t New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and =
is worth starting on a weekly basis.   David Patten , Active WR Updated 11/=
21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he =
has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wi=
deout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should =
consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Rod Gardner , Reserve WR U=
pdated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and =
is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough P=
hiladelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy pe=
rspective.   Michael Pittman , Reserve RB Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroi=
t defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pi=
ttman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  Freddie =
Jones , Reserve TE Updated 11/18/01 Jones (ankle) has been declared inactiv=
e for Sunday's game. He has been advised not to play for two weeks.  LaDain=
ian Tomlinson , Active RB Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing =
numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall stat=
istics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to=
 do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Matt Stover =
, Active K Updated 10/25/01 Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent=
 him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to=
 published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are =
considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs=
.   Steve Christie , Reserve K Updated 09/11/01 According to published repo=
rts, Christie has been released by the Buffalo Bills. Christie, who was pla=
ced on injured reserve due to a groin injury last week, will have an MRI on=
 Tuesday. Drop Christie now if you haven't already done so, and consider pi=
cking up Jake Arians, who has taken over the placekicking duties in Buffalo=
.   Travis Prentice , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01 Prentice was traded to th=
e Vikings, where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not wo=
rth a Fantasy draft choice right now.   Rams , Active DT Updated 08/30/01 H=
ead Coach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Ad=
am Archuleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletch=
er (hamstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' =
final preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener=
 against Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-roun=
d selection on Draft Day.   Steelers , Reserve DT Updated 08/25/01 Defensiv=
e back Chad Scott sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee=
 on Saturday. He is expected to have an MRI this weekend, and the team is u=
ncertain of just how long he'll be out.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissio=
