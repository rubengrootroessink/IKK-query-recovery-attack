Some friends of my wife and I are throwing a little bash on the evening of 
September 9th for my upcoming baby BOY.   I would like to invite you all to 
attend.  I believe there will be a margarita machine....

If you want to come,, please reply by sending me your address.  You will then 
recieve an invitation by mail.

Hope to see you there,,

Mike
