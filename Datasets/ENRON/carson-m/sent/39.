Subject: Check out Radio stations from around the world


 <A HREF="http://www.radio-stations.net/index.php3">Click here: Radio
stations from around the world</A>

This is a good site to quickly find worldwide radio stations on the
internet....can sort any way first by continent then by news, talk, type of
music etc.   Can be very interesting to "tune in" to say a world hot spot
when something is happening.  I go to KOMA and Bob Brinker and Guam from
here.   For instance, there was some news on a possible military takeover on
the island of Fiji this morning...i went to a Fiji news station.
