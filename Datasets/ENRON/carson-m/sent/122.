Chuck, good article about Theop's fish farm in the Oklahoman this morning.
I can save it for you or you can get it off the oklahoman web site. I am
still considering hockey tickets but if I wait too long its ok. I will let
you know real soon. Web site is www.oklahoman.com
Thought you might take a lood.
Steve
