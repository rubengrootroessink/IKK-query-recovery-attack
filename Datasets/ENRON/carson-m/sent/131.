RIBFEST IV

Mike Paradise produced an unparalleled performance last year managing to=20
dominate the lowest ranking of all the contestants by a considerable margin=
=20
for the second year in a row!  Additionally, the judges showed tremendous=
=20
wisdom picking the winner.  However, the nagging question remains; how good=
=20
does the perfect rib taste?  Thus, as the artist must pursue beauty, the=20
fourth annual celebration of the Baby Back Rib must take place.
=20
This event involves many of the things you need for a perfect weekend day:=
=20
eating a lot of ribs, imbibing libations, enjoying an autumn day, and=20
watching some football.  This year, the contestants will be cooking an absu=
rd=20
amount of ribs, allowing the crowd to voice their opinion on the "people's=
=20
choice" along with the official judging of the champion.  Cooking technique=
s=20
are hotly debated, and the insults are legion, but within a month, most=20
people are able to speak to each other again.
=20
If you think you=01,re going to make it please call Greg or Martha (713)=20
861-2766, we need to know how much to stock up on.  Kids are definitely=20
