Doing good.... My division  (Wholsale Energy Trading) just got sold to UBS Warburg, a swiss investment bank....  I will start work for them in about two weeks or so.   Other than that every thing is cool,,, Heather and I are getting ready for a trip to Aspen  in next couple weeks and the "Little Man" is still growing like a weed!

How are things in KC??

Mike,

I was wondering how your job was going.  I've obviously heard all the media
hype surrounding your company.  Please send me a email with an update.

Thanks,

Devin
