Whats up Mike?  Just thought that I would drop you a line and see how things
were going.  Hows the wife and kid?  San Fran. is cool, don't worry, I
haven't meet a boyfriend yet!  Drop me a line sometime and let me know what
you are up to.  CJ

Send me Phil's number and email, thought I would look him up since he only
lives an hour away,
