Dana Davis would like you and your spouse/significant other to join the Northeast Group for a weekend away at Barton Creek in Austin on July 20th - July 22nd.  Enron has arranged for morning golf on the Crenshaw Cliffside Course and relaxing afternoon Spa Services.  All accommodations, activities, and meals have been arranged, however, you will need to provide your own transporation to and from Austin, Texas. 

Please let me know by Friday, July 6th if you will be able to attend.


Thanks and hope to see you there,


Tjae
