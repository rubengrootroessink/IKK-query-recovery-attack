Yeah,  it has been a little hectic as of late.  I am still at Enron(for now).  I have been retained as part of the trading organization to stay with this entity to see if it sells.  We go to auction on Monday and will see what happens??  I guess the interested parties are UBS Warburg and Citigroup.  Good companies, but I will have to see what the $offer$ is for me personally.  Anyway, the family is doing GREAT and is looking forward to Christmas.  Harris is about 14mos now, so he kind of understands the whole presents thing, which should be fun!

Have a happy holiday!

Mike,

I haven't heard from you in a while and I was wondering how the bankruptcy
has affected you.  Please send me a note or call me at work(816) 218-1606
or at home (913) 642-9758.  Hope you're doing well!

Devin
