Mike,

If you have any trouble finding the restaurant, I've included directions
below:


To Chapel Hill from RDU Airport:

Take  I-40 West and proceed to exit 273 B which is
highway 54 West.

Proceed on 54 West which turns into Raleigh Road. Do not exit on 54-15-501
Bypass. At Country Club Road turn right. This is 3.9 miles from I-40.

Drive on Country Club Road for .4 mile and turn right on Raleigh Street.

Drive .2 mile on Raleigh Street to Franklin Street ( this is the main
street that runs through downtown Chapel Hill) and turn left on Franklin
Street.

Proceed west on Franklin Street and you will see  University Presbyterian
Church on your right  .3 mile and then continue another .4 mile and you
will see Michael Jordan's 23 on your right.

If you have any trouble, please call my cell (913) 481-4632.

Thanks,

Devin
