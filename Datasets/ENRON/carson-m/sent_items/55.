Mike,

Do you have any pictures of Harris that you could email me?  Laura and I
would like to see if he has his dad's good looks (ha ha).

Mike,

Thanks for the note, it was good to hear from you.  Quick update on us,
Laura and I bought a house in late September.
Our new address is 14501 W. 86th Street, Lenexa, KS, 66215.  Our house is
located in the Cedars development just off
of 87th St. and Lackman Rd.   Is this close to where you used to live?  All
of our family is doing well, we've  been getting
ready for Christmas (tree, lights, etc.).

I hope everything goes well with your work!

Yeah,  it has been a little hectic as of late.  I am still at Enron(for
now).  I have been retained as part of the trading organization to stay
with this entity to see if it sells.  We go to auction on Monday and will
see what happens??  I guess the interested parties are UBS Warburg and
Citigroup.  Good companies, but I will have to see what the $offer$ is for
me personally.  Anyway, the family is doing GREAT and is looking forward to
Christmas.  Harris is about 14mos now, so he kind of understands the whole
presents thing, which should be fun!

Have a happy holiday!

   Mike,

   I haven't heard from you in a while and I was wondering how the
   bankruptcy
   has affected you.  Please send me a note or call me at work(816)
   218-1606
   or at home (913) 642-9758.  Hope you're doing well!

   Devin
