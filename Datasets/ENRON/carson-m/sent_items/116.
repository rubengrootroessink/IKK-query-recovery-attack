New proposition!

Looks like fiedler has got to score over 32 tonight.....He's never done that before has he??

Lets say 70/30 split now (Me with the 70%),,,, no matter who wins,,, I believe this gets you an extra $100 or so... Not such a bad deal when you look at the odds!  Give me a shout and will discuss....
