I know things have been crazy, and you have had alot on your mind.  I just
wanted you to know Steph and I have thought alot about Heather and yourself,
and if there is anything we can do please let on know.  You know I am always
happy to help.  Hang in there, and when you get a chance give me a shout.
Take care.
