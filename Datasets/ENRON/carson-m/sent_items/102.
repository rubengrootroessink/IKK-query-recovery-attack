It looks like they may be wavering a bit.  The only catch is that the redir=
ect must be done 2 days ahead of time..  Also, there must be firm transmiss=
ion available on the redirected path.  Currently, in the short term at leas=
t, there is no firm transmission to any place of value,,,,ie SOCO, AMRN, TV=
A.  Entergy is still, unfortunately, LONG JAIL...
If you guys read this notice any different, please let me know.

Does this mean Ent is wavering on the firm point-to-point argument?  maybe =
pressure being felt through the RTO process?

Subject: =09Modification (REDIRECT) on a firm basis.


Effective 10:00 AM, Wednesday August 22, 2001, Entergy will begin accepting=
 partial term REDIRECTS on a firm basis.  Entergy believes the guidelines l=
isted below are necessary to manage the redirects on a firm basis, and succ=
essfully allow the recalled portion of the original reservation to become a=
vailable for other customers to purchase. If you have any questions, please=
 call David McNeill at 870-541-3931 or Cameron Warren at 870-543-5497.



Section 22.2 - Modification on a Firm Basis

a) As available, Entergy's transmission customers may modify the source/sin=
k or POR/POD of confirmed firm point-to-point service on a firm basis at no=
 additional cost per section 22.2 and Attachment 'M' of the OATT.

b) Requests to modify on a firm basis will be treated as a new request for =
firm service.

c) Requests to modify on a short-term firm basis must be submitted via OASI=
S using the REDIRECT function no later than 12:00 noon two days prior to th=
e start of the redirected service. Requests to modify on a long-term firm b=
asis (twelve months or longer) will be processed according to the current b=
usiness practices for original long-term firm service.

d) Request to modify on a firm basis must be pre-confirmed.

e) The REDIRECT request must include the assignment number of the original =
request in the related reference field.

f) Requests to modify on a firm basis must specify the exact same capacity =
as the original request.

g) Requests to modify on a firm basis must not be for an interval of the or=
iginal reservation in which a previously submitted schedule exists.

h) Requests to modify on a firm basis may be submitted in daily, weekly, mo=
nthly, or yearly service increments.

i) Requests to modify on a firm basis must be within the time interval of o=
riginal reservation (the REDIRECT cannot start before the original start da=
te or end after the original end date).

j) Upon acceptance of a REDIRECT request, the customer loses their rights t=
o the redirected interval of the original request and Entergy will release =
the original reserved capacity back to the market. If the customer wishes t=
o revert back to the original path they must submit another REDIRECT subjec=
t to the same guidelines as all other new REDIRECT requests.

k) When applicable, rollover rights will be given on the original reservati=
on only.
