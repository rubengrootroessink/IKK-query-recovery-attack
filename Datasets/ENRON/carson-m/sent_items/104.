DON'T FORGET THE HAPPY HOUR!
 
The last Happy Hour of the KSU Alumni Club for the 2001 season  will be this Thursday, August 30, from 6 to 8 pm.  The Happy group gathers  at the Champps American in Uptown Park near the Galleria.  Hope you can be  there to say goodbye to summer and hello to football season!
 
HELLO  FOOTBALL!!
 
All of us folks in Houston may not realize it, but fall is  almost here!  And what does that mean?  Football!! Football!! and More  Football!!   KSU is ranked high again this year so let's get out to  our Watch Parties to cheer the team on!  First Watch Party is on Saturday, September 8, at 5:30 pm  when KSU defeats the mighty USC team.  Where are the Watch Parties?  At the new  SRO in Northwest Mall at 290 and 610 West intersection.  It's a great new  location with wonderful tv's and sound.  If you can't go to California for  the game, this is the next best thing!  We have a great time!  New  shirts for sale!  Other surprises!  GO CATS!
 
FALL  BARBECUE
 
October 14 is the date to remember.  That is our club's  4th annual bbq and scholarship dinner.  Your invitation should be placed in  your mailbox by around September 13.  Mark it down now.  It's a fun  event and also helps us raise money for our club's scholarship given  annually.
