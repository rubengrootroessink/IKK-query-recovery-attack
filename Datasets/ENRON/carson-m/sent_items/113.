Dear Friends,
Just a note to remind you that we will be meeting on Wednesday  this week instead of Thursday. We will have our Christmas Party at Brian and  Lori Long's home in Pearland. I discovered  today that some names were on  my e-mail list and not the database list that I sent to Brian and Lori to work  from. So if you can come, and have not indicated so, please let me know.  We would love to see all of you. For those of you who can't be with us, we will  miss you. See all of you in January.Here is the invitation website: http://www.evite.com/r?iid=BUFVYXGQNZOJHNOWFBSG  It has  the address, time and directions. Hope to see you then. Lori and Brian have  worked hard on the plans. I know we will have a wonderful time in their home.  
Charles
