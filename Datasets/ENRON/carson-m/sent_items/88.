Mike,

Let me first introduce myself -- I have responsiblity for a couple of sites in Louisiana as part of the Generation Development Group.  We are trying to determine if we should continue to develop these sites (permitting and interconnection) or just sit on the land options.  Obviously there is more cost associated with the permitting and interconnection activity and we are at a critical juncture in both activities (whether to proceed or stop).  I would like to discuss at your earliest convenience.  The sites are located in Calcasieu and St. Charles Parishes.  

Please call me x.39298.  Thanks, Ron Tapscott.
