> Manhattan, KS (AP)- Tragedy has struck the sporting world yet again. 
> In a scene that has become all too familiar to sports fans, one person 
> was killed and several others were injured as the bandwagon carrying 
> thousands of life-long Kansas State Wildcat fans ran out of control when 
> all but two people jumped off. The name of the deceased has not been 
> released, 
> pending notification of his immediate family. He is believed to be a 
> former 
> Dallas 
> Cowboys/Chicago Bulls/New York Mets fan, who was attempting a leap to the 
> Oklahoma 
> bandwagon. 
> The incident seems to have been caused by a 31-24 loss to Texas A&M 
> Saturday afternoon. 
> "You hear about things like this in other towns, but I never thought it 
> would happen here" said Bruce Snead, mayor of Manhattan. 
> Preliminary police reports indicated the wagon, which was recently 
> purchased from a dealer in Tallahassee, Fla., was in poor working 
> condition and could not handle the load from the hoards of Wildcat fans 
> that had climbed aboard. 
> "We were getting concerned that this might happen after the loss to 
> Oklahoma," said Manhattan Police Chief Fitzgerald High. "We really 
> became concerned after the CU game, but there were still only a few 
> folks jumping off here and there. Then came Saturday's loss and they all 
> jumped...the horror!" 
> The incident was not without heroes. Kansas State quarterback Ell 
> Roberson, without regard for his own life, attempted to throw a rope to 
> the bandwagon's driver to help bring the vehicle under control. 
> Unfortunately, Roberson drastically under threw the driver, catching the 
> axle of the bandwagon instead, and was unable to hold on to the rope, 
> fumbling away his opportunity to aid those in need. 
> K-State's Mark Dunn attempted a similar effort, but his throw was 
> intercepted by a nearby tree, never to reach the bandwagon driver. 
> Kansas State head coach Bill Snyder could not be reached for comment.
