#1 These guys can't even trade on EOL because they don't have an EEI in place with us.  #2 ,,,all the legs of cal02 are out there.  Tell them to add them all up, and divide by 12.

Teresa, I have noticed that the Entergy Jan-Dec02 contract has not shown up
on EOL since 9/4.  Is this because no one is trading it anymore, and have
lost interest? 


Thanks,
