John, 
As we discussed... 
The following is the WEMT's wiring instructions for prepayments by Enron: 

Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Inc

Bank One, N.A.

ABA# 071000013

Account# 5527554

The wire will need to be in our bank account by 3pm the day before any power physically flows.  After you and our traders agree on all the particulars (price, quantity..), I will advise on the $ amount to you or the appropriate person that you designate.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks  Tim
