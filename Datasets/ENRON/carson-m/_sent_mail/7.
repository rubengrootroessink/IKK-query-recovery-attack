Hey what's up??!

How's the baby squirrel??  How big is he now?

My sister is going to start popping out kids here pretty soon....she is 
getting married in KC on Dec. 16.

Wow...I feel old.....

I am not having babies anytime soon.....I just got out of a 1.5year 
relationship, and am not really having too much luck with any other women, so 
I may just move to Nepal and become a monk.....

my address is:
P.O. Box 3394
Avon, CO 81620


Later,
Cody
