Subject: This weekend  

This Saturday I am having an informal gathering at my house for those of you 
that are free to attend. People should start arriving around 8:00, so stop by 
whenever you want.

Directions: We live off Memorial
Coming from 610 towards downtown stay on Memorial, go
past the Park and take a Left onto Detering. You will
go through a stop sign then you take a right on a
street called Floyd. Floyd will end directly into our
complex. Our house is in the back left. The address
is:
662 Lester
Houston Tx 77007

Thanks!
