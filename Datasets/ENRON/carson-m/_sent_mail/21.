As the chaplain said in Caddyshack, "The good Lord would never ruin the=20
greatest game of my life", and Mr. Murray, "I don't think the heavy stuff i=
s=20
coming down for quite some time yet."

Hopefully the weather-guys didn't flip the coin correctly this time=20
(weather.com says, "isolated T-storms, 81H, 66L).  Rain or shine though, th=
e=20
ribfest will go on.



RIBFEST IV

Mike Paradise produced an unparalleled performance last year managing to=20
dominate the lowest ranking of all the contestants by a considerable margin=
=20
for the second year in a row!  Additionally, the judges showed tremendous=
=20
wisdom picking the winner.  However, the nagging question remains; how good=
=20
does the perfect rib taste?  Thus, as the artist must pursue beauty, the=20
fourth annual celebration of the Baby Back Rib must take place.
=20
This event involves many of the things you need for a perfect weekend day:=
=20
eating a lot of ribs, imbibing libations, enjoying an autumn day, and=20
watching some football.  This year, the contestants will be cooking an absu=
rd=20
amount of ribs, allowing the crowd to voice their opinion on the "people's=
=20
choice" along with the official judging of the champion.  Cooking technique=
s=20
are hotly debated, and the insults are legion, but within a month, most=20
people are able to speak to each other again.
=20
If you think you=01,re going to make it please call Greg or Martha (713)=20
861-2766, we need to know how much to stock up on.  Kids are definitely=20
welcome, we are renting an inflatable moon-walk, and we'll have someone the=

Date: Saturday, Nov 4, 2000

Time:  We start the grills around 12:00, the first judging will occur aroun=
