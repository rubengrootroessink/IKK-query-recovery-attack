Hey guys ,,,, thankyou very much for the baby outfits... Heather and I both 
loved them......  We can't wait for you guys to meet him.......  We took him 
to the doctor today for his two week chk up and he weighed 9.5 lbs.  That is 
up over a pound....  he eats like a horse and is very healthy.... the next 
goal is to get him to sleep at night!

Mike and Heather
