Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy 
and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their 
daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to 
ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to 
grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew 
about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were 
cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the 
flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make 
it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what 
you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with 
tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our 
parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However, 
we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.  
Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents 
standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican 
restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have 
things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys 
are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is 
that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay 
the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends 
to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and 
grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine 
at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way 
down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey 
and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there 
will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron 
of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick 
toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or 
Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.  
Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a 
reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am 
going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going 
on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could 
get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.  
Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad 
to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please 
call me tonight at the house.

     Hi Marty,

     Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she did not plan
     to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to keep Alec.
     Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec for
     dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?  She said
     she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or
     Zooey to feel any pressure.  This is your special time and she doesn't
     want to detract from it in any way.  I feel sorry for her missing out.
     It is hard for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he
     would be fine while we are eating.  Would you please talk with Zooey
     and ask her how she feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.  Amy
     would leave right away if Alec was disturbing anyone.  If you prefer
     he doesn't come, just say so.  There will certainly be no hard
     feelings over it.

     I spoke with Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not
     going to be able to come.  Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her
     boyfriend) are planning to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the
     29th.  Dad and I are bringing Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and
     should arrive early in the afternoon on Friday.  Mike decided to fly
     and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.  There will be 9 or 11
     (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for the rehearsal
     dinner.  I know that is more that you had planned on but I will pay
     for the extra people.  Why don't you call me when you have time and we
     can talk about it.

     Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very excited about the trip.  She
     called me yesterday when she got her ticket and she said she had
     really wanted to come but didn't think she would have the chance to
     come.  I'm glad I was able to work it out.

     Grandma Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.  It seems like I
     remember you and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her
     class reunion.  I know you have a busy schedule and may not have time
     to come by, but if you do let me know when and we will plan lunch or
     whatever.  If you have time you can see the new house.  It is looking
     better every day.

     Love,

     Mom
