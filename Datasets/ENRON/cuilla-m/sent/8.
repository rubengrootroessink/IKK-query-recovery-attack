Bobby

We are very happy that you will be participating in the celebration of our 
marriage!  Attached is a copy of the reading we selected for you to read.  
Please read it over and if you have any questions you can reach me at 
713-853-5933 or Zooey at home 713-432-7163 or cell 713-516-8820.  I 
understand you won't be in town for the rehearsal so we look forward to 
seeing you before the wedding.  I am not sure when we are all meeting up but 
Zooey or I will talk to you on Saturday afternoon about the ceremony and when 
the reading will take place.  Thanks again for your help.

Martin
