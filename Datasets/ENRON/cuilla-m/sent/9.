Attatched is a copy of the reading we selected for you to read.  Thanks for 
taking part in our celebration!  If you have any questions you can reach me 
at 713-853-5933 or Zooey at home 713-432-7163 or cell 713-516-8820.  As if 
that is not enough numbers 6pm is the time the rehersal begins.  We are on a 
very tight schedule so prompt attence is appreciated.  The location is the SE 
corner of Kirby and Westheimer.  If you are coming from 59 you turn left on 
Kirby (north) and go to Westheimer and turn right (east) and it is on your 
right.  Also, the rehersal dinner is following the rehersal at Buca di Beppo 
at around 7:30.  We hope you will be able to attend.
