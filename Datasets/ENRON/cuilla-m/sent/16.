I am interested in purchasing a Huglu shotgun and would like to get a price.  
I am looking at the Model Au1 semi-automatic model.  Please email me with a 
price and approximate time til delivery (I live in Houston).  Also, please 
include information on any choices or extras available.

Thanks,

Martin Cuilla
