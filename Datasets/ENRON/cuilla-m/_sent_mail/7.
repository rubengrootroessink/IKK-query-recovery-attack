Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is 
still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already).  
Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going 
to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed 
to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other 
things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also 
I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from 
Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but 
wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  

Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me 
know.

Love

Hubby
