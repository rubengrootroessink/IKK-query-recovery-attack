I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding.  
The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 
and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation 
from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.  
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks 
like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried 
about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical 
moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.  
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get 
tropical  moisture.
