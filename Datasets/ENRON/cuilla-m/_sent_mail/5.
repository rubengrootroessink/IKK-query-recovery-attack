Cheryl, I was in your store on 9/23/00 and saw some Bernhardt furniture I am 
interested in.  It is the Paris Collection Dining Table and Chairs and the 
numbers are:

346-242  Table
346-244  Base
346-502  Air Chair (4)
346-501  Side Chair

Also I am interested in one of the two beds in the Paris Collection:

346-435  Sleigh Bed 5-0

346-527  Metal Canopy 5-0
346-457  Poster Bed 5-0
346-416  Poster Headboard 4-6 thru 5-0

On the second bed I am not sure if you need all three pieces or not so it 
would help if you could tell me what is the difference between the three 
pieces.  Finally, I am interested in an amroire and chest of draws (there are 
several depending if I go with a granite top or not):
346-144  Armoire
346-237  Right Stone Top
346-236  Right Bachelor's Chest Base
346-235  Right Bachelor'e Chest
346-042  Dressing Chest
346-044  Dressing Chest Stone Top
346-043  Dressing Chest Base

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.  If it is easier you can email 
me with the prices and then call to go over the info (instead of having to 
give 15 prices).  My work number is 713-853-5933.

Thanks,

Martin Cuilla
