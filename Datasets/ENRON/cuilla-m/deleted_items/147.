Questions on Davis' Health Linger

Entire story:

Clipped from the Aaron Lopez article:

Terrell Davis has enough trouble staying healthy without other people
creating new injuries for him.   Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee
surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday
when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg
and could be lost for the season.

``At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,'' Davis said.

Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that
his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the
scout team the past two weeks.

He was part of Denver's offense Wednesday as the Broncos (3-3) prepared for
this week's game against the New England Patriots (3-3). Davis was listed as
questionable on the weekly injury report.

``Some days he feels good, other days he feels bad,'' coach Mike Shanahan
said. ``Is he going to be back this week? Until he actually says, `Hey I'm
ready to go and I'm close to 100 percent,' it's all speculation.''

The speculation was rampant Wednesday when the CNNSI.com and the Baltimore
Sun reported that a potential trade between Denver and the Baltimore Ravens
fell through because of uncertainty about Davis' health.

Both stories, citing unidentified NFL and Ravens officials, said the Broncos
were reluctant to trade backup running back Olandis Gary because they were
worried Davis may not return this season.

The Internet report said Davis may have personally quashed the deal by
telling Shanahan he was unsure about his status for the rest of the season.
Davis denied speaking with Shanahan about the trade.

``It's difficult because my knee is sore. Can I say my knee will never be
sore again? I can't comment on things I have no control over,'' Davis said.
``As far as it being a stress fracture, at this point, no it's not. Does it
get sore at times? Yes it does, but I don't know what that means.''

Finally thought to be healthy, Davis ran for 101 yards in Denver's
season-opener but needed surgery 10 days later to remove debris from his
knee. Tests since Sept. 20 have shown Davis' legs to be structurally sound.

``We check everything out,'' Shanahan said. ``Every X-ray or MRI we've given
him has been negative, but we'll keep on looking at it, and hopefully he'll
be back some time this season. But I can't give you a time frame because I
don't know.''

In the meantime, the Broncos will continue to use Gary and Mike Anderson in
the backfield. Both have maintained that they are merely keeping Davis' spot
warm until he returns to health.

``He's really frustrated. Everyone would be,'' Gary said. ``He's got a thing
where he wants to get back on the field and show his critics and the guys
who have supported him alike that he's back, and he's 100 percent.''

We told you this morning to be leery of the "unnamed Raven sources" and that
you could expect a rebuttal / denial from Denver.   Here it is pretty much
like clockwork.   What to believe?   I believe it's a very dicey situation
here and I'd avoid it if I could.   If you can't, it's my guess (and it's
honestly a guess) that this week you'll see mostly Anderson with Gary having
an increased presence and very little Terrell Davis.

Something tells me we'll be talking about this soon...

Joe
