NEW! TAKE OFF IN AS LITTLE AS 3 HOURS & SAVE UP TO 70% OFF
</b>
<br>
<br>
This week, we have added a new feature called Last-Minute Getaways. Unlike
Internet-only specials, we give you many days to travel and more options
for less. Instead of being locked into a Saturday departure and returning
the following Monday or Tuesday, we give you many more choices. You can
depart Thursday, Friday or Saturday and return on Sunday, Monday or
Tuesday, depending on the inventory of cheap seats. Plus, to help you save
even more money, we have negotiated a special rental car rate or special
hotel rate to go with the airfare. What is great about this offer is that
you may be flying and staying at a major hotel cheaper than the lowest
published airfare alone. This is a very exciting new program for our
visitors and our Bestfares.com members. Our members can receive an
additional $30 off any of the airfare/hotel or airfare/car programs based
on two people traveling together, giving you an unbelievable travel deal.
As an added benefit, you can take off in as little as three hours. This is
a great offer if you are trying to get out of town in the next two weeks
with little notice. Be sure to review these fares if you have a
last-minute emergency, it could save you more than $1,000 over
compassionate and bereavement fares. For our Last-Minute Getaways, check
