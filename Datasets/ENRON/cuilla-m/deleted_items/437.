Finally, the Foam World Tour will be bringing all the excitement of Cancun & Ibiza to Down Town Houston! For the first time ever, Downtown will be the host to an exclusive [21 & UP] Foam party. If you have never been to a Foam party, it is definitely an experience that you will never forget! You may have seen footage from MTV or E-Entertainment TV, but to experience FOAM is like no other clubbing experience.

The FOAM used will be a dry air-based foam that is neither sticky nor harmful. We will also have towels & a coat check on hand for your convenience. Be apart of the vibe that is sweeping dancefloors from Mexico, Europe, & now to the US.
