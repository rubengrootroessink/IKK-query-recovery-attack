Warrick Dunn Likely Out - Keyshawn Johnson Better

Entire Story:

Clipped from the Buccaneers Website:

Friday's practice at One Buccaneer Place started without running back
Warrick Dunn, which means Sunday's game probably will, too.

Dunn was still in the training room when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began to
pass and run the ball late Friday morning, and though he joined the team
onfield a few minutes later, it was in sweats and running shoes.

Afterward, Head Coach Tony Dungy made it clear that he does not expect Dunn
to play against the Vikings this weekend, and the same holds true for WR
Jacquez Green (groin strain).

"Warrick did not practice and Jacquez didn't practice," said Dungy. "I would
say there be doubtful, but other than that we have a shot to have everyone
else.

"Really, Warrick and 'Quez, unless they had a miracle recovery, probably
would not play. Right now, we're saying doubtful. We haven't ruled them out,
but we're as close to that as we can be, I guess."

Friday is often the best determinant for a player's readiness for Sunday,
and neither Dunn nor Green looked close to ready for the final full-scale
practice of the week. Dungy was concerned both about their productiveness on
Sunday and their potential for further injury.

"Today they couldn't go, couldn't run," he said. "Unless they can run full
speed by Sunday, we shouldn't play them. If they're not running full speed,
it's tough to get anything done and you are more vulnerable (to injury)."

This is the Buccaneers' final season as part of the NFC Central Division,
but Dunn keeps seeing dates on his farewell tour cancelled. A foot sprain
suffered against Minnesota a month ago caused him to miss the Bucs' home
opener with Green Bay on October 7. In that contest, FB Mike Alstott carried
15 times for 77 yards, including a late-game 39-yard breakaway that scored
the winning points in a 14-10 decision. It is likely that Alstott will be
the primary ballcarrier again this Sunday against the Vikings, though
running backs Aaron Stecker and Rabih Abdullah may also get their shots.

With Dunn entering the season as the designated number one rusher for the
Bucs' new offense under coordinator Clyde Christensen, Alstott has found his
carries somewhat limited. He has averaged just over six carries per contest
so far, picking up 132 yards and one touchdown on 31 carries. He has
averaged an impressive 4.3 yards per carry.

Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who started the week as questionable but has
since been upgraded, also continued his path towards playing against the
Vikings.

"Derrick practiced today and went through," said Dungy. "He's doing fine and
should be okay by game time, I think. Keyshawn practiced and went through.
We'll see how they are tomorrow but they look like they could be able to
play."

That would mean the Bucs would still have the NFC's leading receiver in the
lineup, though his starting mate, Green, will probably sit the game out. If
he does, fifth-year wideout Reidel Anthony would take his place. Anthony has
34 career starts with the Buccaneers, two more than Green.

This pretty much sums it up.   Alstott moves up of course.   Keyshawn does
as well.
