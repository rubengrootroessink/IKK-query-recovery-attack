Yo Sweets.  Just a reminder that while you're checking out tile, you should
pick up a birthday card for your mom.  Her birthday is Monday and we will
need to get that off by Friday at the latest.  We can send her a belated
present if you haven't thought of anything by then, but we should at least
get the card to her on her birthday.  L, Mrs. C
