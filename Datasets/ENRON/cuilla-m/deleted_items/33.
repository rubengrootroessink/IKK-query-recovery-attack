Dunn (foot) was used as the Bucs' featured back on Sunday against Tennessee. He posted 81 yards of total offense and two scores in Tampa Bay's 31-28 overtime win. <BR>

Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a reserve at this point. <BR>

Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183 yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime. Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best receivers.<BR>

Jenkins will be used as Arizona's No. 3 receiver on Sunday against Chicago. However, don't be fooled by his solid performance last week against Philadelphia. Unless Jenkins shows that he can be more productive on a consistent basis, there's no need to pick him up Fantasy-wise. <BR>

Thomas had 11 carries for 58 yards in Sunday's game against Arizona. Thomas is inching closer to taking James Allen's starting job, and is worth stashing away on your roster if available. <BR>

Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.<BR>

The Jaguars have ruled Taylor out for their next game against Buffalo on October 18. Taylor is still recovering from the groin injury he suffered in Week Two. <BR>

Jackson led New Orleans with six catches for 95 yards against Minnesota on Sunday. He has become QB Aaron Brooks' favorite target and is slowly becoming a more consistent Fantasy player. He's a good option this weekend against a shaky Carolina secondary. <BR>

Brown caught seven passes for 114 yards in Oakland's win over Dallas. He continues to be one of the more consistent receivers in the league from a Fantasy perspective. <BR>

Linebacker Zach Thomas suffered a partially torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee during Sunday's loss to St. Louis. "It's just real sore," Thomas told the <I>Miami Herald</I>. "I'm going to try to play [Sunday]." His knee is very stiff right now, however, so don't be surprised if Thomas misses this weekend's AFC East contest against New England. <BR>

Elam is a fine selection to start. Kansas City might engage in a shootout with the Broncos, and both kickers (Elam and Todd Peterson) would benefit. <BR>
