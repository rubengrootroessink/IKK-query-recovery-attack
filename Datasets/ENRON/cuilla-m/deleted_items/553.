Hi Folks,

Trying to get this to you earlier as many people had asked for it sooner.

Hope you have a great and joyful Thanksgiving.

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton
Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on
Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's
lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in
your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy
Clayton Gray.  Let's get to it.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Arizona Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

We rated Plummer as a "Lock" matchup and he delivered with 334 yards and 4
TDs.   If only they could play Detroit each week...  This week, they'll face
a San Diego team that ranks just # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   WR David
Boston is unstoppable and a must start.   Frank Sanders played well too last
week but had what looked to be a pretty serious hamstring injury on the TD
reception.   Check Plummer's status as he has a bruised tailbone but I'd
feel good about him again this week.


Atlanta Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a nice outing last week
leading the Falcons to a huge upset over the Packers.   He threw for 352
yards and 2 TDs.   Terance Mathis led the way with 7 receptions.   Mathis
suffered a concussion but the early reports are that he'll be able to go.
This week, the Falcons face a soft Carolina defense that ranks # 21 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs so this is looking pretty enticing.


Chicago Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Jim Miller to Marty Booker looked more like Montana to Rice Sunday.   I
don't recall the last time I saw two consecutive bomb TDs to the same player
like that Sunday.   Miller's been up and down but clearly, Booker is a guy
to watch.   Dez White and David Terrell are in the mix but this seems to be
Booker's show.   The Viking defense ranks # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks so it looks like the Bears may be able to
continue to roll.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Favre isn't as red hot as he was but he's still a premier QB.   He threw for
262 yards and 2 TDs last week.   He spread the ball pretty well between
Billy Schroeder, Antonio Freeman and Corey Bradford.   Bradford had the big
yardage while Schroeder and Freeman scored.   All 3 are solid plays.   TE
Bubba Franks continues to be a non factor.   The Pack draw a great matchup
this week in Detroit that ranks # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   They rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so
you have to like that.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

If you'd been thinking about benching Daunte Culpepper, Randy Moss, or Cris
Carter, you got your answer Monday night.   These guys should always be in
your lineup as they're too explosive to sit against any matchup.   The Bears
rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so
clearly, this is a must start for these guys.   The only downside to the
Moss / Carter explosion was that TE Byron Chamberlain was left out of the
party.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

You don't need me to tell you to start Jeff Garcia.   He's clearly one of
the premier QBs in the game.   Terrell Owens is freaky good and is obviously
a must start.   J.J. Stokes had a breakout game last week so he deserves a
look.   Tai Streets is not a bad reach and TE Eric Johnson is getting more
involved in the offense each week.   It's sort of like St. Louis where any
of these guys are worth a gamble.   Indy ranks # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 25 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so the 49ers are
looking good here.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Baltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

Does anyone else find the Baltimore's self destruction amusing?   The Grbac
tear thing on the sidelines (which looked like sweat to me) and then Shannon
Sharpe's posturing as the self appointed spokesperson shouting about
interceptions was pretty funny.   Can Brian Billick hold it all together?
Where's Trent Dilfer when you need him?   Grbac will be fine I think.
Sharpe is always a good play if you can stand having him on your team.
Qadry Ismail and Travis Taylor are both decent options as they're seeing
plenty of action and TE Todd Heap even got a score.   Lots of weapons in
this passing game.   They'll be facing a Jaguar defense that's reeling and
beat up.   They rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks.   Jacksonville ranks # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs for
the year.   All in all, a good matchup here.


Detroit Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

A perfect example of how sometimes the NFL does NOT mirror Fantasy.
Charlie Batch is becoming a desirable QB simply because his team is so bad
and he's forced to throw on every down.   Regardless of the reason, you have
to give this guy some credit as he's clearly becoming more comfortable in
the system.   He threw an amazing 62 attempts last week for 436 yards and 3
TDs.   I'll take that.   WR Johnnie Morton led the way with 153 yards.   RB
Lamont Warren had 11 catches but his status is up in the air with the return
of James Stewart.   Green Bay is nothing special against the pass lately
ranking # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they are pretty tough on QBs though ranking # 8 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Trent Green had a week off to get everything together but you have to wonder
how much can be done in a week.   Derrick Alexander is supposedly ready to
play this week but you know how that goes.   I'd be leery until I see him
play some.   Snoop Minnis is still nursing an ankle injury and is iffy.   As
always, TE Tony Gonzalez is the primary threat.   Seattle has been below
average lately ranking # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New England Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Coach Bill Belichick raised some eyebrows when he announced Tom Brady would
be the starter until further notice.   Great news for Brady fans who'd been
sweating a Bledsoe comeback.   Brady's come back down to earth lately with a
mediocre 185 yard day last week but he's still showing promise.   WR Troy
Brown is by far the favored target and the only real receiver worthy of a
start in most leagues.   New Orleans has been very vulnerable lately to the
pass ranking # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs New England Defense

Aaron Brooks once again offers some vindication for those (including us)
who'd been sweating it after giving him lots of preseason hype.   2 passing
TDs plus another TD rushing Sunday made his owners happy.   I'd go with the
hot hand and keep him in your lineup.   Joe Horn is clearly the WR of choice
as Willie Jackson is up and down.   TE Boo Williams is not a bad reach if
you need a guy there.   He caught 2 TDs and looked good doing it.   New
England ranks # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks but be careful, as Bill Belichick seems to sometimes pull out
something special to confuse young QBs.


Oakland Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

You have to like Rich Gannon here against the Giant defense that was torched
by Minnesota last week.   Gannon threw for 311 yards and 4 TDs Sunday and
looks as in control of this offense as ever.   Jerry Rice looked half his
age running all over the field and played outstanding.   Tim Brown is as
good as ever.   This team has serious weapons and should go deep in the
playoffs, if not all the way.   The Giants rank # 15 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year they rank # 3 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Kordell Stewart once again looked like a real NFL QB.   He threw for 266
yards and a TD.   Most importantly, he didn't fold up when Jerome Bettis was
held down.   Hines Ward caught 9 passes for 112 yards and a TD and looks to
be a good play most every week as he's clearly the go to guy.   Tennessee
ranks just # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
They rank # 26 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so these
Steelers could have a chance to do something through the air here.


San Diego Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

Doug Flutie's magic trick bag seems to be fairly well empty lately.   Losing
TE Freddie Jones last week surely didn't help even though Jones wasn't being
thrown to as much as we'd like to see.   Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham
struggled with Flutie.   This Arizona defense could be the ticket though as
Charlie Batch discovered last week.   They rank # 17 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but are playing softer than that.
They rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Kurt Warner's a must start, obviously.   As are Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt.
Both are outstanding.   Bruce had the big yards Sunday while Holt got the
TD.   RB Marshall Faulk catches as many passes as the WRs, just another
reason why he's the best.   Tampa is limping but they rank # 9 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They do have 13 sacks
over the last 4 games so they're obviously putting pressure on the QB.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Carolina Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Are you really down to starting Chris Weinke?   I didn't think so.   Muhsin
Muhammad could miss this week's game with a shoulder injury.   That means
Donald Hayes would be the go to guy assuming his sore ribs allow him to go.
TE Wesley Walls is always a threat although he seems to be less of the focus
lately.   Maybe he needs to have another "Keyshawn Fit" and yell about not
getting the ball enough.   That worked pretty well for him last time.   The
Falcons rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks
but for the year, rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   They rank #
30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they're definitely toastable.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

It doesn't appear to be the best thing for the Bengals, but Jon Kitna
continues to air it out.   He threw 42 passes Sunday for 234 yards and 1 TD
/ 2 Interceptions.   The Bengals have about 25 WRs it seems and all are
pretty good.   Ron Dugans got into the act scoring a TD Sunday.   Darnay
Scott is the # 1 but it's a crowded group there making it tough to pick out
any one player.   The Brown defense ranks # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks so you'd think Cincinnati would be able to
throw the ball.    For the year, Cleveland ranks # 5 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs though so it's not like it's a cakewalk.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Tim Couch is winning the "real" NFL games even though he's not doing much
for your FF team lately.   His 144 yard / 0 TD / 3 Int game Sunday is an
example of that.   He'll get back on track though.   Kevin Johnson and
Dennis Northcutt seem to be his primary guys with Quincy Morgan there too.
Honestly, I wouldn't count on too much from anyone but Johnson.   The Bengal
defense ranks # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks so they've been tough lately.   For the year, they rank # 22 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

Peyton Manning looked solid even with the broken jaw.   Jerome Pathon is
gone for the year and Reggie Wayne's knee is an issue.   It looks like it'll
be his old reliable target, Marvin Harrison.   Keep an eye on TE Marcus
Pollard as he could easily be the best receiver after Harrison.   San
Francisco ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   You never know when
Manning will throw that monster game though so it's tough not to play him if
he's on your roster.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Donovan McNabb didn't wow anyone with his numbers Sunday but he didn't need
to in order to win the game.   He threw for 129 yards with 1 TD.   James
Thrash is still the go to guy with Todd Pinkston worth a roll of the dice in
larger leagues.   TE Chad Lewis was pretty active and caught a TD so you
like to see that.   The Redskins are starting to believe in themselves and
now rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
A dangerous game against the Redskins who have nothing to lose and can play
with abandon.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense

As a consistent Rob Johnson basher, Alex Van Pelt kept me from looking bad
by playing extremely well Sunday with 2 TDs and 316 yards.   And he actually
finished a game...   Clearly, he gives the Bills a boost.   Eric Moulds is
still the #1 WR but Peerless Price had a huge game with 138 yards and a TD.
Larry Centers was also extremely involved and TE Jay Riemersma caught a TD.
Miami is hurting without CB Sam Madison.   They rank # 6 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're still tough.


Denver Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Brian Griese just keeps losing weapons.   From Ed McCaffrey to Terrell
Davis, now Rod Smith is limited with a bad ankle.   There's only so much a
QB can do without his weapons.   Smith is saying he'll try to tough it out
and play Thursday but it's very questionable how effective he'll be if he
plays.   My friend (and Denver local) B.J. Miller says his guess is that
Smith will dress but likely not finish the game after re-aggravating the
ankle.  I'd agree with that prediction.   TE Desmond Clark needs to become a
bigger part of the passing game here.   The Cowboys are solid on defense
ranking # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and #
10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it's a tough matchup here for the
Broncos.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Kerry Collins threw for 321 yards but couldn't find the endzone Monday
night.   Ike Hilliard continues to improve and actually was more effective
than Amani Toomer.  Tiki Barber remains a strong force in the passing game
and that should continue.   All 3 of these guys are solid starters.
Oakland is very solid lately against the pass ranking # 4 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Matt Hasselbeck posted 134 yards and 1 TD Sunday.   With the way Shaun
Alexander is running, that's probably enough.   Koren Robinson and Darrel
Jackson are the primary targets but Hasselbeck is really spreading the ball
around.   Kansas City ranks # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks although for the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Brad Johnson rolled up 399 yards Sunday without throwing a TD.   That's hard
to do.   Keyshawn Johnson remains TD-less which I admit is cruelly amusing.
That'll have to break soon though as he's just catching too many passes not
to score.   I wouldn't be surprised to see him explode with a couple of
multiple TD games as the odds even out.   Johnson to Johnson is really all
there is to talk about with this passing game.   The Rams are solid ranking
# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Washington Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Tony Banks left with a concussion Sunday but Kent Graham did a fine job
filling in.   WR Michael Westbrook has shown nice maturity this season
hanging in there and now looks to be the quality WR everyone has always
expected him to be.   He had 9 receptions for 104 yards and a TD last week.
The Eagle defense can be troublesome with all their blitzing so it'll be a
challenge.   Philadelphia ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks and for the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs.   Should be a tough game.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Dallas Passing Game vs Denver Defense

Ryan Leaf did little to impress anyone Sunday with a 102  yard / 0 TD / 2
Interception game.   I can't get excited about anyone on this offense.
Joey Galloway could be worth a shot just for his home run potential but it's
pretty bleak overall.   Denver ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks and that doesn't help any.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Mark Brunell is looking very iffy again and it'll likely be Jonathon Quinn
again.   (Has there ever been a good QB named Jonathon?)   That's bad news
for the Jaguar WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell although both played
decent last week.   With Fred Taylor out again, Baltimore should have a
field day.   The Ravens rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks but for the year, rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.
I'd shy away from these guys unless I had few options.


Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

Jay Fiedler looked lost last week throwing for 188 yards, 0 TDs and 3
Interceptions.   He'll have his up and down games but he seems to be
settling back more toward the downside.   His WR corps is solid with James
McKnight, Oronde Gadsden and Chris Chambers but it's hard to put a lot of
faith in Fiedler.   I do like Chambers and his big play ability.   Buffalo
has been tough lately ranking # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   It's actually not so much an issue of them being tough as
it is teams just don't need to throw to beat them.   Regardless, offenses
haven't been putting up a lot of yards on them.   For the year, they rank #
24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

A typical Steve McNair week:   Major questions all week as to whether he'll
be healthy enough to play.   Guts it out through the game, rushing for more
yards than George, throwing for 172 yards and 1 TD.   It might win NFL games
but that probably won't carry your FF team.   Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson
are both decent players at WR while TE Frank Wycheck remains his best
receiver.   The Steelers bring a great defense though ranking # 2 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 2 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs not to mention the fact they've logged 18 sacks over
the last 4 games.   Tough matchup here.
