***********************************************************************

On October 12, 2001, CERA Chairman Daniel Yergin hosted a presentation by US 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, at which the Secretary spoke on US energy 
policy and the legislative implications of the war on terrorism.

The importance of energy security strategy has certainly been raised, and 
Secretary Abraham spoke about actions by both industry and government to adapt 
to this new environment. He also noted requests from President Bush and Senate 
Majority Leader Daschle to the US Senate to enact a new US energy strategy. 
Finally, Secretary Abraham described his agency's efforts to improve 
communication between government and industry decision makers in this period of 
bipartisanship and heightened focus on energy security.
