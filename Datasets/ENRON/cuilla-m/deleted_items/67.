SECURITY OF ENERGY SUPPLY BACK ON THE EUROPEAN POLITICAL AGENDA

The tragic events of September 11 brought a new dimension to the general 
question of security--clearly energy facilities could be targets for terrorist 
attacks. Even before the attacks, high world oil prices and the euro's 
depreciation put energy security of supply back on the European political 
agenda, together with the awareness of dependence on imports, and the risk of 
economic and even physical disruption in energy supply, including natural 
disruptions from storms or flooding.

*  Security of supply, under its different forms, has returned as a political 
concern across the European Union.

*  The new liberalized environment should, at least partly, mitigate security 
supply risks.

*  Long-term risks remain a matter of discussion, with concern that market 
mechanisms provide the right signals, such as adequate investment made at the 
right time.
