For any of you with early lineup deadlines:

ESPNews is reporting that Olandis Gary could get the starting nod at RB for
Denver.

Welcome to Shannyland...

Terrell Davis caught 5 passes last week and this could be an area where Mike
Shanahan wants to use Gary.   It's logical that both could see time until
Terrell Davis is ready.   Or I wouldn't be surprised to see Anderson get all
the carries.   Sadly, I wouldn't be surprised to see Gary get all the
carries.   It's a murky deal there right now.   Unless it clears up pretty
fast, I'd probably avoid.
