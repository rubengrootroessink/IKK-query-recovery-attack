Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter

***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to 
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker 
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a 
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels 
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery 
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be 
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market 
boosted distillate demand.
