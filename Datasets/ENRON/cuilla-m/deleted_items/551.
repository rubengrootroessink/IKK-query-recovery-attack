November 22, 2001
============================

Happy Turkey Day, or for our vegetarian friends, Happy Meatless Alternative Day.  What better way to spend the holiday than a computer, an internet connection and a couple of stories from the Houston Press.

Burnt the turkey and need some dinner plans?  Head to our dining section and search for a restaurant.  Dial them up and make a reservation.
