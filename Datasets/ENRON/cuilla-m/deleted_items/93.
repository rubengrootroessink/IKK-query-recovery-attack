Hi Folks,

You guys that got fired up after Terry Glenn's outstanding performance (I'm
one of you) last week need to keep an eye on this.

Foxboro, MA (Sports Network) - Patriots wide receiver Terry Glenn injured
his hamstring during a workout on Thursday, and may not suit up for Sunday's
game against the Colts.

Midway through the Patriots' afternoon session, Glenn came up hobbling after
making a cut on a pass route. The extent of his injury is not known.

Glenn also experienced soreness after the team's 29-26 overtime win over the
Chargers last week. Yet, he may have aggravated the injury on Thursday,
possibly resulting in a pull or tear.

The six-year Ohio State product caught seven passes for 110 yards with a
touchdown in his first game back since being suspended on August 3 for
violating the league's substance abuse policy.

This is all I know for right now.   We'll keep you posted.

Thanks to Footballguy Matt Rosenthal for pointing me to this one.

Joe
