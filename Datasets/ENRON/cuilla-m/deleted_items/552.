Aloha!

There has never been a better time to book your Hawaiian vacation!
Why?  Because you'll SAVE $150 per couple to Hawaii's Big Island!
(in addition to our already great prices!)


HAWAII'S BIG ISLAND:

The Big Island has 11 of the 13 world climatic regions, making
it the most diverse Hawaiian island and offering something for
everyone...

- visit the orchid gardens and hike through the tropical rain forest
  on the eastern side of the island

- visit historical sites and experience fantastic snorkeling on the
  western side of the island

- relax at the sunny beach resorts on the northern part of the island

- don't miss the Volcano National Park and macadamia nut farms on the
  southern end of the island

- golf at some of the most incredible courses in the world!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Big Island "must sees"

- Waipi'o Valley - once the home of kings of old Hawaii

- Rainbow Falls - one of the Big Island's loveliest waterfalls

- Black Sand Beaches - made up of pulverized lava, located on the
  south-eastern cliff

- White Sand Beaches - Hapuna State Beach Park, Anaehoomalu Beach,
  and Magic Sands Beach, Kailua

- Volcanoes National Park - the number one visitor attraction in the
  state is also home to Kilauea Volcano, the world's most active volcano
  which continues to pour into the ocean - making the Big Island even
  bigger each day!
