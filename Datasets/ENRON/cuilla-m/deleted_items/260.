Dear Martin Cuilla:

"Internet Abandonment Syndrome"-should take comfort and joy in
DIRECTV DSL?, a reliable connection offered by a reliable company.

Now you can take advantage of a special offer for the Internet
abandoned. Get your first two months of DIRECTV DSL? free when you
sign up for a year of service (after that it's just $49.99 a month). Also,
the normal activation fee will be WAIVED (a $49.99 value). And as
always, there's no need to buy our equipment, you can use it for no
additional monthly charge,? all you have to do is pay the shipping and
handling fee (only $24.99). You don't even wait for an installer to set up
your connection**-plus technical support is available 24 hours a day.
