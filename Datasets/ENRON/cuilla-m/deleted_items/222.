James Questionable for Nov 4 Game


Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1026/1269528.html

Clipped from the ESPN.com article:

INDIANAPOLIS -- Two-time NFL rushing champ Edgerrin James could miss the
Indianapolis Colts game next week at Buffalo because of a sprained left
knee.

James injured the knee with about 41/2 minutes remaining in Thursday's 35-28
victory at Kansas City. James was hurt when his foot stuck in the Arrowhead
Stadium grass as linebacker Marvcus Patton tackled him.

Colts coach Jim Mora said James had an MRI exam Friday that confirmed he had
a sprained knee -- but no structural damage.

Mora listed James as questionable, meaning there's a 50-50 chance he would
play Nov. 4 against the Bills.

"The MRI showed that it was sprained, which was basically the prognosis last
night," Mora said. "I haven't talked to him today, but (trainer) Hunter
(Smith) has, and he said Edgerrin felt pretty good."

James and other Colts players were not available Friday because Mora gave
them three days off.

James won rushing titles in each of his first two NFL seasons and, through
six games this season, is in contention for a third straight crown.

On Thursday, James carried 27 times for 102 yards. It was his fifth 100-yard
game this season and the 24th of his career, which tied the team record set
by Eric Dickerson.

Earlier this season, James tied Jim Brown as the second-fastest running back
to 3,500 yards rushing, which he achieved in 34 games. James has 3,924 yards
rushing in his career.

The knee injury, however, has put James' streak of 38 consecutive starts in
jeopardy. Indianapolis doesn't practice again until Monday, and Mora said he
"doubted" James would practice then.

"We've still got nine days before we play again," Mora said. "So we're going
to take it day by day."

If James cannot go, the Colts appear to have found a more than adequate
replacement in backup Dominic Rhodes.

Until Thursday, Rhodes, a rookie free agent from Midwestern Texas State, had
carried six times for 56 yards.

In James' absence Friday, Rhodes burst onto the scene by returning a kickoff
88 yards for one touchdown, then racing 77 yards for another touchdown on
his fourth carry.

Rhodes' run was the fourth-longest in franchise history and the longest by a
Colt since Tom Matte raced 80 yards against the St. Louis Cardinals on Oct.
12, 1964.

"I was just glad to get the opportunity," Rhodes said after the game. "I
wish it wasn't because Edgerrin got hurt. (Running backs) Coach (Gene) Huey
has been telling me to just hang in there and my time would come. I guess he
was right tonight."

Rhodes outran Chiefs defenders to the end zone on both touchdown runs and
played well enough to put Mora's mind at ease -- if James cannot play a week
from Sunday.

"I feel very good about Dominic Rhodes," Mora said. "He's done nothing but
show us he can be a good back in this league. He hits it hard and he has
good hands."

That's one reason Rhodes might continue returning kickoffs even if he
replaces James against the Bills.

Mora said he would wait to see if Terrence Wilkins could return. The wide
receiver-returner has missed the last two games with broken ribs. If neither
Wilkins nor James plays, Rhodes is likely to see double duty.

But Mora remains optimistic that James will heal during the nine-day break
between games.

"We'll take it day by day," Mora said. "We'll put him down as questionable
right now, but we're hoping he can play."

Clearly, not great news but also better than it might have been.   Dominic
Rhodes could be a great insurance pickup if he's still available.   This
will certainly be a hot topic and something we'll stay on top of for you.
