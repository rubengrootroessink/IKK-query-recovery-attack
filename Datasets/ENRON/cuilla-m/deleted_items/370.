An American Tradition
Calyx & Corolla Style

Dear Martin Cuilla, 

This year, more than ever, Thanksgiving means family, tradition,
and the celebration of this uniquely American holiday. Cherished
memories and a slice of nostalgia touch the very heart of our
festivities. For you or a loved one far away, we've assembled a
grand Thanksgiving selection sure to speak of these warm,
wonderful holiday traditions. 

Calyx & Corolla creates luxurious style with Thanksgiving-inspired
touches. Couture Cornucopia is a true tabletop tradition set to be
a focal point in the holiday home. Our enchanting moss-covered
cornucopia brims with autumn's bounty.

Nothing is cherished more than the feast upon the Thanksgiving
table. Celebrate your family meal with the added beauty of our
Harvest Centerpiece. It's an eye-catching collection of nuts,
leaves, branches and herbs designed to show from every angle.

If adding ambience to the air is your desire than you're sure to
love our Harvest Candle Ring, which symbolizes the cycle of the
year and the bounty of the fields.

The fall flower of the moment, Red Rover Mums, is the emblematic
floral choice this holiday. With their dramatic shades of rusty
red streaked with gold your guests will be impressed by this
glowing display.

Not to be outshone, our Sienna Roses are a fine consideration for
a traditional family gathering. Afterall, the rose is the National
Floral emblem of the United States of America.
