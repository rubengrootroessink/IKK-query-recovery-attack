As you may know, we're fortunate to have several Physicians "on staff"
(amazing what a T-shirt and cap will do...).   Seriously, these guys are not
just Fantasy Football Junkies, they're Physicians who deal with these types
of injuries for a living.   Every once in a while, we'll get one of our Docs
to share some insights.   Today is one of those times.

One of our readers in a dynasty league asked me today whether Marcus
Robinson's ACL / LCL injury was worse than Germane Crowell's Patella Tendon
injury.   I may not know a lot but I know when I'm over my head so this
question was immediately passed on to Footballguy.com Physician, Dr. C.J.
Coshal, MD.

Here's his reply:

Hi Joe,

Good question.    Glad to help.    First, both of these are season ending
injuries.    ACL injuries used to be career enders, but no more.

With more refined surgery and stapling techniques the ACL can be repaired.
It however is the major stabilizing ligament to the knee joint and it takes
a lot of rehab to get back the mobility and feeling comfortable so that the
repair is going to support you when you cut.    That is why most guys with
ACL injuries; come back the next year but don't do as well as the second
year after the injury.

If it had just been Marcus' LCL or MCL there was a chance he could have made
it back this season but paired with the ACL, it was a fatal blow.

Although Crowell's injury ends his season - in theory, it should have far
less implications for long term recovery.    First, to repair this you don't
even need to open the knee joint.    The repair is done by stapling the
tendon to the top of the main bone in the lower leg - the tibia.    Anytime
you can avoid opening a joint space, recovery is quicker.    Now it will
still take a lot of rehab - thousands of leg lifts without and then with
weights but once the muscle strength is regained from just nonuse - the leg
will be strong and stable.    It will be much less affected by cutting, etc.
The biggest problem for Germane is to be aggressive with strength
conditioning so it doesn't limit his jumping ability.    He's pretty tall so
even if he loses a couple of vertical leap inches it wont be that
noticeable.

So to make this short and sweet - anytime you have a choice between players
with these two injuries occurring at the same time you can bet

A) The ACL / MCL / LCL injury will take longer to recover from

B) That ACL / MCL / LCL injury has more implications for running and cutting
after the catch.

Where the art of medicine enters into this is that two different individuals
will approach their rehab differently.    Someone with a more serious injury
and a more diligent approach to their recovery can still surprise you.    My
best guess, Crowell will come back strong by early next season.    Robinson
will be slower to recover and you have to see how that affects him.    Can
he regain pre-injury form? - Yes, but probably not for 1 1/2 - 2 years.
Hope that helps.

By the way, I am not surprised at Hearst's recovery as I predicted but you
still have to admire the sheer patience and determination it must have
taken.  Sounds like good qualities for a RB.  Unfortunately for Robert
Edwards, he had the heart but there are some injuries you CANT come back
from.

I am also less than surprised at Eddie George's slow start.    I think
everyone underestimated his toe injury - it sounds like such a little thing
right?    Well, put your foot on the floor and push off - where does all the
weight go --to the base of your toes.    I think he can still have good
games but probably not till the second half of the season.
