DJ Icey
Lurking in the shadows of Florida's burgeoning dame music community is a low-key musical visionary named DJ lcey. By day he runs his Zone Records indie, when the sun sets he regularly decimates dancefloors at clubs and raves all across America courtesy, of his crafty mixing manner. For the past seven years, DJ Icey has carefully avoided the, scrutiny and excesses of the spotlight, and has focused his energies on pioneering funky breaks, an energetic hybrid which incorporates booming hip-hop beats with an uptempo house sensibility and lots of bass in-your-face. "I'm basically a shy person," says Icey, "and I prefer to express myself through my music or when I'm DJING for a packed dancefloor," 

While growing up in Florida, DJ Icey was always infatuated with music of all types. He passionately collected vinyl and loved anything with a synth hook and electro drum beat. Having few musical limitations, he fell in love with a disparate melange of groups: Scritti Polliti, Run-DMC, New Order, Cabaret Voltaire and Audio Two. Anything with just the right groove sooner or later found its way into his collection, and his tastes soon broadened to run the gamut of club music: hip-hop, acid house, Chicago house, Miami Bass and Latin freestyle. 

After getting his spinning career into full gear in Orlando, Icey went on to helm a legendary residency at the now defunct club, The Edge. Not only did he use that time to pioneer funky breaks and get his remix-production career going, he also made history by convincing the then unknown Chemical Brothers to play their first U.S. show on July 4, 1993 at The Edge. Upon the club's demise, Icey, hit the road xvit his crate of vinyl and hasn't looked back. Now regarded as the kind of funky breaks, he's won a legion of followers all across the country. And because of the eclectic nature of his sets, it's no wonder that on any given moment his dancefloor might be packed with break dancers, B-boys and househeads all losing their minds in unison. 

That leads us to DJ Icey 14-track FFRR compilation, The Funky Breaks, which shows exactly why this mixmaster is tops on everyone's list. Not only does it portray his adept mixing technique, but it also pleasantly illustrates his playlist. Icey's association with FFRR dates back to when A&R man Nell Harris played a Zone Records 12" of DJ Icey,s "Big Ditch" for FFRR kingpin Pete Tong. The duo were so taken with the track that they promptly licensed and re-released it adding "Galaxo" on the flip, later incorporating him into the Sunshine State Of Mind compilation, a well-received showcase of Florida's top dance producers. 

The unpredictability of The Funky Breaks is clearly evident with DJ Icey throwing everything from his own "Grand Canyon Suite" and"Beats-a Rockin"' to PM Dawn's "A Watcher's Point Of View" and Armand Van Helden's remix of Genaside Its' "Narra Mine." "I like to play with a lot of energy, and what you hear on The Funky Breaks is a good taste of -what I'm like when I spin," says Icey, who has also remixed the likes of Deee-Lite, Faith No More, Two Bad Mice, and A-Town Players. "There's a lot of obscure tracks, such as the Ride Conunittee featuring Roxy's 'Get Huh' which has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I guess that I don't like to play a predictable set and this mix represents that." 

DJ lcey: he's always as funky as he wants to be.
