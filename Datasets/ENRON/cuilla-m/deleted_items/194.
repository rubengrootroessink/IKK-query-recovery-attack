FYI - I rebooked the deal so that you are selling directly to Direct Energy, and I let confirms know about it.  I talked to Canada and they would like for you to write an annuity to them for the difference in price that you were selling to them and the price that they were selling to Direct Energy.  I told them that I would talk to you on Monday and get back to them.  
 
Thanks

Martin, the deal I mentioned to you this morning is #113186.  Presently we are buying from you and selling to Direct Energy Marketing Limited.  We need to step out of this deal and have you paper the trade between ENA and Direct.  If you require any information regarding this counterparty or contact information, please contact Grant Oh in our office.
 
Thanks
Laura
