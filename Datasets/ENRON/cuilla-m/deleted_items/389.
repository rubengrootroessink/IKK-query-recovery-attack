NATURAL GAS MARKET LOOKS FOR THE ARRIVAL OF WINTER

Natural gas market participants are renewing the annual tradition of seizing on 
each weather forecast for hints of the onset of winter weather. Although these 
jitters have led to higher early-November prices, the winter market looks to be 
well supplied owing to the combination of milder weather, depressed demand, 
high storage levels, and ample production. December Henry Hub prices are 
expected to average $2.70 per MMBtu.

* US gas storage inventories are estimated to leveled off at 3,107 billion 
cubic feet (Bcf) by the end of October. Without harsher weather, the year-over-
year storage surplus should swell to over 770 Bcf by end-December.

* December demand will be significantly lower than in 2000 due largely to the 
milder weather expected this year. While some industrial demand will return due 
to lower gas prices, overall demand should be 11 percent lower than last year.
