Re: US Energy Secretary -- CERA Client Briefing

I wanted to be sure you were aware that U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer
Abraham is delivering an exclusive telephone briefing to CERA's Global
Energy clients on Friday, October 12 at 11:00am eastern time on "US
Energy Policy: What's Ahead." I will be chairing this call.

This is a unique opportunity for you to hear directly the Secretary's
