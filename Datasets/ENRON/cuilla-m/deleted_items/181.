Hi Folks,

Here's the latest on the Raven Running Back situation.

Brookins Looking Like the Starter

Entire story:   http://www.sunspot.net/sports/football/bal-sp.ravensnotes

Clipped from the Paul McMullen and Jamison Hensley article:

After he was released by the Ravens and Oakland Raiders last year, Jason
Brookins hooked up with the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad.
Brookins could get his first NFL start against those same Jaguars on Sunday
at PSINet Stadium.

The NFL landscape keeps shifting for Brookins, the 25-year-old running back
who was just trying to win a permanent spot on the Ravens' roster when
training camp began. A season-ending knee injury to Jamal Lewis put Brookins
in the game plan, and a less serious malady affecting Terry Allen had coach
Brian Billick and the 6-foot-2, 225-pound player talking yesterday as if he
would be Sunday's starter.

Allen is listed as questionable on the injury report because of the sprained
ankle that knocked him out of Sunday's loss to the Browns. A second-half
terror in impressive wins over Denver and Tennessee, Brookins went down as
meekly as the rest of the Ravens in Cleveland, where his five carries after
halftime netted 6 yards.

"This is a different role for him," Billick said. "He's going to have to
hold up the whole game. That's something you think more about. He'll be a
little hyped up. I'll have to calm him down a little bit, but stamina is
something you're more concerned about."

After seeing little first-half action in the first four games, Brookins
averaged 5.7 yards a carry in the second halves against the Broncos and
Titans. After Allen went down early in Cleveland, Brookins entered and had
eight rushes for 40 yards by halftime, and he scoffed at the suggestion that
fatigue played a part in his late dropoff.

"It wasn't so much that I was tired, Cleveland's defense just buckled down
in the second half," said Brookins, who was taken off the injury report
because his shoulder injury responded to treatment. "We had to start passing
the ball, and if I could have gotten the ball more, maybe we would have had
more rushing yards."

We've been hyping Brookins for a while but he'd never been able to move
Terry Allen out of the way.   Here's his chance.   Clearly, back off of
Allen and if you're ready to roll the dice a bit, take a shot on Brookins.
