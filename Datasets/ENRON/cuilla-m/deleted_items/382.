Add tight end Freddie Jones to the list of Chargers who won't play Sunday at
Oakland.

Jones traveled to Columbia, S.C., yesterday to get a second opinion on an
injured ankle that has limited him to one practice in the past three weeks.
Although the results of the MRI exam won't be determined until today, a
source close to the situation said Dr. Evan Ekman of Southern Orthopedic
Sports Medicine has advised Jones against playing against the Raiders.

The timing couldn't be worse for the Chargers, who have lost two in a row
and four of six to fall to 5-4. They already will be without strong safety
Rodney Harrison, special teams standout Carlos Polk and nickel cornerback
Alex Molden because of injuries, and losing Jones will restrict offensive
coordindator Norv Turner's ability to run two-tight end formations.

The Chargers have just two other tight ends on the roster, and neither
presents the threat Jones does. Steve Heiden has just four receptions this
season and 10 in his career, and Josh Whitman is a receptionless rookie who
was promoted off the practice squad last month, after being waived by
Buffalo.

Jones was voted the team's offensive MVP last season after he led the club
with a career-high 71 catches and tied for the team lead with five touchdown
receptions. He was supposed to build on that this season under Turner, but a
bad ankle sprain suffered Oct. 21 against Denver changed that.

Through nine games, Jones has just 19 catches -- 17 fewer than team leader
Curtis Conway and just three more than rookie running back LaDainian
Tomlinson. Jones has participated in only one practice since sustaining the
injury, but the Chargers kept him in the lineup by providing pain-killing
shots to the ankle on Sunday.

Jones, who could not be reached for comment, has not missed a game since his
rookie year in 1997. He had started 53 straight games before the Chargers
opened with a tight end-less formation against Denver on Oct. 21.

But spread formations were not the reason Jones didn't start in two of the
past three games; the ankle was. Last week in particular, the Chargers tried
to limit him to two-tight end sets and occasional spread formations. The
hope was that they could limit the wear and tear on him while still getting
the big play, such as two weeks ago when Jones caught a fourth-quarter
touchdown pass against the Chiefs. His three scoring receptions are tied for
the team lead with Conway.

But it has gotten to the point that Jones' condition was worsening instead
of improving. Some close to him fear the injury could become chronic and
arthritic if Jones doesn't treat it properly now. Which means rest and
rehab -- especially on Sunday.

General manager John Butler said late yesterday afternoon that he had yet to
receive word on Jones' status.

"Anytime someone wants a second opinion, he's sure welcome to it," Butler
said. "What else can you do? I don't know what the second opinion is going
to show. Our doctors have done their work.

"You're always concerned when somebody's not feeling their best, so we'll
see if there's something detected that our people didn't see."

Clearly bad news for Jones and also for Doug Flutie.   San Diego isn't a
real high profile team so it's not talked about a lot but Jones is a guy
they'd love to be the primary focus.   When healthy, he's that good.   You'd
have to think Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham will see a little more action
although Jones hasn't been much of a factor lately already.   Few people
think Steve Heiden is the answer there.   You may be able to grab an
available TE in your league if some owners have slacked off.   San
Francisco's Eric Johnson is a guy we've liked for a while that's starting to
emerge and might be around in smaller leagues.

Thanks to Footballguy Scott Hensell for pointing me to this one.
