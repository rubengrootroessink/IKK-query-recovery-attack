Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia
may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt
Warner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up
against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box
when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Joe

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Arizona Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Jake Plummer came up small last week with just 144 yards against a hot
Dallas pass Defense.   Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just
26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's
nothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Tim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was
the 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and
Garcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual,
was his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved
in the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have
been awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again,
some people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm
not saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for
where we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here
against the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.


Miami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Jay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,
Footballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with
124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok
this week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The
Falcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

Vinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs
(with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary
WR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced
another TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Kurt Warner had an "off" day for him with "just" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of
course, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads
the ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but
I'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.
Keep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts
rank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Marty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you
realize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker
the # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about
Anthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of
these guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Brett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.
He's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder
are solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was
earlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Manning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions
last week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's
still one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching
nearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled
over them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game

It's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but
that's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as
along with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing
units in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week,
they'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Brad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207
yards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of
him, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the
name of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Carolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

Weinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams
were ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last
week.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as
Muhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The
Cardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Denver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Brian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the
year so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver
of note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and
he's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has
struggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Brunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy
Smith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just
about any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

Trent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2
Interceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander
did very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as
his owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.
The Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Stay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.
The Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for
Moss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target.
Although it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter
because it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough
to sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are
rarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

The Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for
Staley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and
Freddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too
effective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick
a WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big.
They rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Kordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs
last week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly
so.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any
team.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are
tougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Doug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175
yards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting
Drew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we
would've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's
probably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs,
Curtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action
as well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

Matt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll
start now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and
Darrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved
in the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Tony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago.
Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes
thrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6
passes thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got
a cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Buffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Van Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual,
Eric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the
Bills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Dallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

I can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on
the roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do
much of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey
Galloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite
risks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Rookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a
rookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very
green.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw
more balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's
not unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could
continue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Few people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last
week but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints
tried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks
owners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie
Jackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again,
Boo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank
# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Kerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for
338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with
Joe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have
cooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can
cause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Steve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He
managed 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the
primary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying
something.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #
10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Atlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense

Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last
week throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis,
Tony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games.
As you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll
face a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Baltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Elvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181
yards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the
preferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an
impact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

You pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153
yards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a
sideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched
for fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this
week.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.
Pittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Garcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)
but he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many
weapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai
Streets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in
the passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Tough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless
you're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see
these guys ranked.
