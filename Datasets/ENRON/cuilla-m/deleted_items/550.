Clipped from the John Mullin article:

The Bears are preparing to play one of the NFL's poorest defenses against
the run but may face that defense without their No. 1 running back.

Rookie tailback Anthony Thomas is questionable with a strained hamstring
that has bothered him for the last couple of weeks, got a little worse in
the win over Tampa Bay and could eventually cause coaches to hold him out of
a game to let it heal.

Thomas did not practice Wednesday and his status for Sunday night's game at
Minnesota will not be determined until closer to game time.

"I can't say when I really did it," Thomas said. "It just bothered me a
little more at the end and halftime when you rest on it awhile."

Injuries are part of every week's preparations and players become accustomed
to playing with pain and injury. But with a playoff berth possible, the
Bears may bench Thomas to let the hamstring get closer to full strength.

"We could get there," said coach Dick Jauron. "You definitely don't want to
do that, but any player that's out there that has an injury that causes them
to not only be not as effective as they can be but also risks further
injury, you don't want to expose him to that. We'll just have to monitor
that really closely."

Just passing along.   Realize the Bears are thinking now much further past
just this game.   Dick Jauron knows Anthony Thomas will be a big part of
their playoff success and he may be thinking conservatively here.
