Nevada Legalizes Internet Gambling - Maybe
Many Nevada casinos have decided that Internet gaming is not just going
to go away. As with Indian gaming, they have abandoned years of wishful
thinking, arguing for prohibition, and have finally adopted the position
that the industry should be regulated. So, in June 2001 they persuaded
the Nevada Legislature and Gov. Kenny Guinn to enact a law legalizing
online casinos.

I have seen in some casinos the dice game called Sic Bo. I have never

you give me a brief rundown on the game, and is it worth playing?
