Excitement is understandable. Just watch the drool.

The latest Sony Cyber-shot(r) Digital Cameras are creating quite a stir. It's no wonder considering they feature resolutions up to 5.2 Mega Pixels, more features, and weigh as little as 8 ounces. Who wouldn't be excited about that? It's the excessive drooling that we don't understand. 

Head over to ImageStationSM right now, where you'll find your new Sony Cyber-shot camera with all the accessories, in-stock and ready to ship.
