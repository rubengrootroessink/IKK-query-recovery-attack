We keep finding ways to make worldwide travel cheap (or should we say
"super cheap"). We now have over 200 cities coast-to-coast for $44-$118
roundtrip and hundreds more for $162 roundtrip or less with free stopovers
in Las Vegas or Phoenix. We have Europe on sale from $192 roundtrip. We
have cheap airfares to Asia and Canada. Mexico is on sale from the West
Coast for as low as $132 roundtrip through December 13, 2001. We even have
Hawaii on sale for Christmas and New Year's at up to $600 off. To have
Hawaii on sale up to $600 off is unheard of for the holiday season. Check

Have you ever had the urge to just take off at the last minute? If you
call the airlines, they want you to refinance your home for the cost of

you can't return on Sunday? Have you ever had a family emergency and the
airlines want $2,000 for you to fly? If these kinds of offers have just
turned you off, let us turn you back on to our new Bestfares.com
Last-Minute Weekend Deals. Now you can plan up to two weeks in advance or
leave in only three hours. You can depart on any Thursday, Friday or
Saturday and return on the following Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. Savings
can be up to 70 percent off. Check out our new section and you can book
these goodies online. For example, this week from Dallas there are 335

Angeles, 276 deals; from New York City, 327 deals; from San Diego, 258
