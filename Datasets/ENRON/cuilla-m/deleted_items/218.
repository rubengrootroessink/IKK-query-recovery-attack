Hi Folks,

Breaking News for you and wanted to let you know:   Bob Berger and Bruce
Murray just reported on Sporting News Radio that Carolina RB Tshimanga
Biakabutuka is out 8 weeks with a broken foot.

Not naming a RB yet and it's pretty muddled there.   Richard Huntley and
Nick Goings had been running earlier this year but today, Brad Hoover was
the other RB to share time with Biakabutuka.   None of these guys get's
anyone too excited.

More as we hear it.

Joe
