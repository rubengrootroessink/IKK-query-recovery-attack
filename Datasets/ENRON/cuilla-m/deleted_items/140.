----------------------=20

Planes, trains, and/or automobiles One way or another John Acquaviva is alw=
ays on the go and off to the next club or party. Despite having DJ?ed full =
time since 1980, appearing at over 600 international clubs and events, havi=
ng played for about half a million people, he is still as busy as ever and =
in demand like never before. Certainly one of the most eclectic DJ's around=
 at the club and festival level, John is well known for his vast record col=
lection of over 40,000 pieces of vinyl. Spanning a rather significant perio=
d of club music and 12" culture, sometimes even still "dropping" a classic =
or old track along with the new. He is one of the very few DJ's who can enh=
ance a room as well as appeal to a number of different crowds on different =
levels which explains his high demand. John began his international career =
in 1989 with Richie Hawtin by founding the world renown Plus 8 Records. Joh=
n and Richie not only launched their own careers but also those of Dan Bell=
 as the trio Cybersonik, Kenny Larkin, and Speedy J to mention just a few o=
f the artists. They have also founded Defintive records to feature house mu=
sic and artists launching the likes of Robotman, Barada, Omegaman and other=
s. Although noted mostly for his DJ?ing, John was actively involved as engi=
neer, producer and artist in the formative years and has compiled and exten=
sive and impressive discography. The last few years has seen a number of ch=
anges to the club and party scene. Evolving as ever, the international scen=
e has settled down with DJ's taking on club residencies. John was at the fo=
refront of this trend and over the last two years, not only has he played i=
n every inhabited continent excluding Africa, but you can also find him mon=
thly at Florida 135 in Barcelona Spain and the Twilo club in New York. Citi=
es that regularly appear on john?s itinerary every two to three months are:=
 San Francisco USA (Nikita and Spundaes ), Montreal Canada (Sona ), Essen G=
ermany (Tanzhaus-ex Rote Liebe ), Dusseldorf Germany (Unique ). With this r=
egular performance base, the rest of the time is spent trying to fill reque=
sts from clubs primarily from Europe and now in North America as well as al=
l over the world. John has had a quiet but still excellent history for prod=
uction work. The most notable release of late is a DJ mix CD. "From Saturda=
y to Sunday mix" is his best mix CD to date and was done with the cooperati=
on of John's Spanish club where he is resident: Florida 135. It captures Jo=
hn over two sessions and is the best example of his mixing and DJ sound to =
