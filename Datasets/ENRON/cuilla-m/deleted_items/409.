Quick note for you Pittman owners I may have worried with my comment about
Thomas Jones scoring the Goalline TD.

I'd forgotten my buddy Jim from Arizona had told me this:   Michael Pittman
wears contact lenses and had a problem with one of his contacts at the
goalline so Jones came in.   If Pittman had not had the problem, he would
have likely gotten the score that Jones did.  (Hope none of you Pittman
owners lost by a TD last week...)

Thanks Jim for keeping me straight.

Actually, I'm using that goof as a chance for David and I, along with the
Footballguys.com staff, to wish you a very Happy Thanksgiving.   It's a
always a time for reflecting on the things we're thankful for and I know
I've got more than I can count.   Hope you do too.   Have a great day and
travel safely if you're going anywhere.

And not to beat up on our Detroit faithful (and I know there are LOT of you
guys), but thought I'd share this one with you if you haven't heard it.
David sent to me this morning:

There is a mama lion, a daddy lion & a baby lion.  The mama lion & the daddy
lion were having a lot of fights so they decided to get a divorce.

The lion family goes in front of a judge to decide custody of the baby lion.
The judge asks the baby lion "Do you wanna live with mama lion?"   The baby
lion answers "No mama lion beats me."  The judge said "All right, do you
wanna live with daddy lion?"  The baby lion answers "No daddy lion beats me
worse."

The judge asks "who do you wanna live with then?"

The baby answers  "The Detroit Lions.  They don't beat anybody..."

Have a great weekend all.   Cheatsheets to follow soon.

Joe
