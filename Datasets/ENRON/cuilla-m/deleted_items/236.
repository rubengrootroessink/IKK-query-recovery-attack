Expand your business! Make it easy for your customers to
pay using Visa, Master Card, Discover, American Express,
Debit Card and Checks via Phone/Fax/Internet. How? Through
a business Merchant Account!

By providing multiple methods of acceptable payment you
automatically help ensure that it will be easier for them
to pay you and build up trust. People DON'T want to send
cash or checks via mail, because it is dangerous and gives
them absolutely no guarantees whatsoever.

So make it easier for your customers and setup a Merchant
Account for your business. There are NO setup fees, and
the monthly costs are very low. To obtain more information,
please reply to this email with your name, phone number
