ABUNDANT CONTINENTAL GAS SUPPLIES SET TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE UK FORWARD CURVE

The UK forward curve may come under pressure in first quarter 2002 as abundant 
supplies of Continental gas become available for import into the United 
Kingdom. CERA identifies four key pressures on the Continent that could make 
surplus gas available at low cost:

*  Contract prices are on the slide.

*  Contract volumes are running ahead of demand.

*  Storage levels are high.

*  LNG cargoes are returning.
