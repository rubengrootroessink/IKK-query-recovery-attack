From CBS Sportsline:   Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a
broken foot. Moe Williams will probably become Baltimore's No. 1 RB now, and
the Ravens may add another RB to their roster in the next few days.

Don't expect something goofy like a Barry Sanders or Robert Smith to come to
the rescue.   I'd expect to see Moe Williams and FB Obafemi Ayanbadejo
should have an increased role.   I expected good things from Williams when
Brian Billick acquired him and had been disappointed he hadn't seen much
action.   Now he has a golden opportunity.   Also remember Terry Allen will
be back from the hand injury (latest word is week 14) so don't go crazy.

Thanks to Footballguy Rich Voakes for pointing me to this one.

Joe
