Hi Folks,

Like you, I'm scrambling to try and find anything on Edgerrin James this
afternoon.

As of 4:27 EDT, the latest I have is he says he'll be fine isn't especially
worried.   I do NOT however have news on how the MRI results came back.   As
soon as I do, I'll shoot to you.   If things go as they usually do, I'll get
the new information about 2 minutes after I send you this update...  Oh
well.

Sticking with the "You'll Know What I Know" philosophy, here's what I have
for now:

Clipped from the Phillip B. Wilson article:

James Assures Everyone He'll Be Ready for Next Game

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Peyton Manning had the same sinking feeling a week ago,
staring in disbelief as one of the Indianapolis Colts' famed "Triplets" went
down and stayed down with a leg injury.

"I don't like it at all," the Colts quarterback said. "There's no
replacement for Edgerrin James."

The durable James had his left knee bent awkwardly by Kansas City linebacker
Marvcus Patton with 4:26 remaining and the Colts clinging to a 28-21 lead
over the inspired Chiefs on Thursday night at Arrowhead Stadium.

A grimacing James looked up and eventually caught the eye of Pro Bowl
teammate Marvin Harrison, the Triplet who gave his teammates a scare when
his leg buckled in the third quarter last week.

"I told him I'd be back," James said.

James didn't make it back for the Colts' 35-28 triumph, but that wasn't his
decision. He said he wanted to go back into the game.

The NFL's two-time reigning rushing champion is expected to have an MRI exam
today, just to be safe, but he isn't worried about being ready for the next
game, Nov. 4 at Buffalo. He joked with teammates after his shower and didn't
even have ice on his knee.

"I'm going to be all right," he said with a smile.

"Something wasn't right, I felt some pain and knew something wasn't right.
Then the pain started to go away, so I knew it couldn't be too bad."

James caught everyone by surprise. The Pro Bowl runner has been as rugged as
he's been consistent. He has 151 of the Colts' 184 rushing attempts this
season for 662 yards. As a rookie out of the University of Miami, he had 369
carries for 1,553 yards rushing. His second year, he upped both totals to
387 carries for 1,709 yards.

"I was shook up," Harrison said. "I was shook up last week when it happened
to me and Edge was more worried about me. This time, I was shook up about
him.

"You don't think that about Edgerrin. Him being down awhile was scary."

Manning, one of the last to enter the Colts' triumphant locker room, stopped
at James' locker and tapped his tailback on the shoulder.

"How is it?" the quarterback asked.

"I'll be all right," James said, for seemingly the hundredth time.

Despite missing the final minutes, James finished with 102 yards rushing on
27 carries. That gives him 24 100-yard rushing games in his 38-game NFL
career, tying Eric Dickerson for the most in Colts history.

Colts coach Jim Mora also didn't seem worried that James' injury might be as
severe as it looked on slow-motion television replays.

"I don't think it's serious," Mora said. "They were in there examining a bit
ago. I think he'll be OK. I can't give any prognosis about next week. We do
have a little longer time to recover and hopefully he'll be ready."

On the first play of the final quarter, James broke free on third-and-one
and ran 20 yards to the Chiefs' 33. It set up Mike Vanderjagt's 42-yard
field goal to give the Colts a 20-14 lead with 13 minutes remaining.

On the Colts' next offensive series, Manning audibled at the line of
scrimmage and hit Harrison for a 47-yard touchdown pass. James added two
points, catching a Manning pass in the flat and running to the left corner
of the end zone to give the Colts a 28-14 lead with 8:21 left.

I'm still wanting to hear official word.   Knee injuries are weird.   The
first time Jamal Anderson wrecked his knee in college, he stayed in the game
a good while after the injury.   Just because James says it doesn't feel too
bad, doesn't have him out of the woods yet.   Stay tuned.   If you can grab
Dominic Rhodes with little cost, it might not be a bad idea.   If nothing
else, it'll be fun for taunting the James owner in your league.

If you hear anything on James, shoot me an email at bryant@footballguys.com
and I'll spread the word the rest of the guys.
