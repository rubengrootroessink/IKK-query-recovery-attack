<b><font size = 3>
America, you're only one click away from the lowest airfares on the
planet.
</font></b>
<br>
<br>
Quickfare Finder, combining 20 years of expertise and designed for
consumers--not airlines--is here! We invite you to be among the first to
check it out. If you want to find the lowest possible fare between two
cities, spend some time Beta testing Quickfare Finder and let us know what
you think.
<br>
<br>
For the next few days, we're inviting a very select number of travelers to
"kick the tires" on this new and exciting system. Your e-mail address was
chosen at random from out Hot Deals by E-Mail list. We hope you take the
time to experience this new way to find the lowest possible airfares. No
other site on the Web offers you more options to save travel dollars.
<br>
<br>
Please note that we have a large team of programmers making cosmetic, and
other necessary changes, throughout the weekend. We ask your patience and
understanding as we tweak the system.
