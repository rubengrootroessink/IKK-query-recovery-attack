        I hope you didn't tell Star that we cancelled the purchase though -
because if so, seems like we lose our bargainng leverage to get them to come
down off the floor price.  Then again, at some point I guess I should stop
worrying about trying to save the moolah and just be happy about having the
pretty furniture in our home.  Still, sure would be nice if you could work
your trading magic to get us some kind of discount off the floor price.
Whatcha wanna do on the choice of bed situation?  L, The Wif

I sent an email to the prez of Star about the furniture and cancelled our
purchase from Furniture USA.  The said we should get a cedit on our credit
card in 5 days.  Hopefully I will hear from him soon and we will have
spankin' new furniture!
