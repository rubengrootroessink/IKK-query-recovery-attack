Spookeasy

Whispered rumors tell of a small group of friends who set out to throw a
party the likes of which had never been seen before.

Nearly a year later, that party has become part myth and part legend, and 
to
this day, no one is quite sure how it ended. All we know for sure is that
when the smoke had cleared and the dust had settled, the friends had
vanished, never to be heard from again...

...until now.





They?re Baaaaaack!

The crew who brought you Speakeasy 2001 is back with a nightmarish 
creation
of light, sound, exposed skin and alcohol, the hellborn result of a lust 
for
everything in excess.

Spookeasy.

Join us and experience the macabre music of The Southern Backtones, 
devilish
dance sounds, gorge on fiendish foods and of course, enough booze to float 
a
thousand corpses.

Enjoy $1 draft beer and drink specials all night long. The 1st drink is 
free
for those in costume, while it lasts. Celebrity judges will award cash 
and
prizes for best costume, scariest costume and sexiest costume.


Spookeasy 2001is located at The B.U.S., 1800 Texas Avenue, across from 
the
clock tower at Enron Field. 713-222-2287

Saturday, October 27
9pm - 2am
$10 cover.

Be there, or live to regret it... maybe.

Spookeasy 2001 is brought to you by Dylan Moore, Laurette Veres, Lawson
?Willie? Massey, Mandy Nicholson, Myke Toman and Jeff Hagedorn.

Leave for Vegas early (make sure not to have any box cutters in your 
luggage). Arrive in the ultimate party city knowing that NO ONE in the 
entire town will party like we are about to. 

Event I: Ultimate Fighting Championship 34


What: The largest, worldwide, Pay-Per-View event outside of boxing. Blood, 
sweat, teeth, and adrenaline. It's a battle of modern day gladiator's in a 
cage.
Where: MGM Grand Arena (12,000 expected; based on last 4 shows that sold 
out). Celebrities: Carmen Electra (spokesperson; formerly of Baywatch), 
Victoria Silvestedt (Playboy Centerfold), Dennis Rodman, Mike Tyson, Limp 
Bizkit, Dave Navarro (Red Hot Chili Peppers), and too many to mention.
OUR STATUS: Secured VIP. All access Press Passes: ability to interview and 
take photos with the celebrities and fighters, unlimited food and drinks, 
promotional items such as t-shirts, hats, etc. Also, we can get possible 
footage and camera time on this worldwide Pay-Per-View event. The 
after-party will be full of sexy babes and national print (Rolling Stone 
Magazine) and video media (MTV) like us. 

Saturday, November 3rd

Try to wake up after the wildest night of our lives partying with 
celebrities. We have the option of going to the pre-party/press conference 
for tonight or we can party at the casinos until the show. 

Event II: John Huntington and John Lewis present WFA 


Time: 7:00 pm (Pacific Time)-??? (There will be an outrageous 
after-party)


What: John Huntington is the most successful party/event promoter. He has 
conceptualized the biggest theme parties such as the Pimp an' Hoe Ball 
(sells out 10,000 tickets in 2 weeks), and personal parties for celebrities 
such as Madonna, Guns and Roses, and Ben Affleck, among many others. 
Everything he touches turns to gold.
Where: Hard Rock Hotel and Casino
Celebrities: John Huntington and Damian Saunders always attract 
celebrities and commonly have Tommy Lee, Pam Anderson, Ben Affleck, Charlie 
Sheen, and others host their parties. Wait and see.
OUR STATUS: Secured VIP. All access Press Passes and VIP introductions by 
the host himself to the wildest, most beautiful women in Vegas. We will be 
picked up BY JOHN HUNTINGTON and JOHN LEWIS in THEIR stretch limousine!!! 
Whatever happens in the limo will be our secret. Arrive at the event and 
flirt with the ring girls, sexual performers, or the hundreds of babes in 
attendance who want us to take their pictures. At the end of the event, we 
will party like there's no tomorrow at the VIP after-party. Whatever 
happens next will be something to write Playboy about. 


Sunday, November 4th

Speaking of Playboy, we are about to find out how Hollywood celebrities 
and Rock star's party! Hugh Hefner's 30 sexiest playmates will party with 
us for this unbelievable VIP party. 

Event III: The PLAYBOY Open Golf Scramble


Time: Early afternoon to evening (complete schedule coming soon)
What: Who can party harder than Playboy? Early morning/afternoon, we'll be 
drinking bellini's and mimosa's while watching Pro golfers battle for the 
finals. ESPN, Sport's Illustrated, and many other media crews' will be 
filming the action. We're talking about having golf cart races with Limp 
Bizkit, Incubus, and Playboy Bunnies on the Golf Course. Drinking the best, 
frozen margaritas and eating continental cuisine by the pool with Playboy 
Bunnies, Hawaiian Tropic chicks, and surprise celebrities and rock star's. 
We can all become Hugh Hefner for a few days while our photographer snaps 
our pictures with over 30 centerfolds. At night, we'll be drinking, 
laughing, and dancing ourselves into a bliss! You won't remember what 
happened the next morning but you'll be happy!


Where: Playboy TAKES OVER Caesar's Palace Hotel- we'll own the place! 
Strict security will keep the paparazzi and the riff-raff out.
Celebrities: Playboy won't release this information until the day of the 
event but rumors are Vin Diesal (Fast and Furious, Pitch Black, Saving 
Private Ryan movies), a few famous faces, and of course?us! E! 
Entertainment, Maxim, and Playboy magazine will be there as well. 
OUR STATUS: If you walk in with Sean Star, the red carpet to fame will 
always be unrolled for you! ALWAYS VIP with Playboy, since I cover 
(journalistically) all their parties worldwide. Everything has been taken 
care of for our all access Press Passes. You will be treated no different 
than Bill Gates or Ricky Martin!

CONSIDER THIS: I'm bringing one of Houston's best photographers to follow 
us around and shoot pictures of the event and all of us with celebrities, 
BABES, and anything cool. You will ALL get copies of the digital and print 
pictures. You will also likely be published in many magazines and websites 
we contribute the content to. I will also make each of us a commemorative 
photo album/binder for us all to remember this incredible experience.
