Bills To Cut Arians: Coach Williams said in his Monday press conference that
the Bills will make a move at kicker by the end of today and announce who
will be picked up tomorrow. The missed extra point was the last straw for
Jake Arians who struggled mightily as a rookie kicker in the NFL.

This wasn't hard to see coming after yesterday.   Poor Bills can't catch a
break.   Probably not a big deal for most of you, but didn't want any of you
Arians owners to get stuck on this short week if he was your guy.

Thanks to Footballguy Mike Webb for pointing me to this one.
