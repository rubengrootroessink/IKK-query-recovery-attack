Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton
Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on
Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's
lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in
your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy
Clayton Gray.  The Target and Redzone Data is from our Footballguy Andy
Hicks.
Let's get to it.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Arizona Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

If you're going to roll the dice on Jake Plummer, this is the week against
the Lions who rank # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   The Lions rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   WR David Boston is a bonafide All Pro and
is worthy of starting in any league, even with Plummer.


Denver Passing Game vs Washington Defense

QB Brian Griese gets healthy and now finds himself with no WRs to throw to.
Eddie Kennison suffered a brain cramp last week and retired / unretired /
was cut.   He didn't contribute much anyways but with Rod Smith hobbled with
an ankle injury, the Broncos are dangerously thin.   Smith says he'll play
though.   TE Desmond Clark and Dwayne Carswell could see more action.   The
Redskin defense is awful ranking # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks so you have to like the matchup.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Peyton Manning looks like he'll be ready to go, broken jaw and all.
They'll need him as Edgerrin James looks to be done for the year.   I'd
expect you'll see Manning lean heavily on Marvin Harrison to carry the load.
Jerome Pathon re-aggravated his foot and may not even play this week.
Reggie Wayne and Terrence Wilkins will be the other WRs.   New Orleans ranks
# 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're
very beatable.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

QB Aaron Brooks finally played like we all were expecting last week.   With
347 yards and 2 TDs (plus another sure TD dropped by Ricky Williams), let's
hope this is what Brooks needed to get going.   WRs Joe Horn and Willie
Jackson looked great and should continue to roll.   Indianapolis ranks # 28
in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they shouldn't
present too much of a problem.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

QB Kerry Collins will likely be thinking of last year's NFC Championship
game where he toasted the Vikings.   It could happen again as the Giants are
rolling while Minnesota is struggling.   WRs Amani Toomer, Ike Hilliard and
Joe Jurevicius will see action.   The Giants are a run first team but that
opens the pass as teams focus on stopping Ron Dayne and Tiki Barber.   The
Vikings rank # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

QB Jeff Garcia and WR Terrell Owens are no brainer starts against the AFC
Pro Bowl Team so I think they'll probably warrant starts against the Panther
defense that ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   WR Tai Streets is worth a gamble as is our favorite Yale grad, TE
Eric Johnson.   Greg Clark hasn't been healthy in years it seems.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Baltimore Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Elvis Grbac looks to be taking a step backwards as he looked uncomfortable
in the pocket last week.   Look for the Ravens to run the ball to take
pressure off the passing game.   This is a good matchup for Baltimore as the
Browns rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
Qadry Ismail was the big WR last week with 129 yards and a TD.   Brandon
Stokely is in the WR mix as well as the up and down Travis Taylor.   TE
Shannon Sharpe is always a threat.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

The strength of this team is Corey Dillon and running the ball.   Kitna
threw 48 passes last week and that won't continue.   With T.J.
Houshmandzadeh becoming a factor, the Bengals are getting back to the 3 WR
sets that were effective before Chad Johnson was injured.   That's a big
plus.   The Titans rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.   For the year, Tennessee ranks
# 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Detroit Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

Charlie Batch is throwing the ball a lot and that's just fine for his
owners.   The problem is he doesn't have many guys who can catch it.
Lamont Warren and Corey Schlesinger caught more passes than WR Johnnie
Morton last week.   That needs to change.   The Cardinals rank # 11 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but they're not that
good.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Favre's playing as well as ever.   Start him.  I'd start both Antonio
Freeman and Billy Schroeder as well.   Having Schroeder back clearly is a
big plus for Favre.   TE Bubba Franks is always worth a shot as well.   The
Falcons rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks
so they're no pushover.   Although that's an improvement from where the
Falcons have been.   For the year, they still rank # 30 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   I'd feel good
about all the Packers here.


Oakland Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

Rich Gannon put together another solid game throwing for 257 yards and 2
TDs.   With guys like Tim Brown and Jerry Rice to throw to, that doesn't
hurt your chances.   He'll be facing a Charger Defense that's struggled a
bit and now ranks # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   Safety Rodney Harrison will likely miss this week and that hurts.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

This team is about Jerome Bettis and running the football but part of
Bettis' success has to be attributed to the revival of the passing game.
Stewart offers enough of a threat that defenses must honor the pass.   Hines
Ward is productive but he's about the only player from the passing game I
can see starting in your league.   It is enticing this week though as the
Jaguars rank just # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.


St. Louis Passing Game vs New England Defense

QB Kurt Warner's thumb responded well to treatment this week and looks good
to go.   That's bad news for Patriot fans.   The New England Defense ranks #
19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Isaac Bruce
and Torry Holt are must starts every week even against a giant killer team
like New England.   Marshall Faulk is back in full swing and he'll be a
major part of the passing game again.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

QB Brad Johnson is starting to feel the comfort zone it seems although he's
still dinking and dunking the ball (5.22 yards per attempt last week)   It's
basically Johnson (Brad) throwing to Johnson (Keyshawn)   The Bears are not
nearly as tough defending the pass as they are the run.   They rank # 27 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Could be a good
matchup.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Buffalo Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Alex Van Pelt takes over and that could be a spark the Bills need.   WRs
Peerless Price and Eric Moulds should be more involved.   Or on the other
hand, maybe we'll find Rob Johnson wasn't as bad as his OL made him look.
We'll see.   Van Pelt probably isn't a starting QB anywhere (his last start
was in 1997) but he might be worth a shot if you're desperate.   Seattle is
an average defense ranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   But for the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

QB Tim Couch spread the offense out to beat Baltimore earlier this year and
I'd look for them to employ a similar tactic this week.   He's steady.   WR
Kevin Johnson is clearly still his primary target.   The Ravens are tough on
the run defense but rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Tough matchup but don't
count out Couch.


Dallas Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Leaf started his Dallas career with an unremarkable 14 of 22 for 114 yard
day.   1 TD and 1 Int.   I guess it could have been worse.   He'll have
another week of practice under the belt.   The Eagles are pretty average
lately on defense ranking # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they're tough though ranking # 3 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   This
doesn't look promising for Leaf or WRs Joey Galloway / Raghib Ismail
although both are big play guys and it only takes a few seconds for them to
make your weekend.   They will have a speed advantage over the more physical
Eagle Corners.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Miami Defense

Vinnie Testeverde looks to have his exciting rookie WR, Santana Moss
available for his debut game this week.   Could be interesting as Dolphin
Cornerback Sam Madison is injured and Moss could make things interesting if
the Jets turn him loose.   Wayne Chrebet may be limited with a bad shoulder.
Laveranues Coles has been up and down.   The Dolphins rank # 14 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but clearly, will miss
Madison.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Donovan McNabb continues his outstanding play.   WR James Thrash has clearly
identified himself as the prime WR over Todd Pinkston.   Young Freddie
Mitchell is coming on strong too.   The Cowboys are pretty tough on defense
ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
Although for the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   This team may decide to keep it on
the ground though given the huge success they had running the ball last week
with Duce Staley and Correll Buckhalter.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Steve McNair sat out of Thursday's practice nursing his bad hand.   His
status for Sunday isn't clear yet.   Although he's normally a question mark
each week.   His # 1 target, TE Frank Wycheck is hobbling too with an ankle
but hopes to be ready by Sunday.   WRs Kevin Dyson and Derrick Mason are
playing well lately.   The Bengals are average ranking # 15 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   K
eep an eye on McNair's hand here.


Washington Passing Game vs Denver Defense

I'll admit to being surprised at the success Tony Banks has had but you have
to give the guy his due.   He's stretching the defenses and making good
reads.   And WRs Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner seem to play hard for
him.   They'll face a Denver Defense ranked # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   Denver held Doug Flutie in check last
week so that's some worry.   TE Stephen is still looking very iffy for
Sunday.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Atlanta Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

QB Chris Chandler was able to practice Thursday and that's great news.   The
Falcons struggled without him.   WR Shawn Jefferson led all receivers last
week - with 2 catches.   Ouch.   Hopefully, with Chandler back, Jefferson,
Terence Mathis and Tony Martin will do better.   On the flip side, Chandler
is his usual one shot away from the bench.   It won't be easy though against
a tough Packer defense that ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.


Carolina Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

Ugliness all around here.   George Seifert has to look across at those 49er
uniforms and wonder how it came to this.   QB Chris Weinke is reportedly
looking pretty good in practice but coach Seifert was reluctant to name him
the starter.   If he can't go, Matt Lytle will start.   WR Muhsin Muhammad
and TE Wesley Walls are maybe worth the gamble but their stock is certainly
slipping with the QB play.   San Francisco is ranked # 18 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.


Chicago Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Look for QB Jim Miller to keep it pretty conservative in the passing scheme.
Tampa ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
The Bears want to run Anthony Thomas and throw enough to keep the Bucs off
balance.   When they do throw, look for multiple WR sets as they work rookie
David Terrell into the mix with Marty Booker and Dez White.


Minnesota Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

With the Vikings running game in disarray, look for them to air it out
against a tough New York Defense.   QB Daunte Culpepper will have his work
cut out for him against the Giant defense ranked # 6 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Like Kerry Collins, you can bet
he'll be thinking of the NFC Championship game from a year ago where his
team fell apart.   Randy Moss and Cris Carter are starters in most leagues
just on potential alone.   TE Byron Chamberlain could be a factor as well.


New England Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

QB Drew Bledsoe proclaimed himself ready to start but Tom Brady gets the nod
again this week.   No promises for next week but it'll be hard to keep
Bledsoe's salary on the bench.   We'll see.   Brady's been solid.   WRs Troy
Brown and David Patten need to re-engage and become a bigger part of the
offense.   The Rams are tough ranking # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.


San Diego Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Is the "Flutie Magic" wearing off?   He certainly looked mortal last week.
This week, he'll be without TE Freddie Jones.   Even though Jones wasn't
being utilized much, he was still a nice outlet.   Tim Dwight is still out
with a collapsed lung so that leaves WRs Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham to
carry the load.   Both are capable.   Oakland's Charles Woodson may be
limited with a bad foot and that'll help.   The Raiders rank # # 9 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 21in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Seattle Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

Matt Hasselbeck offered a glimmer of hope last week and hopes to build on
that success.   As long as Shaun Alexander is running wild, Hasselbeck
certainly has a chance with the play action pass.   Darrell Jackson in
particular is looking better and Koren Robinson will work against a tough
set of Cornerbacks.   The Bills rank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks and have 16 sacks over the last 4 games so this
will be no cakewalk.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

Mark Brunell and crew will have their work cut out for them as they face a
much better Steeler team than they saw in week 1.   The Steelers rank # 3 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  WRs Jimmy Smith
and Keenan McCardell both scored last week and continue to put up quality
numbers.   The Steelers will throw Cornerbacks Dewayne Washington and Chad
Scott who are very solid.   Plus, the defense has recorded 23 sacks over the
last 4 weeks.   Tough matchup.


Miami Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

QB Jay Fiedler quietly put a very nice game together last week with 259
yards and 2 TDs.   His WRs are solid and our guy Chris Chambers had a
breakout game with 2 TDs.   Oronde Gadsden is quietly putting together a
nice season.   The Jets rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks though so it'll likely be tough.   They rank # 4 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs for the year and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
I'd look for the Dolphins to try and exploit their much softer run defense.
