Hi Folks,

Lots of email pouring in on these guys so I wanted to share the latest here:


Griese "Questionable" But Should Start

Entire Story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1012/1263238.html

DENVER -- After missing most of Thursday's practice with a sore throwing
shoulder, Denver Broncos quarterback Brian Griese was a full participant in
Friday's workout and was expected to start on Sunday in Seattle.

The Broncos added Griese to their injury report on Friday morning, listing
him as questionable.

An hour later, however, Griese had no obvious discomfort during a 75-minute
workout. Coach Mike Shanahan said he was confident that, barring any
setbacks, Griese will play against the Seahawks.

Griese has had surgery twice on his shoulder, after the 1999 and 2000
seasons.

Shanahan said Griese reported soreness in his shoulder after Sunday's 20-6
win over Kansas City. The injury likely occurred in the first half, since
Griese threw only five passes after intermission. For the game, he was
11-of-20 for 121 yards with one touchdown and one interception.

"It was sore after the game, but we didn't think it was anything that would
keep him from playing," Shanahan said Friday. "He couldn't practice
(Thursday). He just took a few reps and it was sore. That's why we put him
on the questionable list. I wasn't really sure where we'd be at (Friday).

"But he was able to make it through practice and he was effective. So if
there's no setback, then he'll be able to go Sunday."

If Griese had been unable to practice Friday, Shanahan said, the Broncos
would have prepared backup Gus Frerotte for a starting role.

"If you don't practice Thursday and Friday, then you don't start," Shanahan
said. "But he was able to go through the whole practice, and he practiced
well."

Scary news to see him listed but sounds like good news that he'll play.
Gotta love Shanahan making a mockery of the "Questionable" listing saying
he's confident Griese will play.   As we've been telling you since May, you
should back up your valuable skill guys in great situations with their real
backup.   It was a lot better before Ed McCaffrey's injury but Griese would
probably qualify as one of those guys in great situations.   If you (or your
arch rival) own Griese, it's a good idea that you grab Frerotte if you
haven't already.

Derrick Alexander Improving

From an interview with Dick Vermeil today on KCChiefs.com

Question: Did (WR) Derrick Alexander take a full day of reps?

VERMEIL: "Not the full amount but he did work. I asked him after practice
how he felt and he said he felt good. I don't know how long it's been since
he's said he felt good."

ESPN.com is also reporting on their Injuries page that Alexander will be
able to play this week. (although I take that page with a grain of salt)

It's a risky play here.   We'd told you this week that it wasn't looking
good for Alexander's back.   He seems to be over the Achilles trouble but
the back was so stiff earlier this week he couldn't tie his shoes.   That
appears to be getting better.   Still though, he's a large risk.   I would
still shy away unless I didn't have any alternatives close to him.   A sore
back is the kind of thing that could tighten up at any time and it's just
too risky in my opinion.
