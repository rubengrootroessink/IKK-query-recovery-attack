I guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and mic=
helle at the horsetrack.  I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to =
it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be =
bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the be=
tting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept askin=
g are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn'=
t say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool=
 about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are =
going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I wal=
k in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we =
had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts l=
eaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to =
email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls=
.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like an=
d she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you coul=
d say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs. =
 It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that=
 i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weeke=
nd.  I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it =
is very tempting it is also very dangerous. =20

I don't know if this is going to keep its format but EOG's trailing
earning are $5.01 and forward expectations are $2.31 and that probably
is too high.  Its trailing P/E is 6.53 and forward P/E is
14 which is still on the low side of historical P/Es (6-60 with average
of 30) but it all comes back to how long you think gas prices are in a
$2-$3 environment.  Usually when you are as full in storage as we are
going to be it takes at least 2 years to work off the extra gas which
would lower earnings in 2002 and 2003.  I think the industry is going to
wash out in the next month or two and could be off up to 20% and then
maybe it will find the bottom.  The one thing I have learned from
trading is usually there is a big washout of the longs (like down $3 or
more in a day or two for EOG) that takes place before you find the
bottom.
