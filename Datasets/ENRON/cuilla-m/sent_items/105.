I spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedroom furniture set.  At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a company in North Carolina after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores.  We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands.  After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received a full refund from the North Carolina company.  If you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately.  I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the furniture.  You can reach me at 713-853-5933 at work or on my cell at 713-432-7163.  
 
Thanks,
