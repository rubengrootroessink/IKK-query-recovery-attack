I had an extremely rude conversation with a manager at southwestern bell and they once again said we weren't owed anything at which time I told the woman she didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.  After several other uses of fuck she hung up.  I switched our service to att (never thought i would be happy to be an att customer again) and called back and got another manager who claims she is taking care of it.
