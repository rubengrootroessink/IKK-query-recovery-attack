Ok, my below request has now changed.  I have found these deals under Coral Energy Resources, L.P.  Please advise as to which counterparty these deals belong to.

Thank you,
Scott

Martin,

Coral Energy Canada is billing ENA for 3 deals for the production month of Sep-01.  However, I cannot find anything in the system which matches these deals.  Upon contacting Coral, they have stated that you are the trader on each of these deals.  The Coral Energy Canada trader is Shane Lee.  The detail for these deals is below.  Please advise as to where they might be in the system or what my next step is to be so that I may settle this account.

Dates		Pipeline	Volume	Price		Total
Sep 13		Union		100,000mm	2.74000		$274,000.00
Sep 12		Union		201,000mm	2.80000		$562,800.00
Sep 15 - 17	            Union		600,000mm	2.56000		$1,536,000.00

Thank you,
