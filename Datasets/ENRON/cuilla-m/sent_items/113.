Hello Mr. Cuilla,

Per our conversation on yesterday, I am sending you this email with the
information that I am needing to update. I am attaching a sheet that would
be very helpful if you could fill it out. In filling this out, this will
help us in finding the right opportunity for the right candidate. If you
would fill it out and email it back to me that would be very helpful.



Thank You for your time,

Jessiica Howell
