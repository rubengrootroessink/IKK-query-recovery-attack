Wasssup.  I just got back from vacation so still trying to catch up.  I would love to go to lunch but I have not been allowed to go to lunch for two years.  I work on the trading floor - trading natural gas - and thanks to the lovely invention of EnronOnLine (our online trading program) we have lunch delivered in everyday and aren't allowed to leave.  It sounds great at first - free lunch everyday but trust me you grow to hate it.  Regardless we should go for a beer sometime soon.  Give me a call and we'll go for a happy hour.  x35933

Hey Martin this is Vassigh Willy D's friend.
I just started a project here at Enron this week.

I am working with the Global Settlements group on the 18th floor.

My phone extension is 5-8679 just thru tomorrow.  I am out of the office Thur and Friday and will get my permanent seat next week.

This project is going thru at Least Next August - so we should go to lunch sometime.

Let me know

Late
Brian
