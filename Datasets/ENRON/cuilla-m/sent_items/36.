see below - I still have to find someone whose email we can send the requests but I will do that by tomorrow

During weeks 1 through weeks 10 we will conduct free agent drafts.  Each team will start with 100 fantasy points to use for bidding on free agents and will be awarded points each week based on your finish that week.  The highest scoring team will receive 1 point and the lowest scoring team will receive 10 points.  Each Thursday at 12pm we will conduct a free agent draft.  You must submit a list of the players you want to bid on with the points you bid on them to an email address yet to be determined.  After 12pm the highest bidder for each player will we awarded the free agent.  You can bid 0 points for a player but will lose if anyone else bids at least 1 point.  

If you have a Defense or Kicker on a bye week, you can pick up a bye week replacement from the free agent pool for free.  After the bye week is over, you must drop the replacement player.  Bye week replacements must be submitted via email to mcuilla@enron.com and will be awarded based on lowest YTD points scored.
