Doesn't make a lot of sense.  We don't have any offices in Dallas that I am aware of and his name or anything closely resembling it is not in our employee listings.

Zooey name of Enron lawyer we talked about yesterday is Phillip Islip.
Believe he is based up here in Dallas if that makes sense.  Love Dad.   See
