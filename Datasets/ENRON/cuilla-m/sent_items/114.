Kayvan,
 
Attached is a copy of my resume.  Things are very volatile over here so I am not sure what to expect for the next three months, but if possible (and if Enron isn't banktrupt) I would like to stay here until Febuary 5.  If we are around until then, I would like to try to make a choice on a potential job by early January.  Of course if we go bankrupt everything could change.  I would like to come up sometime soon and see what options exist and how I could fit into AEP's plans.  It was good talking to you and I hope to hear from you soon.
 
Thanks,
 
Martin
