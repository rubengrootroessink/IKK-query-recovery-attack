yeah i am in the process of interviewing but i have a job at least for the next 90 days and they are working on a job offer for if i stay on past that.  unfortunately most of the other job offers are out of texas though - stamford, connecticut; columbus, ohio; and kansas city, missouri.  hopefully in a couple of weeks i will know if i am staying here or going elsewhere.
