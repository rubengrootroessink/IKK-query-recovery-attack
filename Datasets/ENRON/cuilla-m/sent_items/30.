How much is the Montefeltro and the Legacy - I assume they can shoot 2
3/4 to 3 inch.  Which would you recommend (between Montefeltro, Legacy
and Super Black Eagle) - I mainly hunt pheasant and quail but would also
like a gun that I can hunt ducks and geese with.  Since I plan to hunt
some ducks and geese should I get a camo gun?  Any other suggestions or
recommedations?
