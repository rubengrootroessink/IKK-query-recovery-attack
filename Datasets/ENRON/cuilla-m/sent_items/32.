Fantasy Football puts you at the helm of your own team of
NFL stars. The CBS SportsLine.com Fantasy Commissioner allows
Martin Cuilla to make all your league's rules and run 
your league in virtually any way possible. 

You'll enjoy the convenience of a private web site which 
stores all your team's data and updates the statistics and
standings daily. You can customize your team's site to 
display all the information you need in the way that works 
best for you.

You can also set up your team's site to send you e-mail 
reports every morning, with updated league standings, news 
about your players, and much more. Your site can even 
notify you, via wireless text messaging, of breaking 
league news.

What better way to usher in another football season than to 
live out the ultimate football fantasy - running your own 
team!

We hope you enjoy the CBS SportsLine.com Fantasy Commissioner.  
Have a great season.

        The Staff
