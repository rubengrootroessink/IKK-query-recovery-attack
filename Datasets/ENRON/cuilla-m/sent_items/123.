I forgot to tell you yesterday when I was talking to you that I talked to a friend of mine at Calpine and I am not interested in them.  Sorry about forgetting tallking to you on Friday but this has been a very stressful time in my life as well as many of my friends.  Thanks for your help and I look forward to talking to you about TXU.
