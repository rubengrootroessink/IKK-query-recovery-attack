Small world - I have talked to Gerald and Dana before about Enron people they know but don't ever remember hearing your name.  I would like to meet you, however I am going to be in Kansas hunting from November 9th through 14th.

Martin,
Apparently you live right next door to friends of mine.  Dana Welsh and Gerald King were neighbors of mine when I lived in Houston in 1998, and my wife and I still keep in contact with them.  As a matter of fact, we'll be staying with them on November 11 & 12 before their wedding, and might knock on your door to meet you.  Funny, Dana mentioned in the past you worked for Enron, but it's such a big company I didn't think I might know you.

Regards,

T. Scott Campbell
