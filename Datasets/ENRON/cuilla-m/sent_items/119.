We got home too late last night to call you, but I wanted to tell you what a
wonderful evening we had and thank you for being such a thoughtful son.
Drillion was just great.  I have never seen anything like it!  After seeing
Drillion a regular circus would be dull and boring.

The Old Warsaw was everything you described and more.  Fur coats and big
diamonds are still in style and I saw plenty of them at the Warsaw.   The
service was impeccable, the music was soothing and relaxing, and I've never
eaten a better meal.  Dad had the lobster thermador and I had the
tenderloin.  Everything was absolutely perfect.  The young man at the table
next to us proposed to his girlfriend and the ring was hidden under grapes
in a silver goblet.  It was very romantic and the staff made a big
production of it so we all enjoyed it.

I wanted to call you this morning to thank you but I know things are in
turmoil at work and I didn't want to disturb you.  We will call this
evening.

Your wonderful gift was very much appreciated and enjoyed by both Dad and I.

Love,

Mom
