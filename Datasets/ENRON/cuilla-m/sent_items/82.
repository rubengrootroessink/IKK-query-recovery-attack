Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Janikowski Allegations Getting
More Serious


I reported on our message boards Monday night about the "Janikowski
Shenanigans" with him falling down at a night club resulting in a cut to his
head requiring stitches.   Chris Mortensen reported the Raider brass were
simply calling it "Sebastian being Sebastian".   Coach Jon Gruden joked that
he was just "glad he fell on his head and not his leg".   Most sort of
shrugged it off as "those crazy Raiders".

But now it's getting a little more serious with this CNNSI article:

Janikowski Hurt in Fall After "Apparent Drug Overdose"

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Oakland Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski fell at a
nightclub due to "an apparent drug overdose," cutting his face and requiring
five stitches a few hours after the Raiders' game against Dallas, police
said Tuesday.

Janikowski was taken to a hospital after patrons at the Sno-Drift Bar
reported he had collapsed early Monday morning, police spokesman Dewayne
Tully said.

Janikowski, 23, who attended team meetings later Monday, was not arrested,
Tully said. A police report indicated the club's doorman told officers that
Janikowski was "possibly overdosing on GHB" -- the so-called date-rape drug.

Last April in Florida, Janikowski was found innocent on charges of drug
possession and evidence tampering after being accused of possessing GHB.

In the police report Monday, officers wrote they "found Janikowski
incoherent and wildly flailing around on the floor. As a result of the
uncontrolled flailing, Janikowski hit his head on the floor and caused a cut
over his right eye."

Janikowski did not respond when officers talked to him, and he was placed in
soft restraints on a gurney for the trip to the hospital, the police report
said.

Janikowski's roommate, Jay Hoffman, told police the kicker was not taking
drugs but that he was with an unidentified woman earlier in the night who
may have slipped something into his drink.

Other witnesses at the club told police they saw Janikowski voluntarily
taking what appeared to be GHB earlier in the evening.

Paul Healy, the kicker's agent, said Janikowski needed stitches for a head
wound. He said his client had been drinking, and said reports of a drug
overdose were "totally false."

"I know he was out there at a nightclub in San Francisco and slipped and
fell. At a lot of these clubs, people spill their drinks, and he slipped and
whacked his head," Healy said. "You don't have a drug overdose Sunday night
and go to practice Monday morning."

Asked about the police report, Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor said Tuesday
the team would have no comment.

Raiders coaches said Janikowski appeared fine Monday. The kicker, who has
made all eight of his field goals this season, was not in the locker room in
the hour that reporters are allowed access on days following games.

Janikowski, a native of Poland, was Oakland's first-round choice in the 2000
draft after starring at Florida State.

In June 2000, Janikowski was acquitted on a charge he offered a Tallahassee
policeman $300 to release his roommate after an argument with a bouncer who
wouldn't let him into a local nightclub.

His contract includes a clause that will force him to pay back about $25,000
for every game he misses due to suspension. The clause was added because of
his run-ins with the law.

First thing - nothing has been proven.   It's important to note we're
talking about allegations here.   But clearly, this isn't as funny now.   He
likely skates here without too much trouble but it's probably a sign that
you need a "plan B" if Janikowski is your kicker.   Just to be safe.   More
as we hear it.
