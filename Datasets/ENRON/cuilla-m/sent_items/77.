Hey I want to check with you about pulling $750 from our checking account to deposit into my gambling account.  No I have not lost $1,000 but I am following a model and I take all the games it says and there are more than 20 games each week which eats up all the capital until the games are decided.  I know the next question and so far I have lost $150 but I didn't take any games this week because there wasn't enough to bet all of them and I would have won $150.  Anyway, I would like to know if there are any big checks coming otherwise I am going to pulse and get things set up for this weekend.  On a side note, the furniture people called and said the furniture is coming in in pieces and they should have it all by November which means it would ship to us between the 1st and 3 week of November but definitely before Thanksgiving.
