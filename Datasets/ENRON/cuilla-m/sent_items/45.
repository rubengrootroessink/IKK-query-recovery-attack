There is a very good website for getting information regarding current
events - www.drudgereport.com  I highly recommend you read it if you
want to get the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade
Center bombings.  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming
evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind
and/or financier.  If you are interested -  read the article below that
gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible.
Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before
(embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this
year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of
terror by ending his life!

U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah 
 
SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM
Friday, September 14, 2001
WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of
Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the
suicide attacks in New York and Washington.

U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the
conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the
sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used
a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.

The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another
group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the
Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.

"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. Charles Grassley, the
ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the
speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very
much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."

Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were
briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.

A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that
Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But
the official said no determination has been made.

"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one
connection," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated
the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who
could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."

Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration
appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in
the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting
Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the
Middle East.

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet
determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination
would have to be made soon.

The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism
campaign. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested
allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.

"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are
so enormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to
be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."

A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the
government proves he is responsible, rather than send hate mail & cause
added tension between the two countries!

Don't be so ignorant!  It's UN-American!

Whoever is responsible will be taken care of - we don't need to take it
upon
ourselves.
