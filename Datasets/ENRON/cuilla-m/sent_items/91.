Now you can enjoy the benefits of convenient online ordering and home 
delivery for medications that you take on an ongoing basis - even if 
you currently fill these prescriptions at your local retail pharmacy.

Recent enhancements to merckmedco.com now make it even easier for you 
to see which of your prescriptions can be filled through Merck-Medco's 
Home Delivery Pharmacy. 

When you choose to refill a prescription through home delivery, you can:
* Enjoy at-home prescription delivery and the convenience of online 
  ordering anytime, from any computer with Internet access. 
* Receive a larger days' supply of medication -- usually up to 90 
  days -- which saves you trips to the drugstore and in some cases, 
  saves you money.
* Check prescription order status, pricing and coverage online.
* Receive e-mails notifying you of your prescription order status. 

To see which prescriptions may be eligible for home delivery, simply:
* Click on this link or copy it into your browser window:
  https://host1.merck-medco.com/cgi-bin/Br.cgi?-PW-MyRxRtTb 
* Then log in using your email address and password.
* After you click on the "login" button, you'll be presented with our 
  "Retail Prescriptions" area, where you can see a detailed history of 
  recent prescriptions you filled at a retail pharmacy. 

Any medication with a little blue house next to it indicates that the 
prescription is eligible for home delivery. When you click on the blue 
house, you can compare your current co-payment with the savings you would 
receive if you choose home delivery.  If you decide that you would like 
to take advantage of home delivery savings, we contact your healthcare 
provider and keep you informed every step of the way via e-mail. 

merckmedco.com has many ways to help you get the most out of your 
prescription drug benefit.  So visit us today and see for yourself!
