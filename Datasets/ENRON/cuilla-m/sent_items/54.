only problem is his recommendation is that we do nothing and the american people won't stand for that and if we don't do something bin laden will surely strike again.

>Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban? The 
>answer is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering. 
>A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are 500,000

>We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone

>New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs. Would they at

>So what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak with

>and the West, he's got a billion soldiers. If the west wreaks a
