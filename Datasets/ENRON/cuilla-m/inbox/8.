<br>Re: Revisions to TransCanada's Transportation Tariff
<p>TransCanada has updated the General Terms and Conditions (GT &amp; C)
of the Mainline Transportation Tariff. This
<br>amendment was proposed in the Fifth Report of the 2001 Tolls Task Force
(TTF Resolution 06.2001 Balancing Service
<br>Changes) and was approved by the National Energy Board by letter dated
September 14, 2001.
<p>Accordingly, a new version of the General Terms and Conditions and Table
of Contents page are available on-line at
<br>TransCanada's website at<a href="http://www.transcanada.com/"> http://www.transcanada.com/&nbsp;</a>
or through NrG at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nrgexpressway.com/">http://www.nrgexpressway.com/</a>.
