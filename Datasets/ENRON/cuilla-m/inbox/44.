Wall of Champs Is Up!   Some sites attempt to impress you with titles won by
the guys running the site.   I've found most people are just slightly more
interested in winning THEIR own league.   Footballguys.com is built on the
concept of giving YOU information to win YOUR league and tons of you have
done just that.

If you've made your playoffs or won your league, let the world know about
it.   We've got our Wall of Champs up and running and waiting for you.
Check it out here  http://footballguys.com/wall2001.cfm You can add your
team here http://footballguys.com/addwall.cfm   There's not much better than
flaunting your success in front of your league members...

Enjoy.

Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia
may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt
Warner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up
against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box
when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

What a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell
Stewart combined for 662 passing yards and 5 TDs.Kitna had 411 of those
yards.   Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be
involved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active -
maybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although
you have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks
# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Check the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a
good matchup.


Denver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Griese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him
to do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do
well too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense

Manning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday
but he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go
to guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great
effort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos
rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Mike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the
playoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and
maybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than
a full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as
Holt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank #
26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed
to WRs.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Carolina Passing Game vs New England Defense


Can't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster.
Weinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd
possibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin
Muhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.
For the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn
't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to
take advantage of the matchup though.


Chicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

When you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the
passing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the
Bears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes
than any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he
's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Dallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Quincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway
deep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for
sure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and
# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends
on whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more
thing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000
yard season so that may be a factor.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Trent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards.
Tony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He
saw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week.
The Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense


Jay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad.
Chris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis
Minor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be
used more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Tom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams
going drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to
make an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.



Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Hindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated
player in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a
Superbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks
season (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another
shot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell
Jackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look
hard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Jeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last
week.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start.
J.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved.
The Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Baltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Elvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with
205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of
Qadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The
Vikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Green Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

Favre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it
was really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past.
Freeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw
a handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this
week ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

Aaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and
just 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading
receiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came
up small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Stewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4
Interceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is
showing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well.
The Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Steve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a
totally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's
re-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal
number of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense
ranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense


Tony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it
was the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle
injury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This
week, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking
# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed
to WRs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Atlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense


Mike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly
looking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler
was consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis,
Shawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team.
The Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

For the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up
Tennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of
choice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Mark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday.
Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos
in the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats
don't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been
stingy allowing FF points.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Spergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day.
Really puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they'
re sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times.
Both these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I
still think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so
even though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put
forth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Kerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki
Barber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing
pretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Vinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2
Interceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all
about Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders
rank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Oakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Rich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did
have the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well
and Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a
must win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Donovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week
and better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300
yards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back
onto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Brad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90
yards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt.
Keyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This
week, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Arizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Start David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits
consideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week.
The Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a
sure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR.


Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense


Van Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks
to me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and
Peerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins
rank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Detroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Mike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start.
Sounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday.
He threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger
were especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank
# 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
