	Yo Sweets McGeets.  Just a reminder that you were going to call and
discontinue your payroll deduction for the Enron fitness center.

	Let's talk insurance stuff tonight as I know you need to make those
elections soon.  Will plan on comparing and contrasting my health plan with
Enron's.  Luv, The Wif
