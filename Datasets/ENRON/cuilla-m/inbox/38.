One final note, if you?re seeking last minute getaways for Christmas and
New Year's, cheap seats are very limited or do not exist at all for the
holidays to Florida, the Caribbean, Mexico, Hawaii or west of the Rockies.
 This may be a good time to review our last minute airfares and hotel
program. The fares for the holiday season will be slightly higher than
normal, but when you compare it to the lowest published fare, you still
may save big bucks. Check out Quickfare Finder today or try our last
minute getaways, we may have just the ticket for reasonable holiday
travel! Visit the Quickfare Finder at
