Title: Lone Star: The Texas Market Launch Is a Pivotal Point for Retail Energy Competition 	
URL(s):

***********************************************************************

MARKET LAUNCH IN JANUARY 2002 COULD MAKE OR BREAK THE MOVEMENT TOWARD RETAIL 
COMPETITION

The much-anticipated opening of the Texas market--one of the largest in the 
country--is on track for January 1, 2002. There are great expectations that 
this comprehensive and unique restructuring model, combined with favorable 
market conditions, will produce a viable retail market. As a result, Texas 
could be the lone star in what has been otherwise a largely disappointing 
market space.

* Market fundamentals should support retail competition as Texas moves into a 
supply surplus, providing an opportunity for competitive suppliers to earn a 
margin.

* Large customer load will switch to competitive suppliers well ahead of small 
customer load.

* Regardless of its success, the Texas retail market will have significant 
short-term and long-term effects on retail markets nationwide.
