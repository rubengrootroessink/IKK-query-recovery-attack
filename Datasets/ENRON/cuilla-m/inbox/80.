Title: The Spanish Gas Auction: A Precedent for Europe?

A SMALL STEP FOR SPAIN, BUT AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR EUROPE

The recent auction of contract gas in Spain represents an early initiative both 
to release gas from preexisting long-term contracts and to make it available to 
aspiring market entrants. As such, CERA believes it could provide a precedent 
for other European markets (and for their regulators) where release gas 
programs have not so far been on the public agenda. 

*  The Spanish gas release program, as currently devised, will have limited 
impact on domestic competition. However, pressure will grow in Spain to extend 
the program.

*  By setting a unique precedent across Continental Europe, Spain has signaled 
a possible path for the reforms needed on the supply-side to complete the 
European gas internal market.

*  The role of credit risk and sovereign guarantees will be critical in any 
reallocation or renegotiation of long-term contracts.
