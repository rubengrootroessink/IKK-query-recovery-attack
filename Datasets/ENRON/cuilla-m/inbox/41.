<p>Re: Revisions to TransCanada's Transportation Tariff
<br>&nbsp;
<p>TransCanada has updated the following sections of the Mainline Transportation
Tariff:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TABLE OF CONTENTS;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIST OF TOLLS;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTERRUPTIBLE TRANSPORTATION
TOLL SCHEDULE;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TURNBACK PROCEDURE.
<p>These amendments were proposed in the TransCanada application concerning
2001/2002 tolls and tariff issues (Tolls Application) and the Mainline
Service and Pricing Settlement (Settlement). The Board considered the Tolls
Application at a public hearing and "RH-1-2001 Reasons for Decision"&nbsp;
approval by the National Energy Board was dated November 15, 2001.
<p>Accordingly,&nbsp; new versions of the: Table of Contents, List of Tolls,
IT Toll Schedule, and Turnback Procedure pages are available on-line at
<br>TransCanada's website at <a href="http://www.transcanada.com/">http://www.transcanada.com/</a>&nbsp;
or through NrG at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nrgexpressway.com/">http://www.nrgexpressway.com/</a>.
