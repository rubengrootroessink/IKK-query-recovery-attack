     Delivering Intel technology to your inbox
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Dear Martin,

We're contacting you because you signed up at
Real.com a while ago to receive news about the
Intel(R) Pentium(R) III processor and Intel(R)
WebOutfitter(SM) Service.  This e-mail is to
inform you that you will now receive updates
on Intel's processors and products for the home,
courtesy of the free Intel(R) Home Computing
Newsletter.

In the first issue, you'll hear about the brand
new Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 processor, a new
generation of processor created to take
advantage of tomorrow's Internet technology.  In
future issues, you'll learn about our other
products (yes, we do make more than processors)
that are making the Internet a more interesting
place to be, like the Intel(R) Wireless Game Pad,
the Intel(R) Pocket PC Camera, and the Intel(R)
AnyPoint(TM) Wireless Home Network.
