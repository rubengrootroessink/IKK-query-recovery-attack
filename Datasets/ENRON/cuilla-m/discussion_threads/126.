For the December sale to Sithe under our long term gas sales agreement, 
please use

 Chippawa: 28,400 Dth/day
 PEPL:  37,776 Dth/day

 ANR-LA: 83,915 Dth/day

For the volumes that ENA would buy back from Sithe in the field due to the MW 
Turndown
deal, please use the following volumes:

We are meeting with John Lavorato at 9:30 this morning to talk about hedging
the power side of this transaction.  Besides the gas bid we talked about 
yesterday,
please come up with a back-up plan to price the gas on a fixed price basis 
just
in case it takes us another day to address any other concerns that John may 
have.

Thanks,
Ruth
