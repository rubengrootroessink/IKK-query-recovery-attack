Hey everybody!!!

I know the holiday season gets a little crazy, but if you're not attending a
company Christmas party, fighting the masses at the malls, or going to
Cousin Timmy's dysfunctional family get-together, please leave Saturday
night open for hall deckin' H-town style!!

The plans for the entire evening have not been determined, but Zooey & Marty
have graciously offered The Bellefontaine Pub as a starting place for all of
us.  Just think... We can sing & roast marshmallows there for a couple of
hours, and then we'll hit the town with our holiday Nog breath!!   Just
another great excuse to get together & celebrate with friends!   So....

Bring your favorite beverage, and come by for the munchies & fun around
7:00.

Look forward to seeing you all!!

Laura Lou Who
