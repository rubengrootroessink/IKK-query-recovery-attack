 FYI - I just recently paid for a portion of our At&T bill with the
rest of the free money in our Waterhouse account (wrote a check in the
amount of like $2200).  The remaining balance is something like $2,500.  All
of that amount is allocated to our monthly savings for property/school
taxes.  I guess what you're saying is you would like to borrow from this
savings account to make this investment.  As long as you feel confident that
we will be able to reimburse that amount somehow to pay our taxes (should we
not get a return on the investment), then I guess we should go for it if
it's something you're excited about and believe is a good investment.
Naturally, I would prefer we only invest $500 because of the risk involved
and Christmas just around the corner, but you're the one with the financial
instincts and know-how.  Wifey

Hey how much of the money in our Waterhouse account is budgeted for
expenses.  I am thinking that it would be a good investment (speculative in
nature though) to purchase some options on Enron.  The options would expire
in January and the potential return could vary between a loss of 100% of
the investment to a 400%-500% return.  I think between a $500-$1,000
investment would be wise given the nature of it.
