Hi Stephanie,

The counterparty is Harrah's Operating Company, Inc. (Rated BBB-) and they 
are domesticly based.  They would be buying a 2 year plain-vanilla fixed 
price swap (the volume is small; 10,000 MMBtu/month).  I understand ENA would 
prepare & send-out the confirm.

Thanks!

Ken

Ken,

Are they looking for  a "sample" confirmation to see what it will look like?  
In speaking with Brent Hendry, an attorney in our group, we need to know more 
information about this counterparty and the type of trades they will be doing 
before sending out anything.  Our forms vary depending on the type of 
counterparty and trade being done, and may look different depending on credit 
terms.  Also, if the trade is going to be done in the name of ENA, then ENA 
needs to prepare and send out the confirmation.

Can you send us what information you have on the counterparty/trade?  If you 
have any questions, please contact myself or Brent Hendry.

Thanks.

Stephanie,

As discussed, please send a copy of ENA's standard long-form swap 
confirmation.  We have a customer who is potentially going to trade with ENA 
and they'd like to review the confirm as soon as possible.

Thanks for your help.
