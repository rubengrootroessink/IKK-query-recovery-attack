Mr. Chrismer,
Attached for your review is a draft of the Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the proposed ISDA Master Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and Solvay Paperboard.  Please note that the actual ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex are preprinted forms from ISDA and cannot be sent electronically.  Therefore, I am also sending the entire package to you via overnight delivery.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at the below number or Sara Shackleton, Assistant General Counsel, at 713-853-5620.  We look forward to hearing your comments.
