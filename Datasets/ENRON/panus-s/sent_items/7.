There has been some confusion on this ISDA/CSA since originally there was no electronic version.  I have tried to incorporate all comments into this electronic document.  Please make all written comments directly on this document.   If you prefer, you may call me to discuss comments at (302) 455-9282.
There are no comments on the Guaranty.  I have received two different guaranty versions from Enron. In my last phone conversation with Darren Vanek on 8/8/01, Darren indicated he was going to talk to Stephanie about providing one guaranty for both financial and physical transactions.
