Mr. Diaz,
Attached in connection with the ISDA Master Agreement between Copamex, S.A. de C.V. and Enron North America Corp. is a revised Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex, which revises the transfer timing for the delivery of credit support.  Also attached is a blackline showing the change from the previous copy.  As no signatures are required on this annex, please substitute this Paragraph 13 for the Paragraph 13 you received with the ISDA Master Agreement.

If you have any questions, please contact me at the below number or Francisco Pinto-Leite at 713-345-7942.
