Mr. Dawson,

Attached for your review is a draft of the Alcan Inc. Guaranty we are requesting on behalf of Alcan Aluminum Corporation.  We have set the guaranty up to cover physical gas and financial transactions with Enron North America Corp., and physical power with Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

On page no. 1, Alcan will need to complete the effective date and the State/Province of incorporation for Alcan Aluminum Corporation.  On page no. 3, Alcan will need to complete the contact information for Alcan Inc.

If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me at the below number, or by email.
