Patrick,
I have the documentation for the name change.  It should be Enbridge Marketing (U.S.) Inc.  I am processing the paperwork and Diane should receive the usual copy from me.

In TAGG, the name appears as MidCoast Marketing.  But when we generate the confirm, it says Enbridge Marketing.  So with that in mind, should we hold off sending these confirms?

I think that they are changing their name, but I haven't seen the documentation yet.

Stephanie,

We have some deals that are generating differently than they appear.  Has MidCoast Marketing changed its name to Enbridge Marketing Inc.?


Thanks,

Patrick
