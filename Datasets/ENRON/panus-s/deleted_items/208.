Cindy,

On April 25, 2001, Enron Corp. issued a guaranty (gty2997) in favor of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, Inc. ("PacifiCorp") to guaranty the obligations of ECC.  ECC and PacifiCorp are now entering into an ISDA Master Agreement.  Under the ISDA Master Agreement, the Guaranty is being amended to increase the amount to $25 mil., and we will be required to provide certificates for Enron Corp.

Attached is the Amendment to Guaranty and the related Enron Corp. certificates that are needed.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Stephanie
