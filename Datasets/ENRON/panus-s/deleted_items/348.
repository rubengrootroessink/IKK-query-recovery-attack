That all sounds great to me!

I'm going out tonight and won't be back in until late most likely so I can't
call tonight.

I'll just coordinte with Nance and I'm sure that you guys will be talking.
If we don't do something Friday, then let's defintely do something next
week/end.

If you do go out of town - have a great time.  And have a good holiday!

That sounds like fun.  We might be out of town for the weekend.  Raymond's
friend has some land about halfway between Dallas and Houston.  We were
thinking of going up Thurs night or Fri morning.  If we do go out of town,
we need to get together next week(end). Give me a call.  We'll be around
tonight.

   Hey Steph!

   I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to
   travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it
   was
   Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!

   How long are Nancy & Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.

   I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
   weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time
   and I
   like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if
   that's
   alright.

   I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be
   strange
   b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's
   thinking
   but now saying - you know what I mean?

   My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't
   recall
   my cell right now.

   We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and
   bitch
   about the idiots we both work with!!!

   Let me know what's up!

   Jenn

   Hey, Jen,
   What's been going on?  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I seem to
   have missplaced your phone numbers (I'm sure if I dug through my pile of
   junk at home I would find them!).  Give me a call.  Nancey & Michael are
   going to be in town for Turkey Day.  Lots of fun going on at my office
   these days.
