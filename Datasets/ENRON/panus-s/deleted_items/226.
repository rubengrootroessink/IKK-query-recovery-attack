Kim and Dan,
In an effort to come to closure on the one final issue I propose the follow=
ing language. =20
"(e)=09Payments on Early Termination.  For the purpose of Section 6(e):  (i=
) Market Quotation shall apply to natural gas and crude oil Transactions wi=
th a remaining term at the time of the Early Termination of less than one y=
ear and Loss will apply to all other Transactions, and (ii) the Second Meth=
od will apply."

I believe that this provision would cover the vast majority of SAC's trades=
 with Enron which are the types of trades which Enron considers most liquid=
.  This also addresses our concern of not having to obtain quotations on il=
liquid positions.  We would be willing to modify the Loss definition as set=
 forth below (as proposed in my last email) which also addresses some of yo=
ur concerns with the standard version of the Loss definition (while recogni=
zing that it does not address all your concerns).  We believe this to be a =
fair compromise that attempts to address the concerns of both parties.  Ple=
ase review the proposal and let me know if we can send a final blacklined c=
opy of the agreement for your review.

Regards,
Brent=20

"The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as fo=
llows:=20

"Loss" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Tran=
sactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equival=
ent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a co=
mmercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which =
case expressed as a negative number), without duplication, in connection wi=
th this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Tra=
nsactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the ele=
ction of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a res=
ult of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge =
or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).   to =
be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a re=
placement transaction.  Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of =
funding or, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidati=
ng, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions.  Fu=
rthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or  a party's legal fees =
and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11.  A party will dete=
rmine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is no=
t reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonab=
ly practicable.  A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference=
 to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers=
 in the relevant market."
