Stephanie,

This document reflects our changes.  Please contact me if there are any
problems with these.  We, too, would really like to get this completed
today.  Thanks!
(Also, we need a copy of the paper confirmation faxed to us as we cannot
confirm that a financial trade between CNR and ENA was done at all in
October, 2001 specifically:  "WE BOUGHT A 2500MMBTU/DAY SWAP ON 10/17/01
BEG 11/01 THRU 2/28/02")
