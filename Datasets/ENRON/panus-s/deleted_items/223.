Elaine,
I am attaching clean and blackline versions of the Fourth Amended and
Restated Guaranty from FPL Group Capital to Enron entities, incorporating
the  changes requested by Enron.  Please confirm that you are comfortable
with  the modification in paragraph 2 of assuming responsibility that Enron
actually receives your notice in the event that you desire to terminate the
Guaranty.  As always, please do not hesitate to call with any  questions.
-Karen
