Please accept my apologies.  I did find where you sent this memo on PPL. I just didn't read far enough down my list.  Sorry. -g

Stephanie,
 
Please send forward your preliminary memo to me concerning PPL EnergyPlus, LLC.  If you sent one earlier, I never received it.
 
It is vital that we get these memos because it signals us to check EOL immediately as to whether or not we have to set up a shell agreement for a contract number so the counterparty can do on-line trading. 
 
Thanks,
-g
