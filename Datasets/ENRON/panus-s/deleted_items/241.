Hi, Stephanie

VCM has an office in bermuda and in Houston ... you will tend to deal with
the Houston office most of the time on trading, invoicing and collateral
matters.

I trust that this answers your question

Regards, David

      Hello, Stephanie,

      I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your
      email/attachments
      fo 24 July.

      Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope
   that
      once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
      implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ...
   I
      expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the
      address
      details and a few other similar minor items.

      Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

      Can you please confirm that you receive this email and the
   attachments
      in a
      'readable' format?

      Thanks and regards, David
