Dear Ms. Panus,

I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with
reference to the following issues:

1)  Description of "Representative" was too broad.  We feel accessing
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.

[Panus, Stephanie]  While the definition of "Representative" is broad, it is limited to those persons who will evaluate, negotiate, and finalize the Transaction.  There may be persons working on this who are from different departments/affiliates.

2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential
indefinitely.
[Panus, Stephanie]  
We can agree to a two year term.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, you can request the return of all documents submitted to Enron.  The information to be submitted does not retain its value indefinitely.

3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We cannot agree to California law, but can agree to New York law.

4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for
a Confidentiality Agreement.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We use arbitration for settling all issues other than for injunctive relief.

Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.

Thanks and best regards,

Mr. Wise,
Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which
Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the
Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution
copies.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via
email or at the number below.
