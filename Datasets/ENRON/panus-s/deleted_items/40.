Mr. Wise,
Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution copies.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via email or at the number below.
