Hey, Jen,
What's been going on?  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I seem to have missplaced your phone numbers (I'm sure if I dug through my pile of junk at home I would find them!).  Give me a call.  Nancey & Michael are going to be in town for Turkey Day.  Lots of fun going on at my office these days.
