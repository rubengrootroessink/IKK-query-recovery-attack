Dear Dr. Sayre:
Thank you for your letter regarding the ISDA Agreement being executed
between OPPD and Enron.  I have discussed your letter with our General
Counsel (Fraser Stryker).  I would like to set up a conference call to
discuss the issues raised in your letter.  Would you be available for a
conference call on Thursday, October 18 or October 29?  I will look forward
to hearing from you.
