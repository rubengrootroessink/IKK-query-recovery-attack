The documentation they sent does not show that Sequent Energy Management, LLC became Sequent Energy Management, L.P.  The documents they sent show that 1) Sequent Energy Management, LLC changed its name to Sequent, LLC, 2) Sequent Energy, LP changed its name to Sequent Energy Management, LP, and 3) Sequent, LLC is the general partner of Sequent Energy Management, L.P.  I have left a message for the individual who sent the documents to us.

Hi Stephanie, 

I just wanted to be sure you received the documents I sent you on Sequent.  I was also wondering where we stand.  If you could let me know I would appreciate it.  

Thanks, 
Leigh

Hi Stephanie,

I work in deal confirmation and have been receiving confirms back from Sequent Energy Management.  The are saying thay it should be Sequent Energy Management L.P. not LLC.  We were wondering if you have recieved documentation of this.  We have documentation of this if you need it.  Please let me know if you reflect this or not.

Thanks, 
Leigh
