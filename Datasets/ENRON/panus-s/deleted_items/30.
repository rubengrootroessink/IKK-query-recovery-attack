Sterling,
I have forwarded your request on to our Credit group.  Any amendments involving credit terms or new entities must be approved by Credit.  Please feel free to contact Jay Williams in our Credit group at 713-345-3923 or by email at jason.r.williams@enron.com.  I will also follow up with him.

Stephanie,
Have you had a chance to review the amendments?  Our traders are very eager
to trade with Enron NA (and are asking about it several times a day - I'm
sure you know how it goes!).  Please let me know if there is anything I can
do to help expedite the process.  Thanks a bunch.
