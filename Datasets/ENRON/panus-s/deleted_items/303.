Cindy,
Attached for your further handling is the Enron Corp. Guaranty needed in connection with an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron Canada Corp. and Encore Energy Solutions, L.P., as well as the Secretarial Certificates that are also needed.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

 

Stephanie
