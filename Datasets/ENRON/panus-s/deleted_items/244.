David,
With respect to the tax representations, can you tell me if Vitol will be acting through offices within the US, outside of the US or both?

Thanks,
Stephanie

   Hello, Stephanie,

   I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your
   email/attachments
   fo 24 July.

   Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope that
   once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
   implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ... I
   expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the
   address
   details and a few other similar minor items.

   Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

   Can you please confirm that you receive this email and the attachments
   in a
   'readable' format?

   Thanks and regards, David
