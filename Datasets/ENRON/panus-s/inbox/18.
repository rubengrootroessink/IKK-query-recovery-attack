Thanks, Stephanie ... I look forward to your reply in due course .. I guess
that your credit people are rather tied up at the moment.

   Hi, Stephanie,

   I wanted to check where we are on the ISDA ... we sent you a proposal at
   the
   end of Sept, and you and I have exchanged a couple of emails since then,
   but
   overall I believe that the ball is still ' in your court'.  Is this
   correct?

   Regards, David
