Tana,

I am following up on the issue for Maureen Piercey who is out of the
office.

Will the TransAlta guarantee provided to Enron North America for financial
deals be acceptable? TransAlta currently sleeves the financial deals
through Enron Canada, and TransAlta can not continue to do this due to the
administrative difficulties that are created by this process.

Please let me know if the guarantee attached below is acceptable, and if
Enron North America will be will to sign the ISDA amendment. If you want to
contact me directly, my number is 403-267-6992.

Thanks,
Geordie
