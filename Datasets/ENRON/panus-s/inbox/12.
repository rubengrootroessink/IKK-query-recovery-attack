Derek,
 
I spoke to Stephanie yesterday and she updated the Confidentiality Agreement following our discussion.  The following references status of the points discussed:
 
1.    The updated agreement includes a definition of "affiliate".  This is acceptable to me.  
 
2.    Two year term.  This is okay.
 
3.    Request for Californiajurisdiction.  Stephanie said they could not agree to a Californiajurisdiction.  Her argument calling for a New Yorkjurisdiction is that the purpose of the Confidentiality Agreement is to facilitate a credit review, and Enron is familiar with dealing with credit matters under New Yorklaw.  
 
4.    Arbitration.  I told her we would agree to no changes on Arbitration wording from Enron format.
 
 
I told Stephanie that I would discuss with you before I get back to her.  
 
Thanks.
 
Tim
