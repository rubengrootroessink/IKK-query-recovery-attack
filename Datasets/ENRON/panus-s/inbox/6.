Stephanie, =20

Prior to the execution of the ISDA Master, LD had crossed out some stuff on=
 their confirms (ex. governing law) and stuff on the Annex - and we have be=
en unable to fully execute these outstanding deals.  So... since any outsta=
nding deals are now covered by the Master, what do we do about the ones tha=
t weren't fully executed and had markups? =20

Diane

Celeste,
Can you remind me what the problems were?  If they were related to confirmi=
ng trades, all trades should now be confirmed under the Master Agreement an=
d all trades that were confirmed prior to the execution of the Master will =
also now be governed by the Master.

Hey Stephanie.  Now that they have signed this ISDA for Louis Drefus Energy=
 Services, LP, how does that effect the confirmations that have been sent o=
ut in the past?  We are assuming this ISDA addressed the problems that were=
 sent up to legal a few months ago (Frank Sayre) and we now need to know ho=
w to move forward and get our existing confirmations executed.  Can you con=
firm if it did address the issues we sent to legal and how we need to proce=
ed to get these outstanding confirmations executed? =20

Thanks.

FYI, we have confirmations in 'Sent to Counterparty' status since December =
13, 2000.
