Stephanie - Attached are NJNG's comments on your guaranty.  Please review and let me know if these changes are acceptable.
Please note, the guaranty references the ISDA.  I submitted comments to you on 9/24/01 for an ISDA/CSA between our companies. Would you please give me the status of this review?
