Hello, Stephanie,

I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your email/attachments
fo 24 July.

Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope that
once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ... I
expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the address
details and a few other similar minor items.

Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

'readable' format?

Thanks and regards, David
