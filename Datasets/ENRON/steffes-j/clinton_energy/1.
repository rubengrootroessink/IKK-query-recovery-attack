Based on my records, EES LLC is owned as follows:

enron corp 98.16%
Enron Capital Management III LP - 1.8%
Enron Capital Management II LP - 0.04%

When I last checked, the corporate records indicated that both ECM entities were 100 percent owned by Enron Corp.  However, I recommend that you check with the relevant ENA  lawyer to make sure the information is correct.
