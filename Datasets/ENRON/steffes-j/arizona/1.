I am sure APS would be willing to discuss the opportunities already presented under the proposed PPA, which are quite extensive, especially in the later years when there is a large need for what the contract calls "Supplemental Energy Products."  Whether there is any enthusiasm for increasing these opportunities or front-loading more of them into the early years of the agreement, I cannot say.  Let me know if you wish to arrange a meeting.
