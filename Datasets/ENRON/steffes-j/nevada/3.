Attached is an outline for a new NPCo and Sierra tariff I prepared for a discussion with the ENA folks working on Nevada matters (including Gordon Savage).   Assuming we work through the politics (both internal and external), and the economics (both internal and external), the idea would be to propose the tariff in the Nevada rate case (scheduled for filing on October 1).
