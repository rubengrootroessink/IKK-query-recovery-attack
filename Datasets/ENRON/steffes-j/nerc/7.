I don't have anything to add to John, there was no mention if ESC, OASIS II, seams issues, etc. at the Stakeholder Committee meeting on Monday.

I am cc: Jose and Richard to jog their memories.  If you guys recall anything about the discussion, please let Mark and I know.

I do however, want to tell you about the conversation I just had with Dave Nevius.  He called me to check the Enron concerns about the ESC resolutions as expressed by Andy Rodriquez' email.

Dave reverted to the fact that the sector voting model was language added at the request of John Anderson and Vann Prater.  I explained to him that those words were needed as an add on to salvage what we could.  If NERC was going to adopt the resolutions 7-9 concerning the ESC, John's concern (and I agree with him) was that the ESC structure doesn't work.  I think you agree as well given the response to the joint TCCG request to Gent last year re: membership on the ESC.  The intent of the additional language was to make the best of a bad situation.  If the ESC was going to be roped into NERC, it should at least adopt the new voting structure.  

This may be useful info. for you.

Charles--Thanks for this.  On the NERC front, it is becoming increasingly important to know  exactly what, if any, discussion the Stakeholders Committee engaged in specifically relating to the ESC.  John Anderson told me that the first draft of the Resolution on NERC's role on market interface/commercial practices did NOT contain points 7-9 addressing the ESC.  According to John, those provisions were added overnight by Nevius and company.

It is important to know whether, and how, the Stakeholders Committee discussed the ESC, particularly whether their was consensus on the ESC issue.  Julie and Lynne are meeting with Pat Wood on Tuesday to discuss general matters and may have an opportunity to briefly address this an NERC/EISB stuff.  It would be good for them to point out to Wood that, contrary to Gent's letter, the Stakeholder Committee was in fact not wholely supportive of all aspects of the Resolution.  Please let me know what you determine.

Thanks!

Mark

If you don't already have this - here it is.

Another Market Interface issue - for the ESC?
