Our UBP group met for two days last week in St. Louis, along with GISB and =
AGA reps.  UBP is definitely on board with creating the retail electric qua=
drant of an EISB.  We have been working extensively on getting the membersh=
ip in line with a national organization.  Attached is a "draft" governance =
document that was completed at our meeting last month.  When this document =
was initiated, we were unsure of the progress to an EISB and it was develop=
ed to accommodate either a stand-alone retail organization until the EISB w=
as formed or to be used as a part of the EISB organization.  AGA has been o=
ff on their own developing details for the retail Gas quadrant of EISB.  We=
 have been very vocal in stating that they cannot develop these documents i=
n a vacuum with only gas utility representation; they must reach out to Sup=
pleirs, Services, etc.  The AGA member told us at our meeting that they pla=
n to have an open meeting sometime in November to gain input.  We'll wait a=
nd see how that develops.  A Virginia SCC staff member is also working to g=
et us some time in front of the Electricity Committee to update them on our=
 progress and continue to foster their support of our endeavor.  Please fee=
l free to let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Nancy, etal --

With the discussions at NERC recently to broaden their role, I think that w=
e need to be very coordinated on our EISB message and begin to figure out h=
ow we get AGA to work with the Retail Gas and EEI/UBR to work with the Reta=
il Power quadrants.  Let's think about a NARUC message to drive this very q=
uickly (maybe at the next meeting).

Having one body begin to coordinate all of these matters will greatly expan=
d our policy reach.

Thanks,

Jim
