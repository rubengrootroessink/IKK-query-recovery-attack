Attached, in no particular order, are my 12 selections for the top 10 wholesale market positions/issues we are currently advocating in New York. I've included a short status report on each.
 Regards. Howard

Merger of NYISO with PJM and NEPOOL into one consolidated Northeast ISO. Status: Protests pending before FERC. On 6/28 Agenda.
Elimination of ICAP market (long-term). While market continues to exist, assuring consistent programs among the northeast ISOs so that product can be freely traded across borders. Status: Stage II Tariff changes just approved by Management Committee; will make NY's market more consistent with PJM. MOU process being pursued by NY to eliminate current barriers to New England capacity being sold into NY.
Allowing power marketers to take positions inside the state. Currently, marketers can only go long and short at the border proxy buses. Status: Virtual Bidding, expected to be implemented by November 1, should resolve this issue.
Allowing multi-hour block import/export transactions to be scheduled. Status: On target to be implemented by November 1.
Access to Data: Status: Comprehensive list of data approved by Business Issues Committee last fall. Computer enhancements being implement and much of requested data has begun appearing on Oasis. All material should be available by end of summer.
Elimination of separate New York State Reliability Council. Dominated by TOs; marketers have no seat. Status: Raised as part of RTO protest. See 1 above.
Adoption of Best Practices to resolve critical seams issues. Status: Little progress being made. Unlikely to get addressed in meaningful way without FERC leadership role. 
Simplification of billing and assessment of transmission service charges for exports. Billing is currently done by each TO based on flow based models. Status: Under consideration in Committee.
Reduction/elimination of out-of-merit generation decisions by TOs. Status: Issue under investigation by ISO. Unlikely to be resolved without ISO assuming control over (i.e., securing) much of Con Ed's distribution system
Oppose circuit breaker, bid caps, temporary extraordinary procedures, penalty provisions and other forms of market intervention programs that impede the proper functioning of the markets. Status: FERC has recently allowed some of these measures to continue (bid caps and TEPs), although only for six months and not the 18 requested by the ISO. Circuit Breaker is pending before FERC. Penalty provisions just filed at FERC under "exigent circumstances" authority. Will be opposed at FERC. PR campaign designed to affect policy and public opinion to be launched imminently under IPPNY banner.
Revise ISO credit policies. Status: Major revisions under discussion by ISO committee in consultation with Price Waterhouse. TOs likely to be subject to some credit requirements for first time.
Revising the way day-ahead energy prices are determined in ISO model to eliminate impact of ISO unit commitment for reliability purposes when loads refuse to purchase their forecast requirements in day-ahead market. Status: Issue likely to begin getting discussed later this fall.
