Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky has prepared the attached position
paper in connection with tomorrow's FERC conference on the scope of
interconnection studies and services.  It attempts to reflect what we
believe was the consensus position reached during today's and earlier
conference calls regarding the types of interconnection studies/products.

Also included are several additional points covered in the EPSA issues paper relating to both the scope of studies and the rights of
interconnecting parties.  Finally, included is a proposal for an additional interconnection service product sent to us late this afternoon by
Tenaska.  We look forward to your reactions either by email this evening, or
at the initial caucus meeting at 9 a.m tomorrow.  If there are concerns,
will we make adjustments at the caucus.  Thanks.
