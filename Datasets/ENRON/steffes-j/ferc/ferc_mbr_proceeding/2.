RE: EPSA Leave-Behind on Market-Based Rate Authority
      ?Conference Call on Friday, November 2nd at 11:00 a.m.
       (EST)

Last Friday, we held a conference call to discuss EPSA's position on possible changes to FERC's market-based rate authorization standard and the Commission's recently released staff report outlining several alternatives to the currently used hub-and-spoke method.  Please review the attached draft, which has been extensively revised based on last week's call.  We have scheduled a conference call on Friday, November 2nd at 11:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss this draft and hope to be able to go forward after that call.  To access the call, please dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call. If you have any questions, comments or edits before the call, please contact Julie Simon at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org.
