FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) asks that we "provide factual evidence on the costs and benefits" of extending the affiliate code of conduct to bundled service.  To provide this evidence, we are asking members to provide incidents/anecdotes for EPSA's comments on the NOPR.  EPSA recognizes that some examples may include confidential data, so please feel free to eliminate any identifying data (i.e., name of counterparties, etc.) and to use general terms (e.g., "Control Area A").  Such factual evidence will help us to make a stronger argument in our comments.  Please send any information to Jackie Gallagher at jgallagher@epsa.org as soon as possible.
