This time, with attachment.

At the request of the TFG Steering Committee, we are circulating the testimony prepared by Richard Tabors that Powerex plans to submit regarding the special features of hydropower systems and their role in the PNW.  This is testimony that the TFG or a number of its members may wish to support or refer to at hearing.  The text is a slightly modified version of what Powerex filed at the July 9 hearing in the settlement conferences before Judge Wagner.

We will be circulating Richard's draft testimony on economic issues later this afternoon for TFG review.

Also, please be advised that the Steering Committee suggests that Ripple Claim testimony that TFG members may file individually contain an aggregate gross refund number, and refer to the number of sellers who would be responsible for the refunds.  To keep peace in the family, the Steering Committee recommends that individual sellers with refund responsibility NOT be named.  Since this testimony will not be admitted into evidence and will not be subject to cross, but will be placed in the record as an offer of proof, the Steering Committee believes that work papers need not be supplied.  So the identities of the first wave Ripple Claim respondents  need not be revealed under this approach.

Please be advised that Powerex intends to submit its Ripple Claim testimony  on the basis recommended by the Steering Committee.
