Great reading.  Sue, I would like to see the Supreme Court brief.  I imagine Jim would, too.

Subject: SECOND DRAFT OF TOMORROW'S COMMENTS
Importance: High


Attached for your review and comment is a second draft of tomorrow's comments on the Wood ACR.  I have added a significantly expanded section dealing with how the Commission's inaction and subsequent action contributed to the flow of customers back and forth between DA and bundled service.  My thanks to Aaron Thomas for his assistance on this section.
 
Also, I have deleted the "CYA - not the California Youth Authority" quip --  I had to have some fun while writing this on Halloween night!
