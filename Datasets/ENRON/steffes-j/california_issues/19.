The CEOs you contact may not know who their representatives are on the CMTA board, especially if the company is based outside California.  Word should be sent down from the top to these folks that direct access should be elevated within CMTA, as well as within other associations they belong to.
 
Key names at CMTA among the companies we discussed:
 
Marsha Kwalwasser, Northrup Grumman -- She's on the CMTA executive committee.  Her title is not listed.
 
Edward Munoz,  Raytheon, is a board member.  He is listed in the lobbyist directory as "regional director," with a contact number of (310) 847-6531.
 
Michael Jackson represents Boeing on the CMTA board.  His title and contact number are not listed.
 
FYI, Steve Chaudet from Lockheed Martin also sits on the executive committee.
