On Sept 20, the CPUC implemented a system average 1.46 cents per kwh rate increase for bundled service customers of SDG&E.  This is an interim increase specifically designed to alow SDG&E to provide funds to DWR.  

While DA is excluded from the increase, the PUC said it will revisit that issue if it finds that any services "funded by the DWR revenue requirement ... provide any benefit to direct access customers."  

The decision does not address other surcharge amounts necessary to maintain the small customer rate ceiling or large customer rate freeze (6.5 cents), or whether DA will help fund those additional amounts.

In the case, we had argued that DA should not have to pay either type of surcharge, so, so far so good.
