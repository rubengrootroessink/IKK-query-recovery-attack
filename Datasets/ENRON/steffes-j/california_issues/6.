Gordon:

Thank you for your message.   To respond to your voice mail - we left space for these costs from your model to be added to Sheet 2- Assumptions/Data (under "Other Costs").  A "Regulatory Costs" column can then be added to Sheets 6 and 7, to the right of "Above Market Costs", and the weighted average total can then be recalculated.  

Please let us know if you would like to set up a time to discuss any questions about our assumptions, probabilities, etc.  If you need further assistance with additional numbers, please contact Jim Steffes.

I am reattaching our model as I found a small mistake in the one I sent earlier today. 

Thanks, 

Jennifer

Please find attached a model showing the balances for other charges and CTC charges for QF's.  The QF numbers are from a report by MRW from last fall.  That those numbers should be reconsidered given the large changes in the QF contracts and in the change in market prices.

Please find attached the spreadsheet showing the values "TJOHNSONHISTORY" and the MRW report called "Final Report".  Please call me on my cell phone if you have any questions; the number is 503 720 0926.

Regards,
Gord
