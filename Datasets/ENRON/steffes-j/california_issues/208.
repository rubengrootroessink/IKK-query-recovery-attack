EES seems to want to go to court on the PX Credit -- I believe we need to follow the tariff FIRST.  That involves going to the utilities and then to the CPUC if we can't work it out. If we don't do that first, the court will throw us out and make us do than anyway-- and WHY make that play -- it just raises everyone's temperature and gets them into fighting mode right off the start. Jeanne Bennett agrees with this but Laboeuf is giving EES this recommendation.
