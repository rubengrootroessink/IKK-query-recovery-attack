I spoke to Robert Flemming who is Boeing's lobbyist.  He has been instructed
by his client to work on the issue so I told him he needs to have his client
contact the Administration directly and push for the September 1 date.  He
also indicated that he is going talk to Los Angeles area legislators who are
directly affected by Boeing's business and recommend that they push for a
date change.

I also spoke to Wal Mart's lobbyist Barry Brokaw.  Wal Mart has discussed
the issue with him but has not instructed him to work on it.  He can not
proceed until he receives direction from the client.
