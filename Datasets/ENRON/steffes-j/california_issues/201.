On August 10th, SCE filed a motion in Docket 98-07-006, et al (same docket
which they filed their petition to suspend payment of the PX credit) in
which they request resolution of direct access issues.  Specifically, SCE is
seeking resolution of the following issues:

(1) How should SCE calculate the direct access credit from January 19, 2001
forward?

(2) If schedule PE is adopted on an interim basis, what should replace the
PE credit on a going forward basis?

(3) Should direct access customers receive a credit for the one cent
surcharge?

(4) Should customers who switched or will switch from bundled service to DA
after DWR began procuring energy for bundled service customers be charged
for DWR costs?

(5) How would the transition costs, if any, that are the responsibility of
DA customers be determined in the absence of a transparent energy price?

SCE is asking that the commission expeditiously resolve these issues as part
of this proceeding.

We may want to chime in an support SCE on this.  Answers to the motion are
due on August 27th.

I do not have an e-mail version of the motion, but will fax it to anyone who
wants a copy.
