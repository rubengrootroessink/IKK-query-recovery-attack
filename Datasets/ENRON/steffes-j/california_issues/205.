ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

Below is the proposed "7/7" and early termination language for the current =
CA contract push.  Please review and provide me any feedback.  This languag=
e is the same as what we used in late June, with the exception that the ter=
mination date is 8-27 at 1:00 pm.  One concern I have that we need to work =
through:  In June our termination date was after the CPUC meeting but befor=
e the date we believed DA would end.  Recall that this changed upon the CPU=
C delay.  Here, it sounds like 8-23 is both the date of the meeting and the=
 date DA could end (in fact, it might even end as of some retroactive date)=
.  Thus, we have some increased risk that a regulator could decide that our=
 contract was not effective before the 23rd because of the termination righ=
t.=20

It is my understanding that we are pricing new CA deals off the master betw=
een now and 8-23, with the inclusion of this language.  There is a list of =
about 10 prospects that Lamar will be circulating later today. =20

Please send me any comments or questions.  MDS

TERMINATION FOR FAILURE TO OBTAIN DIRECT ACCESS SERVICE:=09Notwithstanding =
anything in the Agreement to the contrary, if, during the first 7 Business =
Days after this Transaction is effective, (i) we have not received notifica=
tion from the applicable Utility that a direct access service request submi=
tted by us with respect to any Account has been accepted by the Utility; or=
 (ii) a Change in Law occurs which prevents, or would be reasonably likely =
to prevent, us from transferring any Account to direct access service, we m=
ay terminate this Transaction as to any Account that we are unable to trans=
fer to direct access service.  Such termination will be effective immediate=
ly upon written notice to you, and neither Party shall incur any liability =
to the other Party as result of termination under this provision, including=
 the payment of an Early Termination Payment.  In the case of a termination=
 under this provision, any Account(s) so terminated will be deleted from Sc=
hedule 1, and this Transaction will remain in full force and effect for any=
 Account(s) not so terminated. We may elect to extend the 7 Business Day pe=
riod set forth above for up to an additional 7 Business Days upon written n=
otice to you within such initial 7 Business Day period. Any notice under th=
is provision shall be by facsimile or electronic mail and will be deemed to=
 be received when transmitted.=09
=09=09
EESI EARLY TERMINATION:=09Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the =
contrary, at any time during the period between the date this Transaction i=
s effective and 1:00 p.m., Central Time, on August 27, 2001, we may termina=
te this Transaction for any reason by written notice to you.  Such terminat=
ion will be effective immediately upon such written notice, and neither Par=
ty shall incur any liability to the other Party as a result of termination =
under this provision, including the payment of an Early Termination Payment=
.  Any notice provided under this provision shall be made by facsimile or e=
lectronic mail and shall be deemed received when transmitted.=09
