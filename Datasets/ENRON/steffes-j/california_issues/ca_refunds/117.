To  all parties that filed unredacted responsive testimony and exhibits  on
Tuesday, November 6, please forward electronic versions of the same to me  as
well as to Stan Berman at sberman@hewm.com.
We have both signed the  protective order on behalf of PG&E, and are
therefore eligible to receive  materials labeled "not available to
competitive duty personnel".
We  will only share these protected materials with other individuals who  have
also signed the protective order.
