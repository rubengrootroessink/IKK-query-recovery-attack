The Modesto Irrigation District would like to offer the  following issue as an additional issue to the list that Staff has  prepared:
 
1) Is the CAISO's data  for calculating the Mitigated Market Clearing Price in such a form that allows  other Market Participants to determine whether the Mitigated Market Clearing  Price was properly calculated?
 
Thank you for preparing  this list.
 
Sean Neal

Judge Birchman  asked me to send you his list of testimony he has.  (In other words,  if your testimony is not on there, heads up!)  In the interest of full  disclosure, here is our exchange of e-mails.  I sent a separate e-mail  saying that Avista is part of the Competitive Supplier Group that sponsored Dr.  Chicchetti.
