Subject:        Mirant Protected Materials 

As discussed on today's conference call, in an effort to satisfy the Presiding Judge's request to remove the protected status of materials, Mirant proposes the following action concerning exhibits it filed Nov. 6 pursuant to the protective order in the EL00-95 proceeding (namely, MIR-3 and MIR-4) :

Mirant proposes to formally withdraw its submission of the protected versions of Exhibits MIR-3 and MIR-4, leaving the redacted versions of these exhibits as the only versions of MIR-3 and MIR-4 in the record.  As noted on the conference call today, Mirant believes that the limited amount of material redacted from these exhibits (certain PPAs pursuant to which Mirant incurred emissions costs) is not relevant to the issues in this proceeding.

If any party objects to or has concerns about Mirant undertaking such action, please let me know no later than November 28, 2001 at noon, EST.

Thanks much, 

Jeffrey Jakubiak

Attorney for Mirant
