For the benefit of all concerned and listserv:
Williams testimony was  provided in a jumbled fashion in a large box which contains
(1) a cover letter  to the Secretary that mentions there is being  filed a redacted and unredacted version of Elliot's testimony
(2) the box provided to me has no confidentiality markings on it and simply  sasys Box 1 of 1;
(3) in the box is a CD with a label  that says exhibits to testimony  of Elliot and indicated those materials are protected--the CD was not mentioned  in the transmittal letter, so withut opening it, one does not know its contents;  
(4)also in the box, without any markings, tabbed items 1-21, attached to  that by a rubber band lare enghty spread sheets which on the first sheet  indicvated that sheet is protected, with remaining sheets covering heat  rate data, followed by another tab 17 with items A-F, none of which is labelled  as confidential, and a further rubber banded tabbed items A through  N.
 
None of this material except as noted is labelled confidential and it does  not appear that Eliiott's testimony and the required detailed narrative  sumary  is among the hard copy mmaterial described above.
 
If the Secretary received this pottage, I would be doubtful that its office  understood what is protected and what is not. 
 
Beyond that, the brief summary of the Heintz testimony is inadequate and  needs to be revised since it simply says he describes, explains, etc. without  providing the essence of the material or the material points.
 
In other words, the filing as it was provided to me is haphazard and a mess  and an explanation is in order togetether with proper provision tome of two  tabbed hard copies of any testimony Willimans wishes to sponsor and a clear  delineation of what is protected and what is not.  The same followup should  be made with the Secretary in the event that Williams wishes to comply with the  Protective Order and the Rules of Practice.
