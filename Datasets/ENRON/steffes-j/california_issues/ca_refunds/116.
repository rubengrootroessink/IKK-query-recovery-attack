All Parties:
 
Attached is the Responsive Testimony filed today at the FERC by the Imperial Irrigation District.  Only Exhibit No. IID-3 has been attached.  However, hard copies of the other exhibits, which are affidavits, have not been attached.  Rather, I have filed and mailed them to the Restrictive Service List.
 
If you have any questions or problems with any of the attached documents please give me a call.
