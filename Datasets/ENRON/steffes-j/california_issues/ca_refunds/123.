The California State Parties will endeavor to have a list of issues from  our perspective available soon.  We feel the need to be somewhat cautious  about presuming a question is properly in issue if it has one  supporter.

Just by way of a suggestion to make things a little bit more  organized for Judge Birchman's conference (and to respond to Joanne's inquiry  earlier today), how about if each group (or individual entity not filing as part  of a group) do the following:
1. prepare a one page outline (not a brief;  just an outline) of the issues that group had introduced in its testimony  (identifying the group and the witness for each such issue).  Later (but  not very much later) more details under each outline heading will get filled in  (by you) for the joint stipulation of issues.
2. put it on List Serv by  midday Friday
3. let's assume for this exercise that if you think it's an  issue, it is an issue; we can second guess one another later and refine the list  of issues when we get together.
4. someone who is public spirited can then  merge the lists into one editorially neutral outline.
Just a suggestion  and no response is needed.
