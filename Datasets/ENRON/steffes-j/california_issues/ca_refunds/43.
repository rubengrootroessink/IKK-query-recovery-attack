Staff is considering very broad categories (buckets) which  might contain the issues in this proceeding that we might agree to give Judge  Birchman.  Our list is attached.
Also, Judge Birchman will probably ask us about cross  examination times.  If possible, it would be wise to be prepared with a  time estimate, either as a single entity or as a member of a group.  If  that's not possible, if you could prepare a list of witnesses you are not  interested in crossing, that might give him some indication that the December  phase  of the hearing could fit within the allotted  time.
