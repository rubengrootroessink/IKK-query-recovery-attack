On behalf of Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. (AEPCO), we are
attempting to distribute our 11/06/01 testimony filing electronically as
well as by mail.

This is part 5 of 5, and it includes some of the spreadsheets, which have
not been compressed.  The specific exhibits are AEP-6, AEP-7, and AEP-9.

The filing consists almost entirely of protected materials and materials
that are not available to competitive duty personnel.  If you are an
unauthorized person who receives these materials, please destroy them and so
notify us.
