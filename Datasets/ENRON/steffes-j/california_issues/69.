Bob, how should we handle this?  Should Sue Mara, Jeane or I contact SCE concerning the late fees?

Diann -- properly disputed charges are not suppose to be subject to late
fees.

Jeane, I have evidence on some DA bills where SCE has assessed late fees on
disputed bills.  I haven't been able to do a thorough analysis, but knowing
the amount we have disputed so far, the charges could be substantial.

I understood that, until the CPUC makes a decision, the UDC can not charge
late fees on disputed bills.  Correct?
