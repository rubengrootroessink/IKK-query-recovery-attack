Will do.  P.S.  Mike Florio informs me that the order from the 9th Circuit
requires TURN to file papers with the District Court judge justifying their
request for a permanent stay within 5 days.  Following a hearing at some
unspecified time, the District Court judge will rule on that request.  If,
as expected, he denies the stay, TURN will get one more bit at the apple by
appealing that order to the 9th Circuit.  Needless to say, these
developments could deny Edison certainty regarding their precious settlement
for 2-6 months.  Mike Day

You should contact Lisa M. about the SCE meeting arrangements.  I will
be there in spirit only.
