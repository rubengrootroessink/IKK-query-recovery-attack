Mike - just a couple thoughts -

slide #1 - could reinforce the near certainty of DA ending July 1
                - regarding the SDGE rate freeze, we should see a proposed order today perhaps increasing the rate freeze from 6.5 cents to something like 9.5 cents, so sales folks will need to know that outcome.

Later in the package, where the product is described - how certain are we that "Enron's commodity price will beat the UDC generation component"?    Do we guarantee this or are we just claiming it will - and if so, based on what?

Jim Wood thought Legal might want to review this pitch book before it is sent to customers.
