Our power MTM on the bilateral power contract with EPMI is roughly $20mm.  =
I spoke with SCE's CFO Jim Scilacci regarding a margin call we have made un=
der the power contract.  He is meeting this morning with his outside counse=
l and EIX CFO Ted Craver to discuss the terms with which they are willing t=
o post margin.  He is supposed to call me at 2:00PM to discuss further.

I am working with Carol St. Clair and Elizabeth Sager in legal.

Bill

It looks like a proposed decision on the negative CTC issue will be deferre=
d.  We therefore have a window of time to make a deal with SCE on the money=
 it owes us before the PUC returns to the issue and once again contemplates=
 making a ruling that could jeopardize our negative CTC claim.  Mike Day, L=
isa and and I think we need a representative (or representatives) from Whol=
esale, PGE, and EES to form a "working group" to put together and to implem=
ent an SCE collection strategy.  This would involve claims of Portland Gene=
ral and EWS as well as the negative CTC claim.  The leverage we have now th=
at we may not have later is (1) support of SCE's MOU and advice letter and =
(2) the threat that we will put them into bankruptcy.  We may not be able t=
o get an agreement to a cash payment, but perhaps we could get acquiescence=
 in netting 100% of the negative CTC against customers' bills, dismissal of=
 the counterclaim, and other noncash value.  We are concerned that if we do=
 nothing the CPUC will eventually strip us of our right to collect this mon=
ey, and the court may defer to the Commission's "special expertise."  Comme=
nts?
