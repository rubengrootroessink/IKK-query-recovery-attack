 Attached is a preliminary draft of a motion to the Bankruptcy Court for relief from stay in connection with the commencement of proceedings at the PUC.  Please favor us with your comments at your earliest convenience.

Also, when convenient, Carl would like to schedule a conference call to further define this motion and the next steps.
