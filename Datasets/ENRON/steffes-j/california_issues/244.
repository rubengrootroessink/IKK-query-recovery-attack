Attached is the direct testimony of Richard Tabors, along with two exhibits.

Comments should be received no later than 3:00 PM EST on Sunday, August 26.  All comments and suggestions need to be in writing and can be faxed (not E-mailed) to Dan Watkiss at 202-857-2131.  Also, if your suggestion is a proposed addition, please write out the exact language you would propose we incorporate into the testimony and where you would place the addition.

One final note on a separate topic:
A number of parties have expressed concern about submitting work papers and other supporting evidence with respect to ripple claims.  The TFG Steering Committee has suggested to its members that ripple claim testimony contain aggregate refund numbers, instead of naming individual sellers, at this stage in the proceeding.  By filing supporting documents which identify specific sellers (even if made "confidential" under the protective order) for all our transactions in the refund exposure period, group members will essentially be releasing much of the information that was originally placed only in the hands of the Judge and FERC staff.  As noted in an earlier email, Dan Watkiss will be seeking approval of Judge Cintron to allow parties to file supporting evidence of ripple claims under seal to FERC staff and to the Judge.
