Jim--here is the relevant language.  Customer pays all "Special DA Charges."


"Special DA Charges" means any charges, fees, assessments, adders or surcharges imposed or authorized by any Governmental Authority on "direct access" customers (regardless of whether any such charge is also imposed on other classes or types of customers), however styled or payable, that are related to (i) a Utility's, ISO's or Governmental Authority's energy procurement, including, without limitation, charges for system reliability, rate recovery, future payback of under-collections, amortization of above market purchases and energy load repurchases; or (ii) public purpose programs, including, without limitation, environmental, social/low income, renewable energy utilization, and demand side management programs.  Such charges will apply regardless of whether the energy requirements of the Accounts are being supplied by us or the applicable Utility.
