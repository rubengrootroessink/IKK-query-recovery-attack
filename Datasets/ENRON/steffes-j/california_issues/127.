Harry and Jim,

I am back from vacation and am trying to get caught up. I understand that pretty much everything (both the Direct Access vote and the PX credit language)  at the CPUC has been postponed.  I wanted to make sure you and Jim stay in the loop re the calculations (as best as we can make) estimating the difference between Enron's recommended market rates vs. the utilities interim methodology for PX credits.  

Please read the e-mail below and call if you would like to discuss. 

Wanda

Michael - As a follow-up to our meeting several weeks ago, I have performed a rough calculation of the impact of PG&E and SCE's px calculation after Jan 18 as follows:

PG&E  $24.9MM
SCE     $34.6MM 

As we discussed, this would be incremental receivables from the utility if the CPUC agreed that the utilitities should have been using NP 15 and SP 15 rates for calculating PX credits.  Let me know if you'd like me to schedule a meeting to review these calculations and discuss next steps.  Thanks.
