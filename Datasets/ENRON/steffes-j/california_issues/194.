Here is the discovery we tried to send out last week.  The people on  the A list (attachment A) are the ones to whom the non-ISO discovery is  directed.
I've made all the changes to the e-mail list that I received this morning  --I think.  If you send names, please indicate whether they are destined  for the e-mail list or the restricted service list.  Although we have ended  up as custodians of both (at least until we file the request for a restricted  service list) we'd really like to avoid mixing up the names.
