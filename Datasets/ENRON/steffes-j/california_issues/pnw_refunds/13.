Under the ALJ's procedural schedule, the Joint Stipulation of Issues is due Thursday, August  14.  So far, we've only received comments from Cheryl Foley and Dan Adamson on the first draft that was circulated 8/9.

Please find attached a second draft.

Since "Joint" means all parties, we should circulate a draft among all the parties in EL01-10 no later than noon tomorrow (even though there's slim hope for agreement among all parties).

Accordingly, please provide your revisions and additions to the attached draft by 4:00 P.M. today.  We will make an effort to integrate all comments and prepare to forward the draft to other parties by noon tomorrow.

Please also advise if you think we need to have a conference call to discuss the draft before we transmit it to the other parties tomorrow.  If you think we need the conference call, we'll get one set up for 9:00 A.M. tomorrow.

Thanks.
