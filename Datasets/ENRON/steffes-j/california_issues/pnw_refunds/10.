Steve,
	I believe the data period is December 25-Jun. 20.  There are also
some preliminary deadlines about setting the parameters for the data, and
the stipulation for so called "Ripple" claims.  There are some specific
questions Steve that I think you could help on.  I will call you  directly.
Thanks
Gary

BPA and the munis should not be entitled to any refunds unless they
stipulate that they will pay refunds, if ordered to, and will not
dispute FERC's jurisdiction in this matter.  Otherwise, 5 out of the 6
parties below will get to have it both ways:  keeping the proceeds of
their sales but getting refunds on their purchases.  I would be
surprised if, at this point, any of the munis or BPA would concede
jurisdiction.---sch
