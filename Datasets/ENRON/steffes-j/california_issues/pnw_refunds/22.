This list is up to date with all the changes that Cheryl Foley has received as of the morning of 8/22/01.  It is on an MS Word document. Not everyone may need to have "internet" in front of each address.  I can copy and paste it into our e-mail system.

I believe the email list below is as accurate as one can be.  If you have
outlook I believe you can just drag and drop into your contact list.  If you
don't have outlook then, well, I don't know what to tell you  .  .  .
