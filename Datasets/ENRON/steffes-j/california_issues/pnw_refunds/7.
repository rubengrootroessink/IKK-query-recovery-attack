ALJ just issued her recommendation.  It's 270 pages long - but she finds the PNW is a competitive market, rates were not unjust and unreasonable, and that no refunds should be ordered.  She finds that spot sales consist of 24x24 and "within a month and balance of the month" transactions.  I'll draft a summary and circulate.
