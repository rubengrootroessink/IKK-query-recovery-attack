Please find attached a 3rd draft of the Joint Stipulation of Issues.  It attempts to reflect the comments of about 20 of the TFG's participants.

No one has requested a conference call.

Please keep in mind this is a DRAFT that will be circulated to all parties to EL01-10 tomorrow.  It will no doubt be subject to further negotiation.  While it is highly unlikely that all the parties will reach agreement on a Joint Stipulation by the due date on the procedural schedule(i.e., Thursday, August 16), we nevertheless should make an effort to get it out to the other parties as early as possible tomorrow.

Accordingly, please propose only those additional revisions that you feel are critical at this time.  If I have not heard from you by 10:00 a.m. EDT tomorrow, August 15, I will go ahead and serve the other parties with the document conspicuously marked "DRAFT".

(Don't you hate this process?)

Regards,

Patricia Fry Godley
