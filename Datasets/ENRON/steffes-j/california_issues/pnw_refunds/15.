There seems to be a fundamental issue which must be clarified among the TFG=
 if we are to keep this proceeding manageable, and I'm afraid that the draf=
t which has been circulated is heading in the wrong direction.  Portland Ge=
neral was of the opinion that ripple claims were to be deferred to a later =
date and not to be considered by the Judge at all in this phase of the proc=
eeding.  Given the issues in this case regarding unlawful retroactivity, di=
fferences between the California and PNW market structure, and an unduly sh=
ort timeframe in which to hold a hearing, there is no reason to start getti=
ng into the counter claim/cross claim morass unless and until the Judge and=
/or the Commission rules that refunds are required as a matter of law.  In =
that event, each member of the TFG (and for that matter, every party to the=
 proceeding) has to have fully reserved its rights to file counter and cros=
s-claims in order to seek compensation from any other party for liability w=
hich may have been ordered to the parties filing affirmative cases.

This approach does not mean that a party cannot defend itself in this phase=
 against another party who makes an affirmative claim against it in the ini=
tial round of testimony .  Such party should be able to defend against not =
only the specific price, volume, etc. of the claim, but also should be able=
 to respond with a counter-claim against the party initially claiming the r=
efund in order to ascertain the net refund, if any, due the proponent.  Cro=
ss-claims can be deferred and are not necessary at this point.

Limiting the first phase in this manner should allow a record to be develop=
ed as to the net amount of refunds potentially due to those filing an affir=
mative case, but need not, at this point, develop cross-claims or start up =
the next "ripple."

Avoiding ripple claims to the greatest extent possible in the first phase o=
f this proceeding would also answer the question of whether the parties cou=
ld try to expand the bases for refunds, since the Judge (and/or Commission)=
 would have already made rulings as to the definition of "spot market" and =
other parameters of a refund calculation.  We should be taking positions on=
 all of these market structure issues in the testimony and filings we make =
now, and the resulting decisions will guide further phases.

This was Portland General's understanding of what the ripple stipulation wa=
s intended to reflect.  PGE does not support an approach which would greatl=
y expand this phase of the proceeding to incorporate filings on ripple clai=
ms at the end of this month, and I'm not entirely sure that the current dra=
ft was intended to do that.  However, that is my reading of its effect.  Ar=
e others in agreement with the general approach outlined in this email or d=
o we need to schedule a quick conference call to discuss/confirm the  princ=
iples and details of how we go forward?
