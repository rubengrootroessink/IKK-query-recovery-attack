FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 21, 2001 CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 9=
73-5930   PG&E Asks Court to Require DWR to Hold a Public Hearing Before Ch=
arging $13 Billion in Power Contract Costs to California Consumers  San Fra=
ncisco - Pacific Gas and Electric Company today announced it is asking the =
Sacramento Superior Court to require the Department of Water Resources (DWR=
) to abide by state law and hold a public hearing before determining whethe=
r its $13 billion in power purchase contract costs are just and reasonable =
and should be charged to electric retail ratepayers. "There is evidence tha=
t DWR is attempting to overcharge electric customers in PG&E's service area=
 by over $1.4 billion in 2001 and 2002 alone, but DWR is refusing to hold a=
 hearing on whether its costs are reasonable and supportable," said Roger P=
eters, Pacific Gas and Electric Company's senior vice president and general=
 counsel. "DWR should not be given a blank check to pay for its high-priced=
 power contracts. The public needs to be able to review DWR's contracts and=
 hold them accountable for the billions of dollars they are spending."  Bas=
ed on limited information provided by DWR, PG&E's analysis indicates that D=
WR has padded its revenue requirement for 2001-2002 by more than $3 billion=
 due to overestimating the cost for spot power purchases and natural gas. A=
s a result, PG&E's customers would overpay over $1.4 billion in the next tw=
o years alone.  DWR determined that its revenue requirement was just and re=
asonable without providing any type of prior notice and without conducting =
a full and complete public review of its costs or revenue requirement.  Und=
er the California Administrative Procedure Act, Water Code, Public Utilitie=
s Code, and the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions,=
 DWR must hold a hearing to allow utility customers, consumer groups and al=
l other interested parties an opportunity to comment on the justness and re=
asonableness of their revenue demands. DWR's determination of its revenue r=
equirement must then be based on those comments and the overall evidence in=
 the record. Ultimately at stake are $68 billion of costs to utility custom=
ers over the next ten years under DWR contracts which have never been revie=
wed in a public hearing. This works out to an average of $6,800 for each of=
 the 10 million electric customers within the service areas of PG&E, Edison=
 and SDG&E. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, along with consumer groups an=
d other utility companies, has urged that DWR's revenue requirement receive=
 the appropriate level of public comment and review prior to adoption and i=
nclusion in rates. DWR has repeatedly refused the requests for additional i=
nformation and public hearings, saying it is exempt from any review by the =
public or the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) regarding the b=
asis or reasonableness of its request or costs.  The petition filed today r=
equests the court to order DWR to withdraw its determination that its reven=
ue requirement is just and reasonable until it complies with federal and st=
ate laws and holds a public hearing to determine if their power costs are "=
just and reasonable."  Pacific Gas and Electric Company understands the imp=
ortance of selling the revenue bonds and continues to want to work with all=
 parties to find a comprehensive solution.=09
