Jim:

The attached list contains information on approx. 180 of the largest
California-based companies.  The list also contains the names of individuals
with whom Ken Lay met in May 2001 to discuss the energy crisis.

Most of the companies on the attached list received a 2 mailings from Enron
earlier this year.  The first mailing provided general information about the
energy situation in California and the second mailing was about retention of
direct access.

The e-mail addresses for most CEO's or their executive assistants are
included on the attached list.

Please call if you have any questions.   I may be reached at 323/655-4660.
