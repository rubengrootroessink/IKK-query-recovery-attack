Latest word, as of 5 pm is that Commissioner Bilas has requested a hold on
the direct access suspension item, but that his office does not know why
Loretta Lynch indicated an intention to vote on the matter at her press
conference, and expects that there may be a vote to overturn the hold.  She
is suggesting that parties lobby Comm. Brown to support the hold--which is
the strategy that we have tried to put into effect.  We have not been able
to get any firm response from Brown's office.  We will continue our efforts
to support the hold and monitor the Commission meeting tomorrow and advise
of the result.  Mike Day

Subject: Potential Action Against CPUC RE: Retroactive Suspension of DA
Importance: High


I've asked Sue Mara to try and develop through AReM some form of legal
action that the industry could file if the CPUC goes through with its
current plans to retroactively suspend DA as of July 1.

Our goal should be to file tomorrow evening (assuming CPUC action).  To
make sure that we are on board, it probably makes sense to have a phone
call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon (1pm PST?).
I will leave it to Sue Mara to arrange with the people on this e-mail a
conference call to discuss the draft.

My choice would be to not have Enron file the paper, but rather work
through AReM.

Thanks,

Jim
