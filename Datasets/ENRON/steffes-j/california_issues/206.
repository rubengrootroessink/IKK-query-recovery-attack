I think this works... We've reserved one-page ads Monday in the LA Times, Sac Bee and SF Chronicle.

Janel and Karen,

Here's the draft ad.  Edelman is finishing up getting approvals from all the
organizations listed, so please don't send this anywhere as a final product
until we've talked.  Once you have approved the ad and the signatories are
finalized, the graphics firm will send the ad directly to the
papers--several of the papers have special digital software that must be
used when forwarding ads--email doesn't work.

In all cases the copy deadline is tomorrow morning (deadlines on the grid I
sent earlier)

Looking forward to talking with you.

Tracy
