Let's discuss how to proceed.  Should we ask MRW to do an updated analysis to get QF numbers?

Please find attached a model showing the balances for other charges and CTC charges for QF's.  The QF numbers are from a report by MRW from last fall.  That those numbers should be reconsidered given the large changes in the QF contracts and in the change in market prices.

Please find attached the spreadsheet showing the values "TJOHNSONHISTORY" and the MRW report called "Final Report".  Please call me on my cell phone if you have any questions; the number is 503 720 0926.

Regards,
Gord
