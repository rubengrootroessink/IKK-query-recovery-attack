Jim: I have put together a "slide" on what EOL is and isn't.   Mark Taylor did not want to include this in the response to FERC because it opens a can of worms, which I'm happy to discuss with you when you have a minute.  

Thanks for your comments.

Maggie, etal --

How about some slides --

1.	History of Trading  (where we've been where we're going)
2.	What EOL is and What EOL is not

Maggie -- I think these are good.  We still need to have info from economic sources on why the liquidity, tighter spreads = better market = better for consumers.  Sarah, we can use these for our background knowledge for Monday, but not to provide to FERC staff yet.  The slides can help formulate our responses to questions and when traders go to FERC.

OK- I turned the info into 2 slides because I haven't found a real clean way to illustrate liquidity or spreads.  I didn't think you wanted me to go into the three levels of efficiency theory.  And if you do, I have a paper on it at home.

I have a fragmented, 2-page brief overviewing EOL/electronic trading.  This may be useful to have internally & externally.  Perhaps Monday will offer more insight as to what aspects we should all be prepared for future questions.

I gotta run for now, but I'll touch base with you in the morning.
Maggy

Be sure to put the slides in notes view so you can read my suggested explanations.
