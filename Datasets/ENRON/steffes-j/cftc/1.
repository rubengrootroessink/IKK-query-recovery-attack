Jim - This is the issue that I left the v-mail on when you were in London. =
 I think that an internal group call is a great idea.  I will be on the cal=
l on Monday and plan to participate on Wednesday via conference call.   I c=
an be available to be in New York if necessary.=20

Ken Raisler, with Sullivan and Cromwell in New York, brought this to my att=
ention in late June.   Ken and I worked on the swap language as part of the=
 Commodities Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) last year and Linda Robertson=
 and Larry Decker worked on the issue from the Department of Treasury.
We have worked closely with Mark Taylor and his colleagues in legal on thes=
es issues.

I sat in on a call with the commercial team last week to see what sort of r=
etail swap products we would offer, if we decide to offer any.  Attached ar=
e their preliminary product offerings which are being reworked.

  =20

At the time the CFMA passage, Enron did not anticipate entering the retail =
swap market.  The issue of retail swaps was quite controversial and was one=
 of the primary issues that delayed passage of the CFMA.  Because of the co=
ntroversy, the final language in the Act requires the Commodity Futures Tra=
ding Commission (CFTC), the Board of the Governors fo the Federal Reserve, =
(the Fed), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Secretary =
of Treasury to study the issues associated with the offer and sale of retai=
l swap products and report no later than a year after passage ( by the end =
of 2001).  The request to interview Enron came from the CFTC.  On August 2,=
 2001 the CFTC, Fed, SEC, and Treasury (the FDIC and the Office of the Comp=
troller of the Currency will also participate) will interview 7 or 8 partie=
s at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   I know that ISDA and AIG have =
been requested to interview, and assume Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JP M=
organ are among the others.   We have agreed to the interview and understan=
d  the responses will be confidential.    I  will fax you the request lette=
r so you can see the questions that they want addressed.

CONCERNS:

1)  Likely the other entities that are being interviewed are regulated...we=
 must not say anything which would indicate that our current business needs=
 further regulation.
2)  We had a significant victory in the much lauded Swap exemption, which p=
rovides an exemption from the CEA for energy and metal swaps, except in cas=
es of fraud and manipulation.  I do NOT want to have to reopen the CEA with=
 amendments, because the current political environment could lead to a loss=
 of or meddling in the current exemption.
3)  I am concerned that any indication of offering retail swaps on EnronOnl=
ine, could lead to a greater interest in regulation of EnronOnline.
4)  Retail swaps will be regulated, likely by the CFTC.  Are we prepared to=
 enter a regulated business?  Is there regulatory creep into our existing b=
usiness?  Do we have other regulators take greater interest in Enron activi=
ties?  It may be too late for this last question.

Look forward to talking more about this.

CFTC Request for Information on Retail Swaps for Enron Direct Customers=09


Chris & Lisa --

EES has been requested by the CFTC to present at a closed-door session on t=
he matter of retail swaps for energy products to small customers (dry clean=
ers, etc.).  The meeting with the CFTC is scheduled to be on Aug 2.  Right =
now Scott Gahn (the head of Enron Direct USA) is scheduled to testify. =20

Vicki Sharp has scheduled some meetings prior to this to make sure that Enr=
on has its story straight.  The key question is whether or not Enron would =
accept "regulation" by the CFTC for purposes of swaps to these customers. =
=20

The first meeting would be a phone call on Monday at 10am (CST) to open dis=
cussions.  The second meeting would be a hands-on discussion on Wednesday b=
eginning at 8am (CST).  I think that both Lisa and Chris should attend both=
 meetings to make sure that we understand the politics and risks.  One key =
question is whether or not the CEA (as it currently stands) would allow thi=
s activity.

Please let me know if this works for everyone.

Jim
