Jim --

Please see attached from EPSA on their meeting today with Andy Black, Chairman Barton's chief energy adviser.  I have my own one-on-one with Andy at 4 pm tomorrow.  

Would you have a minute to read the EPSA memo and a list that Andy sent me (which I will forward separately) and we could chat about these issues tomorrow before the 4pm -- just so I have everything in perspective going into the meeting?

I am open to any time tomorrow except 10 am (EDT).  Please let me know.  Thanks.
