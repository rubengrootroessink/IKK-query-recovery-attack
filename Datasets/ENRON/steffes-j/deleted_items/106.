Luiz, Guille:

This is a quick note to let you know that David Gorte of RAC has agreed to provide us with their analyses and models for both Transredes and Elketro.  He advised that we contact Andre Canqucu at 3-5985 and seek his help.  I would like to emphasize that I specifically mentioned the models, and he specially agreed.  

Please advise if I could be of any help.
