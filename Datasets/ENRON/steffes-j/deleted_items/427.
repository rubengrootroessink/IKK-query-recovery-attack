Jim:

Thanks for getting people together. There are (at least) 3 things going on here:

1) Coordinate PG&E/SCE
2) Edison "meet and confer" (on Monday?  sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th.
3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder's coordinating.

2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov't affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.  No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.

We have a number yet for the call?

Best,
Jeff
