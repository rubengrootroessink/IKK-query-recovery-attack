Luiz, as discussed here is an update of what needs to be done to complete the paper.

1.  Need authorization to use Larry Ruff's expertise to check argument structure and provide affadavit.  Doug Gilbert Smith has agreed to pay for the use of Larry so I have left a message with Wes Coldwell (ext. 37249) who is the ENA accountant who will approve spending $5-10k.  He has not returned my call so call him tomorrow if i don't get a response today.
2.  If approved call Larry (415-440-0654 work or 415-602-7069 mobile) and send him paper tomorrow with a turn around of next Monday (close of business).  Give him an idea of expected cost.
3.  Paper needs a final redraft after Larry's comments are in.  You should read through and think about this now but get comments from Doug (Christi's changes have largely been accomodated).
4.  Final version sent to Doug for wider distribtution and use.

Give me a call with any queries.

regards
Mike
