I realize both of you are probably crazy busy, but I thought I'd drop a
line. I hope everything is going OK during the upheaval.

I have a very good argument (and paper by an academic) to send you regarding
market power analysis for the Enron-Dynegy merger approval process if you
are involved in all of that. Seems like the FERC is going to be trying very
hard to figure out how to do this.

All the best,

Seab
