I thought we could spend a few minutes at the end of Jim's call tomorrow talking about the recent filings in the Midwest.  There have been quite a few; I think they are trying to inundate us.  Perhaps we can discuss possible Enron participation and who will be taking the lead on the filings/developments.

Translink EC01-156	due 10/29  need protest
Are we lead with MW competitive coalition?  If so, need draft by early next week.

MISO and ARTO filed status reports on 10/11 and 10/10 respectively that claim the settlement and IRCA are working and both RTOs will be ready for business 12/15.  The status reports have not been noticed for comment and staff (per phone call) said they will not be.  We are not precluded from filing a response, but it was indicated that next week's FERC meeting may take action on the reports.
