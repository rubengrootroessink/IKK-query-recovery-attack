Bob,

	With the changes the past few weeks at Enron, our staff will be shrinking as business is adjusted to meet new realities.  As a result, I must resign as Vice Chairman of the Transmission Subcommittee and also as a member of the committee.  It would be unfair to NERC and to the subcommittee to continue as a subcommittee member when I know I will be unable to make future meetings because of competing work commitments.  I thank you for the opportunity to participate and to express my views.  Please extend my thanks to the members of the subcommittee for their courtesy and friendship.

Sincerely,

Steve Walton
