Thanks, Christi.  The FAQs on related party transactions are helpful for discussing the LJM situation, to the extent that people need to discuss it.  I'm hoping that we'll have some more general talking points on the business to give to people in our group in time for our call tomorrow afternoon.

I haven't looked at this yet, but may be helpful in developing responses to FERC/State/Congress, etc. questions.
