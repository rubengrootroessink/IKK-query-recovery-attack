You may want to communicate our trading and EES folks regarding a recent decision made by Texas Public Utility Commission to delay retail competition in Texas-SPP region. (Docket 24468)

"Based on the evidence and arguments presented regarding open access transmission tariff, pilot-project participation, wholesale and retail system readiness, and independence issues, the Commission finds that the area of Texas located within the SPP is unable to offer fair competition and reliable services to all customer classes on January 1, 2002" ...

.."the Comission is required to delay customer choice in this area" .." the pilot project will continue" ..

Also, " the Comission is initiating the Southwest Power Pool Market Readiness Implementation Project, number 24869".

Enron provided a testimony opposing any delay in retail competition. 

There is a similar docket discussing Texas-SERC (24469). No decision made so far.
