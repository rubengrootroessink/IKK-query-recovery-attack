Good idea to meet today.  SCE has changed their tone, and from what I understand has adopted an adversarial mode at CPUC (I have not seen any papers).  As well they are changing their take on the 3 cent/1 cent increase and pass thru to DA.  Our meeting with PG&E was favorable, but SCE is mucking it up.

Bob --

Where do we stand on the SCE stipulation?  I want to make sure that our push in SCE doesn't conflict or contradict something we are doing in the PG&E discussions.

Can we meet today?
