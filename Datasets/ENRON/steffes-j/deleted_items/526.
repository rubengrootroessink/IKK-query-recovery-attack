Hi Luiz -- Friday I saw an email from SPP about changes to SPP's credit policy.  Unfortunately, I cannot find the email now.  Can you check into this with SPP (maybe on the web page or you may have seen the email) and talk with Mike Carson, in trading, about what commercially would/may be impacted by any proposed changes.  For example, it may only deal with LT transmission, which we don't usually purchase.  If it involves a need for more credit assurance from Enron, please check with Bill Bradford's group (credit) and let Jim and Imr know. 
 
Also, Mike Roan is leaving Enron to go to AEP.  Mike will be in the office this coming week.  Can you talk with Mike and Kerry so you all have the complete download as to what is going on in the Midwest, both in MISO and Alliance (due dates for FERC filings, meetings, committees, etc.)  If Andy is in the office, please include him too.  
 
Thanks for your help Luiz and welcome to our new wholesale group!  Christi
