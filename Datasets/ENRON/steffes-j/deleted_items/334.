Jim,

I hadn't included you on the original distribution of this message and Alan thought you should have this.  Vince Kaminsky of Enron is one of the panelists and it may be good for you or someone from our group to be sure to speak with Vince before his appearance next month at the market monitoring conference.  we should especially fill him in on the CAISOs attitude toward markets.

Thanks,

Dave

To All,

Below is the announcement of a Market Monitoring workshop to be held in San Francisco on November 16.  There is a fee to attend of $50.00.  The scope of the meeting is to discuss market monitoring in the west.  The workshop is hosted by the CAISO and co-sponsored by RTO West and WestConnect.  I am planning on attending and I'm guessing Alan and Sue will want to attend as well.  You'll see on the agenda, that the friend of the market - Anjali Sheffrin is on the first panel, so expect an action packed day!  And our own Vince Kaminsky is on panel 3 (Christi, do you know Vince and should we check with him on any positions we have?).

Kind Regards,

Dave
