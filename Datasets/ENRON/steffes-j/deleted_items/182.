Jim:

On our conference call on Friday afternoon, we discussed contacting those people we knew of at that time to make contacts.  After we hung up from the call, we received the FERC notice, so now we know everyone on the panels.  We will go over the additional names, but if you know Peter Cramton and John Meyer (we did not have them on our preliminary list on Friday), would you like to contact them?  I know John Meyer from EPSA but I do not know Peter Cramton.  

We (the RTO Team) are circulating via email today our thoughts on issues that should be addressed in each panel (and the outcomes we want to see), and once we get that consolidated list put together, that will give us "talking points" to talk to the panelists about.

We also need to talk about coverage of the meetings.  Give me a call when you get a chance.

Sarah

Sarah --

Should we try and lobby any of these witnesses prior to next week?  I was thinking about John Meyer and Peter Cramton specifically.
