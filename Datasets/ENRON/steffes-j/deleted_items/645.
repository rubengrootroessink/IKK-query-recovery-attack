As a follow-up to conversations with the ISO, we propose the addition of the
following language to address our interests:

To the extent that evidence concerning any other additional sources of cost
recovery (other than emission allowances and fuel start-up costs) is not
considered in Phase I, it shall be submitted and considered in Phase II.

It would fit as an addition or footnote to the December 10, 2001 entry.
