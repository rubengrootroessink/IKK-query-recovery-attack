Jim-

I want to thank you for taking some time to speak with me this morning about my current position relative to Enron's market position.  More importantly, I want to thank you for your candor and honesty.  I walked away from the meeting feeling elated and confident, regardless of the bleak message.   

I only wish you the best of luck these next few weeks.  You are in a tough position, a position I do not envy.  I am heeding your advice and looking for opportunities outside this organization.  I had hoped to work in your group as an associate rotation.  I am certain that I could have learned a great deal from you and parlayed it into opportunities for this organization.  Maybe our paths will cross in the future. 

If there is anything I can do for you, please do not hesitate to contact me.  My cell phone number is 713.444.8282 and work extension is 51793.  

Yours Sincerely,

Amanda Day

PS.  Please forgive me for calling you "Jeff" earlier.  I did not realize my grave mistake until I hit the elevators.  At least you, hopefully, got a chuckle out of it.
