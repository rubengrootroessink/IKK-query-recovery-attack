Enclosed is the proposed revised procedural schedule.  Apparently my first attempt to send this last night failed.  Please review and contact me concerning any modifications that you feel are necessary by 1:00 p.m. EST today, so that it may be circulated to the Judge.  If you believe that the schedule is acceptable, there is no need to contact me.
