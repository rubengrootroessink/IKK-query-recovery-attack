Jim:

Thanks a lot.  The settlement impact has been partially included in the value report that was issued two weeks ago (from you and Rick to Steve).  Kathleen and I are preparing a one pager on this issue so that we can use it as a communication tool to ensure that billing in EES/URM are aware of this outcome and realizing its full benefit.

Shall keep you posted.

Good news on a dismal day... The New York State Public Service Commission today voted
to approve the joint settlement in the Central Hudson Rate Case.  See the attached press release.  Please contact me with any questions.
