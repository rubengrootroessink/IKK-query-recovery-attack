Hey buddie:  Just got into my email.  Let's discuss.  Not quite sure how this fits with filing an RCR per our discussion.  Either way is fine, but seems like we need to get coordinated.
 
Best,
Jeff

Jeff, 

Jim and I spoke today about having Enron participate separately in this proceeding -- responding to the utilities' plans to be filed today. I believe that AReM will take a strong position and will incorporate any comments we have.  I don't see anything we can gain by paying for a separate filing under Enron's name.  Jim agreed.  Jim asked that you call him if you have major concerns with this approach.
