Could staff please confirm from the Judge that filing  electronically with
the list serve will suffice for notice?
That depends on what you are noticing.    Discovery  is not to be filed with the Commission and the parties can agree to serve it  electronically.  
If something has to be filed with the Commission, it has to be  filed.  
If the filing is in a proceeding in which an ALJ has  instituted a restricted service list, service on that restricted service list is  enough.  
If the filing covers a bunch of dockets, some of which do not  have restricted service lists, or is going directly to the Commission,  you're stuck with serving the whole official (unrestricted) service list.   
Finally, (in my unofficial opinion)  as a practical matter,  considering the rate at which mail is moving around Washington, D.C. these days,  use of the listserv may be the only way to give timely notice, no matter what  the rules say. 
 
If you have a specific kind of notice in mind, I'll be glad to  pass it on to Judge Birchman (or you can send it to Bruce.Birchman@FERC.FED.US  with a  cc to the listserv, which is what I would do.)
