Thank you for thinking of Boston Pacific.  We will pull our thoughts
together and respond.  Also, I understand there will be a call with EPSA
about this effort on Tuesday at 2 p.m.

Craig --

As we discussed yesterday, we would be very interested in a memo
outlining a work product that would document the cost/benefit of RTOs.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me at
713-853-7673.

Thanks.

Jim
