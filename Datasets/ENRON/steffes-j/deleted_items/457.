In light of the Commission's September 26, 2001 Public Notice (on CIPS, no  docket number) stating that FERC has not been receiving mail since October 24,  2001, and the fact that a lot of other mail service has been intermittent, one  of the parties asked if responses to your October 26, 2001 order in this  proceeding could be served on listserv rather than by mail.  
If you hit reply all, it should go to all the parties on the  listserv.
