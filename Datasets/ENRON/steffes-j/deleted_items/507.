PJM has received a number of inquiries as to whether PJM is currently infected
with a computer virus.  We are not.  PJM maintains a very high level of
vigilance against external threats to our computing environment and works
diligently to maintain the integrity of our networks and systems.

We understand that resending duplicate emails is both annoying and inconvenient
to our customers, and we apologize. We appreciate your patience.
