Hi Jim-
 
Will be back first thing Monday AM and will come up then...I came up b/f I left and saw some piles, but I didn't want to rifle through everyone's stuff.  
 
Thanks,
Suzanne

Suzanne -- 

When you get back from the Holidays, please stop by 47 and help go through the Gas cases Becky had intervened in.  

Thanks, 

Jim
