I am going to start periodically attending the SE power origination weekly meetings.  Mike attends the Midwest origination meetings and I have gotten very positive feedback from the originators.  I'll find out what the Services group and Northeast origination has in the form of regular meetings.  Are there any that we should attend for EES?  Let me know if I should ask them.
