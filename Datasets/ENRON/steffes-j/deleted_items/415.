Colleagues:

	We wish to introduce our firm's new website: www.hemplinglaw.com.
On the website you will find:

*	resources for practitioners of regulatory law.
*	information on the Firm 's courses and books on electricity law.
*	a description of the Firm's experiences, services, and professional
personnel.
*	lists of the testimony, appearances, and publications of firm
professionals.
*	notices of employment opportunities at the Firm.

	The resources available on the site include key regulatory statutes,
cases and regulatory decisions; helpful articles from leaders in the field;
glossaries, web links, and other documents related to breaking events in the
field.  Also available are the tables of contents of the Firm's books on
electricity law.

	The Law Offices of Scott Hempling advises and represents clients
before federal commissions, state commissions, state legislatures and state
and federal courts.  The Firm has managed adjudicative and rulemaking
proceedings on behalf of state regulatory proceedings, and represented
clients in the same fora.  In addition to our work on behalf of over 20
state agencies or legislatures, we have advised municipally owned electric
systems, investor-owned utilities and organizations of consumer advocates
and independent electricity generators in their own restructuring strategies
and on litigation before regulatory fora and state and federal appellate
courts.
