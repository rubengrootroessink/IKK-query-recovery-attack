As far as Reliant / Mirant goes, they've pretty well covered the bases.  A simple intervention would cost virtually nothing.  A short intervention in support gets up there pretty quickly at Bracewell- about $5k- which, however, could probably be split 50-50 with Coral.
Let's discuss the CAISO filing; I thought we had decided to go with IEP but let's consider.  I talked to Erin Perrigo at EPSA and she will touch base with Julie Simon to determine whether they have plans.  Ray

I just learned that FERC has noticed both of these filings and comments are due on Monday.

We need to intervene in both at a minimum.  IEP will be filing comments but we must determine whether separate EPMI comments will also be needed.
