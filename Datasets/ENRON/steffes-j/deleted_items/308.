Thane's 3 year old daughter is now in a body cast for 6 weeks, but the wonderful news is that the problem was a non-malignant cyst that weakened her leg causing the break.  The doctor told them that having her break it naturally is actually better than the planned surgury that was going to drain it because the leg will be stronger.
