EES was recently assessed $147,000 by the Pennsylvania PUC as a method of r=
ecovering their costs.  Enron's local PA attorney, Kevin Moody of Wolf, Blo=
ck, Schorr and Solis-Cohen LLP, notified us that he has taken the lead for =
a group of natural gas suppliers to challenge the assessments and inquired =
if Enron wanted to be a part of the group.  The group includes IOGA (an ass=
ociation of oil & gas suppliers in PA), TXU, Hess, New Power, and 4 others.=
  Moody successfully got a postponement of the payments until Oct 16.  EES =
is included in the postponement at this time.  The options are to litigate =
the assessment (Moody feels we are on solid ground to prevail) or to negoti=
ate a settlement with the PUC where we agree to some assessment to be deter=
mined.  Litigating the assessment could cost about $50K - $60K (in addition=
 to the $25K to date) whereas settling would obviously be less expensive in=
itially but would provide an assessment for each year going forward.  Moody=
 id meeting with the PA PUC this Friday to determine what would be the best=
 way to proceed (he is hoping to convince them that the statute is quite cl=
ear that they cannot make the assessment and that they withdraw it).  We wi=
ll have a better grasp of the situation and clearer path for the direction =
we should pursue after that meeting.  I will keep you informed. =20
