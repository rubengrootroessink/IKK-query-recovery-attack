Margaret Morgan gave me a second name, Elliot Roseman.  He was with Price Waterhouse but was let go in a round of layoffs recently, but Margaret says he is a good, pro RTO investment type.  I have spoken with him and sent his information, along with a couple of articles that he has written, to Kevin.
