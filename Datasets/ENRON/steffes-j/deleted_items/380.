We are certainly two different companies.  At first blush, the stable cash flow from the utility business is certainly a good thing.  A foothold in PJM may also be beneficial.  Combined market cap would be about $25 million--debt-to-cap still high, offset by more stable cash flows.  EXC's ROA and ROE appears much stronger.  More later....

Did you get the chance to look at the combined company?  Just interested.  

Thanks
