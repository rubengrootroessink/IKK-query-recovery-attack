Phil-
I've been informed by my client that the disk that was mailed to Idacorp (and presumably to many others) on October 11, titled Settlement Manual Adjustments IE, UE & AS, is not usable.  The disk contains approximately
3.4 million records and is comma delimited.  The problem, I am told, is that the ADJ_COMMENTS field contains commas, which shifts the fields containing comments one column to the right causing the resulting array to be unusable.  I am told that the ISO can remedy this problem if the ISO sends the same data, but with the ADJ_COMMENTS field on the end, so that it won't matter if it uses the field to the right of it.  Please see the attached data sample.

Please advise if there is any reason to believe this cannot or will not be corrected in very short order and how long short order will take.

Thanks for your attention to this.
Lawrence Acker
