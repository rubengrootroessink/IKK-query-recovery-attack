Mark Bruce, Policy Analyst, Electric Resturcturing Legislative Oversight Committee, attended the October 25th RMS meeting.  When he left, he gave me his card and asked me to contact him after the meeting, which I did.  He asked that I forward my contact information and asked if I could be available to attend the Legislative Oversight Committee meeting on Friday, November 2nd.  This is the email that I received from him after I sent my contact information.  He has not elaborated on exactly what questions he has or would have for me.
