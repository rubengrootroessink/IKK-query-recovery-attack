We got a good bit of support in the comments, if that's what you mean by winning.  All the marketers objected to the increase in pooling areas, and the SoCalGas proposal did not rule out keeping the current pools.  A different group of commenters called for demand charge credits, and there was some support expressed for requiring capacity turnback.

Are we winning?  Any movement on our issues?
