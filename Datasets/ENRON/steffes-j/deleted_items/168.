Robert - Please send me your monthly EES/ENA update for October.  I have attached your report for September, so it should be easy to just modify what you have there, or add any new activities you may be involved in.  Your report is part of a larger report that Jim Steffes reviews at the beginning of every month.

 

Thank you for your help,
If you have any questions, please call me at 713-345-2430.

Bryan
