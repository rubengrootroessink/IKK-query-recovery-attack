CEUs: 1.9
Course Number: EN02040
REGISTER NOW! <../../register/index.cfm?course_num=288&course_type=short> 
Course Description: 
Course Objective 

Participants who attend this course will be able to understand more fully the technical issues in operation and planning of electric power systems, particularly relating to deregulation, open access, and competition. The emphasis in this course will be placed on providing a working understanding of electric power to legal and regulatory professionals, without requiring a technical or math background. Participants will more fully understand the results of software tools such as power flow and will use power flow software to analyze example systems. 
The course will consist of approximately 17 hours of lecture and 3 hours of laboratory. The educational materials used in this course will consist of copies of PowerPoint presentations reproduced and bound in a three-ring binder.
