Mike/Chris: 
So far, our research only shows 1/3/01 OOM transactions with TID ( on that 
date you should have received 175 MW of OOM at $250 throughout the day per 
attached spreadsheet).  We see no other OOM transactions for the additional 
Trade Dates you have listed on your spreadsheet.  The next step would be to 
get the specifics on the OOM purchases.  Was it with ISO or CERS?   Do you 
have transcripts of OOM calls?

Mike and Chris: 
The original Market Invoice for January, 2001 transactions was faxed to 
Leslie B. at 209-656-2147 on March 27, 2001. 
I am researching some of these transactions to see if I can get specific 
data breakdown on the charges.  Do you have the hours for these transactions 
for each day?
