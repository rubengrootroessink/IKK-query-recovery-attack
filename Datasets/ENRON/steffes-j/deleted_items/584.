Will do. I'll send you the article (by an academic who works with us
occasionally) and a short summary of why I think it might be relevant to
your current merger issues.

Speak to you soon.

Please send it...I'm going to be intimately involved in the regulatory
approvals process. Thanks. I'll give you a call early next week to
discuss.

I realize both of you are probably crazy busy, but I thought I'd drop a
line. I hope everything is going OK during the upheaval.

I have a very good argument (and paper by an academic) to send you
regarding
market power analysis for the Enron-Dynegy merger approval process if
you
are involved in all of that. Seems like the FERC is going to be trying
very
hard to figure out how to do this.

All the best,

Seab
