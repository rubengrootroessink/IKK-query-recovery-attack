As Mr. Acker pointed out, there is, indeed, an error in the formatting of the data included on the Manual Adjustments disc distributed  to parties by the ISO on October 11, 2001.  The ISO is aware of the problem and is presently working to produce new discs.  They should be ready for distribution via fed-ex by Wednesday or Thursday at the latest.
