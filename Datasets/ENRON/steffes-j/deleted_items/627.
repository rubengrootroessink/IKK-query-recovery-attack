Vernon  believes that the issue of whether purchase power/transmission costs and similar  costs should offset any refunds alleged owed to purchasers should be expressly  made an Issue II/III testimony issue (i.e., January 2001 filing date) in  the procedural schedule in this proceeding--to the extent these issues are  properly in this proceeding under the Commission's order herein this docket so  far in any event.  Vernon obviously has a direct interest in these issues.  See Vernon last request for rehearing.
 
Vernon  believes that the Presiding Judge was quite clear on this at the 11/6  conference.  Moreover, Vernon would not consider this a change in view by  His Honor nor a change in the existing procedural schedule.  Nevertheless,  Vernon believes that the new version of the procedural schedule should spell out  the Issue II/III treatment.
 
Thanks,
 
Channing

Some of us,  particularly in the non-public utility group, submitted testimony on 11/6  regarding other additional sources of cost recovery, and others may have been  planning to submit such testimony in Phase II.  To the extent such  testimony is not considered in Phase I as a result of the Judge's change of  view or otherwise, the matter should be reflected in the revised procedural  schedule (as indeed it was in the two September procedural  schedules).
