Charles:

Just a quick note to let you know that I am finding ERCOT considerably more difficult than NYISO in its structure and details to provide ancillary services.  I am putting more resources for the summary, but it is a steeper curve than what I have expected.  

As I do not have to complete the summary sequentially,   it might be a good idea to discuss the sequence of coverage that will help you most.

I shall.  All primary documents for AS in ERCOT are already available, and I shall take it from there.

It would be useful to note any "bandwidth" or ranges in which services such as hourly energy imbalance service would apply.

Charles:

Using the structure for the attached report for NYISO, Brian and I shall start on preparing you an identical document for ancillary services in ERCOT. I expect to complete it by the end of this coming week.

 I can accommodate your suggested changes easily, so please feel free to comment on its content/and structure.  

Best regards
