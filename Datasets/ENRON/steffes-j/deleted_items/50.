Parties: 
On October 12, the ISO notified the parties through Listserv that Ean O'Neill would be available on October 22 and 23 in Folsom, California, should any party desire to depose her on matters relevant to her testimony filed on October 9.  Because no party has indicated a desire to depose Ms. O'Neill at that time, the ISO no longer intends to hold her available.  The depositions of Dr. Hildebrandt and Messrs. Rothleder and Detmers will go forward during the week of October 22 as noted in the ISO's posting of October 12 and as subsequently noticed by certain sellers.  If anyone has any questions, please contact Phil Jordan immediately at (202) 424-7757.
