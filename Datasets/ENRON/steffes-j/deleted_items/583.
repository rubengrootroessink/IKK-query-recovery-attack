I was thinking about what to get Dad for Christmas and I think what he would like most is a family portrait.

Joan has talked to Leigh-Leigh Baillio about taking pictures of the family. The sitting fee is $85 (if other family units want pictures it would be an additional $20 per family plus the cost of film). The cost per picture varies by the size and quantity ordered. Joan is getting actual prices from Leigh-Leigh. As a rough estimate, Joan spent about $300 on three 8x10's plus some smaller prints.

I thought we could take the portrait after Jim & Marianna's second baby is born . . . maybe the weekend of her baptism? . . . so there wouldn't be any actual money paid until the Spring. If that's a problem, instead of a Christmas present, we could give him the portrait for a combination father's day/birthday present.

I'm headed to Houston right now. Call me at mom's or we can talk about it at John's house on Wednesday.
