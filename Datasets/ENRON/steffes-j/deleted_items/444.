I just wanted to let you know that I called Jean but she is out of the office meeting with the Governor and then she is flying to Houston.  I did leave her a lengthy message and asked her to contact me as soon as possible.  I am in my office today and will be leaving tomorrow at 7:30 a.m. to make my way to Austin.  Thanks.
