Jim

Hope you are well - all things considered.  I understand you are the Enron
person dealing with many of the state issues at this point.  I write to
inquire about Enron's current status/plans with respect to PJM and ERCOT.

As you know, NewPower is denied a membership in each because of its
affiliation with Enron.  Because Enron has been absent at the last couple
of meetings of each, a vote has been lost.  I guess I have 2 questions:
   do you know what Enron plans to do with its membership in each?  If you
   know you are going to relinquish your membership, would you please let
   us know so we can change our status?
   If you have no current plans to relinquish your memberships, would you
   consider giving us your proxy so the vote does not go wasted?  We
   believe such an action is "within the normal course of business" and
   would not require prior approval by the bankruptcy court.
I know these are trying times, Jim, and it is not my wish to present you
with difficult tasks here.  I just hate that a valuable vote is going
unused because of this circumstance.

Give my best to your family.

Kathleen
