I disagree with your conclusion, but we can talk about it before you go to DC.  What time are you free later today?

Janel --
 
Let's talk about this before it goes out - not sure that I like the use of "security" with energy supply - sounds like we support ANWR drilling.

Jim and John,
 
This is NOT a final version, so I am distributing it only to the two of you in preparation of next week's hearing.  The only obstacle to this being final is a citation on page 4 that we're trying to track down.  Otherwise it's done.  Once I get the citation I will distribute to everyone.
 
I hope it helps.
