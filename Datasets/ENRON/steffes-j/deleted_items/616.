Some of us,  particularly in the non-public utility group, submitted testimony on 11/6  regarding other additional sources of cost recovery, and others may have been  planning to submit such testimony in Phase II.  To the extent such  testimony is not considered in Phase I as a result of the Judge's change of view  or otherwise, the matter should be reflected in the revised procedural  schedule (as indeed it was in the two September procedural  schedules).

Enclosed is the proposed revised procedural  schedule.  Apparently my first attempt to send this last night  failed.  Please review and contact me concerning any modifications that  you feel are necessary by 1:00 p.m. EST today, so that it may be circulated to  the Judge.  If you believe that the schedule is acceptable, there is no  need to contact me.
