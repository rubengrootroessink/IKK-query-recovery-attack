Attached are summarized the main recommendations of the distco of the future paper and  their impact.
Most recommendations would have a positive impact on competition. However, some recommendations could be potentially dangerous. Besides, it does not have a clear position regarding unbundling: it opens too many unbundling possibilities and discards the extreme, and more effective (divestiture).
I will work on the default supplier paper today.
