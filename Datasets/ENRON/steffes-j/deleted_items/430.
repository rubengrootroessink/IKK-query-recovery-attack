Parties: 
As indicated in an earlier email to listserv, please be aware that Coral Power will depose Ean O'Neill of the ISO tommorow (Tuesday, October 30th) at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time.  However, pursuant to an agreement reached between the ISO and Coral, the depositions of Boyd Busker, George Black, and Bob Sullivan, originally noticed for October 31st, will not take place.
Ms. O'Neill's deposition will take place at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, California.  As was the case previously, the reporting service will be Esquire Deposition Services in Sacramento, CA (916-448-0505); parties should make their own arrangements for transcripts.  
If parties have any questions concerning Ms. O'Neill's deposition, please contact either Gene Waas at (916) 608-7049 or myself at (202) 295-8465.
