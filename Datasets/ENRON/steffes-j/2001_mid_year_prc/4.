Jean-

As we discussed, Stan Nelson of the Enron Transportation Services Group has=
 concerns regarding HB 1148 (Relating to the notice of proposed constructio=
n for certain wireless communication facilities) and HB 1492 (Relating to n=
otice and marking requirements for certain antenna structures).  Stan feels=
 that if HB 1148 becomes law our tower and radio sites would need contant a=
dministrative and legal attention to stay in compliance with the rules.  He=
 feels that this bill is far more costly and burdensome to Enron than the c=
urrent Federal Regulations.  Stan also feels that if HB 1492 becomes law th=
en the State of Texas could force us (Enron)  to go beyond the Federal Regu=
lations (47 C. F. R. Part 17) by requiring us (Enron) to adopt more stringe=
nt standards for all antenna structures less than 200 feet. The current Fed=
eral Regulations that are in place relate solely to antenna structures that=
 are greater than 200 feet and/or fall within the glide slope curves of air=
ports or other aviation type facilities.

As a side note, I sent a copy of these two bills along with Stan's analysis=
 to Scott Bolton and Sue Nord on Monday of this week and I have not gotten =
any response from either of them.

If you look below you will find: a copy of the most recent bill, a full his=
tory, and a Word document from Stan Nelson where he explains in detail the =
effects of these two Bills (HB 1148 and HB 1492) on Enron.
