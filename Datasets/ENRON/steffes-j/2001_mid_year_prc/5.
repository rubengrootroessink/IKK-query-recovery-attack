Jim,

Sorry that it has been so difficult to connect.  I did, however, want to share with you my brief, but extremely good, work experience with Chad Landry. 

Chad joined Enron Investment Partners a couple of weeks ago.  During his first week, he became an immediate contributor to the group by picking up the analyitical and modelling tasks needed to support a pending decision concerning an existing portfolio company.  He very promptly gathered the necessary info and completed a model that was thoughtfully constructed and accurate.  He is clearly a self starter and demonstrated a good udnerstanding of finance fundamentals.  When he had questions or needed help, he asked for it.  I encourgage this, particularly when there is a tight timeframe, so that valuable time is not lost.  Chad has demonstrated a real interest in his work and commitment to excellence.  

I wanted to to have these data points in preparation for the upcoming PRC meeting.  Please let me know if you have any questions or would like any additional information.

Thanks,
Barbara Paige
