FYI.  The following language mirrors that which was used in the Sierra/PGE transaction.  Recall that FERC approved the transaction in an order issued last January/February.  

In short, we don't have an RTO/loss of market-based ratemaking authority issue.  

(1)	PGE/NNG will make an RTO commitment; and 
(2) 	In any event, FERC counsel informs us that FERC is unlikely to declare that we are an affiliate.

Paul, per my voicemail, OK to use RTO language like this:

NW Natural affirms PGE's comittment to a regional transmission organization
(RTO) as soon as it is formed with BPA as a member.  NW Natural and PGE's
preference is for the RTO to be a "for profit" entity.
