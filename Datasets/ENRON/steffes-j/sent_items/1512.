We looked at this data and found that if you look at it on a percentage basis you are skewing the story. I explained to her in an email what we did and what our positions had been (generally) so they should put two and two together. This is a mute point at this stage as we no longer exist.

I told them that if they have specific questions then we would be more than happy to answer them.

Thanks,

Doug

Doug --

The PUCT called out of the blue and indicate that they would like to talk with you about this information.  Have they communicated with you about this?

This is the load schedule data that the PUC Market Oversight Division
analyzed concering overscheduling of load in August of this year and that we
would like to discuss with the ENRON QSE.
