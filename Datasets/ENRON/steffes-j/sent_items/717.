FYI,  here is the restricted service list as of the afternoon of August 18,  2001.  You will note that, although I have left phone, fax, and e-mail in  the listing, I have been completely and impartially ruthless in paring everybody  down to two (2) names per party.  There's no other way to get this   mailing list into manageable size. Where I had to choose between two names, I  generally took the first one.  If there is someone else who should be  substituted (e.g. because he or she is apt to be more prompt about making copies  and distributing them around the office) please let me know who to  substitute.  I'm hoping to file this with Judge Birchman on Monday.
