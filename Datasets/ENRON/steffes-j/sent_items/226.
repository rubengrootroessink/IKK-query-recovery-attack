FYI.  The Harvard Electricity Policy Group maintains a web page with recent
papers on "Standard Market Design" for restructured electricity
markets.  You can reach this page at:

http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/hepg/standard_mkt_dsgn.htm

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has announced plans for a
rulemaking proceeding on a standard market design.  You may find these
papers of use.

If you have or know of other papers or links that might be included, please
let us know.
