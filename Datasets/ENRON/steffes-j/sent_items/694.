Thane --

You are probably already aware but if not, Enron holds an interest in Project Cornhusker (a QF in Cleburne).  There are some issues that may develop with the plant related to its ability or inability to meet specific ERCOT guidelines.  Generation Investments is managing this asset and relations with Brazos Co-op. Their primary concern is that Mirant is Brazos Co-op's QSE and may be interested in playing games with the plant through modification of ERCOT rules. 

Please coordinate with Jean and decide who will call either Rick Hill or Chuck Ward.

Thanks,

Jim
