Subject:	Mirant Cost/benefit studies

Mirant is proposing to complete a study of the costs and benefits of a Midwest RTO.  They filed a similar study for the Northeast and Chairman Pat Wood commented at the recent FERC meeting that it was very useful and that further studies should be done.  Mirant is presenting its study in a public meeting at the Commission on Thursday.  

The MW study is expected to cost approximtely $75,000 and Jim Mayhew of Mirant has asked for other marketers/gens to join in the study - both put their name on it and pay for a portion of the costs.  Is this something that we would be interested in participating in?
