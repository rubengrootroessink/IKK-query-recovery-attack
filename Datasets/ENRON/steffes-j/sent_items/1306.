I agree we need to do it.  You may want to ask Boston Pacific to include an analysis of the savings associated with reduction in capacity reserves ( reductions due to increased load diversity, increased reserve sharing and reduced operating reserves to meet NERC criteria).  Some of these savings should be immediate and some should occur over the next few years from decreased need for capacity additions.  I'm not sure whether someone has done this type of analysis before for one of the RTOs, but Christi has talked about some of this and may know.

I would say we go ahead and support this.  I am guessing that 4 other companies would join = $60k for Enron.  What do you think?  I want to get back with Julie by next Tuesday - I'll submit an RCR for discussions.
