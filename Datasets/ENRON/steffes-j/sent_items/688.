FYI in case someone wants to attend (maybe to get some customers?).  I am not sure why it is called "Gas Cost Stabilization" (unless that refers to a producer buying a hedge) since some volatility sends necessary price signals.

The American Gas Association will host a Gas Cost Stabilization Seminar
on September 20-21, 2001 at AGA, 400 N. Capitol St. NW, Washington, DC.
Attendees at this day-and-a-half meeting will learn what caused recent
volatility in natural gas prices and how risk-management tools can
mitigate gas cost volatility.  Speakers will discuss the risks and
rewards of various cost-stabilization techniques.  Regulators and
industry experts will debate regulatory philosophies and practices
regarding volatility mitigation strategies.  The seminar will appeal to
regulators, energy service consultants and lawyers, financial and
investment professionals, supply planners, and gas utility rate and
regulatory experts. Seats are limited.  Please see the attached agenda
and registration materials for fees, hotel arrangements and additional
information.  We look forward to seeing you at this important event.
