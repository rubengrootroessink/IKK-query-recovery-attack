I think a few people in our group who should attend have a conflict at that time.  Can I have my ass't, Marcy, work with your ass't to figure something out?

Thanks for taking the time to meet with us the other day.  Jim,  I wanted to see when you might have some time to get back together with more members of our group to dig deeper into the regulatory issues facing our power market?  

Please let me know and we'll set something up.
