I understand that you have talked to Melinda about her leaving to go to EES.  Did you and she agree that she could go down and work with them part of the day until she is officially transferred?  She has spent about 3 hours down there so far today and was gone about the same yesterday.  

I didn't want to say anything to her if you had already told her it was okay.
