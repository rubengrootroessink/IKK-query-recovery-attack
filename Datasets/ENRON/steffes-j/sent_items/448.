Ray - it seems highly likely the court will allow FERC to proceed w/ rehear=
ing.  In any case, I doubt an adverse ruling would affect the PNW case as t=
he 7/25 order simply announced the new proceeding. =20

OK, here are the facts as I understand them:  The CPUC filed petitions for =
review of the FERC's various refund orders in the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap=
peals. There is an unresolved jurisdictional issue that the petitions filed=
 in the Ninth Circuit are incurably premature because they sought review of=
 orders for which the petitioner was also requesting rehearing.  The curren=
t status of the CPUC's Ninth Circuit petitions is that the court has not ye=
t dismissed the petitions as premature and FERC must file the record in the=
 Ninth tomorrow, October 26.  At that point, under Section 313 of the Feder=
al Power Act, the jurisdiction of the court of appeals becomes exclusive, a=
nd  FERC will not be able to modify the orders under review except by leave=
 of the court.  FERC has filed, and the CPUC is supporting, a motion for an=
 order permitting FERC to keep jurisdiction over its orders so that it can =
act on the pending rehearing requests.  By all rights, the court should go =
along with this, but it's gone on this long.  We are not adversely impacted=
.  Arguably if FERC loses jurisdiction, the PNW and CA refund cases should =
come to a complete stop, although this is an unlikely scenario.  I will kee=
p you posted of new developments.  Ray
