Mark

Here is a document Enron has prepared that describes what we want to see in a wholesale electric Standards Setting Organization (SSO).

I hope you will be able to consider these points for the letter you will be drafting from EPSA to the NERC Board of Trustees. 

Please do not distribute this until Jose Bestard, as member of the Stakeholder Committee, has had an opportunity to convey this to Mike Gent.

Thanks
Charles
