Schriver --

No big deal.  Next time I'm in town I'll give you a little more notice.  

Hope things are going well at State - for what it's worth, I think it would be a total mistake for America to stop our hunt for Osama during the Muslim religious month...I don't think the grieving families in NYC and around the Pentagon are going to stop their mourning for their loved ones during that timeframe.  Just one opinion out of millions.

Take care,

Jim

Sorry I missed you last night.  I was running about half an hour late, then
arrived only to circle around for another 30 minutes looking for parking.
Unfortunately, I had accidentally left your phone number on a slip of paper
at work.

In any event, sorry again to miss your visit.  Hope to see you the next time
you swing through town,

Randy
