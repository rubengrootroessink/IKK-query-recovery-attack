Before we take this on, let's talk about how it fits into our priorities.  What will be happening that we must cover?

Ray,

I will be happy to attend the WSCC BOT meeting in December.  I spoke to Steve about the issues to be covered, so we should be all set.  I will contact WSCC and register next week.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Dave, Steve and I talked and due to our schedules and distance from Phoenix, we think it would be most effective if you could represent the company at this BOT meeting.  This is assuming your schedule allows and Jim is on board with one of us attending.  It will be an important meeting with approval of WECC and next year's budget on the agenda.  I am making hotel reservations for you, since today is the deadline.  I think you also need to fill out a form for WSCC; Jenny Remington is the meeting planner.  I will send Dennis Eyre a delegation after I hear from you and Jim.  Ray
