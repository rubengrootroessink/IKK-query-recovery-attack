I am very sorry that I have not yet responded to your e-mail.  I am trying to firm up my calendar.  Not sure that Excelon and Enron will differ greatly on the key lessons learned.

I should know by mid-week (if you haven't already filled the slot).

Jim, 
Just a quick note to follow up on the invitation I sent you last week for a November conference in San Francisco.  If you could let me know by Monday morning 8-6 if you can participate (which I hope you can), I'd be grateful, as that would leave us time to ask someone else.  Also, if you can't participate, I'd appreciate your recommending someone in your stead. 
I look forward to hearing from you. 
Regards, Lynne

Dear Jim, 
Insight Information Company (www.insightinfo.com) is developing and presenting a conference on Deregulation of Electricity Market in California: Experiences Learned, Perils and Opportunities (working title), and they have asked me to chair the conference.  Insight Information is a leading provider of programs for North American business, executive and professional communities.  The conference is scheduled for November 5 and 6 in San Francisco.  Tentative panel titles include 
? Understanding Restructuring: The Regulator's Perspective 
? The Role of Fuel Supply Mix 
? Restructuring and Technological Change 
? Price-Responsive Demand 
? Energy Services and the Entrepreneurial Firm 
? Energy Risk Management and Electricity Restructuring 
? Restructuring and Transmission 
? Market Monitoring 
? Short-Term and Long-Term Approaches: Risk, Congestion Management, Institutional Change 
? Comparative Experiences in Deregulation 
I would like to invite you to participate as a speaker in this conference, in a session tentatively titled "Short-Term and Long-Term Approaches: Risk, Congestion Management, Institutional Change." I think the title will evolve, but what I'm going for in this panel is a discussion between you and Betsy Moler (Exelon) about short-run and long-run lessons that we should draw from the California experience. 
If you could let me know soon if you would be able to participate in this conference, I'd be most grateful.  The conference coordinator, Victor Pogostin, would then follow up with a formal letter of invitation. I look forward to hearing from you. 
Regards, 
Lynne
