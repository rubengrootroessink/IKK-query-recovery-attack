Good mark ups.  Thanks.
Originally, I purposely excluded acknowledging the need for a forum to develop non-physical/pure financial standards.  I was not sure if this was an issue we could win buy-in from other marketers that NERC establish business practices.

However, on the EPSA-NAERO Working Group conference call today, one member suggested we alert NERC and FERC to the fact that "business practices" have the hardest impact on the marketers and IPPs.  And if NERC is going there - then the likes of EPSA and ELCON become the major staekholders in that forum.  I think this is a great twist to the old "reliablity first approach" of NERC  and can give us major leverage.  I will bolster this point in the write-up.

EPSA will draft a letter to be sent to Mike Gent explaining what EPSA members support.  It will be based upon a "checklist" of issues similar to this write-up.  I would like to get this write-up into Mark Bennett's hands to incorporate into the letter and see if other EPSA members can support it.  We may still want to send this write-up directly to Dave Nevius and Mike Gent since, they approached us directly.

Additionally, EPSA members agreed that we should continue the parallel development of EISB and NERC.  But - take an active role in the formation of the 4th quadrant of EISB.  DOE has offered to host a forum for an industry effort to kick-start the 4th quadrant.  Mark Bennett has been talking with Rae McQuade at GISB and she told him that NERC, as an organization, cannot be folded under the EISB umbrella.  FERC would have liked such a simple solution, they want the expertise/experience of NERC - and the fair process of GISB.  So, the challenge is 
a) migrate the NERC expertise into the EISB, or
b) transform the NERC structure into an EISB like structure

NERC is proceeding at Warp Factor 10 in making a transition into the new One-Stop Shop. EPSA members believe that NERC leading this charge will certainly result in the marketers geting the short endf as we did with the Blue Ribbon Panel of a few years ago.  EPSA members want an open and inclusive forum for shaping the new organization.  That is the justification for participating in the DOE sponsored forum - to challenge NERC leading this charge.  This concern will also be expressed in the EPSA letter.
