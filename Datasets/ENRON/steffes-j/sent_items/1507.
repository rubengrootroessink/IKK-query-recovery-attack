Suzanne --

Becky Cantrell had entered Enron into a number of dockets before FERC related to pipeline rate and other matters (not sure if there were protests).  I would greatly appreciate you coming over to 47 and going through a number of filings so we can either (a) stay in the case or (b) remove our name as an active party.  Elizabeth Linnell has the papers on 47.

My initial thought is that Enron does not need to continue in these cases, but the NewCo will want to understand what to join after formation.  We may want to talk with commercial types to gauge their thoughts.

Please let me know if you can take care of this.

Thanks,

Jim
