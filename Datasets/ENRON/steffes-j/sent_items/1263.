Are they going to send a new invoice with changed amounts??  Do they know not to do anything going forward?

Jim,

I apologize for taking so long to get back to you on this.

As I said during our call last week, I have not ever seen an invoice before.  As I recal from this summer, Stokes kept me posted on the fiscal/tax crisis in TN but I did not ask them to do so explicitly.  As I understood it, I was one of a number of clients they were keeping posted.  They were well aware that we no longer owned the 2 plants and thus were no longer taxpayers.  The work that I requested in covering the Energy Working Group meetings during the late summer and fall.  Also, they represent Tenaska and possibly Calpine and Allegheny and should be splitting those expenses among us.
