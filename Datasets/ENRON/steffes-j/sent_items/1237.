Let's talk soon.  I want to make sure that you understand all of the implications of this decision.

I received an offer this past Friday for a position with EES very unexpectantly.  I've accepted the position this morning .  The group would like me start immediately but I know I need to get with Becky on a few things and finish out a project I've been working on.  

Do you guys have a time frame in mind?  I'm thinking my last day could be the 15th of November.
