Jim -- I know--I have seen this and it is very tempting.  It's expensive, but it could be very valuable from a time-saving standpoint.  I have spent many hours researching "the latest from FERC" (as they like to put it) for our developers.  These are some of the more time-consuming issues I have to research, for some reason.  Maybe I could talk EEI into a discount...what do you think might be reasonable?

FYI.  Not sure if we can afford this, but if you think it's helpful let's talk.
