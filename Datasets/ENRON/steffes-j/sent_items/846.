 risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk=
.  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transacti=
ons via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes,=
 and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and=
 the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of vari=
ous risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the=
 roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management=
 framework. =20

Management and employees are responsible for complying with the risk manage=
ment policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at <http:/=

anagement framework will be required to sign a Compliance Certificate, an e=
xample of which is attached to the Policy as Appendix H.
