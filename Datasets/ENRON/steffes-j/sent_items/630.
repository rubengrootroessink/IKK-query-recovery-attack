Janine --

Who is IMServe?  I'm guessing they are a vendor that does billing, etc.  You should e-mail Evan Hughes to determine the nature of the CSC arrangement.  But I don't think that we want to give our business to a company because they help in one case?

IMServe is interested in participating in the ComEd case as part of our ARES coalition but wants to assess whether there is a business opportunity for them.  Are we bound in contract to CSC or would we be open to a presentation by them for them to handle our  business?  Please advise or let me know who I should talk with that makes those decisions.
Thanks,
Janine
