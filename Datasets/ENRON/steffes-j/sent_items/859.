Christi --

Fine work. Looks like we are moving forward in the SE.  

A couple of discussion points.    I am still not so much in love the LMP as this paper makes it seem you are (I don't believe there is a perfect solution).  Also, the document is not consistent relating to Control Area consolidation.  For instance, the issue around CA or RTO with tagging makes no sense if there is only one CA - the RTO.  This is important to highlight to the ALJ.  The easiest way to solve the problem is to do away with the archaic systems of the old world.  Also, I still don't fully understand why we are happy that the SAC gets to pick the IMA.  I personally despise the concept of a SAC - never has worked when times get tough.  Also, no real discussion (or maybe I missed) of timing to implement - next phase?

Anyway, great work in the mediation.  Keep pushing these guys from the South.  

Thanks,

Jim

CONFIDENTIAL TO THE SE RTO MEDIATION

Attached is the Marketer Sector response (largely written by Enron) to the current proposals.  The judge's report to FERC will be filed publicly on Monday.  Enron will have the opportunity to file an Enron-only response to her report.
