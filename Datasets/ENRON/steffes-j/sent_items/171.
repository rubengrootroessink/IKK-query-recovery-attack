Sounds good to me.  Any thoughts to have Milnthorp support the Conservative=
s and Devries (or someone else) do the Liberals?

As you know, one of our key efforts in Ontario is to build bipartisan suppo=
rt for opening the market in early 2002. That largely involves firming up t=
he position of the Liberal Party (currently in opposition but in a strong p=
osition to win in the next election) in support of moving forward with comp=
etition. The Liberal Party has asked me whether Enron (really someone like =
Rob Milnthorp or Paul Devries) might consider being the co-chair of a fund =
raising event for the party in November 2001. The event would be timed for =
the Independent Power Producers Society of Ontario conference (the largest =
annual energy conference in Canada) and would be targeted at people in the =
Ontario energy sector. Dalton McGuinty, the leader, would speak at the even=
t.  I didn't dismiss the idea out of hand because it may have merit if : a)=
  through such an event, we can secure true bipartisan support for moving f=
orward.  (In other words, if we were to do this, the material would have to=
 state that Rob or Paul is acting as co-chair in recognition of the biparti=
san support for the deregulation initiative and how such bipartisan support=
 is good for the Province etc); and b) we were satisfied that doing so woul=
d not alienate the governing Conservatives. (The Conservatives have always =
encouraged us to do what we can to keep the Liberals on side and I think th=
ey would be sophisticated enough to appreciate that efforts would involve p=
articipation in such fund raising events - particularly if the material use=
d did not endorse the Liberals and merely recognized their support for movi=
ng forward). Let me know what you think.  Aleck (having said all this I sho=
uld admit to being a Liberal)
