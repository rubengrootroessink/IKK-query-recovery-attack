Jim, I've already got you signed up.  Faxed it in today.  Ginger and I put you and Rick up at the Hyatt instead of the Monarch.  Ginger says Rick likes it better so I put you at the same place and will do the same for Christi.  OK?????

HAVE A GREAT EVENING

Linda

Yes, I just signed Jim up today.  Putting him up at the Park Hyatt where Rick is staying.  I know it costs a few dollars more but its nicer per Ginger.  Want the same?

I'll be going.  You should go if you want to go.  It's a good opportunity to network.
