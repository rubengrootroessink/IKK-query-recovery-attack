Let me know how this turns out.  If you need a contact, let me know.

Also, everyone should be aware about an aggregation project under Phyllis Anzalone.  EES legal has found a loophole to the time restrictions on electricity contracts and the appropriations risk that we need to check out.

Thane -- Doug said that the TX PUC staff was asking about an EES contract at the meeting you all had in Austin last week.  Can you please find the appropriate EES lawyer to follow up on this?  (You may want to call Jim Steffes about what was asked.)  Thanks.
