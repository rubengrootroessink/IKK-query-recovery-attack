Subject:	NEW Load Curtailment Product for New York

 

Introducing a product that lets New York customers turn their 
energy load flexibility into a revenue opportunity.

Enron can turn energy usage flexibility into revenue for our customers. When a customer chooses Enron's product, 
they receive monthly payments in exchange for reducing their energy usage at Enron's request. Requests are made 
when energy market prices are high, so the energy the customer doesn't use can be sold on the market at a premium. 
Bad time for the customer? No problem--they can choose not to reduce usage, and pay a 
"buy through price" to Enron instead. Want to learn more? Click here .
