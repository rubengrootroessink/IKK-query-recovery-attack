Mr. Steffes,

Your email was forwarded to me from Rick Drom that you will be replacing Tom
Hoatson as the primary representative on the Members Committee.  Has Mr. Hoatson
left Enron?  Are you replacing him on all PJM related committees?  Our database
shows that he is also a member on the following committees:
Energy Market Committee
Planning Committee
Tariff Advisory Committee
Reliability Committee
Transmission Owners Agreement - Administrative Committee
MEN Study Committee
Credit User Group

I will correct / update the Members Committee roster and wait to hear back from
you with respect to the other committees.  Thank you.
