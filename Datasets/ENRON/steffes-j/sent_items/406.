I've been working pretty long hours recently.  I'd like to do it, but won't
really know my schedule until tomorrow.  Can I give you a buzz then?

Randy --

Last minute, I'm coming to DC today through Wednesday afternoon.  Any
chance to grab dinner or a beer?  You're probably swamped, but thought
I'd check.  I'm staying at Park Hyatt  (24 and M) - leave a number if it
works 202-419-6795.

Thanks,

Jim
