FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MEMORANDUM FOR HOUSTON

Update on Legislative Issues (September 1-15, 2001)

 ENERGY ISSUES

1.    Senate Energy Chairman Bingaman (D-NM) released his draft "Chairman's=
 Mark" of electricity restructuring legislation.  The draft is positive for=
 Enron on transmission issues (including access, jurisdiction and RTOs) and=
 reliabiilty.  We have concerns about provisions on transparency, market-ba=
sed rates and merger review.  We have said we are generally pleased, while =
we work to amend those provisions about which we have concerns.
=20
2.    We drafted testimony for Jim Steffes to be the EPSA witness at a Hous=
e Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing on reliability, siting and tr=
ansmission pricing issues (the hearing was cancelled due to the tragic even=
ts of September 11, 2001).
=20

TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY
=20
House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) said that he didn't expect the House to=
 vote on Trade Promotion Authority until next month citing a need for House=
 Republicans to "get all our ducks in a row."  Senate Finance Chairman Bauc=
us (D-MT) has stated that he would wait until the House took action on TPA =
before he would introduce his measure.  With the House pushing the vote unt=
il October, it lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the likelihood that a bill w=
ill be done this year.
=20
Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA), who is taking the lead for the =
House Republicans, has vowed to spend more time working with Democrats to c=
raft a bipartisan product.  Ways and Means Ranking Member Carl Levin (D-MI)=
 has not yet introduced his bill.  He is still meeting with Democrats and h=
as stated that he wants to introduce the most "balanced" bill he can that w=
ill include labor and environmental provisions. =20
=20
The Administration continues to push hard for TPA.  They have made securing=
 trade promotion authority their chief trade objective this year.  Presiden=
t Bush recently said that he wants TPA before the World Trade Organization =
ministerial in November.
=20
BANKRUPTCY REFORM
=20
House and Senate Conferees are hoping that conflicts between the House and =
Senate versions of the Bankruptcy Reform bill will be worked out expeditiou=
sly.  House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner (R-MI), who is chair of =
the Conference, has stated that the Conference will meet formally for the f=
irst time next week.
=20
There are two sections of the Bankruptcy Reform bill that have significant =
importance to Enron: 1. financial contract netting provisions, which are in=
cluded in both the House and Senate versions; and 2. a technical correction=
s amendment regarding production payments, which is currently included in t=
he House version only. =20
=20
There are 32 members of the House and Senate who have been appointed to the=
 Conference, which is unusually large.  The Conference has to deal with 38 =
amendments that the Senate made to the House bill (including the technical =
corrections amendment regarding production payments).  The Administration h=
as some problems with the bill, none that pertain to our issues.  The progr=
ess is expected to be slow.

FY 2002 TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS - MEXICO TRUCKING BAN
=20
Just prior to the adjournment for the August Recess, the Senate passed the =
FY 02 Transportation bill, which contained provisions that called for stric=
t safety standards for Mexico trucks gaining unrestricted access to U.S. ro=
ads.  Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Senator John McCain (R-AZ) both vehemen=
tly oppose the restrictive language but in the end allowed a final vote on =
the appropriations measure.  They have vowed, however, to hold the bill up =
in the House-Senate Conference until the Mexico trucking language is resolv=
ed (note: the House prohibitive language is more restrictive, effectively p=
rohibiting Mexico trucks from ever going beyond the current 20-mile radius =
they now have access to).  The White House has, on several occasions, reite=
rated their objection to any language in the bill that would halt or slow d=
own NAFTA provisions allowing cross-border transit, which were to have been=
 enacted January 1, 2001 - making the provision well-behind schedule alread=
y.
=20
While the Mexico's Economic Minister has stated that he would not seek sanc=
tions against the United States for violations of the NAFTA, Mexico Preside=
nt Vincente Fox has stated that he would consider limiting or even prohibit=
ing U.S. trucks on Mexico's roads.  A recent study indicated that the U.S.'=
s failure to execute the cross-border transit provisions of NAFTA could cos=
t Mexico's economy upwards of $100 billion per year. =20
=20
The Senate and House will now go to conference on the measure, and it's exp=
ected to be a contentious debate in Conference. =20
=20
MINIMUM WAGE HIKE
=20
The House will likely act on a minimum wage measure following Senate action=
, which is expected this fall.  House Republican leaders are insisting, how=
ever, that any increase in the minimum wage be accompanied by tax breaks fo=
r small businesses.  Additionally, it is likely that the minimum wage bill =
will be a vehicle for other business tax credits and pro-business measures.=
 =20
=20
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) said that the Democratic minimum =
wage bill will come to the floor in the fall.  It is expected, however, tha=
t Senate Republicans will attempt to add several tax cuts, which Democrats =
would oppose unless there are offsets (meaning, the tax measures would have=
 to be paid for elsewhere in the budget). =20
=20
The White House has said it favors a minimum wage increase providing it con=
tains flexibility provisions.  President Bush would be unlikely to veto a m=
easure absent state flexibility provisions if it contained certain tax cut =
components.=20
