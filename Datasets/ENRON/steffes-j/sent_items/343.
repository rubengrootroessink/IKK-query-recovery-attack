Steve - 

See attached  article.  The Energy Summit turned out to be quite worthwhile and well timed, as I was able to get a better perspective of what opportunities we may have to make changes next year.  Also, had a chance to chat briefly with Chairman Connelly, Commissioner Vasington and Commissioner Keating, and others. The most telling part of the article is the last paragraph where Speaker Finneran says, "We'll be doing some adjustments" in legislation next year, "Some of them may be vary large adjustments, but they will be adjustments. We're trying to formulate the phase of deregulation, an enhanced deregulation, if you will."  My sense is that competitive Default service may be a possibility, supplier consolidated billing may also require a change to the legislation. Clearly, it is a time to try to hone in on what EES and ENA's wish list is for Mass

I met with DeTore Thursday night as well, and would like to reschedule a meeting with you and him within the next couple of weeks if possible.  

Let's discuss.

Frank
