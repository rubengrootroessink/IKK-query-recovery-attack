I would recommend that all letters as such should go to Harry and me.  I think we will be getting a number of these.  I would say that we will try and communicate something proactively to the PUCs around the country by Wed am.  Critical that our message is consistent and clear.  Rebecca, any thoughts?

Jim

Hi guys.  Are any of you in the loop on how we're handling this and any other request that comes in?  I'd like to at least be able to respond to Mr. Pregozen on Monday with thoughts on who will be responding and when he can expect a response.   Let me know.  thanks.
