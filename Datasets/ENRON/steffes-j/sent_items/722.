Calvin,  per our discussion,  at the time we returned our commercial customers to utility service earlier this year,  all accounts had accrued credit balances.  PG&E transferred these credits off each account as they were setting them up for utility billing.

These same accounts are now being returned to direct access.  We began receiving the first DA bills from PG&E earlier this month, all with zero beginning balances.  Enron expects that all credit balances will be reinstated on the respective accounts before the next billing cycle.  

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this request.   Page me if you need to.  888.740.8480.

Thanks.
