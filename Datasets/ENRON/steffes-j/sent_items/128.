Sue --

Please work with Diann to determine if their calculations are tariff driven=
 or simply an internal process of SCE.

Thanks,

Jim

As a matter of fact, I disputed their calculations when I was there.  They =
are basing our deposits on the total charges rather than just the transmiss=
ion and distribution charges, which is all we are responsible for.  Accordi=
ng to them, they do not distinguish between DA and bundled charges.

Jim, do you feel we have any recourse in challenging SCE's methodology for =
calculating these requirements?

Do we have no way to confirm the validiity of the amount required?  There h=
as to be some tariff driven requirement or I am just dreaming?

Bill, SCE's security requirements are based on their projected bill amounts=
 for each account that will switch.  They are the ones to calculate this.  =
I will contact Kim Santa Cruz today and see if they have increased their re=
quirements since August 9.

Diann,

We need to read the tariff and understand SCE's security requirement and th=
en extrapolate potential requirements based on our expected load.

Wanda - do you have time to help with this analysis?

Does it make sense to offer the guaranty for $50mm and move on?

Let's discuss,
Bill

When I spoke with Kim, she suggested that I direct the question to credit, =
hence the inquiry.

Bill, not sure what "effective" date is needed.    Our customer accounts be=
gan switching to direct access in late June.  As for the maximum requiremen=
t, the amount is dictated by SCE.  When I met with Kim Santa Cruz, et al, o=
n August 9, the amount they calculated for EESO was at $37,111,872.  It is =
likely that amount has gone up, but I have received no official request sin=
ce then.

Clement, do you know what the latest security requirement is?

Diann,

Do you have a view on the effective date?  What is the maximum guaranty req=
uirement under the direct access?  We should probably put the cap north of =
that level.

Please advise,
Bill

Myself and Kim Santa Cruz of SCE have agreed in principal to the format of =
the guarantee to be provided by Enron Corp.  The only matters to be finaliz=

Teresa,

Please work with Diann's team and Treasury to see if we can issue a 2 month=
 surety while Clem works out the details on the guaranty format.  Work with=
 Diann's team and SCE to validate the $ amount.  Use Veronica Gonzalez to h=
elp if necessary.  Make sure formats on surety are approved by EES legal.  =
Hopefully we will be able to replace with a guaranty in a couple of months.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

Given the nature of progress in the past, I wouldn't want to hang my hat on=
 saying that the guaranty can be completed within a day or two.  What I can=
 do to push the process ahead quicker is to provide comments to the extent =
that they are absolute and necessary and then leave it with Southern to say=
 that they can or cannot accommodate us.  Is there any possibility of uppin=

This process has been ongoing and we should have been continuing to pursue =
this guaranty.  Sorry for any confusion if you feel this has been late noti=

he option to issue a surety bond at some cost.  Please advise if you feel w=

Teresa,

Teresa, I believe you understand what the negotiation pattern has been betw=
een Enron Corp. and Southern California Edison.  It has not changed, especi=
ally given the fact that once again I have received a form of guaranty that=
 is different than before and would need to be modified in order to be acce=
ptable to Enron Corp.  I received the guaranty and have not been able to ad=
dress it because I have been busy preparing items for the upcoming Enron Co=
rp. board meeting.  And, just as in the past, Enron Corp. and Southern Cali=
fornia Edison has not been able to come to any agreement as to what the for=
m will look like.  My question is, why is it the case that it is the ninth =
hour when it is determined that Enron Corp. has to deliver a guaranty, espe=
cially to Southern California Edison (a Counterparty where it is well known=
 that there will be problems with the format)?  Surely, we are keeping trac=
k of our credit limits and the time frames in which they can to be exceeded=
.  There will be a negotiation process and it may not necessarily meet the =
time frame that you have mentioned below.
