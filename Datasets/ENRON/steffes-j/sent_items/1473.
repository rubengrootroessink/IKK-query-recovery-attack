Amy --

I am surprised about Dasovich already getting something.

I would recommend the following amounts.

Montovano	$108,000					75,000
Comnes	$0 (started late last year)			50,000
Walton		$65,000					50,000
Yeung		$36,000					40,000
Lindberg	$20,000						40,000
Frank		$55,000					40,000


Can we talk tomorrow to finalize?  Pls give me a good time.

Jim
