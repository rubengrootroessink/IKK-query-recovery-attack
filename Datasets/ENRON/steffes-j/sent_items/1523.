Lisa and Dave --
 
Are you the right people to discuss payment or modified credit terms for EPMI?  The issue with NEPOOL is that our UI/CMP/NSTAR wholesale reqts deals would be harmed if we don't pay these guys.  
 
I don't know if we should pay, but I need to figure out who is on point for paying if that decision is reached.
 
I know that John Llodra is trying to sell these positions.
 
Jim

Has anyone brought this to the attention of the cash committee?  (Dave Gorte, Lisa Mellencamp)

I left Dave Doot a message.  I need to call Monday.  Does anyone have any real options for EPMI?  I am going to suggest that we modify our credit for two options - weekly billing or wholesale sleave.  
 
At the same time, I don't think that we are in default right now - although our surety bonds are being revoked by the issuer.
 
Ed -- are we in any position to pay NEPOOL for EPMI?  When will the $$ be due?
 
Most importantly, who is making the decision that our UI/CMP/NSTAR positions should not be funded?
 
Sounds like NEPOOL is just about done with Enron and its affiliates.
 
Jim

As long as we continue not to make any promises, but keep the matter "under review".

David Doot left me a message that he had not heard back and he was expecting our proposal yesterday (which we had not told him).  He also said that the bonding company was "rumbling" that it was not going to pay.  I do not know what their obligation is to pay, but I would think that "rumbling" is not default, yet.

Jim S. is going to call David Doot back this afternoon.
