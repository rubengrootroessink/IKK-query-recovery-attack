MEMORANDUM

To: CAEM Board of Directors
Fr: Jeff Mangold
Subject: Liability Insurance for CAEM Officers and Directors
Date: October 18, 2001

REPLY REQUESTED

As a last step in securing liability insurance for CAEM's officers and
directors, the insurer requires all officers and directors to answer the
following questions. Our General Counsel has advised me that a simple
reply to this e-mail stating the answer to all questions is no will be
sufficient.

Thanks for your attention to this necessary administrative detail. If
you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me
