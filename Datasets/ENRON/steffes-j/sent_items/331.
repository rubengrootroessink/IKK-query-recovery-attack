Sorry that I didn't get to you sooner.  The head of the group is Tim Battaglia who is the best person to work with.

Hey, Jim! 
  Thanks for your note back!  Glad to hear that you all are well and hope you had a nice vacation.  In the meanwhile, Roger has actually had a chance to go in and interview with Enron.  He was there for half a day last Saturday talking with the steel group.  It seemed to go really well, and he will be going in to talk to them again on Thursday.  Roger is pretty excited about what they are doing - so hopefully something will work out! 
   Well, I'll keep you posted, and once we make it back to Houston, we'll have to get together some time!  Take care!  Lisa
