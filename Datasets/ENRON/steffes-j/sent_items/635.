Susan --

Can you please work with ENA Accounting and others to determine the following to provide to EPSA so they can calculate our Dues --

1.	Total megawatts of your company's equity ownership as of June 1, 2001 in competitive generation assets operating and under construction in the United States (including PURPA plants) - (probably good to start with Wes Coldwell).

2.	Total megawatthours of market-priced wholesale and retail sales for the 12 months ending March 31, 2001 (probably just get Linda Lawrence to sum up our monthly sales (I would have a separate total for wholesale financials) and use someone from Evan Hughes shop for physical retail sales).

Call me to discuss.  We need to get this in by August 18.

Jim
