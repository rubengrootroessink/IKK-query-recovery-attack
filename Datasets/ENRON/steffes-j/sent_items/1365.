I am planning on calling in from home.  Do we have a list of issues/states that we want EPSA to focus on?

If you send me your thoughts, I think that we can send to EPSA before the phone call.

My list -

1.	Florida Wholesale (EWG w/o CCN)
2.	AZ opposition to the APS - Pinnacle West generation "sale"
3.	Continue pushing at state level for NOx fairness in allocation to IPPs
4.	Re-instate Direct Access in California.

Many EPSA members (led by Williams) will fight against direct access.  I won't push hard here.

Jim
