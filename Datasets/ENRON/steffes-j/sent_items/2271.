A couple of thoughts --

1.=09NG is trying to schedule a meeting in Columbus either Dec 4 or Dec 5.

2.=09I did speak with Ashley.  He indicated that NG has no specific inclina=
tion to avoid LMP in the real-time.  He did not, however, confirm that NG w=
as indifferent.

3.=09I am very concerned with the implication that Mike highlights in his p=
oint #1.  NG may simply have misstated its intentions.  But clearly this po=
sition makes it difficult for NG to join MISO under Appendix I (they would =
be giving up too much).

4.=09I agree that what NG is really saying is a for-profit RTO with ownersh=
ip of some (but not necessarily all) transmission plant in its footprint.

5.=09Let's try and coordinate our discussions with Paul Dawson in the Londo=
n office to gather his thoughts on NG in the UK market.

Luiz -  Can you please develop some questions / talking points based on the=
 attached comments that we can transmit to Ashley Brown prior to the meetin=
g?

Thanks

Just been through the paper and have the following thoughts or concerns dep=
ending on your viewpoint:

1.  The model is inconsistent with the approach taken by FERC.  NG propose =
that every transco. sets its own rates, runs its own OASIS and manages cong=
estion....how can this ensure 'seamless practices' within each RTO footprin=
t?  I suggest the opposite will occur, that is balkanization.  For example,=
 Transco's can join MISO under Appendix I, and a number are proposing to do=
 so.  Based on NG's proposed split of functions each transco. could join MI=
SO with its own tx rates, OASIS platform and congestion protocol regardless=
 of whether they are consistent.  Under this scenario transmission rates an=
d markets would remain balkanized and vary depending on transmission compan=
y geographic reach (similar to today).
2.  NG state that the benefit of a 'for profit' entity is that it can and w=
ill manage risk commercially, i agree!  However NG miss the point here....I=
f an RTO/ISO is a non profit organisation, it will only provide services su=
ch as tariff admin., OASIS and congestion management (such an RTO will not =
own tx. assets...the tx. companies that it provides services on behalf of w=
ill continue to do so!).  In providing these services the RTO/ISO only mana=
ges risk associated with non provision of service, not the underlying trans=
mission delivery risk.  The transmission companies, for whom the RTO provid=
es services, will continue to be 'for profit entities' and will continue to=
 manage risks commercially (RTO benefits result primarily from aggregation =
of services not from more appropriate commercial risk management...there is=
 nothing to stop tx. owners from managing risk more effectively regardless =
of proposed RTO structure.  For example NG as a transco., Translink or Cine=
rgy transmission could propose liquidated damage clauses for overselling fi=
rm transmission under the non profit RTO structure.  Likewise NG as transco=
 and RTO could make the same proposal).  Commercial form is a second order =
issue!
3.  NG should have concentrated on supporting FERC policy (4 RTO's) rather =
than stating one parties view on separation of RTO functions between profit=
/non profit entities.  FERC policy suggests that the key structural issues =
are; increasing market size (4 regional markets) and third party access ('l=
evel playing field').  This was the basis for the CGM proposal that came ou=
t of the SE mediation.  Separating CM and OATT admin. from planning and sec=
urity coord. improves third party access to real time information which in =
turn will facilitate market based investment decision making (being investm=
ent in transmission, generation or DSM).  Suggesting that transmission inve=
stment is necessary to resolve existing transmission constraints either sho=
ws ignorance or more likely the conflict that NG has...i suggest that inves=
tment in generation or DSM could resolve the problems just as adequately.
4.  The model seems to be based on the assumption that transmission charges=
 will continue to be based on 'contract path' (congestion managed through r=
edispatch).  I assume that NG, and other transmission companies, prefer thi=
s approach as it allows them to both maximise cash returns (above appropria=
te regulated rates) and control information that facilitates new investment=
 (retain monopoly).  I agree with Jim that this suggests a physical approac=
h to congestion management.  NG's concept that third parties can 'energy ma=
rkets' is consistent with the ARTO approach (i.e. allowing an APX to provid=
e day ahead market functions for example).  I would propose that a transco.=
 should not care what tx. charging methodology was in place as long as it i=
s perceived to be reasonable by customers and receives its aggregate regula=
ted revenue requirement.  Thus CM and OATT administration are not core tran=
sco. functions at all...

In summary, I suggest that NG actually propose the paper to reflect a 'for =
profit' RTO but they do not state this anywhere (even if true, they do not =
state anywhere that a transco. should have consistent OATT and CM protocols=
 if the assets they own are non contiguous or the transco. has a number of =
owners). I agree with Luiz that in this form it is a hard sell and does not=
 resolve Enron's ongoing concerns...

regards
Mike

As per your request, I examined the attached doc (Response of National Grid=
 US to Questions posed by the  Com << File: National Grid Transco White Pap=
er.doc >> m ission)

My initial reaction is:

1) The simple answer to your question is: yes, I think the proposed governa=
nce and organization structure can live with an LMP model. I am not familia=
r with other MISO CM model, but at least in terms of LMP, my feeling is tha=
t those are not mutually exclusive. It may be worth asking Ashley Brown

2) National Grid and other proponents of For-Profit-Transcos may have other=
 ideas on how to manage congestions (e.g. different reliability level produ=
cts by customer segment). However, the attached paper makes no allusion to =
avoid LMP and to introduce other congestion management models. The paper do=
es not imply a physical model either. Your feeling may be right, but it doe=
s not surface from the paper per se.

3) National Grid proposal is, in fact, an expanded version of the Southeast=
 Model proposed at the Mediation. It reinforces the role of the Transco Com=
pany, preempting, to some extent, the role of the System Admininstrator. Th=
is was a very controversial topic in the mediation: the System Adminstrator=
 was in charge of some functions to avoid potential bias.  (particularly fr=
om transmission companies who are not willing/able to transfer their T asse=
ts)

4) National Grid will face a lot of resistance when selling this idea; Your=
 concerns on generation redispatch and long term transmission planning are =
"surfaced" in the paper, by creating a concept of "core vs. additional" fun=
ctions and a chinese wall, if necessary.  But the perception of potential b=
ias does exist. National Grid will probably face a lot of difficulty in " s=
elling"  this idea. Particularly when we get to the details

FYI.  If we were to ask NG, could they live with the MISO CM/market model??

Thanks.

NG proposal for "splitting" work between Transco and other parties.  Don't =
think they do a great job of managing the key fears - (1) generation redisp=
atch and (2) long-term transmission plant over generation investments. =20

As I read this document, I get the strange feeling that NG is a physical-ri=
ght player.  Meaning, NG needs to build a model based on physical flows so =
they can control (a) TTC/ATC and (b) use of non-firm transmission. =20

While the NG letter states that the "functions related to energy markets ca=
n be performed by a disinterested third-party", NG specifically reserves as=
 a Core Function the "Ability to propose congestion pricing methodology".  =
Sure APX could go in and operate the balancing and CM system, but NG has th=
e right to design subject to FERC procedures.

Not sure what you guys think? =20

I will probably get back to Ashley Brown later this week.

Jim
