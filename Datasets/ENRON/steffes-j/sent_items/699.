I have a call into Jean Ryall to discuss.  Agreed that we need to keep our FERC team in the loop.

Since this matter involves communications directly with Commissioner Wood, should we involve someone from the DC office?  I know they want to be the clearinghouse for high level communications with FERC.  We should also probably alert Hartsoe, just as an FYI.

Linda - Could you please include Leslie in this meeting if she's available at whatever time you can schedule everybody else.  She is something of a 311 expert and it would be helpful to have her involved in the initial discussion.

Jim, Brian has been working with Jean Ryall on Texas issues and he assumed she would be the right person for the Pat Wood contact.  He sent her a draft of a letter last night in fact.  (See below).

The PowerPoint presentation is one that he made to TRRC staff.  

He wants to push on both fronts (Texas and Federal) to get more competition in the state.  Said he would like to get together, but he's out Thursday, Friday, Monday and Tuesday.  Linda can get with his assistant and set something up for late next week if you are available.

Jean,

Please find the attached letter to Pat Wood as follow up to our meeting last week.  Please modify with your thoughts and resend.  

Also, should we visit with Max Yzagurie at the Texas PUC?

Regards,

Brian
