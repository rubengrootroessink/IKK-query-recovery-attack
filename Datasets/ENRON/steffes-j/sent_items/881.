TO: Board of Trustees

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We are taking a new approach to the agenda and background material for
the Board meeting.

The agenda and action item pages only for each agenda item appear in one
document, with electronic "links" to the associated background material.
This document is now posted at
http://www.nerc.com/~filez/botagenda-101501.html. Links to the
individual background material are also available at this site so you
can access any and all of them for viewing or download, as you wish.

We will also post a complete agenda package, with all action item pages
and associated background material, for those that want the entire
package in one file.

Please let us know if you have any questions or have problems viewing
and downloading any part of the agenda.

Sincerely,

Julie Morgan

p.s. The agenda and background material for the Stakeholders Committee
meeting will be available in a single document, with just references (no
electronic links) to those items that appear on the Board agenda.
