We should determine whether we want to voice an opinion on this.  Seems there would be two issues  that might concern us:  1) bankruptcy and 2) effect on our book.  Might be useful to discuss briefly; perhaps first thing tomorrow morning.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Cmmr. Wood is holding an all-party meeting on Wednesday to address the
proposed decision on DWR's revenue requirement (and the concurrent
allocation of that revenue requirement among the UDCs). The Commission is
due to vote on this proposed decision at its continuation meeting on
Thursday (the 13th)  Please let me know by tomorrow if you would like anyone
from our offices to attend.
