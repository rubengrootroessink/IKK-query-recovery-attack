Jim,

If I heard you right yesterday, you said that Phil Harris was exasperated a=
nd couldn't understand why NYISO was so resistant to joining a Northeast RT=
O. =20

From my NY expereince I can tell you a perfect example of the NY attitude t=
oward the merger, if you recall Charleton Heston at an NRA meeting last yea=
r, expressed the sentiment, "not unitl you pry it from my cold dead hand!",=
 I am sure this is the same feeling the folks in NY have toward their joini=
ng PJM... For years, we in NY felt that we where far ahead of PJM as far as=
 technology and operating policies.  Now that PJM has a customer centric ma=
nagement, much improved technology and is the darling of FERC, I'm sure the=
 NYISO staff is struggling with understanding why.  If things were reversed=
, PJM encouraged to join the NYISO, I'm sure NY would be very pleased...and=
 maybe Phil Harris would be happy (but somehow I doubt that).  Recently I s=
poke to a friend of mine from NY who said they had a staff meeting where Bi=
ll Muesler told the staff, that the only reason that the market participant=
s like the PJM model, is because they can game it and make money, while sta=
ting that NY will not give up the effort (to remain independent).  I think =
this illustrates the general attitude of the NY management and the struggle=
 PJM is in for, unless of course FERC Orders the merger, which I think is t=
he only way this can be accomplished.

I'm sure you most likely know most of this, but just thought I'd pass this =
along.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Today after the Hearing I attended lunch with John Anderson and Phil Harris=
.  One of the primary points of discussion involved what to do to respond t=
o the NERC legislative efforts?

Basically we agreed that a straightforward delegation of authority over rel=
iability to FERC made sense for all of the groups.  Agreeing to that, the i=
dea is to review the Bingaman language and see if our groups could agree to=
 that language.  =20

I think that internally Enron is already there???  John Shelk, if you could=
 pls send out the language to everyone on this e-mail to get agreement that=
 would be very helpful.

I'll let you know how we next proceed.  If anyone has any problems, please =
let me know. =20

Thanks.
