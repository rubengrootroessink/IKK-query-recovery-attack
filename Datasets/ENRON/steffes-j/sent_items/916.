Hey, Jim! 
  How are you and Marianna and Grace doing?  Well, I hope!  I don't know if Jason has mentioned to you that Roger and I have been living in Birmingham, Alabama - no, not in a trailer.  Roger moved here with work last November, and I finally caught up with him early this summer.   
   In the meanwhile, he has left the company he was working for, and we are looking at moving back to Houston.  Roger has spent the last six years in the recyclable steel (steel scrap) trading business as a trader.  We have noticed that Enron is involved in steel trading, as well as coal trading - two areas in which Roger would be very interested pursuing possible opportunities.  I was wondering if you would be able to provide us with a couple of potential contact names of people who work directly over those areas.  I hope I am not putting you on the spot.  We just believe that it would be much more fruitful to be able to make contact in that manner.  If you are not comfortable doing that, I would certainly understand. 
    In any event, please drop me a line and let me know how you are doing!  It has been a while.  Was the sailing trip with Jason and Shea the last time I saw you?  That was pretty fun!  I hope Jason hasn't sold the boat.  If we ever do get back to Houston, I would love to do that again.  I haven't talked to Jason since July - when we were able to go to lunch.  I'm hoping he and Shea are still making a go of it.  They would make a great pair!  Anyway, I hope to hear from you soon!  Thanks!   Lisa
