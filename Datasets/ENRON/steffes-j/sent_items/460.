Please see the attached.  FERC has asked for preliminary comments on its proposal to adopt a standard generator interconnection agreement and procedures; the deadline for comments is December 21.  After it has considered the comments, FERC will issue a NOPR.

EPMI will participate in the Nov. 1 meeting at FERC; an update will be sent to you.  I will be taking the lead on drafting our comments.  

Please contact me if you need further information.

Subject: FERC ANOPR on Generator Interconnection


Last night, FERC issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) on Standardizing Generator Interconnection Agreements and Procedures.  The ANOPR incorporates the ERCOT interconnection procedures, modified by various "best practices" identified by the Commission in an attachment.  A public meeting has been scheduled for November 1st in Washington, although the notice of the meeting is not yet available.  We will forward it when it becomes available.  The ANOPR is attached.
