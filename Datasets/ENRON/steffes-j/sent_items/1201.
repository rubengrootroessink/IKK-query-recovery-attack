I don't think that Govt Affairs should do anything on this (and not sure if there is anything to do).

I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS.  As far as I know, Peace can't force CalPERS to do anything, including file a shareholder suit.  Therefore, I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding, or taking other action.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
