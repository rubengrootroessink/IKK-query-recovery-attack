If the RTO has the Interchange function, what else is needed for "virtual" consolidation?

Hello  SE RTO folks

I know you all have a ton and half things going on - but I would like for you to look over the attached proposal that will be a waiver for existing control areas to assign certain control area functions over to a central RTO operator.  This waiver was originally intended for Grid South but since has expanded to include Alliance, SPP, MISO.  The purpose of the waiver is to allow for the continued existence of individual utility based control areas within an RTO AND to fulfill the FERC Order 2000 requirement that the RTO to implement Interchange Schedules.  This may become a direct conflict with our position for consolidation of control areas.

If you don't read anything else, I advise you to at least read - Sec 2.2 Rationale - 5 brief paragraphs which outlines what the RTOs want to do.   

Since I am chairman of the NERC Subcommittee that oversees Policy 3, Enron is associated with facilitating this process.  I want those working at the settlement conferences to be aware that this is coming.  Grid South's original intent was to change sections of Policy 3 to fit their new RTO structure.  I successfully argued against doing this on the basis that NERC policy should not prescribe the Grid South scheduling process and control area structure as reliability policy - hence the waiver.
