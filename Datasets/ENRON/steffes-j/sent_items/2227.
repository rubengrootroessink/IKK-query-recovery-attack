Janine --

What does this do to our current book of customers on MSG?  Will our $$ margin evaporate?  Is there some other "solution" on how to restructure the FE retail market?  What wholesale issues does FE need to change to help the EWS desk?

FirstEnergy has made a filing with regard to the shopping credit for next year.  In that filing they are claiming that they have reached 20% switching and therefore do not need to increase the percentage spread between the price we buy the MSG at and the shopping credit.  I have been working with Scott Reneicke and Nicole Schwartz and am planning to file an intervention on behalf of Enron and contest the calculation of the 20% (which includes affiliate transactions) and the argument to not increase the percentage spread and any other arguments Scott may identify. 

Given circumstances, I am assuming that since this is something I can handle, I should do so as opposed to involving outside counsel.

Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed.
