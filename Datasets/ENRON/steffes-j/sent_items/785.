 and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and=
 the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of vari=
ous risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the=

ment policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at http://=
