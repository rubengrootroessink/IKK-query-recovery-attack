Please see the attached proof of claims in the PG&E bankruptcy proceeding.  These could save us some work in the CA proceeding!  Thanks.  Ray

I enclosed blacklined versions of the riders for the proofs of claim for EES, EEMC and EPMI.  I also enclose the riders for the ECC and ENA claims, which have not changed from the versions circulated last night.

Please let me know your comments as soon as possible.
