Jim -

This is the Entergy source/sink case dealing with control areas that is currently before the D.C. Circuit.  The reply brief is due Friday.  I included you in the original message because Christi Nicolay had included you in an email containing some of her initial comments.  Please let me know if you have any other questions, or if you would like to be left off of further emails re: this case. Thanks.
