Thanks, Jim. If you conclude that you think this is promising, I'd suggest
you talk to some of our current sponsors to see if we're for real. The
corporate types like ATT or the Manufacturers Association would be the best
fit, but you can talk to anybody you want to. I also understand how unusual
this is, I'm used to being asked to prove myself to prospective clients, and
willing to do so with you. I want to work with you folks and I'm willing to
go the extra mile to do so.

What's your timeline on this?

   We produce political/public affairs television programs which air in
   state capitols. Currently we are in Pennsylvania and Ohio, expanding
   into NJ, Md and DE. The disruptive technology is this: the real target
   of the TV show is the guest, not the audience. Lobbyists have trouble
   scheduling time with politicians and regulators, and when they get on
   the schedule lobbyists have time getting genuine intellectual focus from
   government decision makers. We don't have trouble with either. Every
   politician and appointee wants to be on television, they always say yes.
   When they ask us what the topics will be, and we mention something like
   telecommunications competition or electricity deregulation they want
   briefing material which they actually study in order to do well on
   television. In addition by inviting journalists and radio and television
   commentators as members of out panel we have the same effect on them.

   In short:

   Step one: identify gov't decision makers that our sponsors want to
   influence
   Step two: invite them on the program and, in doing so, develop rapport
   with their key staff members on the relevant issues
   Step three: send briefing materials and/or give a briefing in person
   before the the taping
   Step four: towards the end of a show in which the Newsmaker has largely
   been bragging about his/her policy agenda
   Step five: steer the conversation to sponsor selected topics, framing
   the issue in such a way as to make it very difficult for the guest to
   resist the conclusions suggested by the host.
   Step six: take the statement of support for the position we favor e.g.
   tort reform, privatization, deregulation, tax cuts, etc. (which by the
   way we almost always are able to get from the guest on the air) and in
   addition to airing along with the airing of the rest of the show, we
   digitize it and send it out to legislators, regulators and the proper
   beat reporters via email making it almost impossible for the newsmaker
   to back off later.

   Current sponsors: Medical Society, Hospital Association, State System of
   Higher Education, Manufacturers Association, Cornell Corrections, AT&T.
   Levels: 25K, 50K, 100K per year for Pa; 15k for Ohio (one level only).

   This is an amazingly simple, elegant and direct way to influence policy
   makers and opinion molders and we do not have an energy-oriented firms
   in partnership with us. Enron and Newsmakers are a very good fit.

   I'll be in touch,

   p.s. Sponsorship can be done in ways that are not visible if you prefer,
   via intermediaries, if you are publicity shy.
