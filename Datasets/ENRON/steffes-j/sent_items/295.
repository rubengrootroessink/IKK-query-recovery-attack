David --
 
My thoughts.
 
I would change the section "Reliability" to "Operations".  The Current framework is Non-standardized;  Poor Seams Interface
 
Under Access to Transmission I would change it to say that "Not all Users on the System take service in a non-discriminatory manner."  Utilities can't discriminate versus like users.
 
Under Generation - I would change "optional" to Optimal.
 
I don't also understand the 99%.  Easier to say 100%*   * - Public Power recipricoity issues.
 
Thanks,
 
Jim

David, some suggestions (I cannot write directly on your presentation for some reason, so please call me at 713-301-3421 if you have questions.)
 
Add "real time" price
Add costs and "risk premiums"
Add Generation "and Transmission"
Add lack of "valid" grid information
Change the benefits to "Better ability for customers to utilize numerous energy products, including forward hedging tools and demand side management."  [[Which Enron sells!]]
 
Change Market to "Wholesale Market"  open
 
Also, why do you say 99% open after RTOs?  Is this due to publics that don't participate?  If so, then maybe say "100% open to the extent that non-jurisdictional entities, such as federal power agencies and state power authorities, participate"  or name some examples, such as TVA and BPA.

Please find the latest draft of the RTO slide for inclusion in next week's 3Q Analyst Conference Pitchbook. Greg Whalley will be presenting the Wholesale Section which will include a brief RTO's discussion.

Please take a minute and review and let me know if you have any comments/concerns with the wording. 

Kind Regards.
