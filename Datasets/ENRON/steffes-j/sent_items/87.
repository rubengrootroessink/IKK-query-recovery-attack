Jim:

In Washington, we're primarily working on advocacy, which you're pretty familiar with.  Do you need more information -- we can summarize quickly if you'd like us to, but it's pretty much RTO mediation, RTO efforts in midwest, California and Pacific Northwest refunds.  Going forward, we have the Show Cause motion, possible affiliate NOPR, Supreme Court oral argument in October, other possible FERC proceedings such as interconnection policy, mandatory RTO participation, etc -- its just not defined yet.  Also, Tom Briggs continues to work with the Germany guys on an Eon strategy in the U.S.

Also, from the legislative side, you should ask John Shelk about what's expected this fall.

The only commercial deal we're involved in now (that I can think of) is Donna's Gas Storage Monetization proposal.  I'll ask her to send you more information on that.

Let me know what else you need.

Sarah

With everything else going on, it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ENA management.

I'd like to re-start this report and provide an update at the beginning of September.

While I am aware of some efforts, I am sure that I don't know about everything that is critical and on-going.  

I need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for Deal Support, Regulatory Risk, and Advocacy.  I am truly at a loss for current deals that Government Affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates.

For each project, I need lead Government Affairs person, financial impact (our your best guess), background and key issues, and strategies and next steps.

This list does not need to be exhaustive, but simply the major activities currently underway.

Thanks - I appreciate your help,

Jim
