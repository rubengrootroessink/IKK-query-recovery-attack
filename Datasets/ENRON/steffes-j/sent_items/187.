Good Morning Team,

I have been able to get through to the Career Placement office at Georgetown.   We are going to be able to move our presentation to Monday, September 24th, same time (6:30 - 9:30)  and same room (202).  The Career Placement Office was very supportive of our decision, and feel that a week delay would be enough time for the students.  We are also going to send a gift basket to the Career Placement Office to show that they are in our Thoughts and Prayers.

Myself or Alyse, needs to hear from those who are participating,

1]	David Howe
2]	Jim Steffes
3]	Denise Furey
4]	Kirk Nuener
5]	Roshena Ham
6]	Brian Wood
7]	Sebastian Corbacho
8]	Scott Griffin
9]	Andrea Gonzalez
10]	Paul LeBeau

if this date still works with your schedule.  

We are already in the process of changing the Hotel, caterers, and informing the students.

Thank you for your patience, we will wait to hear from you.
