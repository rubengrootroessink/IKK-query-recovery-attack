We are building a spreadsheet of agreements (transmission, gas transportation, pool, regional council, etc) that may be needed for a Newco Power Marketing Company to do business as a wholesale power merchant.  Attached is a spreadsheet that includes information about EPMI's transmission/pool/etc. agreements.  (use the "TRANSMISSION" spreadsheet).  Please use the current EPMI contracts listed as an example of the contracts that may be needed for NEWCO.  To start, please work on the areas listed below and email your updated spreadsheet to me.  "General..." should include any specific issues, such as AA rated company not required to provide any collateral, etc. (or parental guaranty needed, etc.) or contract must be approved by a regional committee, etc.  Include in "timing" column the estimated amount of time from request to completion of agreement and start of service:

Steve Walton and Alan Comnes -- West
Jeff Dasovich -- California
Charles Yeung -- ERCOT and other regional councils
Suzanne Calcagno -- Gas 
Marcus Nettelton -- PLEASE LET US KNOW THE AGREEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED


Susan and I will divide the rest of the spreadsheet and Bob and Harry could help with the pools that Marcus has not done. << File: Newcocontracts.XLS >> 

Please let me know the status of your review by COB Wed. and we'll proceed from there.  THANKS!!
