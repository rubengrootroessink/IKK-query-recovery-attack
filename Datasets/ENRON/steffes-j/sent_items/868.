Subject: ASE Dinner -- Enron Vice Chair Request....
Importance: High


Mike, Linda, Dave and Jim,

We received a request from the Alliance to Save Energy (www.ase.org) for Enron to be a Vice Chair of the annual dinner on October 24, 2001 in DC.

-- Enron is a member (Associate) of ASE

-- Enron has been a Vice Chair for the previous 9 years  

-- The letter of invitation was sent to Ken Lay on July 3, 2001.

-- The Vice Chair level is 10 K and covers the cost of a table. 

-- This year's award recipients are Gov. Pataki (R-NY) and the ESCO Industry - Enron would be eligible to receive the award as part of the industry group at the dinner.

-- Senators Bingaman and Jeffords and Rep. Boehlert are expected to give out the awards.

Invitations are going to print first thing tomorrow morning and will list the Vice Chairs to date -- but we can commit to the Vice Chair level after the print deadline and we will be recognized at the event.

-- There is also an opportunity for Enron to speak at their Associate's policy seminar on Oct. 25, Energy Secretary Abraham has been invited to be the keynote speaker at the seminar.

Please let me know if you would be willing to pay for, our contribute to, the cost of the table/Vice Chair level.

Please see the invite below.

Thanks and I apologize for the short notice.

-Lisa
