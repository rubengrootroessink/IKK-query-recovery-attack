Margaret Allen would like to schedule a 45 minute meeting with you on either Monday, August 27, between 9am and 2pm or on Tuesday, August 28, between 9am and 1pm.  The subject of the meeting will be the GENIE project - to get your feedback on the portal. Please forward me the time and day of your choice and we will try to accommodate your needs.  Your participation is greatly appreciated.  Thank you    



	GENIE is the internal name of the project that includes forums, daily content pushes and 	web casts. The first forum is on Energy Policy in Oct, but we are launching two portals in 	early Sept. Margaret was hoping to walk you through it and get your take. Also, there is a 	discussion in the Dec. forum on online exchanges, so she wanted to discuss that with 	you as well.
