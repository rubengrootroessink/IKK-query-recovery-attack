Kindly find a memorandum summarizing the credit worthiness parameters in the functioning ISOs in the US and Canada that was prepared by the Risk Analytics Group.  ERCOT is still outstanding and shall send you an update as soon as it is ready.

The seminal documents-in hard copies-- for this summary are also available at your request.

Please let me know if you have any question.
