Colleagues:

This is a quick note to let you know that with the help of GA Information (Elizabeth Linnell), the Fundamentals Group is starting to populate the functioning ISO Regulatory database.  The structure of the database (which will remain open to incorporate any of your suggestions)  is outlined below (it includes the latest comments from Christi and Thane).
 
The target customer group of this product is the traders either directly (by having access to the database) or,  and preferably,  via you in the field.   

The final product will be in Excel format, that through MS Access it should enable you to create a very flexible comparative reporting mechanism. An example would be a report on the rules of conflict resolution process across all the functioning ISO's in the country, and so on.  

The time table of this project in two phases is as follows:

Phase One:  It shall end by October 12th and shall include the following ISO's.
		ISO				Contact			
1.	PJM				Guillermo Canovas	(713) -345-8946
2.	California			Alberto Levy		Caracas: (58-212)-902-7811
3.	New England			Amr Ibrahim		(713)-853-3037)

Phase Two: It shall end by November 12th, and shall include the following:
4.	ERCOT				Amr Ibrahim.
5.	New York ISO			Amr Ibrahim  (tentative).


Linda Lawrence is kind to help us with a support database in which all the seminal documents for each ISO are kept so that to allow you to check the original document if you would like to substantiate, or challenge,  the findings of the database.        

The second stage of the project is to link it to the current RTO process.  However, this is a slightly different issue, and shall be communicated to you as it becomes more stable.  

I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you have any question.

Best regards
