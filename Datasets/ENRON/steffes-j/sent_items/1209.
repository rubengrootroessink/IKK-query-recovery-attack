Lisa --

I appreciate your note greatly.  While we didn't always win, we did always give the other side the fight of their lives.  Electricity markets in the Mid-atlantic (and throughout the country) are better for the work you did over the last few years.  

Best of luck in your future plans.  I'm sure that we will talk again, and often.

Take care,

Jim

Thanks for all of your support, professionalism and friendship over the past 4 years.  I will look back on my time here with fond memories, especially our battles in Pennsylvania!!   We had some great victories, didn't we (although I learned from you that I should "declare victory no matter what the outcome")?   We had some losses, too, but defeat makes the victories sweeter.  We've all been through the good, the bad, and the ugly together.  And I'm sure that I'll never work with a more talented group of people.  

Sometimes you have to do what you have to do, and this decision has not been an easy one to make.  The only thing that makes it easier is that I know that our paths will cross again.

Give my regards to Marianna and Gracie.  I wish you all the very best.

Lisa
