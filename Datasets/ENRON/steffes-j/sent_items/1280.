Thanks for asking.  This is a very strange place.  Our core trading is doing very well.  It appears that management decided to put some huge bets at the Corporate level without any risk management.  

I'm doing very well.  Marianna is expecting our 2nd child next May.  Grace continues to grow and become a little person.

Hope you and your family is doing well.

Jim
