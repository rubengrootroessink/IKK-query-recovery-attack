Thanks.  Maybe we should have Nancy Hetrick simply put in a place holder.

But in the past two years you've asked us to get out and stay out of these cases on meters. Is this a change?  I don't believe that meter data is an issue given that meter data is a separate and competitive function -- so far anyway -- but I'll check.

Sue --

We should probably file something on this CPUC docket just ensuring that if these meters are put in place, ESPs have access on a timely basis to the data if they serve the customer DA.  What do you think?  Maybe the Vinio could help?
