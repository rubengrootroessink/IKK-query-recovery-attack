I'll ask around floor.  Given my background, this position does not sound like the best fit - I'd rather be more on the long-term contracting (origination) side or business development.  Thanks for the inquiry.  

As you know, things are pretty crazy right now here at Enron.  I intend to take the week off after Thanksgiving and intend to give you a call during that period.  Have a great Thanksgiving.

Jim

Hi Jeff.
Hope all is well.  I  have a position coming up for a trader at FPL in West
Palm Beach - don't have many specifics yet, but they are dying for someone
from Enron.  Would this be of interest to you or anyone you know?  Let me
know.

Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,
Barbara
