Agreed.  In fact, my understanding is that the ERCOT protocols state that if congestion is greater than $20 MM / year the model would change.  The market has reached $100 MM.

This is just a rumor we're hearing, but we heard that FERC wants someone who knows ERCOT congestion management on the congestion management panel for RTO Week  because FERC (presumably Pat Wood) wants to use the ERCOT congestion management system as the standard CMS throughout the country.  From what I know about ERCOT (which isn't much and I have a call in to Thane to get an update), this wouldn't be a good thing for us.  We'll keep you posted.
