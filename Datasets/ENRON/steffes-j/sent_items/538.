Don't we want the ISO to provide to whom the refunds are entitled?

NOTE: WE RECEIVED THIS PROPOSED SCHEDULE  FROM THE ISO AND ARE  FORWARDING =
IT ALL THE PARTIES ON OUR LIST AND ON SCE'S LIST.  PLEASE NOTE  THAT THEY I=
NCLUDE THE ADDRESS TO  FAX YOUR NON-DISLOSURE STATEMENT TO SO WE  CAN GET T=
HE DATA..
       Aug  9   ISO provides mitigated prices together with a write-up =20
                   of its methodology and two attachments: gas prices and =
=20
                   heat rates=20
        Aug 14  ISO provides Transaction data (sales by bid segment) =20
        Aug 17  ISO provides refund amounts by seller=20
                   (The remaining items that are on Staff's proposal =20
                    under the date of Aug 15th)=20
        Aug 24  Initial pre-filed testimony by all=20
        Aug 31  Responsive testimony by all=20
        Sept 5  (The items listed on Staff's proposal for Aug 22,  absent=
=20
                 the  Protective Order which already has been dealt with)=
=20
        Sept 6-13  Hearing=20
        Sept 21  Briefing by all, including proposed findings of fact =20
                    with citations to the record support =20
        =20
        In putting together the above schedule the ISO was as aggressive as=
 it  could be in making the essential data available.  Although it will not=
 be  possible to provide everything on the 9th, what will be provided on th=
at date  (the mitigated prices and their derivation) will allow the parties=
 to get  started on the most important, and possibly controversial, data se=
t, and will  include the items covered by the Order issued by Chief Judge W=
agner.  The  above schedule does afford Judge Birchman 10 days to prepare h=
is findings and  still comply with the 45 day limitation if he is willing t=
o commence that 45-day  schedule on Aug 17th, the date on which the ISO wou=
ld complete the above  submission.  If Judge Birchman does not believe that=
 he is free to do so in  light of the Commission Order, we would urge that =
he certify to the Commission  our joint request for a modest extension.  (W=
e do believe that the ISO will  be in compliance, certainly substantially s=
o, with the data that it is to  produced within the specified 15-day period=
 and we read the Commission Order as  intending to provide the ALJ a full 4=
5 days from the completion of the data  submission.)
  =20
        There is another important process issue that we have got to put in=
 place  IMMEDIATELY.  May I please prevail on you to include in your transm=
ittal to  all of the parties that they should fax a signed copy of the Non-=
Disclosure  Certificate to Stacey Karpenin at the ISO (mailing the original=
 to her).   Stacey's fax number is (916) 608-7296 (her phone number is (916=
)  608-7273).  In the transmittal to Stacey the ISO should be advised of th=
e  Company name and its billing code (there will be charges associated with=
  preparing the disk as well as air courier charges), the person to whom th=
e  materials are to be sent together with that individual's address, phone =
and fax  numbers. Upon receipt of the faxed signature page the ISO will air=
 courier ONE  set of the materials to the designated individual. The ISO ca=
n only assure that  it will be able to air courier the materials for delive=
ry on the 9th if it is in  receipt of the Non-Disclosure Statement and the =
above information by 3 PM (PDT)  on the 8th.
