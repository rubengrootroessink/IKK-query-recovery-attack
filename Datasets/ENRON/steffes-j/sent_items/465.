Jim:

Yes, Susan is the lead and I have a call in to her now to see if she is coming up for the conference next week.  In response to your earlier email about filling in the Team Coverage chart due to Tom Briggs' departure, this is what Linda and Rick and I talked about earlier this week (you were unable to come to the meeting because you were at the EPSA Reg Affairs meeting).

Tom was on the Standards of Conduct team and was the inside counsel writing out comments.  Leslie has agreed to write all of the comments with support on our native load position from Christi and me on an as needed basis.

Tom was the lead on the market based rate inquiry.  We put Donna on as the lead for that proceeding.  She's been following it pretty closely and is on top of the FERC process/procedure aspect of whatever needs to be done.  Alan will provide the technical consulting part (and we may need outside consulting as well) but Donna will be responsible for organizing the team and doing an initial draft of the comments (if or when we need to write comments).

Tom was on a couple of other teams, but because he was not taking a lead role, I don't think he needs to be replaced.

Let me know what you think.

Sarah

Subject:	FERC ANOPR on Generator Interconnection

Last night, FERC issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) on Standardizing Generator Interconnection Agreements and Procedures.  The ANOPR incorporates the ERCOT interconnection procedures, modified by various "best practices" identified by the Commission in an attachment.  A public meeting has been scheduled for November 1st in Washington, although the notice of the meeting is not yet available.  We will forward it when it becomes available.  The ANOPR is attached.
