   Jim,
   Julie wants to hold a conference call on Tuesday, October 30th to
   discuss the possibility of designing and undertaking cost-benefit
   analyses to support FERC's RTO policies.  She wants to have you on the
   call & would like to know when you would be available.  Anytime after
   1:00 p.m. EST would probably be best for her.  If you could let me know
   ASAP I will be able to send out an email to those she thinks should be
   on the call.  Thanks, Jim.

   Jackie Gallagher
