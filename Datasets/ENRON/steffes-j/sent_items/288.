Lisa and Michael,

I  talked with two representatives from PG&E today, Robert Orbeta and Fong =
Wan, regarding the reconciliation of amounts included in Enron's Proof Of C=
laim, which total almost $404 million dollars,  to the books and records of=
 PG&E.  Both Robert and Fong agree that 1) no significant differences have =
been found, 2) the total variance, including IBM,  is approximately $2 mill=
ion dollars, and 3) the reconciliation is substantially complete and theref=
ore, the results should not change materially.  Diann Huddleson will call h=
er counterpart, Mike Alexander,  this afternoon to request a schedule, by a=
ccount, of these variances.  As you know, Enron's Proof of Claim is a compi=
lation of charges/credits reflected on PG&E invoices, and therefore, the on=
ly differences should have been the result of omissions, duplications, or o=
ther query failures.  All things being equal, the reconciliation should hav=
e been a simple comparison, but at an account level.  The sheer number of a=
ccounts for several months of activity,  made this reconciliation a challen=
ge.=20

Both Robert and Fong made remarks regarding Enron's claim for the IBM dual =
bill accounts.  Mr.  Fong also commented that another outstanding item, in =
his opinion, was the "FERC refund case".   I suggested that these items be =
included on the agenda for the settlement discussions scheduled for next we=
ek.=20

Let me know if you need anything further.=20

Thanks,
Wanda
