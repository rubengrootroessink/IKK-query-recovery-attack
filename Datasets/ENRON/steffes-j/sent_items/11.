Rick --

Any insight into this statement about Whalley and Frevert?  I'm guessing that this is just Lay's vision of what is now impacting our company?  Appreciate your thoughts?

     ``They'll be looking at all of the businesses -- the
wholesale unit, government affairs. Anything that affects Enron,''
Lay said.
