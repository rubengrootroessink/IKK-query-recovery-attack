Harry & Christi --

We need to be coordinating on this.  You both met with these people at different times.  I don't want to be creating work or stepping on each other.  I don't think there is any problem, but let's sit down and coordinate.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject:	EES assistance

I met with Rogers, Dale, Narsimha, and Berney earlier this week to determine how to ensure that EES is getting timely information on FERC filings that may impact the EES regulated positions.  They asked that Govt Affairs provide them with the basic information on FERC filings (filing date, protest date and brief description of the proposed tariff change), especially for changes that impact rates, retail standards, imbalances, non-negotiable agreements, and icap.  

In order to facilitate this, Susan Lindberg will email FERC filing notices to Rogers, Dale, Narsimha, Berney and Don (with copies to the state GA person, such as Janine in the Midwest, and with a copy to Harry).  Dale said that his group should be able to actually make the analysis of the filing and determine if EES should protest/comment/intervene.  Dale will send us a copy of EES top 40 priority companies to watch.  Govt Affairs folks should also watch for non-FERC filings that may impact this list, as well.

Also, EES is doing physical delivery in ComEd, ERCOT, Cinergy, Columbus Southern (AEP), California, Nevada, NY, PJM, and NEPOOL, so we need to make sure that they have notice of tariff changes and other issues in these regions.  Thanks.
