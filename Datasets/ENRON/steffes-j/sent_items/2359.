I will work on an Enron protest of this MISO filing, if necessary, for this issue (question of how "source and sink" would affect reservations and hinder EES in reserving network (similar to Dynegy v. ComEd arguments).

Christi:

I have read the MISO filing and have the same concerns you have with respect
to the granularity of the source.  I have passed the filing onto others in
Exelon and should know in a few days whether we will intervene (it looks
like we have until Nov. 29).
