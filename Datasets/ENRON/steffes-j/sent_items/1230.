PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT: THE CAEM GRID ENHANCEMENT FORUM
 
PROMPT REPLY REQUESTED.
 
A slew of new power control, management, transmission and storage technologies are becoming available in the power marketplace to reduce congestion, enhance performance and improve reliability.  These technologies carry great promise for addressing some of the challenges currently faced by regulators and market participants alike.  But there appear to be significant institutional, regulatory and pricing barriers to their widespread use.  In addition, the new technologies are likely to present challenges of their own.
 
Accordingly, the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM-www.caem.org) is hosting a consensus-building forum designed to (a) achieve a common understanding of the grid-enhancing potential of the new technologies; (b) use an intensive role-reversal seminar to identify and highlight the institutional, regulatory and market design barriers to the successful deployment of the various new tools; and (c) develop technology-neutral recommendations addressing these barriers.
 
The project will begin in early 2002 with final policy recommendations to be published by Spring of 2002.  The project is expected to have a significant impact on decisions made by regulators, financial analysts, utility executives, the media and potential customers.
 
For a copy of the proposal, please e-mail Philip Marston, the Project Director, at pmarston@marstonlaw.com.  This forum is time-sensitive and the number of participants is limited.
