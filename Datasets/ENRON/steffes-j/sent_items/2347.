How about heading off campus - less likely to run into Enron people.  Let's meet in the parking lot entrance (right where the little store is on the way to the Met) at 11:30.

If anything comes up, call me on my cell at 713-851-2499.

Jim

Hi Jim,

How about NY Pizzeria for lunch?  Another preference?  We could go to
Teala's on Dallas.  Let me know what time is most suited to your schedule.
See you in a little while.

Shane
