This vote was for UBP members only.  I cast a vote for Option A on behalf of Enron.  We still a small group of suppliers that are a holdover from the CUBR days and we keep in close contact through this process.  It appears from the email votes that I have seen that most members are choosing Option A - even some of the "harder to convince" utilities.  Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Jim

As discussed during Friday's conference call, we're sending out the overall
governance documents asap for an email vote of affirmation by August 31st.
Scott has provided the revised documents.

Does the following statement to our membership do the job??   If you have
any changes / suggestions, please provide them by Wednesday, as I will send
out this email by the end of Wednesday.

The risk of asking for this is:  What if we don't get an affirmative vote??
The risk of not asking for this may be worse.
I don't expect a unanimous affirmation based upon recent events.

Charlie

Members of UBP-RSB,

The attached documents represent the basis of organizational design
development for a Retail Standards Board per the original charge of this
organization.  The versions of the documents attached here reflect the
changes identified in discussions during our Baltimore meeting on July 23rd.
Your Governance Committee needs you to confirm that these documents now
state our intentions and the design needs of a Retail Standards Board before
we can reasonably proceed with detail organizational design efforts.

As the Governance Committee's work proceeds, the organizational design may
evolve slightly as the high level view of these documents does not contain
every design requirement or anticipate every contingency.  There may be
issues that arise in developing an inclusive organization that need your
further attention.  As, or if, such issues arise, the GC will seek your
input.

For now, please provide an email response which indicates either that

a)  your company agrees with and supports the Statement of Structure and the
membership's revisions to Strawman 2 as described in the attached documents,


     or

b)  your company cannot support the Statement of Structure and the
membership's revisions to Strawman 2 as described in the attached documents.

Please provide your response no later than August 31, 2001.

UBP voting rules will be applied in this instance.
