Jean --

Why not ask Marianne Carroll to draft a short note on the current status of the docket and likely outcomes/timing?  Thanks.

There have been settlement discussions at the PUCT, however, since we have not been a party I have not participated in any of the discussions.  Jean would be in the best location to get details since Marianne Carroll has been representing Dynegy and others.

Subject:	QSEs and QFs in Texas

Texas folks:  The East desk originators would like to know the current status of QFs with PURPA put contracts in Texas and how QSEs can provide scheduling services to these entities.  They said that customers have told them that this issue is being discussed in ERCOT now.

I am aware of the FERC decision last year that precluded the TX PUC from basically abrogating the PURPA contracts.  We circulated that decision to the originators and traders at that time. 

Thanks.
