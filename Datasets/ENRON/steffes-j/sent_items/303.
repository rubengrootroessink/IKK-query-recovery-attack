This is especially problematic given that EES and ENA can not comply with the reqts as defined.

Subject:	California Gas Reporting Requirements

The Commission denied the requests for rehearing (including Enron's) of the Commission's July 25 order on reporting requirements for California natural gas transactions.  The Commission finds that the information is necessary for FERC to better understand how the California natural gas market operates so the Commission can determine whether anything else is needed to be done to protect consumers.  Also, FERC states that the information is necessary for the Commission to advise Congress on whether Congress needs to change the regulatory framework that FERC works under.

A more detailed summary will be provided shortly.  Please let us know if you have any questions.
