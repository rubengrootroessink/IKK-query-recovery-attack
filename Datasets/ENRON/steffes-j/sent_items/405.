e.  For this effort, please rank up to five choices in the list below (1=3D=
highest).  We'll tally the results, identify which items will have priority=
 and communicate back how those needs will direct implementation efforts.  =
Please note that items marked with (*) would require your input.  Please cl=
ick on Forward for this message to allow you to type in your ranking number=
