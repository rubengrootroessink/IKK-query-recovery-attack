I'm writing to invite you to a meeting on August 16 to discuss origination =
and trading opportunities in the renewable power sector. On April 1, we est=
ablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =
and West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=
ron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=
reen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=
r fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=
lion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =
nationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=
shing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=
 market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=
rnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=
demand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=
lls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=
easing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=
 it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =
market-maker in the renewable power sector.

I would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =
and origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=
nated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=
is.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a de=
signate from your group will be able to attend.  We will contact you with a=
 follow-up call/e-mail the week of August 6th with a room location and agen=
da, and hope you will be able to attend.

Best wishes,
