I think they are closed in the afternoon.

On a different topic, I need to travel to Wash., D.C. on the evening of Nov. 28 and return the evening of the 29th, for a FERC meeting.  Go ahead and see what's available; I assume the expenditure is OK, but you might double check with Jim.  It's for a matter that is important to the Services group, and they've asked me to attend.

Line was so long this a.m., I did not get my shot because I had to leave for a meeting.  Can you check to see whether they have any vaccine left?
