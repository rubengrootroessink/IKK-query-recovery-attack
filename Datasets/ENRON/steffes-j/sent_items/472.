Tom --

You may at some time want to cross train on NYISO rules - especially as the region integrates.

Thanks,

Jim

Either today or Monday, I expect the NYISO to announce that it will be offering its 3-day Market Orientation Course in Houston December 11-13 at the Hyatt Regency. Enrollment will be limited to 150 people on an as-registered basis, so early registration is encouraged. The on-line registration process will be included in their announcement, which will be broadcast to the ISO's TIE list as well as put on their web site www.NYISO.com. Because Enron has previously sent people through this training course, the costs for Enron employees attending this training session will be $800.00 per person, rather than the normal $1,200.00 charge. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
