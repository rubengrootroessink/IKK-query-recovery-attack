When is  Bigger Better?
The Acquisition of Orion by Reliant
The  possible acquisition of Orion Power, the owner of many plants that ser=
ve the  Pittsburgh area, by Reliant Resources is the fifth major transactio=
n affecting  Pennsylvania's generation and electric service since 1996. Rel=
iant Resources'  attempt to buy Orion Power, however, raises issues not see=
n before in other  transactions.=20
Those transactions - the PECO Energy and Unicom merger,  the GPU and First =
Energy merger, the sale of GPU's power plants, and Duquesne  Light Company'=
s swap of plants with First Energy and subsequent purchase by  Orion - did =
not increase the market power of a particular generation owner. =20
Why not? All the other transactions involved companies operating in  differ=
ent markets, or companies that did not own generation, or sale of power  pl=
ants from one company to one or more companies. In fact, taken together the=
se  transactions reduced consumer costs, protected rate caps, and decreased=
 stranded  costs. They also led to important environmental improvements lik=
e new pollution  control investments and support for renewable energy.
Reliant Resources,  however, already owns generation within PJM and the pur=
chase of Orion would add  generation to its PJM share, once Duquesne joins =
PJM West. For this reason, the  transaction should be carefully reviewed an=
d used to formulate a new policy  concerning consolidation of generation as=
sets within a single  market.
Specifically, regulatory bodies should make increased demand  response a co=
ndition for any transaction that increases generation consolidation  as dem=
and response strongly mitigates market power. Funds should be devoted to  e=
nsuring that all consumers with a load of 50 kilowatts and above are equipp=
ed  with time-of-use meters. This measure is necessary, as the single bigge=
st  regulatory mistake to date in electricity restructuring is the failure =
to make  demand response a central part of restructuring. Without it, worka=
bly  competitive markets will not develop or be sustained.
Apart from  increasing demand response, regulators and the Office of Consum=
er Advocate  should get answers to the following questions:
- Will Reliant Resources  permit Duquesne Light Company, the local distribu=
tion utility, to offer in its  service territory a competitive default serv=
ice (CDS) program modeled after the  successful CDS program operating in th=
e PECO Energy service territory?=20
-  Will Reliant Resources exercise market power within local markets and sh=
ould  particular plants be excluded from this acquisition to eliminate mark=
et power? =20
- Will Reliant Resources commit to supporting economic demand-response  pro=
grams within PJM, instead of voting against demand response as it has done =
 recently?
- Will Reliant Resources acquisition help finance installation of  time-of-=
use meters for all customers with demand more than 50 kilowatts within  the=
 Duquesne control area?
- What will Reliant Resources do to clean up some  of the heavily polluting=
 plants that it owns now or will acquire from Orion? =20
Reliant owns portions of Keystone and Conemaugh and Shawville power  plants=
. It would buy from Orion the Cheswick unit. Keystone and Cheswick have no =
 scrubbers installed to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, while Shawville ha=
s been  scrubbing one out of four boilers. In 2000, Keystone, Shawville and=
 Cheswick  respectively released 153,490 tons, 48,243 tons, and 44,908 tons=
 of SOx into  Pennsylvania's air. Keystone is also the biggest emitter of m=
ercury in the  entire country and all four plants spew huge amounts of nitr=
ogen oxide - at a  rate more than double the modern standard of .15 lbs/mmb=
tu. That's not all - all  four plants produce an amazing 30 million tons of=
 carbon dioxide, helping  Pennsylvania to contribute 1 percent of the entir=
e world's human-induced global  warming gases.
Reliant can begin cleaning up by implementing in the  Duquesne area the equ=
ivalent of the PECO Service Territory's CDS program, which  includes a Rene=
wable Portfolio Standard that increases annually the amount of  renewable e=
nergy that must be supplied to customers. CDS customers there are  served b=
y New Power and Green Mountain Energy at 5.56 cents per kilowatt-hour  (kWh=
), more than three cents less than the 8.65 cents per kWh PECO Energy  char=
ged its residential customers in 1996 for coal and nuclear power. =20
Market Power Issues
In addition to environmental  issues, market power issues must be examined.=
 Such an inquiry hinges on defining  the relevant market and products.=20
Nationally, total generation capacity  is approximately 800,000 MW, with mo=
st of it subject to base rate regulation in  the retail market. Despite reg=
ulation at retail, wholesale generation  transactions are generally price d=
eregulated in all 50 states, whether or not  the entities engaged in the tr=
ansactions are deregulated generation owners,  regulated public utilities, =
municipal utilities, or electric cooperatives and  whether or not necessary=
 market institutions required for workably competitive  markets exist.=20
Orion Power has been participating in the deregulated  wholesale market. It=
 owns 81 power plants in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and  West Virginia, =
producing approximately 6,000 MW and has another 5,000 MW under  constructi=
on. Orion has done an exceptional job, improving the forced outage  rates, =
especially among its New York City resources.
The proposed  acquisition of Orion Power by Reliant Resources will form the=
 nation's second  largest deregulated power generation owner, controlling 1=
7,279 MW, or 6.15  percent of the deregulated generation market that totals=
 281,000 MW of the  country's total capacity. Reliant Resources has a small=
er share of the nation's  total generation capacity.=20
Yet these small national shares do not  guarantee that Reliant Resources co=
uld not have market power in portions of the  PJM Market.=20
Prior to this proposed acquisition, Reliant Resources owned  about 7 percen=
t of total PJM generation, or 4,262 MW of generation capacity  within the 5=
8,000-MW PJM market. These facilities include 2,009 MW of base load,  803 M=
W of intermediate load, and 1,450 MW of peaking capacity. They are quite  o=
ld and formerly owned by GPU and Sithe (see table in attached document).  R=
eliant Resources is also developing another 1,316 MW within PJM.=20
These  numbers would indicate that regulators should focus on possible mark=
et power  within the Duquesne Control Area of the units that Reliant Energy=
 is purchasing  from Orion. The Duquesne Control area is scheduled to becom=
e part of PJM West in  2002, but regulators and the Office of Consumer Advo=
cate should ensure that no  plant is strategically located within the trans=
mission system so that it  possesses market power even after incorporation =
of the control area within PJM  West. If any plants that would give Reliant=
 Resources market power are  identified, they should be removed from this a=
cquisition.  =20
Addressing Market Power
The combination of large  generation owners creates concerns over market po=
wer that can only be identified  and addressed by sound regulatory action. =
In all three of the Northeastern ISOs,  there have been incidents of market=
 power which have resulted in numerous rule  changes. There are several rea=
sons that the electric industry is sensitive to  market power. First is the=
 inability to store energy. In many other industries  surpluses can be buil=
t up in low demand periods and used to fill in gaps during  high demand per=
iods. In the electric industry, energy is produced and consumed  virtually =
instantaneously. Second, there are barriers to entry in the electric  indus=
try, including discriminatory interconnection practices and other incumbent=
  advantages. Third, historically the demand for electricity has been inela=
stic  and creates the opportunity for inflated prices. Inelastic electricit=
y demand is  not surprising when most customers see average prices and do n=
ot have metering  or the ability to respond to prices.
For these reasons, concrete steps to  combat market power in the electric i=
ndustry must be taken. For starters, the  existing market mitigation measur=
es, such as PJM's $1,000 price cap, should be  examined to determine if the=
y are sufficient, while not being burdensome as to  limit new generation re=
sources from entering the market.=20
Secondly,  barriers to entry should be reduced, especially for distributed =
generation and  environmentally beneficial grid technologies like wind ener=
gy.=20
Lastly  and most importantly, demand-response programs can and must be deve=
loped.  California has shown that energy efficiency can preserve reliabilit=
y and break  the market power of generation owners. Changing the demand for=
 electricity is  the biggest and best protection against market power.=20
A Deeply  Troubling Tale
Unfortunately, Reliant Resources did not support  PJM's Economic Demand Res=
ponse programs, voting against them last year in the  Members Committee. It=
 had company, with all generation owners voting as a block,  with one excep=
tion, against demand response. Three cheers for the exception:  Edison Miss=
ion.=20
In the face of the mass opposition of generation owners,  PJM wobbled but d=
id not cave. It changed but submitted demand-response programs  to FERC whi=
ch were approved for the summer of 2001.=20
The moral of this  tale is that the public interest needs regulators, the P=
JM Board, and other  interested parties to further demand-response initiati=
ves, because generation  owners will likely be roadblocks. In particular, r=
eal-time metering, residential  air conditioning and heating programs, and =
wholesale markets all need to be  developed.=20
It is time for strong action on these points. Regulators must  begin by req=
uiring Reliant Resources to finance the installation of time-of-use  meters=
 for all customers with demand of 50 kW or more within the Duquesne  contro=
l area. This is especially important as the transition there may be  comple=
ted by 2004.=20
