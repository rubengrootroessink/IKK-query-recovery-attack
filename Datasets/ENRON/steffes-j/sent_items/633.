Comments (Phase IIA)

 NERC ROSTER

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Responses to the comments received on the revised (April 11, 2001
version) Phase IIA Planning Standards during the 45-day public 
comment
period (April 11-May 29, 2001) have been posted on the NERC web 
site:

  http://www.nerc.com/~pc/standards/#planningstandardsphaseiia

These comments (10 sets) and their responses form the basis for 
the
further revisions made to the Phase IIA Standards by the Planning
Standards Subcommittee, in conjunction with the Compliance 
Review
Subcommittee and several other NERC Planning Committee 
subgroups.
These further revisions to Phase IIA are clarifying and editorial in
nature and are not believed to be substantive.

The resulting revised Phase IIA Planning Standards (June 15, 2001
version) were posted on August 2, 2001 for a 30-day notification
period prior to their consideration for approval by the PC. The posted
comments and responses complement these Phase IIA Standards.

Sincerely,


Virginia C. Sulzberger (via Angie Nicastro)
PSS Staff Coordinator
