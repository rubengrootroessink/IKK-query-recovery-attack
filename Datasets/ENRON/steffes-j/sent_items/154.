Guys --

Don't know if we need to do our own study.  Probably want to get with this prof to discuss.  I agree with his analysis that the electricity markets needs a bunch of sellers - means we should push for distributed generation.  

Thanks

This study also concludes that due to the inelasticity of demand, there needs to be a great deal of sellers (more than in a typical market) to ensure competitive markets.  I am not sure that we want to use this study for our purposes; however, need to be aware it is out there as we discuss any new methods of assessing market power.  Do we need to conduct our own study?

Cornell has published a report of 4 experiments conducted to test market trading behavior and its impact on electricity prices under different price auctions. 

1) uniform price auction
2) uniform price with interruptible loads
3) discriminative auction - generators are paid their actual offers
4) soft-cap auction 

The study is fascinating as real subjects were employed and paid real dollars based on their trading performance.  The findings are consistent with our arguments against price caps - particularly soft caps as installed in California.   I think there is some "empirical" data that can be used in our arguments against price caps.  

More variations of the auctions aimed at testing some assumptions used in these 4 experiments are planned, and industry is invited to participate in the experiments.
