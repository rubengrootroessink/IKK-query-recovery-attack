I thought I'd pass this along to the RCR committee - I am going to try to get other participants in the Pacific NW refund case to chip in for Seaborn's fees.  As you know, things are moving quite fast.

Bob (cc Dan):

On August 9th I sent a memo to Dan and Bob re: budget for the Pacific
Northwest hearing. This included a PNW budget of $87,300 through the end of
the hearing September 6th. I noted that we had already spent some time on
PNW issues, including a meeting in Washington, etc. These were outside the
$87K value.

Just as an update, and to avoid any surprises, I thought I would provide Bob
with an update. So far we have spent a total of 206 hours on the Pacific
Northwest issues, through yesterday night. Needless to say, much of this
went into drafting the numerous bits of testimony, plus the data analysis of
the gas/power forwards prices. I also ended up drafting testimony on some
other issues not originally contemplated, including ripple, etc.

On that basis, we have gone through $66,575 of the total budget. I just
wanted to make sure people were OK with this as we still have a very long 9
days left to go before the hearing concludes next Thursday...and I expect we
will be very busy the entire time.
