Barbara,

Our consultant (Bob Iwanchuck of ENSR) placed a call to Shelby County Pollution Control Division and spoke with David Thorpe.  Shelby County Pollution Control Division has been given authority by the state to issue permits for Shelby county.  Mr. Thorpe believes that our permit will be processed normally and is not subject to the moratorium.  Mr. Thorpe has not yet seen anything official as to how the order will apply.  I'll keep you posted.

Chris

I spoke with Chris Booth who works with Ben on the site in Shelby County, TN.  Chris is awaiting an update from their consultant who is speaking with the Dept. of Environment and Conservation.  Chris, Please keep us posted.  Barbara

Susan --

Please discuss with Ben (you may want to call Barbara & Christi to see if anyone else has discussed already) and relay importance of this to his future plans to me?  Key question is whether or not we need to be engaging directly with local governments.

Jim
