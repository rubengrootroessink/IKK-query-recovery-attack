Can we change the project lead on the RTO NOPR on Standards of Conduct to be both Lisa Yoho and Leslie Lawner?

Also, can you call the project leads before the memo goes out to make sure that they are aware of their responsibilities - just a heads up?

In paragraph 2, your language is that this is addressed only to the people on the chart.  I think that Rick intends to send out to everyone in GA.  Maybe we want to change to indicate that people are welcome to be included in teams if they were not mentioned.

Thanks,

Jim

Here is a proposed memo and revised chart.  The memo is rather lengthly but there was a lot to cover.  Please let me know if you need me to do anything else on this.  I am working on the talking points that Christi drafted last night.
