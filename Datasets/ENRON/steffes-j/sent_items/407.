Pat -- Can you please let Heather Kroll, Reagan Rorschach and Rudy Acevedo in EPMI know when we can expect a decision from the TX PUC on whether Entergy goes retail open access 1/1/02?

Also, Texas team, please keep the EPMI SE team informed of the Texas outside of ERCOT information and progress.  The best way is to send an email to Claudette Harvey and ask that she forward it to her group.  Thanks much.
