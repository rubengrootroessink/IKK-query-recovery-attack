Evan, Thanks. The networking has begun. I, Jim and Harry met with Rebecca and Craig yesterday and explored the interface between Services and GA.
We identified several areas of collaboration and networking opportunities. It was a very positive meeting. I and Rebecca have scheduled to meet to outline the process.The effort will aim at bringing our two processes together to insure that we avoid any misinformation or suprises regarding all new market issues, and above all, to make sure that all our bases are covered.

Gloria

Gloria,

Thank you for your note.  You did not offended me in any way that I am aware.

Frankly, Jim and I were discussing the appropriate routing of information to the EES Senior Management Team.  I believe that in any situation other than health or safety issues we have an obligation to factor in all constituents (ie. Rebecca Fite in this situation) and gain the facts before issuing statements about a topic that includes the President of our company in the distribution. 

I do value and appreciate your contributions on the ConEd efforts that preceded your e-mail regarding the Illinois Certification.  Unfortunately, your e-mail (that contained a key inaccuracy) caused several additional e-mails to be circulated and caused a bit of confusion.  In the future -- I agree wtih you and would like to avoid as much confusion as possible.

If you think it best -- I would welcome a meeting between Jim and you and Rebecca and me to better understand how to work together.  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Evan

Evan,
I was standing beside Jim Steffes last thursday, when you gave him your "editorial" of me. In the 2 weeks that I worked with you on ConEd, I did not realise that I offended you in any way, personally or professionally. I have also had similar negative feedback from Jason Woodward, and I have never met or worked with him. 
Before your group assumed the new market role for EES, I worked very closely with Peter Vint, Robert Gresch, Beth Goodman and their groups on all new market issues. 
We worked as a team, and no matter at what point of the new market spectrum problems came up, we all pitched in to resolve the issues. Your group appears to have a more territorial approach to new market issues, and in the past have rejected my offers and efforts at networking. I have tried to respect that.

Prior to sending out the IL analysis, I placed a call to your group indicating that I was working on that analysis, and had some questions. I did not get a call back. Taking the time to return that call, may have saved us all some uneccessary stress. Well, good things do sometimes come from bad situations. The good thing is that we have all seen the need for a closer approach to new market entry issues. I intend to work with your group to develop a mutually acceptable level of interaction and interface.

Thanks,
Gloria

Gloria,
This is to confirm Con Edison's receipt of Enron Energy Services' wire for
billing agency security in the amount of $1 million.  Enron Energy Services'
cash deposit is subject to the NYS PSC approved interest rate for "other
customer capital".  Please note that interest will be paid on an annual
basis, and that the "other customer capital" interest rate changes each
calendar year.

Based on Enron Energy Services' successful completion of Con Edison's
billing agency test using hard copy bills, and our receipt of the signed
billing agency agreement and security deposit in the amount of $1 million,
Enron Energy Services may now begin enrolling new accounts with billing
agency status.  We will immediately code Enron Energy Services' existing
customer account population with billing agency status, as well.  As
previously agreed, Con Edison will express mail the bills produced each day
for Enron Energy Services' customer account population using Enron Energy
Services' Airborne Express account number to the address shown below:
	CSC BILLING DEPT
	700 MILAM NORTH TOWER 6FL
	HOUSTON, Texas  77002

Lastly, any future changes to Enron Energy Services' security coverage
amount or type will be done in strict accordance with the standards set
forth in the Uniform Business Practices.

If you have any other questions or comments, feel free to contact me.
