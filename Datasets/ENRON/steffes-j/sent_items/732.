Dave --

I'll look at today.  Is there an RCR?

Jim,

Attached to this message is a copy of the document that Kim Curry had composed for EPMI to file with FERC today (8/20) in regard to on-going price mitigation in the WSCC.  I have added a couple comments to Kim's document for consideration.

I would appreciate it if you could review this attachment and let me know if you have any questions relating to either our filing of comments or of the content.  FYI, our comments line up with those being made PGE and other parties in the Northwest.

Kind Regards,
Dave

Kim,

Great job!  I really like the comments and like what you have done with the material I had sent to you.

I have added a coupe comments for yours and the groups consideration.  The only other thing I was wondering about was what do you think about adding your "alternative" price recommendations in the footnote on page 4 to the body of the document at the end of the first section "Summary of Comments"?

I have attached my comments for your review.  I'll be in Portland on Monday morning and can be reached on my cell at 415.794.8740.

Kind Regards,

Dave
