Steve --

Alan is on vacation next week.  Jeff is tied up.  Bryan Gottfredson will be compiling this information.  

By the way, there may not be a listing of who (meaning generators) is owed how much - wasn't disclosed in the FERC Settlement.

Ken is talking to Willie Brown today.  He will encourage him to get involved as a facilitator for a comprehensive solution to the California problem.  Ken would like to have the following information to provide Brown perhaps next week:

Listing of who is owed how much in California
Listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions.
Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists
Listing of the defendants in the class action suits.

The objective is to identify for Brown what his leverage would be (and what benefits could be offered) if he were to convene the parties to work for a comprehensive solution.  Please let me know who will take the lead on this.
