FERC will be the ultimate decider on Admin Cost Adder, not the IURC.  Not s=
ure why this is even in the Settlement except to ensure that IURC won't int=
ervene at FERC.

We should not sign based on this information.

I reviewed the settlement document last night and quite frankly do not see =
a whole lot of reason to sign on at this point as it is a rehash simply of =
things MISO is already required to do.  Moreover, the settlement would not =
limit MISO in any future amendment to the MISO agreement, leaving them free=
 to do as they please, post settlement.  The language in parts is a little =
troublesome, things like, MISO "has an impressive infrastructure";  that tr=
ansmission owners and marketers "will need to learn through experience" thu=
s providing them an out for unacceptable behavior; acknowledgements that "i=
t is important not to delay progress indefinately in the hope of making tra=
nsmission system operations perfect in the Midwest for Day One," which whil=
e we may conceptually agree with, I'd never want in writing in this context=
 because it gives them an excuse not to adopt anything we may propose in th=
e name of expediency; etc. Etc.  The settlement also acknowledges the reaso=
nableness of the MISO Administrative Cost Adder but allows us to challenge =
it in a proceeding.  This shifts the burden of proof by creating a rebuttal=
 presumption of reasonableness which will be more difficult to litigate.

I have calls into a number of intervenors to get their take on this and wil=
l keep you apprised.
