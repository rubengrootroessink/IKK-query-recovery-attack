My thoughts --

1.	Great job.
2.	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs.  
3.	Thanks for getting in "Network Plus" - it's the little things that matter.
4.	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative. NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.

Thanks.

Subject:	RTO Comments

Attached are draft RTO comments.  The comments reflect EPMI's views on RTO development, given the Commission's apparent recent changes in position on the number of RTOs to be created.  We urge Right Sized RTOs without choosing a number.  


The comments reflect input from Christi, Dave Perrino, Steve Walton, Mike Roan, Andy and Charles.  Please review the sections where you have had input to make sure we adequately reflected your points, but please also review the entire document and let us know your thoughts.

I'm still filling in cites and Bernadette will be working on the formatting, but the document is hopefully in pretty good shape.  There is no filing deadline for these comments, but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible.  It shouldn't take more than an hour to review.  In sending your comments, please "Reply to All" so everyone receives your comments.  

Thanks for everyone's help.

Susan:  we should also have Kevin review the comments

Alan:  Tim should probably review the comments as well, but check with Dave and Steve to see if the "LMP in the West" argument is correct before you show him the comments.
