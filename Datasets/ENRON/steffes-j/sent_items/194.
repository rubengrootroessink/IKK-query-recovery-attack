Bob --

Any concerns with this language?  Not sure if we are even going to file, but want to be ready.

While this draft talks about July 1 retroactive date, I'd guess this would be filed if the CPUC does anything before the Ordering date?

Attached is a first draft of the  Appication for Rehearing to be filed in the event the Commission issues a  retroactive direct access suspension decision.  Your comments will be very  much appreciated.
