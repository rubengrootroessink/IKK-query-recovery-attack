Subject:	Draft PNW Testimony Will Be Circulated on Saturday

By early Saturday afternoon, the Steering Committee plans to circulate to the TFG draft testimonies that are being developed jointly by PowerEx, PPl Montana and Enron for filing on Monday, August 27.  These testimonies are strucured as a suite, each complementing the other.  The witnesses filing these testimonies will be Dr. Richard Tabors (PowerEx), Dr. Scott Jones (PPL), Dr. Samuel Van Vactor (Enron), and Dr. Seabron Adamson (Enron).

The sponsors of these testimonies invite TFG member comments and suggestions for improving the drafts.  However, in order for your comments to be considered, they will need to be received no later than 3:00 PM ESTon Sunday, August 26.  All comments and suggestions need to be in writing and can be faxed (not E-mailed) to me at 202-857-2131.  If your suggestion is in the nature of an addition (rather than simply an edit), please write it out as you would propose we incorporate it.  Sorry that we cannot be more flexible, but you all understand the schedule that we are operating under.  Thanks
