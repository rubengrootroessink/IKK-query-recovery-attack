I'd let Alan make the call.  As long as we understand the issues well, maybe no reason to take commercial to the mtg.

We spoke with Debra Bolton, counsel for Mirant yesterday.  She believes that this exercise is the result of complaints by Mirant and others as to ISO sheduling practices.  She plans to attend the meeting.  FERC apparently wants to handle these issues "informally" through meetings and mediation rather than through formal complaints.  So...it appears that it will be a "good" meeting, with the various generators and SCs bringing their concerns/gripes to the table.  I will call FERC staff today to get more insight.  We are planning to cover the meeting with Alan, Dave and me.  Should we also take someone from the desk?  Ray

Should we try and agree with the other market participants on a list of issue prior to the meeting?  Maybe coordination also with FERC staff prior to the meeting?  Don't want to appear that this is "ganging up" but we do need to be prepared to go in with a clear idea of what is a "good" meeting.

I made a quick call to Dynegy, WIliams and Reliant to see how they were approaching the meeting. 

Williams and Reliant seem to think this is a very positive step, and are bringing decisionmakers and no attorneys.  They each plan to have 2 - 3 people there.  They see this as an opportunity to have FERC staff ask the ISO some hard questions and demand some answers.

Dynegy is less optimistic.  It currently plans to bring Joel Newton out, its FERC attorney, but that decision is "subject to change." Dynegy agreed that the letter and approach were strange.

All three will have someone there who can make decisions and agree to protocols. We may want to do the same -- if we can get someone to come from the desk.
