Paul -- 

Why so "unhappy"?  Isn't this the best time of your life?  I know that I am truly looking forward to telling my grandkids that I not only worked at Enron, but I survived the "collapse".  

Don't worry about the O drive thing - I'll take care of it.

Jim

I have no clue what you're asking here.  

Happy Holiday Season,

Does everyone have access to the O Drive / Public Affairs directory? 

I'd like to keep an external contact list (PUCs, Utilities, etc.) and any material we are creating (files, documents, etc.) in this area so the entire team has access in case someone is out for the day.

To get into this, go to MY COMPUTER, find the O Drive and then find the Public Affairs folder.  If you don't have access, please let me know.

Thanks, 

Jim

P.S.  If I don't get to speak directly with everyone, I hope that y'all have a safe and happy Holiday Season!  See you in the New Year.
