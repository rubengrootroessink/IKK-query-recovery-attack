Did all of the amendments pass the Appropriations Comm?  When will a new bill get printed?

SBX2 78 (Polanco) passed out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee on a
party line vote as amended.  I faxed the amendments to Houston and San
Francisco.

SBX2 39 (Speier), which grants the CPUC broad authority over generation
facilities, passed out of the Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability
Committee.

SBX2 18 (Burton), which establishes a dedicated rate component, passed out
of the Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee.

SBX2 85 (Burton), which prevents the CPUC from adopting rate hikes up to or
above levels in effect prior to the imposition of 10% rate reduction, passed
out of the Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee.
