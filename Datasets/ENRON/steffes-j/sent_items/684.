Jim,

I am signing up for some correspondence classes to finish off my Bachelors.  I understand that I need to get you to sign off that yes, I am improving my value to Enron by taking them and yes, Enron is aware, and all that other good stuff.  Should I just send everything to you via interoffice?  Or do you want to talk about it in detail?

Thanks!
