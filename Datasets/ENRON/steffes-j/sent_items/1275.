I spoke with Fritz  regarding Kirk House, he confirmed negative push back from "several" parties.  I explained our support for Kirk as it fits the administrations goals on competition etc. He told me to concentrate on the senate which is where the opposition was building its case against Kirk.  He also told me that he would not be sending any names to the seante for awhile until they confirmed next PSC commisioner, probably in Nov.  Clearfield tells me that AT&T is strongly supporting Kirk both at the Gov office as well as the Senate.  I asked Dan to get our support known for Kirk in the Senate, however if AT&T can't get it done I doubt we will have that much of an impact.  We will pursue however to the extent resources allow. SM

I would recommend that either Steve or myself call Bittenbender to recommend Kirk House - we met with him on the RTO discussions.

I received a call from Dan Clearfield this morn.  Nora Mead-Brownell has asked for his assistance in getting marketers to call the governor's office in support of Kirk House who is a former aide and is seeking the position of Small Business Advocate.  Mr. House is a supporter of competition and would be helpful in that position.  Apparently, the electric companies are opposing him. I would recommend that we make the call and I would be happy to do so, however, there are others who may have better contacts than I do (such as Sue in her work with the Governors),  Please advise.

Here is the name and number of the person in the Gov's office that deals with utility issues:  Fritz Bittenbender,783-2896.  The appointment is made by the Gov. (Schweiker).  He has two top aides:  Mark Campbell and Dave Sanko.  I can get you current phone #s for the latter people if you wish them.   Thanks for whatever help Enron can be.
