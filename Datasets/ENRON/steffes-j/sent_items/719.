He called Phil's office today and was told that he would be out of town
until Tuesday.  Jim will call back on Tuesday.

Jim did talk with someone familiar with the bond issuance and he told him
that the Treasurer was "stuck between a rock and a hard place."   The
Treasurer's office is aware of the business community's position regarding
direct access but he said the PUC's hands were tied because AB1x directs the
PUC to suspend direct access.

He also told Jim that he had reviewed the correspondence sent from the
California Chamber and was pleased to see that businesses were willing to
pay exit fees for past energy purchases but that they were still concerned
about who would pay for bonds.

Ultimately, he said that direct access, the Edison bailout and other
outstanding energy issues would probably be worked out in a political
compromise.

I spoke to Sue Mara briefly and told her about the AB1x issue and she said
she would send to me a 1-page document regarding suspension of direct access
and the PUC.  Once I receive it, I will forward it on to Jim so he has it
before he speaks to Phil.

I told Jim that AB1x does not mandate when the CPUC has to suspend direct
access.  I also told him that I thought the Treasurer's advisors were being
very short-sighted about the bond issue since businesses that were denied
direct access would probably pull out of California and really shrink the
number of customers left to pay back the bonds.
