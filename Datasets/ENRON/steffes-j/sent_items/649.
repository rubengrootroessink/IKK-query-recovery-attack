Jim-

I would like to take you up on your offer to have a private meeting with you and Rick Shapiro to discuss the different activities that took place in Enron's Government Affairs office in  Austin.  Considering Austin is one of our satellite offices, I think it would greatly benefit your department to get an insider's perspective on the office, its senior management, and the different interactions/complications that took place over my 5 month tenure in Austin.  

While I realize that ordinarily individuals at your level would not solicit the feedback of a 3rd year analyst, I feel that I have relevant information that could help you better access the situation in Austin.

My extension is 39837.

Regards,

CKL
