I don't know Aldie Warnock.  Thanks for the idea, but I'm going to try and get out of the regulatory world.  Might as well try my hand making $.

I know John Orr and John Meyer.  Not sure about going back to the traveling of RTO world.  Let me think on it.

Let's still do lunch sometime next week.

Thanks.

Jim

Hey Jim,
Thanks for the phone call.  Do you know Aldie Warnock?  He is kind of like
our political whip over here.
Subsequent to this email below, he told me that he was looking for someone
who could serve as a regulatory/FERC advisor to the trade floor - right up
your alley.  He asked me if I knew anyone and I suggested you and gave your
background as an Enron big shot.  He either knew you or knew of you and
said that he wasn't interested.  I really couldn't figure it out, and I
told him I thought the world of you (that may have actually been a negative
though).  I think that he was interviewing a girl from your shop for the
position was her name Christi Nicholae (sp?).  I share this in complete
confidence with you.
So, if you are still interested in talking to us, I would like to set up
lunch with John Orr.  He is an atty who handles most of the RTOs and some
FERC stuff.  John reports to John Meyer if you know him.  He is looking for
someone, but you would be way over qualified.  But, as I suggested before
maybe he could reevaluate what kind of individual he is looking for given
your qualifications.
Let me know what you want to do.

Hi Jim -
I sent Mari an email at home about a position that came up here.  We just
had a guy in our regulatory group leave - his position is much below
anything that you would consider, but given the vacancy, they may be able
to create a higher level position for you.  At this point I am really just
seeing if you would even consider talking to our folks and I haven't
presented it to anyone over here either.  Just thought I would bring it up
considering the situation over there.  If you have some interest maybe we
could set up lunch sometime soon.
By the way congrats on the baby.  Maybe it will be a boy this time.
