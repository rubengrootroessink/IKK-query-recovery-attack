Along with everything else, this bill continues to be discussed.  We don't think this is a high probability, but wanted you to be aware (and more importantly, this is California).  I'll keep you up to date.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott) Senator Soto offered extensive amendments to the bill
immediately prior to today's hearing.  Because the staff did not have time
to review the amendments the bill was held over until Thursday.  Some of the
amendments remove municipal utilities, self cogeneration and QFs from the
provisions of the bill.
