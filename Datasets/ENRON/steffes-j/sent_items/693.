Here are my comments given my very short review of the NGA Statement.

18.3.4	Demand Response 	GOOD

18.5	Improving Energy Transmission	OK	
	talks about "equal access for all suppliers"  
	even though says "oppose preemption", indicate a willingness to better coordinate

18.6	Regulatory 
	hard to read if the section on "no preemption of state regulatory authority" is good or bad...we don't argue that our model preempts any authority, only that transmission service is best defined by FERC.
