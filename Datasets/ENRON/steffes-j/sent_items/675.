I've stopped trying to understand the Utilities in California and what they=
 want - it hurts too much.  But yes, the law allows the Utilities to contin=
ue to collect "something" from customers, including DA customers, for QF co=
sts beyond 3/31/02.

Let me make sure I understand this.  Prior to April 2002, the UDCs want the=
ir QF costs to be as low as possible, since this will cause the PX credit t=
o be lower and thus the positive CTC higher.  However, beginning April 2002=
, they pray for just the opposite -- the greater their QF costs, the more t=
hey can collect from DA customers to help pay for the QFs.
=20
I truly hope I have misunderstood you, else my brain may explode.

Steve --=20

As Sue highlights below, when people talk about stranded costs ending no la=
ter than 3/31/02, they are only speaking about generation-related stranded =
costs.  Above market costs for QFs will be "collected" from DA customers fo=
r some time into the future.  Wanted to make sure that this was clear.

An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August 9:  SCE said that it h=
as TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesn't know what to charge =
for DWR. Meanwhile, it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through =
the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR.  Once the CPUC decides on the =
DWR's revenue requirement, SCE expects that it will charge generation-relat=
ed CTC again.  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that wi=
ll return (and goes beyond 3/31/02) once QF contracts are above the "market=
".  SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance=
 on all these matters. Once the CPUC rules on SCE"s advice letter approache=
s, SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 (it used some diff=
erent PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills=
 going out June 4). I didn't ask the question about calculating CTC back to=
 Jan 18.  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC=
, they will bill it.  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha=
ve a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 10.27 cents (ma=
king it about 10.77 cents) that collects the $400 million that was uncollec=
ted while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surc=
harge.  The half cent addition is for 12 months.

Subject:        Summary or PX Credit Proposals=20


I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August=
 8th.  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything. =20

Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso=
ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enron's exposure to PX credits.  Steve S=
wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal, and his goal is t=
o have recommendations for EWS/EES management on August 14th. =20

Current Issues:=20
1)  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undeterm=
ined (SCE and PG&E have implemented different methodologies)

2)  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (PG&E =
is passing thru to DA customers, SCE is not)=20
3)  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX =
clearing prices from Oct 2, 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised =
PX credits=20

4)  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for T&D=20
5)  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs (CTC or other pass through charg=
es), making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions

6)  Large uncollected receivables from both PG&E and SCE=20


The four proposals are as follows:=20

SCE Recommended Approach=20
        This approach assumes no PX (or PE) credit effective from January 1=
8, 2001 forward.  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the=
  gross PX receivable (as billed by each utility)  which would  be reversed=
.   This approach will ensure that only charges for T&D (no    generation/c=
ommodity costs, CTC charges, or surcharges for CDWR, including the 1 cent) =
 will be applicable to Direct Access customers. =20

        Enron would request the following:=20
        1) Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to=
 EES or EEMC=20
        2) SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an "all=
owable claim" at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if p=
ossible. =20

        3) PG&E will support Enron's recoupment argument=20
        4) Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit =
Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility=
 parent   level.=20

        5) Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits, if=
/when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC=20

        Other consideration:=20
        Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concer=
n re CTC or other surcharge amounts. =20


PG&E Recommended Approach=20
        This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective Janu=
ary 18, 2001 would include an "avoided cost"  component.  This avoided cost=
 =20

        component would include, owned generation, QF purchases, actual CDW=
R purchases for the utility, bilateral purchase contracts, and ISO purchase=
s.        This resulting "avoided cost" would be used in lieu of the PX cle=
aring price in the old PX formula through March, 2002.    If the actual CDW=
R purchase  costs are not included, then the surcharge (along with the embe=
dded gen costs)  should be included in the calculation. =20

       =20
        Enron would request the following:=20
        Same as above=20

        Other Consideration:=20
        Enron  would continue to be exposed to "price" risk attributable to=
 the actions of the utility at a minimum through March, 2002.  This would h=
amper     Enron's ability         to hedge the positions in the retail port=
folio.=20

Hybrid Approach=20
        This approach assumes that the PG&E approach is applicable from Jan=
uary 18, 2001 through September 1, 2001 and that the SCE approach is       =
  applicable from September 1st forward.   This approach might be necessary=
 as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposa=
l.=20

        Enron would request the following:=20
        Same as SCE and PG&E approach=20

        Other considerations:=20
        Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concer=
n re CTC or other surcharge amounts. =20


Enron Model=20
        This approach assumes we continue to support a market based (NP15 a=
nd SP15) calculation methodology for the PX credit.  =20

        Enron would request the following:=20
        It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from eithe=
r PG&E and SCE.   The consensus from legal, regulatory, and EWS commercial =
is        the probability of getting this approach approved is low.   Howev=
er, understanding this amount, at a minimum, can be used to help defend the=
 "value"    Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utiliti=
es and CPUC.

        Other considerations:=20
        This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge "price" risk, b=
ut this is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated wit=
h the     actual collection of the PX credit.


Again, please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu=
ded in Wednesday's meeting.=20

Thanks,=20
