Rick --

Please find attached the asset report in Texas.  Enron's ownership depends on what day the filing is made (for instance, Indian Mesa won't be active until Dec and may be sold immediately).

Also, there is an on-going arbitration with Cornhusker about our ownership right.  Andy Edison has the lead from EWS legal.
