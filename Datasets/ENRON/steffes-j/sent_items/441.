Some more information would be nice.  These seem low.

The back out credits are set at 0.5 mills per kWh for S.C. 13 customers (industrial); 2.0 mills per kWh for S.C. 3 customers (large commercial); 3.0 mills per kWh for S.C. 2 demand customers (small commercial); and 4 mills per kWh for S.C. 2 non-demand, S.C. 6 and S.C. 1 customers (residential).  Theses back out credits will be in effect until the completion of the Unbundling Proceeding where at that time the credits determined from that proceeding will supercede the above credits. 

As for improvement in the market, are you referring to the retail market? If so, I think EES will be able to start marketing in CH territory because not only are we eligible for back out credits, all customers (including retail access customers) are entitled to benefits from the transition power agreement (TPA) with Dynegy and the purchase power agreement (PPA) with Constellation.  If you are interested, I'm happy to summarized the mechanics of how all customers receive those benefits but I don't want to bog you down with unnecessary details unless requested.

Great job.  

What are the back out rates for CH going forward?  Any improvement in the market?

Good news on a dismal day... The New York State Public Service Commission today voted
to approve the joint settlement in the Central Hudson Rate Case.  See the attached press release.  Please contact me with any questions.
