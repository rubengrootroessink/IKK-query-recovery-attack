Subject:  CAEM Board of Directors Meeting

The next meeting of the CAEM Board of Directors will be held on Wednesday,
September 12, at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington, DC.

The meeting is being held in conjunction with the third meeting of our DISCO
of the Future Forum. (Please visit our newly updated website www.caem.org
for more information on the DISCO Forum.) Following the Board meeting on
Wednesday, you are invited to join with members of the DISCO Forum for a
Wednesday evening reception and dinner, including a guest speaker. Board
members are also invited to join in the substantive session of the DISCO
Forum on Thursday, September 13.

Because of an international medical convention ongoing in Washington at the
same time as our meetings, the Grand Hyatt unfortunately is already booked.
However, we have reserved a block of rooms at the nearby Wyndham Hotel. To
reserve one of these rooms, you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are
part of the CAEM group. If you should decide to arrange lodging at a
different hotel, please do so quickly as there is limited availability in
all surrounding hotels. We will be making the Wyndham rooms available to
members of the DISCO Forum on July 20.

If you have any questions or require any assistance at all, please contact
Hope Duncan at 202.739.0134 or Jeff Mangold at 703.729.2710. We are looking
forward to seeing you on September 12.
