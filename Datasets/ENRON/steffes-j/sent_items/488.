Nancy --

I don't understand.  Will this delay the opening of the ERCOT Tx market???  We must do everything possible to open the market on time - Jan 1 2002.

Attached for your information and review are documents concerning market impacts related to conversion to EDI Version 1.4.  An initial plan was presented and discussed at the October 25th RMS meeting, but was not approved.  An RMS workshop is now scheduled for October 31st and November 1st to discuss the options presented and finalize a conversion plan that all MPs and PUCT staff are confident in and can support.  We need to finalize a plan so that all market participants can prepare.  PUCT staff has been actively involved and they also plan to participate in the workshops.  I have also attached a copy of the email that I received from the PUCT staff on their concerns.  I have also sent this information to EES and CSC to solicit feedback.  I would appreciate any feedback that any of you might have and also, please feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
