A few notes.

1.	Be cautious about divestiture.  Remember we own pipes and a electric LDC.

2.	Agree with you that we don't want Utility in merchant role - key issue.

3.	POLR issue involves getting pricing right.

Why don't you put together a note to the CAEM that we can send as our thoughts.  Just the Top 5 issues.

Jim

Attached are summarized the main recommendations of the distco of the future paper and  their impact.
Most recommendations would have a positive impact on competition. However, some recommendations could be potentially dangerous. Besides, it does not have a clear position regarding unbundling: it opens too many unbundling possibilities and discards the extreme, and more effective (divestiture).
I will work on the default supplier paper today.
