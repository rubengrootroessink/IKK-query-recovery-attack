Guillermo --

I should sign the letter.  Also, we should be consistent on affiliates given EPMI and Enron Gas Mktg.  We are affiliates of a pipeline.  We offer competitive services on the affiliated pipelines.  Let's be consistent with our own business.

When are you going to send the letter?

Jim

Attached is a first draft of comments to CAEM about the Disco of the future document to discuss in our 4pm meeting.
The idea is to comment just the top 5 issues.
Regards,
Guillermo
