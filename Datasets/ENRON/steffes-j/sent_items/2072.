If Reliant is interested in filing, we should seriously consider using EPSA.  Reliant is a member of EPSA.  We could get EPSA to work through Larry Robertson maybe.  

Let's discuss next week in Houston.

We should think about it but I wonder if there relation with their utility won't ultimately color the positions they are willing to take.  Let me find out when interventions are due, and we can perhaps discuss it next week in Houston.  We can always intervene separately and then file more substantive comments, etc. jointly.  Jim/Paul, do you want me to call Larry Robertson (AZ counsel) to see if he is available to work on this matter for us?

Leslie,

I had sent a question to my contact in Reliant, it would seem that Reliant is working on an intervention, is this something we would want to join in with?  

As for FERC, in the filing APS I read Commission to mean FERC, when it really was referring to the ACC.

Jim,

Based on your comment, is your concern that if we do intervene and are successful, then APS would find any reason imaginable NOT to do business with Enron?

Thanks,

Dave

is this the "we don't think there is enough wholesale competition in AZ to
allow retail competition to occur, so we "are willing" to let the retail
customers in AZ to buy our merchant plants with an 11% return" filing?  I
am not involved , but I understand we have a  high level group that is
working on a response to APS' ludicrous filing and will be lobbying at the
ACC and AZ legislature on this one.  It is simply uncomprehensible how APS
could think that it makes sense to make such a filing in the same state
whose commission staff seems to think that there is too much merchant
generation being built.

Dan,

Are you familar with this document?  I have just gottne a copy and it
proves how much contempt APS has for deregulation.  Some of the
statements this document contain are unbelievable...If you have any
insights to this I'd be interested in talking to you about this.

Thanks,

Dave

P.S., I hope all went well with your surgery.
