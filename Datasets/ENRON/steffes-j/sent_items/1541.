Thanks.  

Diann, I know that the last few months (year?) has been tough on all of us.  I appreciate everything you've done.  Thanks.

Jim

Jim, this is a residential customer.  Because of the large number of  termination DASRs we issued en masse  in June, the UDC's did not respond to all.  CSC has been cleaning up these straggler's for the past month and have issued new deDASR's on them.

The one you have listed here is in a de-activating status.

I hope this clarifies and closes this issue.  (just kidding.)  

I'm on vacation 'til next year.  If you need to reach me, please page me.

Diann -

Sorry about all of this confusion regarding residential customers.

This guy was listed on the Ken spreadsheet (about T&D bills) as being an EES customer in November.  Is this a residential account?  

Thanks,

Jim
