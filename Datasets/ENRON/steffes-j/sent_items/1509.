We are about to make an HSR filing with the federal government regarding the sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural. In that regard, we are required to make certain disclosures regarding our analysis of the transaction. 

I would appreciate it if you would review the attached memo and either provide the appropriate materials to me or confirm that you have no documents responsive to the request.

Please review and respond immediately to let me know whether you have any materials. We are nearing the deadline for filing our HSR. In particular, if you have a copy of any of the following documents, please let me know:

	(1) Draft information memorandum from Credit Suisse dated March 2001
 
    (2) Information memorandum from Credit Suisse prepared in August of 1999
 
    (3) Portland General management presentation dated June 2001.

 


Thanks.

Paul
