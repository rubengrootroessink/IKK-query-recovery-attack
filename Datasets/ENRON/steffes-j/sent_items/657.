This meeting is tomorrow, but when you head up to Portland -- could you see if there is any interest in responding to this FERC request through WPTF or otherwise? (we have to pay, of course)

Subject: Comments Due on FERC June 19 Order


The FERC's June 19th "market mitigation" order provided that parties could file follow-up comments within 60 days with regard to how the market has functioned under the Order and what changes should be made to the mitigation approaches.  The specific language provides as follows:

  _____  

"8. Mitigation Beyond Summer 2001
Although we are confident of the efficacy of our West-wide mitigation plan throughout the Summer of 2001, we nonetheless wish to obtain comment for the purpose of revising the mitigation methodology for future periods, if necessary.  Accordingly, we invite interested partes to file with the Commission comments and proposals concerning: (1) any developments, either beneficial or adverse, which have occurred in the Western region spot markets as a result of this order; (2) any difficulties with implementation of the mitigation plan detailed in the order, and the relevant solutions thereto; and, most importantly (3) any alternative market mitigation approaches. In order to provide for timely review and analysis, we will require that parties' comments and proposals be submitted to the Commission within 60 days of the date of issuance of this order."

  _____  

At tomorrow's WPTF Board meeting we will be discussing the filing of comments, which would be due next Monday, in response to this invitation.  This email is a heads-up that it would be helpful for Board members to begin sending comments and suggestions with regard to the three topics noted above.  Thanks!
