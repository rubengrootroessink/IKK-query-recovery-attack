Do we need to have a phone call with you, Harry K., Charles Y., Sarah N., Christi N., John Shelk, Gloria O., Vinio Flores to make sure that Enron is on the same page?  I don't think that we will see much support from the business people, although maybe you and I can sit down with Evan Hughes to get his buy-in.

Let me know.

Jim

The attached documents were developed by the Uniform Business Practices Governance Committee and have been distributed to the UBP memberships for comments.  A meeting has been scheduled of our group on September 25th and 26th in St Louis to review comments and hopefully come up with a final document.  I would appreciate your review and comments on these documents.  I need to have these comments back to the committee by COB Tuesday, September 18th.  Thanks for your time and consideration.
