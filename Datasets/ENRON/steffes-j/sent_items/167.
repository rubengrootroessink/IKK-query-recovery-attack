Don't know where you guys are with the negotiations, but here is another small issue with PG&E that would be nice to work through with them.

Yes, that's the point.  PG&E should have used the existing accumulated credit balances to clear the final DEBIT bills.  Instead, they cleared Enron's credit balances BEFORE they calculated the final bill.  Then they transferred the amount, which Enron is responsible for, to the customers' first utility bill.

Diann --

So it is correct to say that EES is responsible for the final bills?  If yes, how much $$ is this?

The customer is not entitled to the credits.  The credits were transferred, then final DA bills calculated and transferred to the customer.  The customer is NOT responsible for these final bills.  Had PG&E not transferred the Enron credits, the final debit bills would have been taken against the credits.

I am a little confused.  Why would the customers be entitled to a credit on bundled service?  EES owns the credits.

Jim,  as far as we know, PG&E is doing this on residential accounts only.  Remember that residential contracts were terminated in May and all accounts returned to utility service.  Instead of using the accumulated credits to clear the final direct access bills, PG&E transferred the credits, then calculated the final amounts.  These debits were then transferred to the customers PG&E bills.  These accounts were NOT reDASRed, so they are no longer Enron customers.  

I have requested a list of all credits transferred from Enron residential customers accounts, plus a listing of direct access bills transferred to these customers.  In the meantime, I feel we need to submit a formal request.

Diann --

I was under the impression that we had taken all necessary steps to protect our customers?  Is this problem just related to residential customers?

All, I finally got an answer from PG&E concerning the residential customer who had an amount transferred to his utility bill after he was switched from direct access.  PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.  

PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers' first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection.

I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved.  However, I have not sent a written request.  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request.

We also have an issue with SCE.  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.   If you recall, their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts.  If that is indeed their process, this is inconsistent.
