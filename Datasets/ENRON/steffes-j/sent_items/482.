Hi Steve.  Are you able to jump on this call?  I could if you aren't able I could listen and pass the info on.  As is referenced in this e mail, FERC hasn't issued any thing yet on their agenda or schedule.

Attached is a list of questions that are to be considered at the CREPC meeting.  To date, we do not have the agenda for the FERC meeting but will send it out when it becomes available.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Erin Perrigo/EPSA call.
