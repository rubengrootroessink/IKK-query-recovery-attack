Subject: ESC Bylaws


Gentlemen,
 
At the ESC meeting last week, some discussion was brought forth about the voting model and bylaws of the ESC.  I joined a small task group to investigate various structures and such.
 
I have attached a strawman set of Bylaws for the ESC that I have written.  I would like to get your input on these items as soon as possible.  The small focus group will be working to determine an appropriate model, and will be using the NERC 8-sector model as its starting point.  I would like to propose this 5-sector model instead, as I think it more closely aligns with the way business works and builds the approriate motivational structure.  There may need to be more detail in the sector definitions, as right now they are somewhat loose.
 
Thanks in advance for your comments.
 

Andy
