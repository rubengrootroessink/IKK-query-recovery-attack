Jim/Paul:

I think given Mary's work with the developers in CA on the environmental side that these kinds of issues are consistent.   I spoke with her today, and she'd be happy to help out.  She indicated she would try to get together with Sue Mara when Sue is back in the office.   After they meet, they'll come back with a plan for covering these issues and we'll bring everyone up to date.

Thanks,

Jeff

FYI.  Can Mary Schoen help us out on this stuff.  We need to first evaluate the rulemaking against our interests, then determine whether IEP can handle it for us.

A number of things are falling through the cracks --Dave Parquet's siting concerns is one of them.  I have had NO time to work on this stuff-- any suggestions? ANother one is EES's need to file data with the CEC -- I just realized I was waiting for something from EES months ago and never followed up. I'm sure there is more.

Subject: CEC Siting Regulation: Staff Report and Business Mtg. Scheduled
for Sept 12


Recently, the CEC initiated a Rulemaking on siting.  The purpose is to
review and rewrite the Commisison's Rules related to siting of new
generation.  As the Siting Committee has failed to convince the full
Commission of how best to proceed, the Commission is scheduling a Business
Meeting on Sept . 12 to discuss this matter and, presumedly, provide the
Commission direction.

Attached is a staff report laying out the issues.

IEP is monitoring this matter through its Regulatory Committee.  Presently,
staff plans to attend the meeting.  Comments on the staff report prior to
the Business meeting on the 12th,  as well as comments on other matters
related to the Commission's Rules regarding siting, would be advantageous.

IEP is interested in hearing from company's willing to fund a stronger
intervention (i.e. the development of comments, etc.) than mere presence at
the Business meeting.  Please contact Steven Kelly ASAP if your company is
interested in IEP developing comments on this matter.
