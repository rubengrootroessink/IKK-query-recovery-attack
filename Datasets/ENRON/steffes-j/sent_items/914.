I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.

While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that ge=
nerators "may" have withheld power, the basic argument is that "DEREGULATIO=
N ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED."   In addition, the paper=
 states that "MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE=
S TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICIT=
Y DEREGULATION."

In addition, California's response of "DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -=
- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS=
."

I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat=
 on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental =
market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financi=
al and political crisis.  The CBO finds that "WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES =
WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED=
 MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET"..because "FEATURES OF THE RESTR=
UCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF =
THE ELECTRICITY MARKET."

Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (toge=
ther with our details of the policy failures).  This CBO report clearly und=
ercuts the "political" arguments of the Davis administration who had every =
opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible l=
ong-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consume=
rs.

Subject to receiving more information, my recommendation is not to make a "=
federal case" out of the CBO report.  In other words, we should be aware of=
 Dave's comments and concerns, but I would not suggest we contact CBO or an=
ything like that.  If others think some response is needed, this is the typ=
e of thing EPSA should do, if done at all.  We should refrain from carrying=
 water for the generators.  The report is being written up favorably in the=
 trade press I have seen, largely because the CBO report says that what Cal=
ifornia did was NOT deregulation and thus the crisis was not caused by dere=
gulation.  That "60,000 feet" view is worth a mint politically and while th=
ere are parts of the report that we differ with, I think its value far outw=
eighs its blemishes.

John,

My take on the paper is that is wasn't particularly flattering to the gener=
ators/suppliers.  It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had=
 addressed and that the ISO did not implement.  It is reasonably sound as f=
ar as "history of the formation" is concerned but some of their statements =
and conclusions I have to take issue with. =20

Off the top of my head, they use the term "idle".  In my mind as a utility =
person, idle means available but just not running.  As they apply the term,=
 they use it to describe any unit not running, either because it was forced=
 off or was off for maintenance, I realize it's only a word, but it carries=
 many different inferences, mostly unfavorable.  Early in the document they=
 refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding su=
pply to manipulate the price.  They never substantiate this claim.  In fact=
 as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case sho=
wing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high pric=
es, but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have und=
erstood the full picture.  They also don't really touch on the lack of supp=
ly side response.  According to Greg Conlin, the President of the P{UC when=
 AB1890 in CA was designed, was a key part to the equation, they spend litt=
le, if any time discussing how this part of the puzzle never developed.  Th=
ey also give insuffucient explaination of the "per-se" reasonablness clause=
....There are other more specific instances I can send to you at a later ti=
me.

I left my notes on the document back in my office, I can give you a summary=
 early next week if that's OK.  I am currently fact gathering about PJM and=
 NYISO congestion models with Steve Walton for RTO West...

Thanks,

Dave

Like most sources of information in DC, folks on the Hill pick and choose t=
hose that support their pre-conceived policy notions.  Having said that, th=
e CBO is a respected source of information.  I read the summary and have th=
e full report in my "to read" stack.  The summary actually made the report =
sound largely favorable from our perspective.  It wouldn't hurt to have a l=
ittle more detail on the problems with the report as you see them so we can=
 decide whether we need to do anthing or just be ready should a CBO witness=
 testify at a hearing. =20

John,

How much weight and influence do papers published by the CBO have with poli=
cy makers there in DC?  I have some concerns about the general tone and som=
e of the conclusions contained in the report.  If these papers draw little =
attention, then , no harm, no foul.  But if policy makers tend to draw from=
 these papers, then perhaps we need to correct or address some of the issue=
s raised in this report.

Thanks,

Dave

Subject:=09Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis - by the CBO

Jim,

Last week some time I had been on the distribution of a paper published by =
the CBO entitled, "Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis".  In re=
viewing this paper several things struck me.  The paper is not particularly=
 accurate, they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse, they ign=
ore the lack of implementation of demand-side response programs that were s=
upposed to be a integral part of the AB1890 and they use inappropriate term=
s, such as "Idle" when describing plants that were unavailable because of m=
aintenance or repair.

My reason for writing is to ask you, how politically influential is a paper=
 like this?  Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on =
problems, especially with those associated with the problems experienced in=
 CA?  And if so, because of some of the mis-representations it contains, do=
 we want to develop a fact sheet for our folks in DC to use to refute some =
of the claims made in this paper?

Thanks,

Dave
