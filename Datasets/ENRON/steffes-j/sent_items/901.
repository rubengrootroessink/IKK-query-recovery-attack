Hello Jim, I was wondering if you could help me in finding the current outlook in deregulation in the following states: 

NC, SC, WI, MS, GA, TN

I don't need any elaborate research, as this is only for some estimates in current position values for origination purposes.  The month and year of estimated dereg will do.  Thanks in advance for your help.
