According to the Stipulation we entered with SCE and approved by the ALJ:

"If the MOU is implemented and the PE Advice Letter adopted, SCE will commit to pay the energy credit to the Enron ESPs . . . using the methodology it employed up to January 5, 2001 for energy provided to direct access customers of those ESPs through and including January 18, 2001."

Mike Day, are we in a position now to send a letter to Edison demanding immediate payment?
