Jim - This is the SDS deal we pulled of with NUI worth approx. $200,000.  By way of background, EES had lost the original bid in spring 2001.  They contacted me in July to see what, if any, information was available as to why we lost the bid.  Most of the info is not public and hence was n/a. EES had won the bid last year and NUI kept our info confidential as well.  With a minimal amount of time and through my relationship with Maloney, NUI agreed to an Off Tariff deal with us giving us our original terms and conditions.  They also agreed to eliminate the SDS volumetric limitations for future bids.  SM

Steve,  

The NUI/EES Letter of Agreement for the "SDS" storage service has been signed by both Enron and NUI.  September gas is scheduled for delivery to NUI.  This service will ensure that certain customer types will receive firm gas all winter.  Kenneth Maloney, of Cullen and Dykman, was helpful and responded quickly to my submitted draft comments, as well as returning a signed copy via fax.  

Your opinions, suggestions, and direct involvement with NUI on my behalf have proven invaluable in the resolution of this matter.  I want to thank you (perhaps personally on your next Houston trip) for your efforts.  I also want to share this email with others here on the gas desk that may have been unaware of your participation.
Again, many thanks.

Sincerely,

Paul Tate
