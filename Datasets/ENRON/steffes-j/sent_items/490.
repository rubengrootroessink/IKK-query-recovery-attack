I was hoping to meet with PGE (but will hold off it is imprudent).  Christi has reviewed something.  I'll loop her in to find out all the details.

Robert Neustaedter has worked up an analysis of the PGE and PP&L programs.  Ree:  who can we meet with to discuss--do you mean at PGE or at ENA?  

Let's figure out whether the rumor of a punitive imbalance charge is true before we do anything more.

Ok.  It seems that (1) we should try and get a handle on AZ - Leslie Lawner please put something together and (2) need a Market Plan on NV - Pat Keene put together.  

Paul, I appreciate the issue with OR but I'd like to know what is the opportunity and make sure that PGE is not destroying our chances - Christi got wind of a Imbalance pgm that was punative to marketers.  Who can we meet with to discuss?

Jim

I also hate Arizona--regulation.  Too much of an inside game, too much like Chicago--except hotter, dryer, hillier and more Republican.  

Anyway ... I do not like (at all) the idea of pushing anything in Oregon right now and probably won't like it for about 6-9 months.  

Re:  Nevada--we need a comprehensive approach to the state ASAP.  

Re:  New Mexico.  Well ...

I hate Arizona.  I just sent you a message that changes things a little about the state, anyway.  We can out a memo together, however, Pat Keene is doing Nevada I know.  I can summarize AZ and NM.

Seems to me that we need to engage in AZ (along with NV and OR?) in the Western states to try and push competition forward.  Why don't we first assemble a (1) what we know - what we don't know memo and then (2) look at oppotunities to push our agenda.  

Leslie - everyone is looking to you to lead us to the promised land in AZ...  GO GET 'EM!!!!!!

Mark Frankena is now an advisor to the Chair of the FTC.   Leslie--when do you start?

I don't think past absences of reasoned decision making by the ACC should prejudice our attempt to re-engage, if there is a cause worth fighting for.  We had a good case then, and they blew us off.  One of the guys mainly responsible for that has since been run out of the state.   It's not like opportunities are as abundant as they once were nor are the commercial people going to go out of their way to tell us to engage.  Retail guys periodically ask about AZ but there is little to tell them.  If we see a worthy cause, let's go for it.   

Leslie - where do we start?

We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).

My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).

APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  

Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.

Are we (or EPSA) taking an active role in the filing APS made with the Arizona Commission to use the unregulated affiliate of its parent as the wholesale provider of last resort?  (There's an article on the filing in today's Electric Power Daily that says they've filed to push back the requirement that they purchase 100% of their power from the competitive market by 2004 to a requirement that they purchase 25% of their power competitively by 2008).
