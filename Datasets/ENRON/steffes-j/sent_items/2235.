Thanks.  

Let's get together (just you and I) and figure out how we can make sure our teams are working together.  I am sure that you don't want to worry about this stuff any more than I do.  How about for 15 minutes after the EES Op Comm on Monday?

Jim

Evan,

I copy of the Bond Extension Certification was sent to the ICC (Donnal Caton) today.  Again, this certificate was orginally sent on 5/11/01.

Have A Good Weekend!


Craig

Evan, If EES Services Group has the EES Illinois bond expiring June 2002, please send a copy to the Illinois Commerce Commission for Enron's files.

Thanks,
Gloria

This is a quick recap from the Services Group perspective.  I have asked Rebecca Fite to get with Gloria and try and connect what appears to be a disconnect.

Thanks,

Evan

Evan,

Attached is a matrix that identifies our current State Licenses.  We work directly with EES Legal for license renewals and new registrations.  As Craig has indicated below, our records indicate we are current for both Licensing and Bond Requirements in Illinois at a State Level.

As EES is currently pursuing Supplier Billing Option (SBO) behind Commonwealth Edison, we will have to comply with the credit worthiness requirements outlined by Gloria, but my understanding of her email indicates we currently meet these standards and will only be required to supply funds in the event our credit rating drops further.

Please feel free to contact either of us with questions.

Regards,
Rebecca

Evan,

As you know, the license application function was migrated to the Service Desk in August 2001.  This activity was previously maintained by Beth Gooden.  In any case, our records show that EES is current and compliant.  EES was granted a retail license in August 1999.  To maintain the license, EES must submit an annual "Re-certification" and keep a bond current.  A Re-certification application was submitted on 1/31/01 and the  bond was extended through 6/1/02.

I hope this answers your concerns.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and/or require further information.



Craig
