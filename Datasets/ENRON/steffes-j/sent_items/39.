This outside bill assumes I am acting as Enron attorney and Pat Keene is the witness.  Can this go to the RCR for next week?

I will assume two hours of my time for testimony review and about four hours for Rob Kinas to fly up to Reno and back (I realize this is generous, but I don't know the place schedule or whether he can do any useful work in transit, so I thought I would give you worst case).  That's probably about $1,600 plus expenses.  You could knock off at least two hours if Rob can admit you from the Las Vegas office of the Commission.  Usually the PUCN allows parties to participate via teleconference in Las Vegas if the hearing is in Carson City and vice versa.  It would also save you the airfare and car rental (its cheaper than a cab even if you are only staying in Carson City a short while) for Rob.  However, I urge you and your witness to appear live in Carson City.

P.S.  When did Enron become such a tightwad?
