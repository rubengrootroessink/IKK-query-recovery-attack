Sarah & Alan --

I plan on attending.  Both of you should feel free.  I think that right now we should decline any offer to present unless we can come up with a set of "Guiding Principles" (i.e., prospective market rules, etc.)

Subject: EPSA Regulatory Affairs Panel on Market-Based Rate Methods



As mentioned in a July 31st memo, EPSA will be hosting a one-day roundtable discussion on the issue of market-based rate methods, as well as EPSA's forward-looking position on the subject.  The meeting will begin with lunch at 11:30 a.m., officially start at noon, and end at approximately 5:00 p.m..  Unless the group is too large, the meeting will be held at EPSA's office at 1401 New York Avenue, NW, in Washington, DC.  An agenda will be sent out closer to the meeting.

We would like to start the meeting with different members' views on the issue and have been approached by member companies who would like to make brief presentations on the topic.  If any Board member company would like to present on the issue, please contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 by noon on Tuesday, September 4th.  If you would like to attend this meeting and have not already responded, RSVP to Jackie Gallagher at jgallagher@epsa.org.
