We should intervene based on our potential interest in serving customers pursuant to AB661(short answer=Paul's language).  It is possible that we may want to reduce revenue requirements by recommending the use of financial products to minimize utility revenue risk. We have intervened in the AB 661 regulation proceeding as Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. If you think we can raise issues outside of "unbundling" we should limit our intervention to EES and EPMI.

Pat,

Shall I use the language proposed by Paul or would you like me to say
something different?  Please let me know ASAP as I would like to get the
petition filed today.  Thanks.

Bonnie

We have intervened in certain cases where we may have an ongoing
commercial interest to require "rate unbundling" in anticipation of
direct access.  We also can intervene on behalf of EWS who may provide
risk mgt. products to reduce utility rates (i.e., weather derivitives to
stabilize rates and reduce utility-reated risk).  In this case we are
there to make sure rates are properly unbundled to facilitate AB 661.

By this e-mail, I'm forwarding this to Pat Keene.  He will be your main
contact on Nevada matters for a while.  I'm swamped processing the
filings for the sale of PGE.  My view is that it should be both ENA and
EES.  Our interest is:  (1) we are a potential new electric resource
under AB 661; and (2) these cases will influence whether we can serve
customers under the statute as the unbundled costs incurred by our
potential customers will be determined in this case.

Pat:  What do we say in other states where we intervene and there is no
direct access?  I'd rather not say that we that we are representing the
interests of several large consumers in Nevada.  It opens our deals up
for discovery.

Paul,

As I was preparing the petition to intervene, it occurred to me that
information has changed.  Do you want the petition to reflect both ENRON
ENERGY SERVICES, INC. and ENRON NORTH AMERICA.  Also, since you do not
own LV Cogen anymore, what would you like me to put as the reasons for
intervention for these entities.  I have attached a draft petition.  It
needs to be filed on Wednesday.

Thanks for your assistance.

Bonnie
