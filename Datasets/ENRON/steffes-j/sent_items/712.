A couple questions --

1.=09Could the company include distribution wires as well, instead of being=
 just a transmission only wires?
2.=09How many shares would a divesting company get?  Could this be more tha=
t 5%?  If so, wouldn't this be over the "control" threshold?

In general, I fully support this type of action. =20

Jim, Sarah and Rick,

=09The following describes the suggestion that I made in our meeting this m=
orning.  This is a strategy which could only be executed in legislation. =
=20

The Problem:

One of the chief difficulties of forming a Transco are the tax consequences=
 of divestiture of assets. The problem was identified in 1995 when we first=
 started talking about a Transco in the West.   If the parties agree in adv=
ance of divesture to combine their assets with others into a new company, t=
he divestiture creates a tax event.  As a result, the Transco's like Allian=
ce or TransConnect have adopted an LLC structure to avoid the tax consequen=
ces of formation.  The problem with the LLC form is the reluctance of the o=
wners to surrender all control of their assets to the Managing Member who h=
as "little skin in the game."  Questions have also been raised by opponents=
 about the fiduciary responsibilities of Managing Member.  Are they to look=
 out of the financial interests of the owners (passive and active)?  All th=
ese issues came up when we were working with various companies in 1999-2000=
 on possible pipe/wire companies.

The Suggestion:

Create a short window during which utilities could divest their assets into=
 a Transco without facing a tax penalty.  Under such a provision, current o=
wners would be allowed to agree in advance to combine their assets to form =
a new company without taxes being levied on the spin off, as long as the ne=
w company was a transmission only company.  The shareholders of the contrib=
uting companies would received publicly traded shares in the new company, s=
o there is no issue of the original company controlling the Transco.  The F=
ederal Treasury is tax neutral, since without the provision the Transco doe=
sn't form.  When the shareholders of Transco sell their shares, the are tax=
able, if the Transco becomes more valuable, then the benefit accrues to Tre=
asury in taxes on the sale of the stock.  With a two year window, the compa=
nies would be faced with a one time opportunity to make the shift and avoid=
 taxes.  This become a trigger for breaking up the vertical integration for=
 which a business case can be made the shareholders of today's owners are b=
etter off.


=09Thanks for listening (reading).

Steve
