    "Is it  Possible to Restructure Retail Electric Markets?" Tuesday, Nove=
mber 6,  2001, at 10 am (MST), 12 Noon (EST)  The catastrophic failure of  =
California's restructuring efforts, coupled with extremely low switching  r=
ates in overseas and various U.S. state markets, raises anew the debate  ov=
er whether it is even possible to restructure retail electric markets.  Is =
there something fundamentally different about electric markets that  render=
 them impossible to open? Over the past quarter-century, numerous  once-reg=
ulated industries, such as financial services, airlines, and  telecommunica=
tions, have been successfully restructured. Why is  electricity an outlier?=
 Will it change?  Two distinguished industry  analysts, Ken Malloy, CEO of =
 the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets and publisher of the RED =
 Index, and Dr. Mark Cooper,  Director of Research for Consumer Federation =
of America, will debate two  interrelated propositions:   1. All retail cus=
tomers  should be required to choose a new energy supplier.  2. Non-commodi=
ty  products--such as demand-side management, distributed generation, green=
  power, and combined heat and power--will penetrate faster and more deeply=
  in open retail markets than they would under the continuation of  traditi=
onal regulation.   To Register Registration fee is  $50 for each dial-in co=
