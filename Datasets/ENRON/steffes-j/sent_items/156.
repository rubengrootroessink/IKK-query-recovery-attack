Subject: FW: Federal Register notices - 417R Changes


The DOE is requesting comments from industry regarding proposed changes to an EIA form EIA-417R for reporting "Electric Power System Emergency Report".  This is being revised to become EIA-417 "Electric Emergency Incident and Disturbance Report".  Reporting will be reduced from the existing >3300 entities to approximately 200 control area operators, RTOS, and Security Coordinators.   

However, "Any utility, businesss entity, or energy concern that participates in the electric power industry could be notified by DOE that it needs to provide technical information concerning a particular incident."

There are a series of questions in the notice (attached) directed towards those responsible for providing responses to the form and those utilizing the data.

NERC is developing a response to these forms and I anticipate that many of their utility members will point out that the traders and IPPs need to be included due to the interdependency on the market/trading systems for energy supply.

For the control area data, I ask that Keith and Lloyd review the new form since we are still operating a control area.

I will track the NERC comments - and if need be, may ask Dan Watkiss to draft comments to DOE to protect our interests.

Charles Yeung
