The $$ should come from the business people.

Jean, 

I have received a request to register EES and EPMI as members of ERCOT's board for 2002.
The deadline is 11/16th. The applicable fees are $2,000 for EPMI (Corporate level), and $500
for EES (Associate level). I have the relevant forms. Let me know if you are handling that from 
Austin or how you want to proceed. Also, who will need to cut the checks ?

Thanks,
Gloria
