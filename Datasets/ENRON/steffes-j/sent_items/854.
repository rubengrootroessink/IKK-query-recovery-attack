Jean --

What is Doug going to say?  Do we have the right messages?  What about the retail issues in Texas?  Have we considered these?

Jim

Doug wants to come to Austin and meet with legislators and regulators. I am setting up meetings for him next week.  
 
The purpose of the Wednesday 9/5 meeting that I requested is to get input from everyone involved with issues in Texas prior to the legislative hearing on Friday, 9/7.  There are numerous issues and we need coordination among the group. 
 
Christi, I will ask Bevin to find a date for a meeting with Doug, Mike, EES traders, EES/ENA attorneys and the regulatory group working on Texas issues for early September as you suggested.  Meanwhile, are the rest of you available at any time on Wednesday 9/5 and can you get your list of issues (requested in the earlier email) prepared and sent to me by late Tuesday?   Thanks, Jean

I cannot meet on Wed. 9/5 because I have to write the marketer response to the SE RTO (due by COB and I have to incorporate all marketer comments).  Also, Doug Gilbert Smith is not available on Wed afternoons.  Let's plan for  the next week if possible.  Thanks and please get input from Doug for the pre-hearing meeting.

It would be great if we could meet on Wednesday, Sept. 5th.  
 
On Friday, Sept. 7th the electric restructuring oversight committee is holding an interim legislative hearing regarding ERCOT/market issues.  Invited testimony only; invited to testify are ERCOT and the Chairman of the PUC.  On Thursday, we are having a pre-hearing meeting with Rep. Wolens and Senator Sibley to brief them on the issues we would like addressed at the hearing on Friday.  
 
First, could everyone please forward a list of the issues that you are working on in Texas?  Second, are there any specific issues or questions you would like to have legislators ask of ERCOT or PUC Chairman?  Could I have both of these lists by Tuesday.  If I can get this information from you, the briefing of legislators will be more meaningful which will make the hearing more meaningful.    
 
Please let me know if you can meet on Wednesday.  Thanks, Jean

Doug Gilbert-Smith talked with me today about some issues in ERCOT.  I think it would be beneficial to have a 1/2 day or so meeting in Houston with all of our Texas team, bringing in Doug and the EES traders and EES/ENA attorneys after we have chatted first.  If ok with all of you, I'll have my assistant set it up early Sept.
