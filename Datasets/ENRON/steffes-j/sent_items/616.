Dear James,
I noticed your involvement in the Center for the Advancement of Energy
Markets and I would like to invite you to join the Council of Energy
Advisors, an association of petroleum engineers, electrical engineers,
petroleum geologists, consultants, power traders, and energy professionals
whom we pay their hourly rate to fill out brief online surveys and/or
consult part-time by telephone on issues of power and energy products and
services for investment managers.  I think that your knowledge of the power
and energy industry would be a valuable addition to the Council.  Membership
in the Council is free; you can register online at
http://www.thecouncils.com/peapp.asp (a quick 5-minute form).
We pay Advisors variable rates for surveys depending on the time commitment
and their customary consulting rates for telephone consultations. You may
decline any survey or consultation that is not in your area of interest or
should you not have the time; you are therefore not making any time
commitment by joining.  Also, Advisors are never asked to answer questions
about their own employers; we don't create any appearance of a potential
conflict of interest.

The Council of Energy Advisors includes members from leading universities,
organizations, and firms such as SPE, EPRI, ABB, TVA, MIT, Square D,
Calpine, Halliburton, Schlumberger, Enron, Mirant, Exxon, Shell. BP and
Chevron. The Council has more than 400 engineers, petroleum professionals,
technology solution end users, independent consultants and researchers
working at utilities and solution design consultancies, leaders on IEEE
standards bodies and thought leaders in the industry.  Our clients include
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Salomon Smith Barney, Fidelity Fund Management,
JP Morgan and about ninety other leading investment firms on both coasts.

Our web site at www.thecouncils.com gives more information about our work.
Please take some time to consider the Council, look over our website, and
let me know what you think.  I look forward to working with you.

Best regards,
Matt
