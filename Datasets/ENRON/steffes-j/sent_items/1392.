Friends--

Whatever the coming days or weeks may bring, I wanted to make sure we could stay in touch.

Here's a web page with my contact information and a place for you to type in yours, if you wish: http://www.blr.net/friends/   

Feel free to pass this email along to anyone you think appropriate.  Thanks!
