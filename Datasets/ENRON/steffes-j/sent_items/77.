MEMORANDUM
 
TO:     Members of the CAEM  Board of Directors
BY:      Jeff Mangold, Vice President of Administration
RE:     September Meeting - - RSVP Requested
Date:  August 22, 2001
 
The next meeting of the CAEM Board of Directors will be held on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 12, at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington, DC. 
 
We will begin the meeting with a luncheon at 12 noon. The substantive session will be from 1 to 5 p.m. Following the Board meeting on Wednesday, you are invited to join with members of the DISCO of the Future Forum for an evening reception and dinner, including a guest speaker, beginning at 6:30. Board members are invited to join in the substantive session of the DISCO Forum on Thursday, September 13. A complete agenda and meeting materials will be forwarded to you shortly.
 
At this time we would request your RSVP for three events:
- The Wednesday Board Meeting
- The Wednesday evening reception and dinner
- The Thursday meeting of the DISCO of the Future Forum
 
We also remind you of the international convention ongoing in Washington at the same time as our meetings, and the need to make hotel reservations as soon as possible. No rooms remain at the Grand Hyatt.
 
It is still possible to reserve a room in the CAEM block at the nearby Wyndham Hotel (see below). Just inform the Wyndham staff that you are part of the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets group when requesting a reservation. If you should decide to arrange lodging at a different hotel, please do so quickly as there is limited availability in all surrounding hotels.
 
If you have any questions or require any assistance at all, please contact Hope Duncan at 202.739.0134 or Jeff Mangold at 703.729.2710. We are looking forward to seeing you on September 12.
 
Information on the DISCO of the Future Forum, as well as our recently released report on gas deregulation, can be found on our newly redesigned website, www.caem.org << File: www.caem.org >>
