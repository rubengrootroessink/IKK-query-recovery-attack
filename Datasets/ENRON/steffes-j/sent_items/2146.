I'll send it on to Steve Roskow.  Could you please respond to him that neither we nor the COmmission agreed with SCE's arbitrary date and that SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on rehearing (D 01-10-036), which required SCE to continue to except DASRs as long as the contract was signed on or before 9-20-01.

Diann,

I received your attached customer list dated 11/1/01, however, per the
attached note sent to you on 10/03/01, SCE's deadline to submit a certified
customer list was 10/5/2001. SCE will use the list you submitted on 10/5/01
@ 3:58pm (attached below) as your certified list.


(See attached file: SCE 011005.xls)

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct access
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC order
states:

     "The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or verification
of any new arrangements for direct access
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited" (Ordering
             Paragraph No. 4).

             and,

            "PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access service
requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed
             or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001."
(Ordering Paragraph No. 7).

In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern California
Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have
written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001,
for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject to
verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce
evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following
information must be included for each customer on this list for your DASR
to be eligible for future processing:

Please include the following information for each customer on this list:

     ?    Customer Name
     ?    Service Account Number
     ?    Service Address
     ?    Contract Date

This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at
Sheila.Advani@sce.com, no later than
     5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Monday, September 24, 2001

For those direct access customers that have certified contracts or verified
agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, ESPs must submit the
respective "connect" Direct Access Service Requests (DASRs) within 30
calendar days following the effective date of the order.  All "connect"
DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list,
will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any "connect" DASRs
after 5:00 p.m., October 20, 2001.  SCE will continue to accept
"disconnect" and "update" DASRs (for changes to billing and/or metering
options) for existing Direct Access customers.

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.
