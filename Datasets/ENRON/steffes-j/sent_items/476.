Subject:	Conference Call to Prepare for Seattle FERC & CREPC Meetings

Erin Perrigo will hold a conference call on Monday, October 29th at 11:00 a.m. EST to discuss the meetings next week in Seattle - the Western Interstate Energy Board's Committee on Regional Electric Power Cooperation (CREPC) (held October 31st - November 1st) and FERC's meeting to discuss Western infrastructure issues (November 2nd).

Attached is a list of questions that are to be considered at the CREPC meeting.  To date, we do not have the agenda for the FERC meeting but will send it out when it becomes available.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Erin Perrigo/EPSA call.
