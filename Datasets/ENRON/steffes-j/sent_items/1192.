RSVP REQUESTED -- RSVP REQUESTED

You are invited to participate in a Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion on November 20 to explore commercial opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions markets.  Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management.

The aim of the meeting is discussion -- with minimal formal presentations.  We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should:

begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, 
look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, and 
Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.
