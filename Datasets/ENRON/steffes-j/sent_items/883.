Looks good.  Why doesn't EPSA propose a timeline for the FERC to order?  This could be a signal that we only want one "rule change" date.  Also, maybe we can build in Kevin's argument about uncertainty hurting liquidity and market dynamics right now.

Attached are the second draft comments on the Southeast Mediation Report prepared by Judge McCartney and issued on September 10, 2001 (Docket No. RT01-100-000).
