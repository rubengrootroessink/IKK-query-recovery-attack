I don't know of any EES collateral at PJM.  Very small position in PECO territory.

I can check with PJM, if necessary, unless there is someone else at EES that may know of the collateral situation.  Thanks.

I don't have any knowledge of EES or EEMC posting collateral.

NYISO 
        I will need to look into this.  Based on my information, I see that we have provided gtys for EPMI, but I'm not quite   certain what collateral we may have posted for EES.

Who at Enron will have the details as to what we have posted, for which company and in what form the collateral is held?

 - NYISO - These are the names that I have.  I believe that Andy is the guy that we would want to talk to but I don't have his number.  Phil is also a credit contact, so he should be able to answer any questions.

We currently have $31MM in cash margin posted to PJM Interconnection, LLC.  My contact is Jay Niemeyer and he can be reached at 610-666-4407.  

I will get the bond information to you tommorrow.  To the extent that you would like to contact them, I suggest that you contact Cheryl Arnold, 413-535-4018 and Ellen Francoeur, 413-535-4000.  Another is the CFO, Ed McCann.
