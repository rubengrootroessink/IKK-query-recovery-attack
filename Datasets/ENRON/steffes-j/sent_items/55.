Steve & Rick --

FYI.  PG&E Bankruptcy counsel has provided the below stipulation that holds any further action on this issue for 48 hours.  It appears that PG&E doesn't want to be anywhere near the CPUC.

Provide more details as they go through.

Jim

This is the stipulation we were able to receive from PG&E to allow Lisa and I to negotiate a stipulation within the next 48 hours.  We will keep you posted.

Carl:

This will confirm the agreement of PG&E not to take any action for 48 hours
with respect to our ongoing disputes with Enron.  We will meet with you and
your client tomorrow in an effort to formulate a process for resolution of
outstanding issues.

Obviously, this is without prejudice to anyone's rights.
