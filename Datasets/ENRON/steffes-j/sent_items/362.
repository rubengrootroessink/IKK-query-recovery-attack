Good idea.  I'm out early next week. How about next Thursday?

Jim,

Hope all is well with you. I was wondering when would be a good time to get on your busy schedule to do lunch. I just wanted to touch base and let you know some of the projects I've been working on since I left your group.

Anytime the rest of this week is good for me and next week (save Monday).
