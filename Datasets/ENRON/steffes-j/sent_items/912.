Mike --

Let's discuss.  I don't want to overextend our involvement to all regional reliability councils and all working groups. If the MAPP RTC is critical, let's understand why and staff as best we can.

Mike,
I am currently a voting member of the MAPP RTC. I am no longer able to participate with this group. If you have someone in mind to replace me on this group, please do so immediately.

Thank you,
Bill Rust
