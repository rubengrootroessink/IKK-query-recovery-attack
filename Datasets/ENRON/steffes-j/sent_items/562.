Subject:	recoupment pleadings

there are some things that do not match betweed cpuc and bankruptcy pleadings and some things that need to be corrected and refined. leboeuf is going to send list of questions/open items that need to be tracked down to bob and i by tomorrow morning i believe.  i have asked linda to arrange a time to talk tomorrow with ferguson/kingley at leboeuf and bennett and she will be calling you about doing. kingsley said they were meeting with bennett today. 
let her know if any others need to be involved re this part.
