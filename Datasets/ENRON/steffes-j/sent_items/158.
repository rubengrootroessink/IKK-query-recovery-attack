Everyone,

You might recall an email message I sent out a couple of weeks ago about a meeting with Quinn Gillespie to discuss our RTO issues in the context of public/media relations.  We're looking at three dates/times and I am interested in your availability if you plan on participating in the meeting.  First, a few people have asked that we do this meeting by conference call between Houston and DC so it won't involve traveling.  Second, the following dates/times are under consideration:

Wednesday, September 19th 1:00 - 3:00 pm CST
Thursday, September 20th 9:00 - 11:00 am CST
Monday, September 24th 1:00 - 3:00 pm CST

Please let me know if you're interested in participating and, if so, let me know which time slot works for you.  

Thanks,
Janel
