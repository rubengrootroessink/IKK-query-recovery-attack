Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd

On October 17, 2001, Dynegy Midwest Generation, Inc. and Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. (Dynegy)
tendered for filing a Complaint against Commonwealth Edison Company.  In its complaint, Dynegy alleges 
that ComEd has failed to properly enforce the network resource designation provisions of its Open 
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT).  Dynegy further alleges that ComEd's actions jeopardize reliability, 
deprive Dynegy of revenues for capacity sales, and permits the improper prioritization of network transmission 
service for bumping and curtailment. Interventions are due October 26.

Please contact me if you would like further information.
