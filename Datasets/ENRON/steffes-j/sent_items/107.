Michele & Rick --

Please see the note below.  It is critical for you to call your clients (Ja=
ck in the Box/Burger King and Wendy's) to try and convince them to push the=
ir industry lobbyist to ask for a change in the date.

Call me at 713-853-7673 or 713-851-2499 (cell) to discuss. =20

Thanks,

Jim

Rick Simpson from the Speaker's office, said there will be no amendments to=
 the bill prior to its passing the Assembly.  They are still scrambling for=
 votes and sent the Chamber and WSPA lobbyists out to shore up a few while =
I was in the office.  I talked to Mike Kahl, WSPA lobbyist, whose firm also=
 represents the restaurant assn.  He argued that the 24th was in the bill f=
or awhile and he called all of their clients to tell them to sign up by the=
 24th.  He said Enron should have done the same.  I argued that Enron did t=
he best it could, but that negotiations with many entities take varying amo=
unts of time.  So long as the date is past, and customers still have to pay=
 exit fees, what was the relevant policy debate.  There can't be a gold rus=
h now.  Scott pointed out to me that bothWendy's and Burger King probably b=
elong to the restaurant assn., so our suggestion is that those entities con=
tact Jot Condie at the assn to instruct his lobbyists to change the date to=
 Sept. 1st.  This is time sensitive.  The Chamber lobbyist would love to se=
e a Sept. 1 date, but was not optimistic that they could move the Governor'=
s office.

Rick agreed to ask the Speaker to call Jeff Brown and ask for a delay until=
 the Legislature has time to act.  He will say the bill is expected to pass=
 his House tomorrow and changes will occur in the Senate which will give th=
em direction.  Rick also expressed pessimism that Bowen's attempts at legis=
lation will have a fruitful result.  I have been unable to speak to Burton =
directly about calling Brown, but hope to see him before the day is over.

Also I have a call in to Mayor Willie Brown, but so far I haven't heard bac=
k.

Jim, re the list of customers signing after July 1 - which ones would be af=
fected by the Aug. 24th date?
