Does change in law mean the implementation of the NE RTO?  That process is underway and whatever happens with its implementation we should already have a knowledge of?

Jim,

This is a 3 year deal, beginning Oct. 1.  Our standard terms and conditions, which MG has already executed, includes a "regulatory" out provision.  In addition, a change in law allows EES to terminate.

If ICAP or UCAP goes away, this would be a material change and EES would try to renegotiate the deal with MG or terminate if an acceptable deal cannot be reached.

Thanks - Jeff

I only have one question - the NYISO may be replaced by a NERTO as soon as this year in December.  What is the timeframe of the contract?  Also, the NYISO rules may change - what happens to our deal?  Do we have rights to restructure?  What happens if ICAP or UCAP goes away as an obligation?

Jim
