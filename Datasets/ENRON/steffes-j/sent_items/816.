We need a model for the entire Midwest independent of the ability to change=

At this point we dont have draft language and we dont have a settlement wit=
h language that allows us to push the way we can in Ohio.  My thought was t=
o push for an investigation and see within that context how far we could go=
.  At a minimum, if a hearing were to be granted, I think we could end up i=
mproving the balancing rules for IP, CILCO, etc.  Com Ed has the most favor=
able provisions and could end up being the model.  In my discussions with J=
eff Merola and Rogers Herndon, they can work with this however it is not op=
timal.  They need to do a transaction in order to figure out where the bugs=
 are.

Janine --

If we have draft tariff language, I'd push pretty hard.

On Friday, I participated in ICC Chairman Mathias' Roundtable on the state =
of competition in Illinois.  One of the questions he asked was what the ICC=
 could do to improve competition in Illinois.  I commented that the ICC cou=
ld commence an investigation on the balancing rules of the various utilitie=
s, having pointed out the problem's with ComEd's and the fact that the othe=
r utilities are even worse.  He expressed concern over ICC jurisdiction and=
 opined that to the extent that it impacts retail transactions and adversel=
y affects retail competition, the ICC is within its jurisdiction to order t=
he utilities to file an amended OATT before FERC for FERC's approval.  I pl=
an to follow-up with a letter to him and all the Commissioners and would li=
ke feedback as to how hard I should push on this.  Should the ICC look into=
 balancing (to which I give a less than 50% probability) we would have to b=
e prepared to participate.  I think it would be highly worth the effort, es=
pecially as far as Illinois Power is concerned, however, I would like some =
feedback as to your views in order to guage how hard to push this.

Thanks,
Janine
