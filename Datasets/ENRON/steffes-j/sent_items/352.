I think that this is a good step but we need to remember that NERC in the commercial sector may not prove to be the end all.  Also, while RTOs may enforce the standards or set the standards, not sure if we want one organization doing both.

This is a direct result of the recent actions from GISB to get involved in the wholesale electric standards.   We and EPSA have made positive statements about the GISB process.  NERC has been forced to change to accomodate what many in the industry are looking for.  There are still many "ifs" at GISB at this time, much of it around how much the big utilitites would be willing to support it.  Our position has been - whoever provided the best deal first, that is where the industry will take its business.

Kevin's preferences for RTO standards is not out of the question.   FERC will utlimately decide how much standards setting authority the RTOs will have.   NERC will certainly foucs - at least - on inter-RTO standards, something RTOs will not do well, if at all.  Howvever, NERC must not impede on internal RTO market structures and rules - a "commercial standard"  - this is why NERC recognizing commercial interests is such a big step.

NERC Roster

The NERC Board, at its meeting today in Vancouver, took bold steps to
expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric
industry in North America, to ensure the independence of actions by its
21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant
functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of
its standing committees.

Attached are the relevant resolutions and policy statements approved by
the Board.

A press release concerning these actions is available on the NERC web
site.
