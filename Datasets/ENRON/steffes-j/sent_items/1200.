Jim - 
	I wanted to give you an update for the first of the month.  Almost everything is updated, except for the California issues, which I assume you already have more information than I do.  I have had a difficult time getting a hold of anyone out there.  Montovano's information will be updated as soon as I get it.  If you like, we can discuss this at 5:00 when we meet.
