Hey, buddie.  Mike and Sue still differ.  We're getting the transcript to verify.  I told them both that this is not something we should make a big issue out of since what the judge said in a "quip" from the bench will in no way alter our strategy or tactics.  They both agreed.  Soon as we get the transcript, we'll fill you in.  Let me know if this works for you.  (Please be easy with Sue, she's pretty tense.)

Best,
Jeff
