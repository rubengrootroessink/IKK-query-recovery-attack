Rick --

Andy is looking for about $1500 for tuition reimbursement.  I would, if we can afford it, pay this.  I indicated that going forward we could not make any committments but finishing his college would be helpful.

Thoughts?

Jim

Jim,
Here is his letter.  I have also attached a breakdown of how that grade was determined.
 
Thanks for helping out with this,

Andy, 
Congratulations, you have received an A. 
A great last week with your usual high level of enthusiasm and professional work outputs. Your paper was very compelling too - the graphic really helped to get the point across. What made this paper even better was the way you integrated it into your work life at Enron. 
The group presentation was outstanding - it was nicely laid out with good balance and structure and covered all the relevant points. It showed a high level of design and thought and it provided a concise view of the teams strengths and weaknesses and how the combinations of them helped it to be effective. It was a professional product and by far one of the best presentations I have seen on this subject. 
Best of luck in all of your future endeavors and I wish you continued success in all of your professional aspirations.
