Interesting.  Seems to me that EPSA needs to help AZ do better by its citiz=
ens - it's not just APS that's a "bunch of neanderthals" (to use a Rick Sha=
piro phrase). =20

I don't understand something else - Is Mumaw APS' and EES' counsel in AZ?? =
 How is this possible?

Jim

A vituperative missive from our (and APS's) AZ counsel for your enjoyment.

We have yet to receive a final order.  I would prefer to have it in hand be=
fore a complaint is filed.  There is another year to go on the statute of l=
imitations, and thus aside from the natural desire to get money sooner rath=
er than later (and especially while Commissioner Spitzer is still on the Co=
mmission, which should be through the end of 2002), there is no particular =
rush.  Also, your "coalition" partner in the war on SWG imbalance terrorism=
, Midwest United, has also authorized a complaint, so there is the possibil=
ity to again share the costs of any such proceeding.

I didn't expect the merchant generators to be thrilled with the APS filing,=
 but then I'm sure they wouldn't like a complete repeal of the electric oom=
petition rules, which at least one Commissioner seems to favor, or an order=
 preventing any divestiture of APS generation and any competitive bidding, =
which is another distinct possibility from a Commission that has effectivel=
y lost its faith in competition.  Hopefully the Texas people at least read =
the application this time.  I can also tell you that APS is quietly upset t=
hat the merchant generators say nothing when SRP does far worse things, or =
when Citizens gets a total waiver of the same regulation for which APS seek=
s a partial waiver, or when TEP files their plan (which will happen shortly=
) making APS' look like a wild pro-market experiment.  In other words, APS =
takes a lot of grief not because it is perceived as the most anti-competiti=
ve incumbent (even our worst enemy would privately agree we are probably th=
e best in this state), but simply because it is the most visable.

Has the ACC issued an actual order onthe SW Gas?  I  have not seen
anything.  I have to formal go ahead on filing the complaint for the
refund, so let me know what your strategy is for that.  I assume we
should run the numbers with some accuracy, and I can have the number
crunchers here do that.

Your APS filing is not being too well received in the hinterlands
(Texas) from what I hear.  Expect some noise.

Hope you are enjoying the World's Series.
