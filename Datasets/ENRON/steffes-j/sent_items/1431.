I'm looking for direction on who in the company this request should be sent to.  I typically would have forwarded to Jeff Keeler/Mary Shoen with a copy to Fred Mitro and Ben Jacoby.  Let me know if you have any other suggestions and I will forward this message on.

ps--I believe that the answer to the question is that we do not own any units, as we sold the Lincoln Center project last year, but I am not in the know enough about whatever else we might have an ownership interest in to make that determination.

Susan M. Landwehr, Director
Enron Corp.
Government Affairs
900 Second Ave. South, Suite 890
Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402

Dear Ms. Landwehr:

According to Illinois EPA records, Enron Corp. owns or operates one or more emission units that are subject to the Pollution Control Board's regulations for the control of nitrogen oxides (NOx SIP rules) specifically, 35 Ill. Adm. Code Part 217, Subparts U and W.  As such, this letter is intended to remind Enron Corp. of its obligation to submit to the U.S. EPA Clean Markets Division a complete account certification of representation as required by the NOx SIP rules.  This certification must include information sufficient to establish an account representative for the source and an account for each unit at the source that is subject to the NOx SIP rules.

If Enron Corp. has not already done so, please forward the requisite certification to:

		NOx Budget Trading Program
		U.S. EPA Clean Air Markets Division
		Mail Code 6204N
		1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
		Washington, DC 20460

As required by the NOx SIP rules, please forward a copy of the certification to:

		Compliance and Enforcement Section, Bureau of Air
Illinois EPA
		Mail Code 40
		P.O. Box 19276
		Springfield, IL 62794-9276


Should you have questions regarding the certification please contact U.S. EPA's Clean Air Markets Division Hotline at 202/564-9620 or Scott Owens of my staff at the above-referenced telephone number.

Sincerely,




Julie K. Armitage, Acting Manager
Compliance and Enforcement Section
Bureau of Air
