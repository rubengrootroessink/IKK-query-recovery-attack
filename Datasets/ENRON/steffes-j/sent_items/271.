If the ONE RTO doesn't have a day-ahead market, what happens?

Howard,

Since this will be a financial deal initially that could be physical in the=
 future, I have only included the value of the day-ahead program in our mod=
el.  Thus if we elect to become the physical provider during the 36 months,=
 we will have an incremental benefit.  However, if we never become the phys=
ical provider, I need to know that I will be paid in the Day Ahead program =
for reducing load.

Three key regulatory issues:

1.  NYISO has an Hour-Ahead market that load needs to be allowed to partici=
pate in.  This would  clearly increase the value of the MG deal and our NY =
products in general.
2.  The Day-Ahead Demand Response Program needs to remain in-tact.  This al=
lows EES to realize the value of our call options, whether we are financial=
 or physical. =20
3.  The baseline calculation for load reduction does not work.  This summer=
, one of IBM's sites reduced load by 2 MW's, which is clear when reviewing =
this usage curves on the day of curtailment.  However, when comparing to th=
eir CBL (as currently defined) there was no reduction and therefore no paym=
ent for IBM or EES.  As we have discussed, NY should look at ISO-New Englan=
d's baseline calculations.  This is a much better approach for Enron and ou=
r customers.

Thanks - Jeff

Jim: I have participated in a number of calls with Jeff and his team over t=
he past few weeks regarding this deal, goving over the details of how NY's =
demand response programs work, reviewing draft contracts, and putting him i=
n touch with appropriate ISO staff when even more detailed followup was nee=
ded. I see little likelihood of NY's demand response programs being elimina=
ted over the next few years given the increasingly tight supply situation t=
he state faces and the long lead time for permitting and bulding new genera=
tion, and the great success these programs achieved this past summer. (Most=
 folks credit the 600 MW produced by NY's day-ahead and emergency demand re=
sponse programs with keeping the lights on in the northeast during the earl=
y August heat wave.) Only the day-ahead incentive program has a risk of not=
 being continued beyond October 2003, it's current expiration date. However=
, even there, there is likely to be pressure to extend it for an additional=
 year or two. With respect to potential RTO impacts, in our discussions wit=
h PJM, they have stated that at a minimum they would allow NY to continue i=
ts demand response programs in the new Northeast market on day 1, even if t=
hey differed from the rest of the region.Further, PJM would even consider m=
aking the NY programs applicable throughout the region on day 1 if that was=
 what the market participants in the region wanted to do.=20

Howard -

Have you and Jeff Brown talked about the MG deal?  I want to make sure that=
 you understand fully and appreciate any issues / concerns.

Thanks.
