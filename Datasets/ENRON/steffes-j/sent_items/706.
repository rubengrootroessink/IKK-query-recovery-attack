Dear SUMMIT2001 Guest:

ALSTOM ESCA, the Energy Management and Markets Business unit of ALSTOM,
would like to invite you and a guest to attend the second annual energy
summit, SUMMIT2001: The Forum for Power Industry Issues, October 7-9, 2001,
at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.

SUMMIT2000 brought energy and government leaders together to discuss a range
of issues-from technical, to business, to regulatory and legislative.  This
year, SUMMIT2001 will again spark discussion and initiate dialogue about a
range of topics, including:

*	ISOs and RTOs from an organizational, business, and technical
viewpoint
*	Retail System Implementations and their financial impact on an
organization
*	Emerging technologies and trends

On behalf of Alain Steven, President and CEO, and the ALSTOM ESCA team, we
look forward to your participation in this year's event.  Please click on
the link below for more information as well as to register.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 425-503-4197,
or just click "reply" to this message.  We look forward to seeing you in Las
Vegas.

Sincerely,

Kerry Ann Donk
Manager, Public & Media Relations
