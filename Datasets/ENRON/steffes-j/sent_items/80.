I am projecting a total budget of about $5.4 million,  a $1 million increase over 2001.  The major increases are for salaries, consultants in the regulatory, public affairs and environmental areas, legislative advertising and a senior executive meeting in the Spring.  Assuming the budget is approved, I am planning to recommend raising the current cap on Board member dues of $150,000 to $175,00, a 17% increase.  Is that something you can live with?  Please let me know.

I also sent the same message to Rick, but I had your wrong address the first time.
