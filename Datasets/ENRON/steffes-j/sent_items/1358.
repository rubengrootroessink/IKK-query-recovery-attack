Thanks for the tip.  Why don't we try to have lunch in early December - I'm going to try and take off the week after Thanksgiving.

Hi Jim -
I sent Mari an email at home about a position that came up here.  We just
had a guy in our regulatory group leave - his position is much below
anything that you would consider, but given the vacancy, they may be able
to create a higher level position for you.  At this point I am really just
seeing if you would even consider talking to our folks and I haven't
presented it to anyone over here either.  Just thought I would bring it up
considering the situation over there.  If you have some interest maybe we
could set up lunch sometime soon.
By the way congrats on the baby.  Maybe it will be a boy this time.
