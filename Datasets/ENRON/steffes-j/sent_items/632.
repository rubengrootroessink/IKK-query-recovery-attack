But where in statue does the ICC have that as one of their issues?

Marc is out til next wednesday or so with surgery.  I already sent him an email to refocus.  This is not what I had expected.  I will talk to him next week when I get back.  However, Jim on your point that the ICC doesn't care if we lose market share, the premise of the anticompetitive argument is that the increase threatens our existing market share and prevents us from competing for more market.  That is the essence of the impact of an anticompetitive situation.  This would be the result not only for us but for others as well.

Janine --

Where does this stand?  I just read the text and agree with Harry.  Most importantly, the HHI may not be suitable given the high degree of regulation of ComEd service.  

As important, I don't think the ICC cares too much about Enron losing market share.  Not the best lead argument.

Let's talk.

Jim

Janine - this is getting insane.  With all due respect to Marc, this has nothing to do with the issues at hand.
