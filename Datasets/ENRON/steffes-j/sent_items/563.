JIm: 
	I wanted to let you know my progress as of 5:45, Thursday.


Listing of who is owed how much in California
	I have left messages (both email and phone) with Ray Alvarez (who is currently in D.C.)


Listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions.
	Jenn Thome helped with this, and we have a good list.


Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists
Listing of the defendants in the class action suits.
		Linda Guinn, in legal, said she would gather some information, regarding the preliminary creditors involved in the PG&E bankruptcy by Fri. morning.(Richard 		Sanders is on vacation).  I was unable to reach Lisa Melencamp today. 
		Bill Bradford is currently checking with Mike Tribolet to see what they may already have.  He is going to update me in the morning.


	Linda explained to me that a list of defendants may be rather lengthy, and that if we could be more specific in our search request it will help her.
	I will be in tomorrow ASAP and if my sources cooperate, should have a report by early afternoon.


	Bryan
