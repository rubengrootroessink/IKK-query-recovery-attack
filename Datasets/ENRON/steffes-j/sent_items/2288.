My initial take is to keep engaged through Perrino.  I'll try and make the call this Thursday.

Subject: FW: Draft Meeting Notes From 11/8 SSG-WI Market Monitoring
Working g Group Meeting
Importance: High


Attached is a work plan for a 3-RTO working group (known as SSG-WI) to develop a market monitoring plan for CAISO, RTO West, and WestConnect.  It is turning into the (western) United Nations of Market Monitoring.  According to the attached plan, "This work plan is structured to first agree on the MME's authority and responsibilities, and then focus on the best structure to effectuate the agreement.  "  

We need to quickly decide our level of participation.  Dave participated in a meeting last week and it got them to not send out biased meeting notes. To actually steer the BPA-CAISO train into something we live with, however, will take a lot of work.  I suggest that we bring this up on our next "Western" call.  That being said, I will be on a plane on Thurs morning.  (Ray, could we have the Thursday call at 8:30/10:30/11:30 PST/CDT/EST??)

Hi --

Here's the revised work plan that incorporates Steve's comments.  (I've added a meeting and moved forward some of our "resolution"
dates.  I've also inserted a meeting location rotation.)  I've attached both a red-line and clean version of the work plan.

I think this is ready to go, although everyone might want to take one last look (especially as it sets out an aggressive schedule).
Steve, I assume you'll take care of forwarding the meeting notes and the work plan to SSG-WI.  Let me know if there is anything else
I can do to help.

Thanks!  Kristi
