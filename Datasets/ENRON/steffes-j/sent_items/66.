Leslie Lawner, Becky Cantrell and I met with Dan Larcamp at FERC yesterday =
to discuss the marketing affiliate issue.  He agreed with the latest press =
reports that the upcoming rulemaking NOPR, expected to be voted out in Sept=
ember, would not make major structural changes to the industry.  The curren=
t document is up to the Commission level and the Commissioners are clearly =
considering the alternatives now.  Larcamp said he expected a broadening of=
 the current market affiliate rules structure to include all corporate enti=
ties.  He did specifically mention that the Commission is not comfortable w=
ith the link between financial and physical transactions and the possibilit=
y for manipulation of market prices in one market (financial) to affect pri=
ces in the other market (physical).  He also expects the Commission to blen=
d the gas and power rules, using the best practices of each.  Any NOPR that=
 is issued will of course have comment dates to allow Enron and all industr=
y participants to comment on any proposed rule changes.

Larcamp indicated that he did not think there were pervasive afilliate disc=
rimination issues in the industry, but said that the Commission needed to a=
ct due to the political pressures they got from the Hill, etc.  The El Paso=
 case is top on everyone's mind and is of special concern because it affect=
s the California market, both gas and power.=20

Larcamp indicated that he is just now learning what a "Pat Wood" Commission=
 is going to want.  He indicated that Wood has closer ties to the producer =
community than either of the two former Chairmen.  He therefore expects  th=
at the Commission will be responsive to that sector in taking a relook at t=
he affiliate rules.  However, Larcamp did mention that the only meeting tha=
t he had previously had on the affiliate issue was with the INGAA group (Jo=
e Hartsoe went with them).  It is not clear whether the producer community =
has lobbied this issue at the Commissioner level.

We discussed strategy with Dan, how to let the Commission feel more comfort=
able with the marketing affiliate issue.  He suggested that he had gained a=
 lot by visiting the trading floors (including Enron's).  He thought the Co=
mmissioners and their immediate staffs would benefit from similar visits. =
=20

We specifically raised the issue of market prices, and talked about tranpor=
tation costs not equalling basis differentials.  We stated that our markete=
rs believed that the prices in the market were determined by market factors=
 in the specific areas of delivery rather than basin costs plus transport c=
osts.  Dan did indicate some agreement with this concept and thought that m=
ore education at the Commissioner level would be very worthwhile.

If you have any questions, call Leslie, Becky or me.=20
