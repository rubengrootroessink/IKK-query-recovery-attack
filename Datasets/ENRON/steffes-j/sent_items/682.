Please plan on attending a meeting on Thursday, 8/23/01 at 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. for a presentation by Lloyd Will (location to be announced later).  Lloyd as agreed to present the PJM model of LMP and congestion and how these issues will soon impact the Midwest Markets.

Additionally, I have invited Mike Roan to present a Midwest RTO update. 

This will be an excellent opportunity to come up to speed on a series of issues that will have significant impact to our region.

Lunch to be provided 


Thanks 


Oscar Dalton
