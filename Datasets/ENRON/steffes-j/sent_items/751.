I think that we should support the effort.  I would not get into the specifics in any region or the specifics of the proceedings.  This should be an opportunity for Enron to "spin" its message - RTOs help us help our customers....

Given that we're in the process of identifying influential stakeholders, this appears to be a good opportunity to clarify and deliver our message.  Jim do you agree we should help Jeannie?

Jim and Janel -- Do you want me to respond to Jeannie on this?  Do we want to write this up in an Enron customer paper article right now?
Thanks much.

Christi, hi -- we spoke about a month ago. I'm working with Michael Burr to pull together an article for our customers on what's going on with RTOs. I know you and Sarah have been involved in the hearings, and that we don't want to comment during this 45-day period. But we will publish in late September and I feel Mike really needs your input in a couple of areas:

1. Why are the states and the proposed RTOs fighting FERC's order so fiercely? And why won't the RTOs being proposed work?
2. There is some confusion as to whether RTO formation is still voluntary. Is it?
3. Can you suggest any source within FERC who can articulate the commission's thinking?
4. Do you see a likely scenario or timetable emerging?

This article is a great chance to talk to our customers about this issue. Please let me know if you can provide some help.

Thanks,
Jeannie
