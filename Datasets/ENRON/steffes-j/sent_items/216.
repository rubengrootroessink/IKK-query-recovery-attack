Becky --

I hope that I didn't come across too strongly just now.  Our budget is again under fire by the business groups and I want to try and do everything we can to create value for the businesses.  

I appreciate what you are doing on this.  Thanks for everything.  I understand the bind we are in with timing and the importance of getting this report in to FERC.

Jim
