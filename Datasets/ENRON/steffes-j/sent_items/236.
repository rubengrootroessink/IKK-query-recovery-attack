ce but just haven't done anything in TX.

Florida
Bobbie McCartney, an Administrative Law Judge for the Federal Energy Regula=
tory Commission, has recommended that Florida join its transmission lines t=
o those of nine other states. Under the plan, Florida Power and Light Compa=
ny (FPL) would turn over its transmission lines to the Regional Transmissio=
n Organization (RTO) or keep the lines and have the RTO manage them. The st=
ate's three major electric utilities, FPL, Florida Power Corporation, and T=
ampa Electric, have already formed a statewide RTO called GridFlorida. Howe=
ver, GridFlorida is on hold because the state is uncertain if a state RTO w=
ould increase customer rates. FPL spokesman Mike Haggerty noted, "We will s=
ee what direction the PSC (Public Service Commission) takes before committi=
ng to any alternative." PSC assistant director Bob Trapp said that agency s=
taff would prefer an RTO for Florida alone, but no formal position has been=
 taken by the commissioners.

Texas
American Electric Power (AEP), owner of Southwestern Electric Power Company=
 and West Texas Utilities Company, is supporting a delay in deregulation in=
 East Texas from January 1 to March 31, 2003. David Carpenter, director of =
Texas regulatory services for AEP, said in a statement, "We are asking that=
 retail competition...be delayed to permit adequate time to assure that inf=
rastructure, processes and procedures are in place to allow fair competitio=
n to proceed while reliable service continues." However, Entergy is arguing=
 that restructuring should move ahead even though no retail providers are m=
aking offers in that part of the state. Entergy spokeswoman Patty Riddlebar=
ger said, "That doesn't mean that they are not interested. Ten retail power=
 providers have either begun or completed testing and certification in the =
Entergy service area." She added that the testing and certification process=
 is rather lengthy and companies would not be participating in them if they=
 were not interested. Last month, Public Utility Commission staff asked com=
missioners to delay deregulation in that part of the state, which encompass=
es 60 counties and 434,000 households. AEP spokesman Larry Jones stated, "T=
here are a number of milestones that need to be achieved, and a delay until=
 2003 will allow those milestones to be achieved." Three commission members=
 will meet on October 5 and 6 to determine how ready the state is to begin =
electric competition in January.
