Marcus N. says that everything is done on our emergency project this morning.  Sam Behrens will write an opinion letter to allow the move without the need for a 203 filing and everything else is in place.  Steve Montovano has/is confirming that in PA, OH, and NJ there are no outstanding tax or regulatory matters.

We probably want to put in place an update to Clinton's MBR that would allow for A/S trading.  Should we just have Sam do that work??
