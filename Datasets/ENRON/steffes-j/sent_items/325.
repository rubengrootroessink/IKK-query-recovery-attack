Thanks Jim.  I will push EPSA as much as I can.  I too don't see how this helps us.  I'm a little annoyed because I think Julie's focus has been primarily on getting better access for generators, and I know she heard the annoyance in my voice when I told her that better generator access is useless for us.  We've been pushing this issue for some time, and we have a lot of marketers in the group, so hopefully we will come to some sort of position that gets us all what we need.

Sarah --

You're call on working with EPSA.  Get everything you can.  I don't understand how "new services" is moving fast enough.

Jim and Christi:

Here is language I proposed to EPSA to be included in "Standardized Tariffs:"

FERC must eliminate the distinction between network and point to point transmission service and create a new "Network Plus" service that is the only firm transmission service offered and is available to all transmission customers.

Julie questions if this is what we really want (we being all of EPSA, including the generators).  Julie is nervous about proposing to eliminate point to point service all together.  She thinks the problem with network is that utilities are preventing generators from getting the service.  I told her that is not our issue, and just changing the rules so that network service is available to generators does not help us.  

Julie suggested language that said something like "FERC should explore new transmission services for customers."  I told her that doesn't work -- we need to address this issue head on.  She is concerned that we're going to have dissention within the membership.

How would you all feel about retaining point to point service but making network available to everyone, with a much less restrictive sign up period (e.g. 1 month term rather than 1 year term), etc.  I think its cleaner to eliminate the two types of services and create a new "Network Plus" service that's available to everyone -- that would be the "firm" service and "nonfirm" would continue to exist.  Do you all think we would want to retain point to point service?  Even if we don't, if some EPSA members want to retain point to point service, we may need to think of ways to make network more user-friendly without eliminating point to point.

Let me know what you think

Sarah
