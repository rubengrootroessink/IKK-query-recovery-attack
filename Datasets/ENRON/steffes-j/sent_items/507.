Nancy --
 
Go get 'em!!!  You'll do great.  Just be factual and explain how you've worked on these issues in multiple states.

I have spoken to Mark, he will send a list of issues to Nancy prior to the hearing.  The committee will acknowledge that you are an Enron employee, however, you are appearing in the capacity of  Chair of RMS subcomittee.  Bill B. from Ercot will be present, however he was not the most stellar witness.  Mark thinks Chairman Wolens will want to hear directly from the Chair of RMS.  The questions that you may be asked include:  what has RMS recommended to TAC, address issues of cutover from version 1.3 to 1.4...where are we, where do we go next, where are the participants on the issue?  Mark is preparing the list of questions and will email it to you soon.
 
Representative Paul Hilbert died last night.  If the funeral services are scheduled for Friday, the hearing will be postponed to enable the members of the committee to attend the funeral.  We may not know the date of the funeral until Wednesday.  I will let everyone know ASAP whether or not the legislative takes place on Friday.  Thanks, Jean

Mark Bruce, Policy Analyst, Electric Resturcturing Legislative Oversight Committee, attended the October 25th RMS meeting.  When he left, he gave me his card and asked me to contact him after the meeting, which I did.  He asked that I forward my contact information and asked if I could be available to attend the Legislative Oversight Committee meeting on Friday, November 2nd.  This is the email that I received from him after I sent my contact information.  He has not elaborated on exactly what questions he has or would have for me.

Thanks for your response ... Connie shared her V 1.4 cutover questions and  concerns with me ... if you reply to her e-mail prior to the Wed. RMS meeting,  please include me in your reply.

  
I'll keep in touch with you regarding possible questions from the oversight  committee on Nov. 2.
