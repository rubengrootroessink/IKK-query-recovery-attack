        Erin,=20
        Thanks for the advance copy of the paper.  While there are a number=
 of very good points made in the paper, Williams has a fundamental problem =
with EPSA endorsing a new market power test that is more stringent than we =
think is necessary.  We would recommend that EPSA support the Limited Compe=
ting Supplier Test, or perhaps simply take the position in option 5 (no tes=
t for bid-based markets operated by an ISO or RTO).  We simply believe that=
 EPSA should not be "negotiating with itself" at this juncture.  That is, w=
e should not assume that the majority of the Commissioners are with Massey.=
  We should use this paper to argue to the other Commissioners and staff th=
at if they move off Hub and Spoke, they only need to move incrementally, no=
t dramatically.  In making this recommendation we recognize that this may n=
ot be enough for FERC and we may not like what we end up with.  But William=
s is simply not prepared to support a position we really don't agree with i=
n the hope that we can avoid an even worse result.  I particularly recall L=
inda Breathitt's reservations about these issues (voiced at the meeting a m=
onth ago) and am hopeful that we can influence Wood and Brownell in this re=
gard.

        The language that reiterates EPSA's position that FERC's primary fo=
cus should be on getting market design right is very well done.  Also the a=
rguments on why it would be disastrous to condition our market based rate a=
uthority is well done and timely.

        We recognize that EPSA has been working on this issue for weeks now=
, but this is not a simple issue and we have needed this time to think it t=
hrough.  We appreciate your efforts and believe this is an important issue =
for EPSA.   Thanks, Judy Neason
