Amr and I met with Dale Furrow and Misty Barrett (Wade Stubblefield's group).  Arthur Andersen again wants our independent review of regulatory assumptions for their year end signoff.  We will do top 50 companies in very incremental fashion - look at changes to assumptions using Stella's tables and then meet with Andersen to give results.  Amr will coordinate compiling of  information.

Interesting quote from Dale - right now, Duke position is his number 1 headache.
