Dan -

Spoke with Janet Dietrich yesterday.  Slight change to our advocacy versus our Monday discussions.  After meeting with Sean Holmes, it was agreed that our policy work would say (1) no retroactive DA suspension (at least not earlier than Sept 1), (2) don't end DA but study how to allow it to continue.

If the CPUC does suspend without retroactive, the fear is that re-starting the CA market will be very difficult.

Please call me when you get some time.

Jim
