Didn't get invited.  Are you going?  I don't plan on sending anything - do you think we should even though we didn't get any invitations?

Jim

Jim--did you get invited to Harvill's wedding or the cocktail reception?  (wedding is NOv 3 and reception is Nov 8).  Just in case you did or were thinking of sending him something, you will see that I have asked our local lobbyist to review reporting requirements.

Molly--one of the Illinois COmmerce Commissioners, Terry Harvill, is getting married early next month and I would like to send him a small gift.  Am I correct  that I am able to do so without any reporting requirement?  As I recall, the only individual's at the ICC that we have to track are the Chairman and the Exectutive Director?
