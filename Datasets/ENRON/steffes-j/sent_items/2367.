And the winner is .............. "me" to coordinate.  I have been leading with Legal and Trading.  Legal confirmed their right under the gas tariff (due to our downgrade).   Don's team, myself and the credit contact at NIMO reviewed the exposure calculation and believe it to be accurate at first review.  I am inquiring to a lock box to reduce the requirement by 50%.  Deadline to deliver is next Thursday, Nov 29th.

Harry/Gloria - could you please review their requirement?  NIMO is asking for collateral in effect to cover EES base load for the Supplier Select program, assuming EES does not deliver for 30 days and assuming the coldest day (in the past 30 years) which in effect mutiplies our load by a factor of 3.  However, NIMO has agreed to use forward Jan price in lieu of the past 12 months as stipulated in their tariff.

Regards
Molly

When is this due?  What is our gas exposure in NIMO's service territory?  Who is on point?

Thanks - Dan

EES received a margin call for $4.3MM on Nov 19th from Niagara Mohawk for EES gas business to cover settlement and imbalance risk for NIMO's "Supplier Select" Program.  The Enron Corp. gaurantee is no longer acceptable at our current rating.  Legal has confirmed NIMO's rights under its gas tariff.
