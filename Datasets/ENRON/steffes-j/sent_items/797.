This is a "kick-off" for more NERC work.  It is by no means the end - of course.
Although what somea out of it may not get stakeholder approval, it will at least have to stand the rigors of busget approval by the stakeholders.

You are invited to participate in one of three workshops designed to
solicit input into training issues which will help NERC understand what
operating and marketing personnel feel they need in the way of training
programs and study materials.

Attached is the announcement and registration form. The announcement is
also posted at the following NERC web site:
http://www.nerc.com/~filez/workshops.html

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Glenda Rodriguez


Please note there is still room available for all three workshops.
