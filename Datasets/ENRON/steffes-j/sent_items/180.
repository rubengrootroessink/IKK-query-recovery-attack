A couple of thoughts --

1.	Ashley Brown and Rick have a great relationship.  Don't hesitate to use Rick to find out some details if you need him.

2.	Are we supporting this?  I don't understand why we would agree to make NG the MM with this process / paper?

Thanks.

Here's the first document available relating to the proposal developed at the last FERC facilitated Alliance stakeholder advisory committee meeting -- NGrid's proposal for the stakeholder advisory relationship to itself as interim as well as permanent independent board.  Talk about independence -- you'll see in the attachment that Alliance Companies are redrafting the section that describes interim board authority!

Dear Stakeholders:

	At last Tuesday's meeting in Chicago, National Grid promised to circulate a draft proposal for the stakeholder advisory process of the Alliance.  The attached document is a draft.  Because of the extraordinary circumstances of this week, Grid was unable to get full corporate review of the document, and may want to  further modify it.  Nevertheless, because of  Grid's desire to fulfill its promise, it is circulating the current version of the document for stakeholders to begin thinking about.
   
Best Regards,

Ashley C. Brown
