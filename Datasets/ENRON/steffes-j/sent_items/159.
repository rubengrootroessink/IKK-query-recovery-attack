John, etal --

Not sure if there is any real "issue" we can push.  Maybe something on the P/L side (see Joe Hartsoe).  Clearly this idea that RTOs will be anti-security is mistaken - it just implies that there should be redundancy of systems.

Jim--

Please see e-mail traffic below on any ideas we have for anti-terrorism efforts that might help us on electricity grid management issues.  Any ideas beyond my initial attempt below?

John

P.S.  The monopoly utilities are already saying that forcing large RTOs is bad at this time because we shouldn't be making such massive and complicated changes to the the electric system at a time of war.

The first thing that comes to mind is a directive from Congress to FERC and/or DOE to conduct  a rulemaking on "gride management" that essentially recasts the "Large RTO" plan as a security/grid management plan, etc.

Linda, 

Regarding the grid safety issue, you will remember that I mentioned
yesterday that Saxby Chambliss has been tapped by the Speaker to coordinate
the terrorism package. I spoke with Krister Holladay of Chambliss' office
today, who is staffing that effort and he said he would be more than happy
to look at any and all proposals and suggestions that we have on grid
safety. He hasn't seen anything yet on this issue and would welcome our
input. 

If the folks in Houston can identify two or three (or more) things that can
be done to enhance safety that also move grid management in the direction we
want it to go generally, this will be a fine opportunity to broaden our
coalition on transimission / rto's. 

It looks like we have an open door here. Let me know what you want me to do.


Terry
