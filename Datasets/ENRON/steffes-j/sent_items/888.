Dave, Jim, Steve

I talked to Belden and he is looking forward to the meeting next week.

He is interested in talking about market structure.  He recommends that we get someone who really understands the PJM market structure.  I suggested Mike Roan in an earlier email to Dave and would reiterate my suggestion that we invite him or someone else who knows PJM.

He also wants to discuss our RTO Week position at the meeting.  If that's too late, we should talk to him in advance of next Wed.

That's it for now,

Alan C.
