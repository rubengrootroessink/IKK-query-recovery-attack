Dear James:
 
Wattage Monitor has partnered with the  Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets to provide the DISCO of the Future  Executive Survey. We'd like your opinion! 
 
As part of the survey launch, we're asking  energy executives like you to complete the survey with us over the phone.  Not only do we want your responses to the questions but we're hoping to have  your feedback on the survey itself, too. You'll be assisting in the development  of policy recommendations for the DISCO of the Future.
 
Please email (jgotch@wmonitor.com ) or call  (415-387-8841) me to schedule a time to participate in the survey. The  following appointments are available:

The survey is approximately 20 questions and  is scheduled in 45 minute intervals to ensure we have time to review the  questions with you and allow for any discussion that might arise. We will cover  general topics like your existing business policies, activity and opinions  of the DISCO of the Future. 
 
If there is a time that fits your schedule  better, please contact me and I'd be happy to make additional appointments.  Please feel free to forward this email to  any additional people you believe would be interested in participating as  well.
 
Thank you for your help.
 
Regards,
 
Jamey  Gotch
