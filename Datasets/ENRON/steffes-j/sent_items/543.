Sue, thanks.  I think it would be a good idea to see what others with Direct Access customers and a negative CTC balance are considering doing.

As I mentioned previously, ARM is supporting the SCE approach which does not charge DA customers for the 1 cent.  ARM is working with the Energy Div staff to get a favorable ruling on it.  We decided that approach had the highest probability of success.  But ARM will seek to change the earlier order charging DA if this approach doesn't work. 

 I have not really talked to other ARM members on the PX Credit balances.  I can if you like.  I believe we should follow the requirements in our tariff and ESP/UDC agreement for a dispute as the best first step.

Sue,

Any information about whether ARM plans to challenge the passthrough of this?  Also, on a separate subject, are there any plans to challenge PG&E's and SCE's removing our PX Credit balances from customer's bills?
