Nancy, etal --

With the discussions at NERC recently to broaden their role, I think that we need to be very coordinated on our EISB message and begin to figure out how we get AGA to work with the Retail Gas and EEI/UBR to work with the Retail Power quadrants.  Let's think about a NARUC message to drive this very quickly (maybe at the next meeting).

Having one body begin to coordinate all of these matters will greatly expand our policy reach.

Thanks,

Jim
