Here is AEP's settlement offer, Jim.  As you can see, it dates from Oct. 4

Here is a draft settlement document which reflects the changes from yesterday's conference call.  AEP has not received management approval of this proposal. However, we to expedite the review process we are sending the proposal out as a discussion document. Accordingly, this draft is not an offer of settlement from AEP and AEP reserves the right to suggest changes to the draft upon further review.
