Thanks Marianne.  We've been in contact with the PUC but we will need some help next week.  Are you in Monday?

Jim

FYI.  The PUC's rule under which Enron Energy Sservices was certified as an
REP in Texas requires that a REP notify the Commission of any petition in
bankruptcy within 10 days of the filing.  In addition, 10-day notification
is required for any material change in the financial requirements presented
by a REP pursuant to which its application for REP certification was
approved.  A REP has 30 days to notify the Commission of any change in the
technical conditions presented in its application.  Finally, a REP may not
cease operations as a REP without prior notice to the Commission, as well as
to customers and any other affected persons (such as the T&D utility, etc.).

Please let me know if we can assist Enron in any of these filings, and give
me a call if you have any questions.  The relevant rule governing these
requirements is PUC Substantive Rule 25.107.
