Subject:	FERC Discussion on Standards of Conduct NOPR


My notes from the Standards of Conduct NOPR discussion:

Draft NOPR would:
adopt one set of standards to apply to gas and electric transmission owners;
broaden the definition to include all affiliates of transmission companies (including affiliates engaged in financial transactions)+
NOT apply to RTOs

The Commissioners were presented with 2 options:
Option A would maintain the status quo with respect to native load;
Option B would require separation of transmission function from bundled retail load.

It appears that there are 3 votes for Option B.   Breathitt was the hold out, expressing concern with respect to timing given that the FERC is trying to build a strong relationship with state commissions.    Pat said he was "surprised" to learn that bundled retail sales were excluded.  Massey sees this as an "opportunity for discrimination to end."   

NOTE:   Pat sent a message that, if he doesn't hear from "people" that this is the right way to go, he will back down.  He will be looking for factual evidence that on the costs and benefits associated with unbundling.   Massey asked staff if there are "operational reasons why this change shouldn't be made."  We may want to comment on this.
