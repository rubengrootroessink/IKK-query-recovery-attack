Jim;  wanted to drop you a quick note {met you during the associate PRC process with Sutton} to inquire about your Admin. vacancy.  Is it open?  Any pre selected candidates you have in mind?  The reason I'm asking is that I have a potential ..................yeah, it's my daughter!  She has been working in HR {recruitment} for almost a year.  Unfortunately, they have started the process of "right-sizing" and even though she has yet to be affected, I'm not sure how long that will last.  She is 23 and has a great personality, but you'd expect to hear that from her dad.  Her supervisor is Meg Wysatta who reports into Will Davies.  Meg has informed me that Tracy does a great job, but they are trying to automate their process.  
If you get a minute, drop me a note. 
                                                                                             Thanks,
                                                                                                  Bob
Tracy wanted to experience the corporate life before finishing school..... she is probably a first semester junior and now fully understands the importance of completing her education.
