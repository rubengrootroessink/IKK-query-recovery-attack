Sue, Mike, & Jeanne --

Attached is the letter from PG&E regarding our payment "issues".  Discussions this morning have this gameplan - 1.  file at CPUC and Bankruptcy the appropriate paper & $ to hold our issues.  

We need to have a call at 12 Houston time to discuss and ensure that the filings are consistent.  If anyone has any problems, please let me know.

Jim
