Do we need to file on the NOPR on Partial Day Recalls??  Will EPSA file?  What position will they take?  Should we talk with Joe Hartsoe about his position?

Most of the discussion was regarding the NOPR on Allowance of Partial Day Recalls of Released Capacity. This would be a possibility only for LDCs. Comments should be submmitted around Nov 19. It was considered disruptive for the market. Discos argue they need this possibility in order to increase reliability. The problem is that the release capacity would be less attractive if distcos are given this possibility (the value of release capacity would be lower than IT). It was mentioned that this could lead to the use of daily balancing. The main fear is that State Commissions could order Discos to keep the recall right in their release.
They plan to talk to INGAA about this issue and said they would appreciate any feedback to talk to INGAA.

On other issue, it was mentioned the due date for comments about the Affiliate transaction NOPR was moved to Dec. 20.

The next conference call will be December 4 (Tuesday) at 3:30 pm.
