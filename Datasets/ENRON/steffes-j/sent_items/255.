I have been following Form EIA-417 - Emergency Incident and Distrubance Report
 
I am not familiar with the changes on these other forms. Should I follow up on these as well?  
 

Form EIA-411, "Coordinated Bulk Power Supply Program Report," 
Form EIA-412, "Annual Electric Industry Financial Report," 
Form EIA-423, "Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Plants," 
Form EIA-767, "Steam-Electric Plant Operation and Design Report," 
Form EIA-826, "Monthly Electric Sales and Revenue Report with State Distributions," 
Form EIA-860, "Annual Electric Generator Report" (combined Forms EIA-860A and EIA-860B), 
Form EIA-861, "Annual Electric Power Industry Report," and, 
Form EIA-906, "Power Plant Report." 

Since I have no former experience with these reports, it would be a great help if those familiar with these reports take a look at at them first and porvide me any comments.
