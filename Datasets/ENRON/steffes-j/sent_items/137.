Elizabeth - 
	Jim and I have been discussing the creation of a database where he/we could regularly check the former, current, and prospective projects of those in Government Affairs.  It would be a way to check the on goings in ENA, EES, and GA as a group.  It would also be an effective tool whenever we needed a GA valuation.  When you have a moment, I would like to explain the project to you and get your input as to how we could design the best system.  Please let me know when you have a chance to talk.

Thank you,

Bryan
