Ms. Elizabeth C. Linnell
Manager
Enron Corp.

Dear Elizabeth:

We are fast approaching our Fall Roundtables for members of the Retail
Energy Advisory Service.  These events are an important element of your
membership in the Retail Energy service and provide a terrific
opportunity to hear CERA's latest thinking on the current and future
state of Retail Energy markets.

We will be holding two Roundtables this Fall:

* San Francisco, CA, November 14, 12:00-4:30PM PST
* Houston, TX, November 16, 12:30-5:30PM CST

Each of these half-day events will feature presentations by CERA experts
on the current and future state of retail energy markets.  Among the
timely issues being addressed this Fall will be:

* The Retail Market Outlook
* The Wholesale Outlook and its Influence on Retail Markets
* Lessons from European Retail Gas & Power Markets
* Retail Billing: Regulatory Challenges, Technology Solutions

In addition to insightful presentations and discussions, these
Roundtables will also offer many opportunities for networking with CERA
staff, members of CERA's Retail Energy Advisory Service, and other
invited guests.

To review the most up-to-date program details, and for registration and
logistics information, please check back to the CERA website often at

I sincerely hope you will be able to join us, in either San Francisco on
November 14th or in Houston on November 16th. If you have any questions
