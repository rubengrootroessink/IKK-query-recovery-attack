Hey there Jim.  I'm glad you made it back in one piece.  I'm sure your wife=
 was frantic. =20

FYI:  This past week-end, Becky and I attended NESA's annual conference.  O=
ne of the highlights was a panel entitled "Power Deregulation."  On the pan=
el:  Brad Williams, Sr. VP, Entergy Wholesale Operations;  Michael Schneide=
r, Director, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E); Steve Gillialand, Sr. VP, Du=
ke Energy North America, LLC; and Jerry Winter, VP, Reliant Energy Services=
.  Note: Loretta Lynch, President, CPUC was scheduled to participate on the=
 panel as well, but she was a no-show.  My guess - she chickened out.  It w=
as probably for the best because everyone on the panel "slammed" California=
, the Governor, and the CPUC.

I had the opportunity of questioning Michael Schneider (I asked these via n=
ote cards) of SDG&E in regards to Open Access and where did it look like th=
e legislature was going with it and what was SDG&E's position.  On record, =
he said that open access will pass through legislature but that it would be=
 "segmented."  For example, depending on the size of the customer would dep=
end on if they can participate in regards to open access.  The Large custom=
ers can have the opportunity to participate in open access but supposedly b=
ecause the smaller customers "aren't really educated" on the issues of open=
 access, they won't be able to participate.  (Sounded rather patronizing to=
 me, even if he was rather pleasant.)  How does SDG&E feel about open acces=
s?  He said that they're definitely in favor of  open access and feel that =
it is needed but only for large customers and that the smaller customers ar=
en't "quite ready" for open access because again lack of education.  Suppos=
edly the smaller customers aren't sophisticated enough I guess.

Jim, question - is this something everyone on the Ca. calls already know in=
cluding you or should I send this out to others as a "FYI" ?
