Dear Reader:

A new world is unfolding and you're in it.  The industry you know is
changing into one no one has ever seen and you'll probably be a part of it.

That's why we've created Restructuring Today -- to report to you the
twists, the plans, failures, strategies, shocks, absurdities, new sales
and buying methods as energy and communications converge into American's
biggest industry.

Add the $220 billion power industry to the $80 billion gas industry and
merge in the $200+ billion communications industry and you're
talking big bucks.  Restructuring Today is focused down the road,
reporting where the industry's headed every business day.

Our editors will tell you what the CEOs making the big decision are
thinking and planning on.  And those editors cover more seminars than
you could imagine going to (or paying for).  They're guided by a network
of correspondents in state capitals - most of them business editors of
important newspapers.

You can call 1-800-486-8201 anytime with your questions because that
keeps us up on what our readers want to know.  The news is readable
because Restructuring Today's editors write the way people talk -- not in
the language of the Federal Register.

Analysis:  Restructuring Today is not written by recent journalism
graduates.  Our editors are directed not to write what the news is but
to report what the news means.  Readers often tell us that Restructuring
Today's analysis is what they find especially useful.

Urgent:  We have enjoyed being able to send you a few copies of
Restructuring Today and if you would like to benefit from our special,
unique focus on convergence and new markets, simply fax the
completed attached order form and I'll make sure you don't miss a
single, vital issue.

Cordially,

Season Hawksley
Marketing Manager
800-486-8201

PS:  While the turmoil in California and the west has eased up, the
forward thrust continues.  Congress and the new FERC are out to
change our world.  Stay tuned and if at any time you decide
Restructuring Today isn't worth more than you paid for it, we'll refund
your entire subscription price.
