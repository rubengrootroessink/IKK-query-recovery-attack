Bryan:

Contract Details
For info. on the parties, contracts, etc. see:  http://www.sco.ca.gov/power_page/whatare/longterm.htm.  Note, I have the complete set of all the contracts with me, but the Controller's site has copies of the pages of the contracts with all the important details, which is all you probably need.

Stranded Costs
Attached is the stranded cost analysis we did.

Don't hesitate to call if you need more info.
