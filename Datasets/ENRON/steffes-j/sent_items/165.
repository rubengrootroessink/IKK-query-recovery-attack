Is this good or bad for Enron?  My take is that this doesn't help us push f=
or ONE RTO.

Attached is the much anticipated order granting clarification of the Commis=
sion's order on the SMD filing.  The heart of this order states that when t=
he FERC refused to act on the SMD filings, its action:

was not intended to stop ISO-NE's or any other parties' efforts that might =
further the objectives of developing and implementing a regional market in =
the Northeast.  The Commission has already identified many aspects of such =
a market that it expects to see:  e.g., congestion management through locat=
ional marginal pricing, and day ahead and real time markets.  These element=
s are likewise present in SMD.  It thus was not the intention of the Commis=
sion that parties should stop work altogether.  Continuation of ISO-NE's ef=
forts at developing the software and related products necessary to implemen=
t SMD would, in fact, be a positive step toward ultimately developing a sin=
gle Northeastern market.  We note, however, that as it continues with the d=
evelopment of SMD, ISO-NE should be mindful of the ultimate goal of a singl=
e Northeastern market design.  We thus urge ISO-NE to continue with develop=
ment of SMD in every aspect, including software, in a sufficiently flexible=
 manner so that any products developed for SMD may be readily adaptable to =
whatever market design is ultimately proposed for the Northeastern RTO.
