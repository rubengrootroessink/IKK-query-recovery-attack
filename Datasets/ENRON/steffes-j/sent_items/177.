FYI.  Does EGM have any past advocacy on NURF?

NURF (Non-Uniform Rate of Flow) is a proposal currently being discussed at GISB to have hourly firm service on pipelines.  It becomes a cost allocation issue as to who pays for the extra compression etc that may be necessary.

The paper is, for the most part, a fair representation of the NURF discussions ( I'd part with a few of the statements made in 6, 7, & 8).   While the ETS pipelines participated in the development of the outline to ensure that the principles were sound, we do not have any present plans to file a NURF service.  When and if we have real customers that want to contract for NURF service, we will make a filing.   Even though we don't plan any immediate NURF service, I think the dialogue was still useful in making sure that generators understand the operational challenges of serving hourly swings.

I read a paper on NURF (from Dynegy attorney).  What is our pipeline position?  Thanks
