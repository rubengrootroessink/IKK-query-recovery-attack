I still think that Enron should be advocating some form of Negawatt program=
 for non-retail access states.  Using an RTP tariff that more closely track=
s the wholesale prices from an RTO balancing energy market with locational =
signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load respons=
e needed to keep prices from skyrocketing - of course this would require a =
DA market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage.

By the way, I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity.  We shou=
ld make sure that we put this in our comments on RTO Week.

Subject:=09RE: RTO Week Comments -- ICAP

 The FERC Staff report on RTO Week states that most panelists agree that so=
me type of long term capacity obligation is needed, as long as demand is no=
t very price responsive, in order to allow generation to recover its fixed =
costs and support investment. =20

The report also notes that some panelists support: =20

=09-=09a recent staff proposal supporting an LSE holding foward call option=
s on energy YES, and=20

=09-=09a capacity obligation being a transitional obligation until demand b=
ecome price responsive.  As I describe below I believe that placing the res=
ponsibility on the LSE should be sufficient, I don't think you need a trans=
istional period.

I have cut and pasted our Executive Summary from the ICAP comments as our r=
esponse (see below), but I have a couple of questions for this group:

=091.=09We say in our comments that a real time energy market, through an R=
TO, will give consumers the means to adjust their demand curve because they=
 will see real time prices.  However, if a state has a rate freeze in effec=
t and/or if retail access is not permitted in a state, how can retail load =
respond to the RTO's real time spot market prices? The short answer would b=
e, they won't.  But we need to remember that some states still are moving f=
orward with some type of retail access, mostly for the C&I customer market.=
  These are the folks who can make a difference and the ones with the most =
potential to benefit.  In the areas of no retail access it is still importa=
nt to have a transparent market to send the correct signals for development=
 of transmission and generation, but even without retail access and a fixed=
 rate, depending upon new technologies and innovations some larger C&I cust=
omers may opt to build their own in-house source of energy and sell off any=
 excess, without market signals this would not be possible.  We need to inc=
lude this response in our comments.

=092.=09What do we think of a proposal where LSEs hold forward call options=
 on energy as a way to achieve a capacity requirement?  This is the proposa=
l I believe we should support because it places the procurement for suffici=
ent resources where it belongs, on the LSE.  The generators will still be a=
ble to receive a "capacity" payment (the one they like so much now from the=
 ISOs in PJM and NY)

Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.  Also, any thoughts you have on othe=
r parts of the Staff report would be greatly appreciated (thanks Dave Perin=
o for sending you comments).

Thanks Everyone

Sarah



EPMI opposes the continuation or implementation of installed capacity requi=
rements.  Four appropriately sized Regional Transmission Organizations ("RT=
Os") that encompass robust, competitive spot markets for energy and operati=
ng reserve products (including demand side management products) will provid=
e an efficient and timely solution for the construction of adequate generat=
ion, the siting of appropriate transmission and efficient use of demand sid=
e management products to ensure that demand is met in real time.  Spot mark=
ets reveal the cost of procuring  (or not using) electricity based on actua=
l supply and demand conditions and, thus, signal the need for new generatio=
n capacity.  They also ensure that consumers 'see' the cost of procurement =
decisions through transparent spot market processes and adjust demand based=
 on discovered prices.  These markets will keep supply and demand in balanc=
e in both the long and short run without the use of artificial planning cri=
teria.  Therefore, there is no need to continue separate installed capacity=
 requirements in an RTO environment.
The use of the spot market to establish pricing for all energy products is =
new to the electricity industry.  Regulated consumers have historically pai=
d utility tariffs that reflect regulatory decisions.  These regulated tarif=
fs provide little, if any, meaningful supply/demand price information to th=
e consumer so the response has been to consume even during times when the u=
nderlying "cost" of doing so has been high.  As a result, demand curves hav=
e been categorized as 'inelastic' or 'vertical' suggesting the need for 'ca=
pacity' related products to meet any unexpected price insensitive demand.  =
The creation of RTOs and the resulting spot markets they include will, for =
the first time, give consumers the means and incentive to change the shape =
of their demand curve as a result of direct real time pricing information. =
 Changes in the shape of the demand curve will in turn eliminate the need f=
or specific capacity related payments as supply/demand interaction, and cur=
tailment, will be based on economic choices.
