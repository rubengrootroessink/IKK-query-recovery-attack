Jim, does lunch still work for you today @ Cafe Express?  Did we say 11:30
or 11:45am?

Thanks,
Dick.

   Jim, thanks for the lead on Governing Magazine.  Their online website is
   a
   great tool and source of info...already found some competitve info that
   helps underscore the market relevance of this solution.

   I'll look forward to meeting you Monday.

   Dick.
