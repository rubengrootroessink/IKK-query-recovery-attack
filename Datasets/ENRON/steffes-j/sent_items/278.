Yes, I have known her for quite some time.  She is the one who recommended me to Korn Ferry for the job that I have at Enron.  I will be happy to make the introduction.  Shall I make arrangements for a meeting in Pebble Beach???  
 
I'll give her a call when you say the word...Jean

Jean --
 
Laura Doll has been appointed head of the CA Power Authority.  Do you know her?  It would be good to have an introduction for Jeff Dasovich.
