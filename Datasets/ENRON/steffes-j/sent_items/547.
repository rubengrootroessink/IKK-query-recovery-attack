Subject: Information Request


 
As part of Public Affairs Global New Economy Initiative (GNEI), Margaret Allen has requested a comprehensive list of publications whose audiences are state and federal policymakers.  
 
For example, Roll Call, The Hill, National Review and Weekly Standard are a few of the magazines and newspapers whose readership includes the U.S. Congress.  
 
Part of the GNEI brand marketing initiative may include a certain level of advertising by Enron in these publications, and therefore it's important that we deliver to Margaret an adequate list to work from.  
 
Please identify someone on your team who will be responsible for pulling this list together and send me their names so that we can coordinate.
 
In addition to Washington, DC you should focus on those states where Enron has a significant stake in the wholesale and retail energy business as well as states where policies are being debated that affect Enron's other commodities (broadband etc).  
 
I will need the name of your designee by Friday, August 10th 
 
Margaret needs a final list by Friday, August 17th.  
 
Thanks!
