Joe / Thane

TXU was not able to send ERCOT the files as they had stated earlier this
week.  Here is the meter read information for 7 of the 11 meters.  The
other 4 will be read today.  The files (867_03) will be sent on Monday,
all still with a meter read date of 12/13/01.  This will update ERCOT's
system to show that Enron is no longer the REP of record for these 11
ESI IDs, once the files are processed.

Thane, please note, if I am correct, when initials are run for 12/14,
12/15 (as they are run 3 days later) the load may still show for Enron,
however on final statements, it will be fixed, as the meter data will
have been run through our system to update correctly.

Please call me if questions.

Thank you
Karen Bergman

443-1331 were all closed on 12-13.
Per our discussion, please provide payloads for these and I will give
Tracy

Diane, 687-1343, 617-1483 and 3001397 are the rate reads and Jeff is on
vacation today so it will be Monday until they close.
Account 533-5270 - I called Denise McBrayer in Ft. Worth, she is sending
reader by premise to get a reading so we can close account today.
Buddy said it would be Monday till final is released.

All will be closed for 12-13.
