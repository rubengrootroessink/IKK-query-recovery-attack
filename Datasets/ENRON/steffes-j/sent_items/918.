Sarah & Christi --

Let's make sure that we get our comments together prior to the phone call.  How about a phone call at 8:30 am CDT on Friday?  Also, probably don't need everyone on the EPSA call so maybe we should organize our participation?

Pls let me know.

Jim

RE: DRAFT Leave-Behinds for RTO Week
      -Conference Call FRIDAY, October 12th, 11:00 a.m. EDT

Based on discussions last week, several members suggested that EPSA create "big picture" leave-behinds for RTO Week at FERC.  EPSA has drafted bullet points for the leave-behinds, designed to follow the workshop agenda for the week.

We will be holding a conference call on Friday, October 12th, at 11:00 a.m. EDT to prepare for RTO week and discuss the draft leave-behinds.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.   If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please contact Julie Simon at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org.
