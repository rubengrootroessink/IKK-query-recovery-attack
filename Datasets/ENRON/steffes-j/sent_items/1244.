Howard --

How did this mistake happen?  Does their tariff allow for restatement of prices?  Does this cost the desk $$?  Maybe the NYISO shouldn't be doing this?

Subject: In-City Price Correction for UCAP Purchased and Sold in the
November 2001Deficiency Auction


An error has been found in the computation of the market-clearing price
established
for the November Deficiency Auction for UCAP purchased and sold in the New
York
City Locality.

The NYISO has corrected the error and posted the revised results of the
auction
to its web-site.  Correcting the computational error revised the New York
City Locality
market-clearing price of UCAP for the month of November from $4.35/kW-month
to
$4.80/kW-month.

Revised Award Notices will be sent to purchases and sellers of UCAP based
on
these revised results.

For your convenience, the revised auction results are attached.
