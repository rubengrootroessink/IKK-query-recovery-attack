The MiniPlan is in many ways a mini-web version of Business Plan Pro -- to give you a glimpse
of what writing a full business plan will be like. The MiniPlan is an
excellent place to condense an idea.

If you are very serious about your business plan, you should look at Business Plan Pro:

Thanks. Best of luck with the business.
