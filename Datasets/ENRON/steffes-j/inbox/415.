Before I started  having my on e-mail problems today, I told Robert Rosenberg of Slover & Loftus ((202) 347-7170; rdr@sloverandloftus.com ) that I would  see if I could successfully distribute his Wednesday Nov. 21 message and  attachments through the EL00-95 listserv.  Thus, I am giving it a  try.
 
However, as I look  at the attachments, one is 13 plus megs.  I will send that one  separately.  I might guess that it size is a problem, except that many  large files have made it through previously.  The file that is coming  separately is named "1121trl.pdf".
 
Below  is the text of his original message.  Attached are attachments hi provided  me separately, but which were supposed to go with that message.   Thanks,
