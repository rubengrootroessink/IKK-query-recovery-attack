		Thanks for registering your MiniPlan with Quicken.com and Palo Alto Software.

You can access your MiniPlan two ways.

>From the Web, just go to:
http://www.miniplan.com/index.cfm?affiliate=quicken

Alternately, if you use Quicken 2000 or 2001 for Windows, you can also access your Web MiniPlan from within Quicken.  Just go to the "Create a Business Plan" link from the Quicken Services Directory.  Once in the Palo Alto Software section, you'll find various links to business planning information, as well a link to the MiniPlan.

The MiniPlan is in many ways a mini-web version of Business Plan Pro so that you may get a glimpse of what writing a full business plan will be like. The MiniPlan is an excellent place to condense an idea. Once you have completed your MiniPlan, you'll be ready to take the next step by purchasing Business Plan Pro.  You can get more information at:

Thanks again and best of luck with the business.
