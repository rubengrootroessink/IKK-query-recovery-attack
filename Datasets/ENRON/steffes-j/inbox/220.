TANKER DEMAND LIKELY TO HIT 10-YEAR LOW
OPEC's agreement to slash crude production by 6.5%,
together with matching cuts by non-OPEC producers,
will reduce the demand for shipping by the equivalent
of nearly 30 supertankers a month.

GEMS, CASH STOLEN FROM SOUTH AFRICAN AIR-CARGO DEPOT
Between five and eight armed men surprised
three security guards at Johannesburg International Airport
as they inspected cargo from Amsterdam. The thieves made off
with $9.5 million in cash and an undisclosed amount
of diamonds and other jewelry.

MARITRANS LOSES OPA-90 CASE
The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that the double-hull
requirement of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 does not constitute
a "taking" of Maritrans' petroleum barges. Maritrans said
it is evaluating a possible appeal.

PROPOSAL OUTLINES RESPONSIBILITIES OF SECURITY AGENCY

will include security for transportation facilities,
coordinating intelligence related to transportation security,

Shaky start for air cargo
Air-cargo executives undoubtedly wish they could
forget the disastrous year that's about to conclude.
Unfortunately, they won't be able to because few expect
rates or volume to rebound until next spring, at
the earliest.
