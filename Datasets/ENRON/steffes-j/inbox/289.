I thought that last night's call went well.  I hope that it was useful for
you.

One action item that seemed to be emerging is for your negotiators to
request certain information from the other side-perhaps as early as today.

I am sharpening up a memo that suggests key information to request and a
priority scheme for the information.

I would like to review the draft with colleagues here before sending it to
you in a couple of hours.

If you can tolerate the delay, you might suggest to the negotiators that
they hold off until you receive my memo before deciding exactly what to
request.

I am trying to keep things simple, but adequate to make some useful
calculations.  I am mindful that we may only get one bite at the apple.
