My read of Mike's summary shows the one cent surcharge was re-characterized in Decision 01-03-082 to apply only to bundled  accounts consistent with the treatment of the three cent surcharge.  I think Mike's summary clearly expresses why Enron believes it should not have been invoiced this amount from March 27,2001 forward. 

Thanks,

Wanda

I would ask Mike about the last sentence in bullet 5.  Based on the language of the quote the Commission appears to be referring to the surcharge "adopted in D. 01-03-082."  Was the .01 surcharge "adopted" in that proceeding?  Maybe I am reading this too literally.  I do agree that the rationale for exempting DA customers from the 3 cent surcharge applies equally to the 1 cent surcharge, and that we should continue to strive for this clarification at the CPUC (which Sue Mara is handling).  Sue, I am forwarding this to you for your comments.
