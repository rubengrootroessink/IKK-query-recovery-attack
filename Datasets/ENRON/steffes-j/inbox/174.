We are currently negotiating with ISO-NE and NEPOOL to ensure that we do not have to comply with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy for a period until at least 15 February 2001 to enable us to continue to service our existing in the money agreements in NEPOOL. 
	
We have filed a heads of terms with FERC today which envisages that we will enter into a fully termed agreement next week in which EPMI, EES and EEMC will pre-pay for a rolling three day period starting 27 December for all energy and other services in NEPOOL. NEPOOL will provide an estimate of such costs and expenses by 12.00 a.m. on 26 December and the money will need to be wired to the nominated account, details of which are set out below, by 04:00 p.m. eastern standard time the following Business Day This will occur every Business Day and we therfore need to be set up to wire the amounts of money demanded. It should be noted that NEPOOL require that there be at least three days pre-paid at all times.

There will be a reconciliation at the end of every month. We do have the flexibility to pre-pay for more than three days if it is deemed expedient or prudent to do so. 
	
Leslie Reeves and Wade Stubblefield will be responsible for ensuring that the monies are wired in a timely manner.

	
Marcus
