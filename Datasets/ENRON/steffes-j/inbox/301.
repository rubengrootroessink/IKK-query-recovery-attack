FYI

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index
published : November 19, 2001
		EIA Storage Survey Faces OMB Review, Several Months of
Testing
		The Energy Information Administration is preparing take over
the American Gas Association's (AGA) storage survey at the end of the
winter. But it first must get clearance from the Office of Management and
Budget for the reporting burden placed on storage companies, EIA's survey
methodology and the budget requirements for conducting the survey. It also
has to arrange the staffing and resources and perform an operational test
before it can get a green light.
		These requirements could take longer than expected, and the
agency is hoping the AGA will continue its survey at least through the end
of March. AGA already has stated the report will be discontinued at the
beginning of January.
		EIA intends to make its weekly gas storage survey very
similar, but not identical to AGA's. One important difference is that it
will require mandatory participation from the companies it chooses to be
part of the survey sample. It also will have the added benefit of being able
to compare reported weekly data with its longstanding monthly information
from the storage companies. EIA hasn't ironed out all the details or laid
down a schedule, but observers expect its report will have similar regional
information to AGA's and would be released at a similar time.
		EIA is expected to file its plans with the OMB sometime soon
after Thanksgiving. It expects the OMB to put the filing through fast-track
processing and hand down a decision about two weeks after it's filed. But
getting the survey ready could take at least several months. EIA expects to
issue a schedule for launching the survey in early December. If AGA does not
agree to continue the survey past January, the market could be without its
most valuable weekly information on supply and demand for several months.
