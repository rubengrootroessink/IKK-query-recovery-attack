Ginger

Thanks for sending this out. I do have a new mobile number in London which 
is +44-7789-320-511 - in the event that you send out another one. I am 
taking a little time off from the insanity of the past few weeks to relax 
with my family in Florida. I hope you are making the most of the holidays 
and please extend my best to Rick and Jim.

Cheers, Paul
