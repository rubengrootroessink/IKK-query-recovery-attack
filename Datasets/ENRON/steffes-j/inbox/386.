Great job in developing the comments.  You addressed my concerns regarding PJM as the platform and the state commissioners' concerns.  One comment I have is in regards to RTO boundaries (1st sentence of 2nd paragraph under I.B. "The Commission is On the Right Track for RTO Formation", page 3) - should we include/reference the Cardell study we did for the northeast and included in our Northeast RTO filing?  Also, do we want to address ITC's in general and to specifically preclude the hybrid-RTO proposed by the New England in the Northeast RTO?

Attached are draft RTO comments.  The comments reflect EPMI's views on RTO development, given the Commission's apparent recent changes in position on the number of RTOs to be created.  We urge Right Sized RTOs without choosing a number.  


The comments reflect input from Christi, Dave Perrino, Steve Walton, Mike Roan, Andy and Charles.  Please review the sections where you have had input to make sure we adequately reflected your points, but please also review the entire document and let us know your thoughts.

I'm still filling in cites and Bernadette will be working on the formatting, but the document is hopefully in pretty good shape.  There is no filing deadline for these comments, but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible.  It shouldn't take more than an hour to review.  In sending your comments, please "Reply to All" so everyone receives your comments.  

Thanks for everyone's help.

Susan:  we should also have Kevin review the comments

Alan:  Tim should probably review the comments as well, but check with Dave and Steve to see if the "LMP in the West" argument is correct before you show him the comments.
