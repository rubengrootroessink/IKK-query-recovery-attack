You may recall that the last summary included SCE advice letter 1586-E.  This was the advice filing that seeksto implement a number of the regulatory components included in the October 2, 2001 Settlement Agreement between the CPUC and SCE.  The summary noted that Edison asked for comments to be due on November 28.  That request has been denied (see the attached letter), and comments are instead due on December 4.
 
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!
