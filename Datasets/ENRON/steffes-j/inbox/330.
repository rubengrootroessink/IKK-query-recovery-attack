Doug, attached is a new version of the paper (the structure is starting to take form).  I don't know who Wes is but i need to touch base with him so that we can get Larry involved in this process quickly (could you email me his contact info).

regards
Mike

As you may have heard, i resigned on Friday so i need to get this underway today (the best way to contact me is by cell 713 822 0135).  Christi is back next week to take over the reigns and Luiz can continue to work on it and coordinate with Larry.
