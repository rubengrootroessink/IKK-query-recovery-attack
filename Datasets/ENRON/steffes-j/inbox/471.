Please address this with the Listserv participants.
 
Hearing on 12/20 probably should be avoided because of distractions likely  to intrude in the sound system from a holiday party at the Commission which  I have just learned will involve all offices and most  floors.   Rather than keep witnesses over until 12/21 and have a  day of hearing on that day, and as we will be in hearing on 202(c) issues on  1/8, I would offer the following suggestion:.  
 
Hold 3 days of hearing on issue  #1 on 12/17, 18, 19, as  planned,  reschedule the hearings  for 12/20 and 12/21 to 1/3,  1/4, and /or 1/7, and  then hear the 202(c) issues, as planned, on  1/8.  Initial and reply brief dates of 1/15 and 1/22 would remain  unchanged, as would the remainder of the trial schedule.
 
I am open to other suggestions and would like to retain as much as possible  the bifurcated trial schedule process.
