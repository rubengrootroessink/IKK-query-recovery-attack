It currently looks like we will not have any wire requests today for power prepayments. 

East Power - We are currently working with PJM and NEPOOL to come to a payment resolution to remain active and current in those two markets, and will not have any need for a wire transfers today (the earliest we will need may be tomorrow depending upon form of resolution).  Additionally, given the post Christmas market conditions and lack of liquidity (and staffing needs in companies other than Enron), Kevin and Dana were not able to execute any bilateral prepay deals for the regions outside PJM and NEPOOL.  They will be continuing to push these deals for the next several days, but realistically, it may be next week before we can actually pull these off.

West Power -  We will have tomorrow a detailed prepay list and wire requests for the first week of January.

Thanks for everyone's help with this process.

Don
