RE: Second Draft of EPSA Leave-Behind on Market-Based
      Rate Authority
      ?Conference Call on Friday, November 16th at 11:00 AM
       (EST)

On Friday, November 2nd EPSA held a conference call to discuss the second draft of our leave-behind on market-based rate authority, which details our position on possible changes to FERC's market-based rate authorization standard and the Commission's recently released staff report outlining several alternatives to the currently used hub-and-spoke method.

Please review the attached draft, which has been extensively revised since the November 2nd call.  An investigation on market-based rate authorization has been noticed for next week's FERC meeting agenda, which makes it important that we come to closure on these issues.  We have scheduled a conference call on Friday, November 16th at 11:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss this draft.  To access the call, please dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Erin Perrigo/EPSA Call. If you have any questions, comments or edits before the call, please contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 or eperrigo@epsa.org.
