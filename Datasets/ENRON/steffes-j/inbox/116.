Jim-

I was hoping that you could give me a status update on the outstanding invoices
from PJM to the two Enron subs. It was my understanding that you were going to
be discussing them with the "5 day" committee today.

Given the ramifications of a default, some of which we spoke of this morning, I
would like to stay as up-to-date as possible with Enron's plans and intentions.

Thank you very much,

Chris Hein
