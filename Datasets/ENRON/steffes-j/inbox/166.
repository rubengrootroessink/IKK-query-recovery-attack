The implementation of incorporating PJM West into PJM will not occur on January
1, 2002 as planned because the merger has not yet received final approval by
FERC. FERC provisionally approved Allegheny Power joining the PJM RTO in July,
2001. Much of the system integration coding, testing and training work has
already been completed, and staff has been employed to operate the PJM West
office and dispatch center in Greensburg, PA.

At its meeting on December 19, the FERC rejected a PJM West "cleanup" filing on
procedural issues, while continuing to endorse the concept of PJM West, and
suggested that they would act on PJM West in the near future. In order to allow
Allegheny necessary lead time, the implementation date will be the first of the
month at least 30 days following FERC approval. PJM will continue to move toward
the implementation of required system changes in an orderly fashion.
