Jim,
 
This isn't the most appropriate time to be asking for this favor but I was wondering if you would write a letter of recommendation for me for business school.  I've already been accepted to DU's law program but I've recently decided to pursue their joint JD/MBA degree.  So....I need to apply to their business school separately.  
 
Rick wrote a letter for me when I applied to the law school, and I thought you would be a good person to write one for the MBA.
 
I am attaching a form that you can detach and fill out (you can include comments within this form or draft a letter of recommendation and include as an attachment).  When you're finished, I will give you a special envelope that you have to sign and seal.  Return the envelope to me, and I will mail it with the application and other materials directly to the school.
 
Just so you know, I've also asked one of the emission brokers at Cantor Fitzgerald to write a letter and also Greg Woulfe (who I reported to on the Power Desk).   
 
I'm applying to the Univerisity of Denver Daniels College of Business
www.dcb.du.edu <http://www.dcb.du.edu> (if you want more information).
 
I hope you don't mind.  I just need to have it all completed by December 1st.
