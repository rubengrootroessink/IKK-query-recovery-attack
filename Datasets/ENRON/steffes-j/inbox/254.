Here are updates for the FERC and EIA reports --

FERC -- We are still waiting on the August purchase info and the September purchase and sale info for EES.  Nagesh expects that the purchase data will be available Wednesday of this week.  A purchase report was provided last week, but several key fields were missing and the report had to be adjusted.  On the sales side, Steve Walker anticipates that the September report will be complete tomorrow.  

EIA -- According to Steve, the EIA reports should also be ready tomorrow.   

Once the reports are provided I will need time to prepare the data for filing.  Depending on the size of the reports, I may be able to turn around the FERC report for August puchases and the EIA data (August and September) by Friday, and the September FERC data by the middle of next week.

I'll keep you posted.

Jeff
