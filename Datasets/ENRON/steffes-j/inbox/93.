David Doot left me a message that he had not heard back and he was expecting our proposal yesterday (which we had not told him).  He also said that the bonding company was "rumbling" that it was not going to pay.  I do not know what their obligation is to pay, but I would think that "rumbling" is not default, yet.

Jim S. is going to call David Doot back this afternoon.
