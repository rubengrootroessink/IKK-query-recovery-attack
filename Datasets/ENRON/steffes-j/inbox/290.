Fred -- I will look around to see if there is anything that is current that examines ComEd's transmission system and changes needed to meet its future requirements.  As a result of the disasterous summer of 1999, the Commission required ComEd to conduct and quartyerly report on the adequacy of its distribution and transmission system upgrades.  These reports can be measured by the pound (at least 30 lb.) and have a lot of extraneous material, as you could imagine.  I'll let you know what I find.

Fred: I don't cover the midwest. I'm forwarding a copy of your email to Janine Migden who is in charge of Government Affairs for that region. She can respond to your inquiry directly. Howard

Thanks for the ConEd transmission information.  Have you seen any similar information for ComEd (Commonwealth Edison) in Chicago?  I am responsible for ENA's development work in Illinois.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Fred

Attached is a revised annual transmission analysis prepared by Con Ed for its system. It looks out over the next five years and identifies what, if any, system enhancements are needed to meet projected load growth and otherwise maintain system reliability, as well as additional costs necessitated by the proposed addition of nw generation in the Con Ed service territory. These draft reports are specified under the interconnection cost allocation tariff additions recently approved by FERC with significant modifications. One of those modifications is that FERC directed the ISO to prepare these draft reports for the utility systems, rather than rely on the utilities to do the studies. The ISO has yet to determine how it intends to comply with FERC's decision, especially for the initial study period.
