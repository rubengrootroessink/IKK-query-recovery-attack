Jim, Jose and Andy

Here is a comprehensive list of the forums at NERC in which I participate.  I will be glad to provide any help in allocating these responsibilites to Jose, Andy or whomever.

1. Market Interface Committee (meets 7 times per year)  - appointed seat, is not transferable, will be resigned.  Note - my term expires in June 2002 anyway

2. Interchange Subcommittee (meets every 2 months) - Chairman, is not transferable, however, there will be an open position for a marketer which can be filled by Enron, also participate on task groups under this subcommittee, Note - Dynegy has a member, Jason Cox

3. Congestion Management Subcommittee (meets every 2 months) - market rep, transferable, Note - Dynegy has a member, Vann Prater

4. Electronic Scheduling Task Force (meets monthly) - market rep, transferable, Note - Andy Rodriquez already participates as the TISWG Vice Chair

5. Flow Based Task Force - market rep, to be disbanded

6. EPSA-NAERO working group - dealing with the NERC vs EISB issues

There are other NERC groups that follow my position as IS Chair and MIC rep which will not need to be filled.
