We will need to figure out for ourselves whether the EESI bond has been terminated or not.  The PUC will only know well after the fact whether it's been terminated and only after they've received (usually after considerable lag) notice from the folks with whom  we've got the bond that it's been terminated.  What's the best way of researching/finding out whether the bond's current or has been terminated?

Best,
Jeff

Wade -

There may also need to be another $100k for EESI.  Jeff is checking.
