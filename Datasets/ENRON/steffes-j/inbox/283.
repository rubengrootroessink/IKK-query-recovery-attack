Rebecca --

Pls work through Gloria and Bevin Hunter (in Austin).  My understanding is that PUCT filing deadlines are always 3pm, but Bevin can take it over to the PUCT this evening.

I assume that you will create the report and Gloria will draft a simple cover sheet filing. Gloria, we may need Marianne Carroll to sign??

Jim,

We have to file a report  under project 22834 - pilot reporting in Texas today.  The data will be available at 4PM. Who on your team can I coordinate with to submit the actual filing?

The procedure to submit the filing can be located on the Texas PUC website   http://www.puc.state.tx.us/   left-hand side, filings.

Thanks in advance,
Rebecca
