The parties to Docket No. EL00-95-045 had a one-hour phone  call this afternoon to discuss ways to identify material for which it is  appropriate to lift the protective order.  
The ISO is prepared to release all claims for protection,  except for certain gas data which comes from a commercial gas index  service.  The ISO is negotiating with that company to allow release of  those data.
Many of the participants who filed material under seal  did so because their exhibits were based on claims of privilege by the ISO  or other parties.   All parties who have submitted material under seal  will send to the ISO by Wednesday, November 28, COB East Coast time, a  list of their claims of privilege.  They will state
(1) whether the claim is derivative (i.e. it is based on a  source's claim of privilege.)
(2) if it is not derivative whether the protective order can  be lifted, or
(3) whether they are still claiming protection for the  material.
By Friday, Nov. 30, the ISO will circulate a list to the judge  and the participants showing the material for which protection is, and is  not, still claimed.
The participants who file rebuttal testimony will be  prepared to explain the basis for any claims of  protection for  the rebuttal testimony in the conference on December 13, 2001.  The  participants will also use best efforts to identify by December 13, 2001 any  documents which they plan to use for cross-examination which may be subject to  claims of protection.
