Update 12/18/01

ERCOT has successfully loaded 5 867_03 finals into our systems - these 5
ESI IDs have completed the Drop to TDSP.  Enron should have received the
867_03 finals for each ESI ID.

10443720003625902
10443720005335301
10443720004233186
10443720007738300
10443720006522263

ERCOT is working with TXU on the 4 ESI ID listed below.

10443720004431331 - wrong DUNS sent in the file from TXU, didn't
translate correctly at ERCOT.  TXU needs to please resend.
10443720006871343 - need file name from TXU, ERCOT does not show receipt
of file.
10443720003630335 - need file name from TXU, ERCOT does not show receipt
of file.
10443720003001397 - need file name from TXU, ERCOT does not show receipt
of file.

ERCOT is working internal on the 2 ESI ID listed below.
10443720003625902 - ERCOT has file from TXU, working to determine why
ERCOT system did not update to Drop to TDSP, will process manually to
drop if necessary, once we confirm that Enron does have the 867_03
final.
10443720005335301 - ERCOT has file from TXU, working to determine why
ERCOT system did not update to Drop to TDSP, will process manually to
drop if necessary, once we confirm that Enron does have the 867_03
final.

Please note, the meter read date from TXU is stated to be 12/13 for all
11 ESI IDs.  Once we do get the information loaded into ERCOT system, it
will reflect that Enron Energy Services stopped as CR of record on
12/13/01.

Questions, please contact me at 512-248-3171.

Thanks

Senior Client Service Representative

Joe / Thane

TXU was not able to send ERCOT the files as they had stated earlier this
week.  Here is the meter read information for 7 of the 11 meters.  The
other 4 will be read today.  The files (867_03) will be sent on Monday,
all still with a meter read date of 12/13/01.  This will update ERCOT's
system to show that Enron is no longer the REP of record for these 11
ESI IDs, once the files are processed.

Thane, please note, if I am correct, when initials are run for 12/14,
12/15 (as they are run 3 days later) the load may still show for Enron,
however on final statements, it will be fixed, as the meter data will
have been run through our system to update correctly.

Please call me if questions.

Thank you

443-1331 were all closed on 12-13.
Per our discussion, please provide payloads for these and I will give

Diane, 687-1343, 617-1483 and 3001397 are the rate reads and Jeff is on
vacation today so it will be Monday until they close.
Account 533-5270 - I called Denise McBrayer in Ft. Worth, she is sending
reader by premise to get a reading so we can close account today.
Buddy said it would be Monday till final is released.

All will be closed for 12-13.
