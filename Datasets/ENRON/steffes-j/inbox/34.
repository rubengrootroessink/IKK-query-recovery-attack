Talked to Pescetti yesterday.  Prior to returning my call, he had received the information that Joe Kelliher had already been appointed to the open Republican spot, and therefore understands that there's no longer a Republican seat to run for. We had a good talk. I told him that reinstating DA was the most important energy issue facing California.

Best,
Jeff
