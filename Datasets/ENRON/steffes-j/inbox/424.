Vol. 3, No. 22

Governing a Northeast RTO

When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruled that the three N=
ortheastern ISOs - the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Independent System =
Operator (PJM), the New England ISO (NEISO), and the New York ISO (NYISO) -=
 should become a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), some hoped that =
these birds of a feather would flock together. After all, PJM, NEISO, and N=
YISO are examples for the country, teaching that RTOs are an essential cond=
ition for the creation of competitive wholesale markets. The three ISOs als=
o individually oversee very small markets that are vulnerable to market pow=
er, have higher than necessary transaction costs, and other problems precis=
ely because of the scope of their individual markets. Indeed, even once all=
 three markets are merged, the combined market will account for less than 1=
5 percent of the nation's generation. All these factors would drive rationa=
l participants focused on creating genuinely competitive markets toward mer=
ger. At least one would think so.

Yet so far, an intensive mediation process reveals that nobody is checking =
parochial interests at the negotiating-room door. In terms of the new RTO b=
oard and membership, participants are haggling about whether 3+3+3=3D1 inde=
pendent board or whether 5+3+2 does. Such equations will never balance, no =
matter how hard one tries. The greater good is getting lost in turf battles=
 and worse. If this myopic behavior continues, the result will be that all =
regions and all states lose, because they cannot see beyond their own noses=
.

Consequently, the ball is squarely back in FERC's court to direct the devel=
opment of a successful RTO. It now faces some key decisions as it attempts =
to make good on the promise of the merger: to improve market efficiency, di=
minish market power concerns, improve interconnection rules for renewable e=
nergy resources, and reduce costs to consumers. For demand response and ren=
ewable energy advocates the stakes are especially high. Indeed the expansio=
n of PJM into the Allegheny Energy control area was crucial to resolving in=
terconnection issues that allowed development of the Mill Run, Pennsylvania=
 15-MW wind farm and enables future wind development in West Virginia that =
will in January 2002 be significantly within PJM.

The ability of the Northeast RTO to make effective decisions and follow thr=
ough on those decisions will determine its eventual success or failure. But=
 the debate over RTO governance begins and ends with the fact that FERC dir=
ected that PJM be the platform for the new organization, utilizing the "bes=
t practices" from NYISO and NEISO. PJM has the greatest experience and most=
 successful track record of the three ISOs and is about the same size as NY=
ISO and NEISO combined. At the same time, NYISO and NEISO have performed we=
ll and have addressed some issues more successfully than PJM. The recent PJ=
M report to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission confirming that PJM'=
s thoroughly discredited ICAP market was indeed manipulated by a "single ma=
rket participant" which exercised undue market power in early 2001 is a tim=
ely reminder that PJM does not walk on water.

Unfortunately, rather than tackling implementation issues solely on their m=
erits, debates have retained the persistent undercurrent of ISO, regional, =
stakeholder and corporate turf wars or self-interests.

Only FERC can get the process moving swiftly in the right direction by dire=
cting that the new RTO be an independent entity with superior board experie=
nce and clear decision-making authority responsive to genuine stakeholder i=
nput. There is no place for perpetuation of existing ISO self-interests, se=
lf-serving stakeholder vetoes, or regional power brokering.

Four principles are critical in the formation of any governance structure: =
board experience and independence, effective input of all stakeholders, suf=
ficient board decision-making authority, and sufficient monitoring of marke=
t power.

An Independent and Experienced Board

Happily, the three proposals which emerged from the mediation process requi=
re members of the board to be independent from any of the market participan=
ts, precluding working for any of the companies doing business in the North=
east RTO markets, owning stock in member companies, or participating on any=
 affiliated boards.

In contrast to this good news is the bad news that the three proposals focu=
s too heavily on giving each existing ISO proper representation on the new =
RTO board, and what the proper representation would be. This regional focus=
 undercuts independence and treats the RTO board like the United States Sen=
ate where each Senator comes from a state and argues for its interests. Loy=
alty to the home ISO becomes the real requirement in such cases, not indepe=
ndence.

Independence for the new RTO board membership should also mean independence=
 from the institutional interests of the existing PJM, NYISO, and NEISO. Ev=
en if the existing ISOs retain operation for an extended period, it would b=
e for practical, technical reasons, not because the ISOs themselves are a n=
ecessary constituency. To take a seat on the Northeast RTO board, all new R=
TO board members should resign any existing ISO board positions. The only f=
iduciary responsibility these board officers should have is to the new orga=
nization.

The new RTO board should include the most qualified individuals, without un=
due emphasis on whether or not they previously served on a particular ISO b=
oard. It makes sense that some, but perhaps not all, of the individuals on =
the new RTO board will have previously served on ISO boards. Such experienc=
e is invaluable. Yet it appears that some parties are stuck in the rut that=
 ISO experience must bring ISO baggage. If the fiduciary duty of RTO board =
members is clearly to the RTO instead of to a prior ISO, it will be easier =
to get beyond ISO power issues. To encourage the movement of the most quali=
fied ISO board members to the new RTO board, the "transition" board also sh=
ould be or become the initial "permanent" Northeast RTO board.

Rather than on representation, selection of RTO board members should focus =
primarily on the breadth of issues that will be facing the new RTO. A well-=
rounded set of board experience and skills is essential to addressing such =
important issues as demand response, interconnection of generators, cost re=
covery mechanisms, system planning, and reliability.

The new RTO board should have members with regulatory, financial, environme=
ntal, consumer and reliability backgrounds. Besides providing voices genuin=
ely without the baggage of prior ISO affiliation, the initial RTO board sho=
uld probably, for example, include someone with substantial experience in m=
erging organizations. The search process for new board members should be do=
ne in an open manner with input from all stakeholders to ensure adequate ex=
pertise in the diversity of issues that will face the new RTO.

Stakeholder Input

Meaningful stakeholder input is crucial because the RTO will be fundamental=
ly charged with serving the public interest in an industry that is at the h=
eart of our economy, security, and environment. Moreover, no board or manag=
ement team can adequately predict all of the impacts brought on by rule cha=
nges without close coordination with market participants. The RTO will ulti=
mately survive only if it maintains its credibility and the confidence of t=
he public.

The three existing ISOs have made a substantial transition from a narrow co=
nception of stakeholders as "transmission owners" to encompass "market part=
icipants" and even to include public representatives. PJM has recently expa=
nded the types of parties that can participate in the process by facilitati=
ng the ability of State Consumer Advocates to join and be voting members. O=
ther ISOs have gone even further by specifying specific categories for envi=
ronmental agencies and individual consumers (and minimizing the costs of jo=
ining.) Of course, many stakeholder processes require so much time and expe=
nse that it is difficult or even impossible for such stakeholders to meanin=
gfully participate.

But while opportunities for genuine and appropriate stakeholder input are e=
ssential, stakeholder processes cannot become an excuse or a means to avoid=
 problem solving. There is a fine line between genuine stakeholder input an=
d de facto special interest veto power. Over the past four years, PJM relie=
d heavily on its membership to make improvements to market rules and has th=
e best (though still flawed) wholesale energy market in the country. Yet it=
 is equally clear that stakeholder input can impede positive changes, such =
as eliminating the ICAP requirements or implementing demand-response propos=
als.

These concerns are balanced by having stakeholder opportunities for input b=
uilt into RTO problem solving, without allowing stakeholder processes to ha=
ve a life of their own or the pretense of being the board. Stakeholders sho=
uld not only be able to comment on proposed changes but also should constan=
tly look for ways to improve the market and be able to communicate these su=
ggestions to the RTO board. In turn, the board should take these suggestion=
s seriously. This healthy relationship is hard to reduce to rules and rules=
 alone cannot create it. Ultimately only a combination of rules, incentives=
, and personal leadership can make it happen.

Decision-Making Authority

Ultimately, the RTO board should be able to file changes with FERC on all m=
arket rule changes and reliability changes, with stakeholder input but with=
out specific stakeholder approval. The RTO board must have the ability to f=
ile under the more broadly defined Section 205 of the FPA.

One example of the effective use of this type of intervention came earlier =
this spring. After months of negotiation on an economic demand-response pro=
gram, several PJM market participants chose to block passage. The PJM board=
 reviewed the results of the various votes on the demand-response programs,=
 determined that the programs were justified and important, and filed the p=
roposed rule changes, which FERC approved.

Since individual ISO boards will likely remain during a transition phase, a=
ll FERC filings should be made through the RTO board, which would have fina=
l decision-making authority.

Market Monitoring

Effective, independent market monitoring is essential to identifying market=
 power problems and fixing them. But an effective market monitoring presenc=
e also requires close observation from inside the RTO. PJM's Market Monitor=
ing Unit (MMU) works for and reports to PJM.

As more parties attempt to merge and contractually control more assets, mon=
itoring market power will become more important. The market would be better=
 served if the MMU were more independent of PJM, perhaps reporting directly=
 to FERC and the board. The MMU must have both the ability to identify mark=
et flaws and the authority to make corrections in a timely manner, without =
being subjected to a committee process that could delay or avoid effective =
responses.

Next Steps

Since the mediation process, FERC has been working to incorporate state reg=
ulatory agencies into the development of the RTO. But as with other stakeho=
lders, too many states are allowing parochial interests to interfere.

To keep the process moving, an independent search firm should review existi=
ng board members and potential new candidates to determine what would make =
for an effective RTO board which meets the criteria outlined above. FERC sh=
ould then direct the new RTO Board to start the long process of creating a =
fully functional and effective RTO. The first task of the RTO board is to c=
ommission an implementation team and set out the overall direction.

Second, FERC should establish an inclusive stakeholder process that can eff=
ectively communicate to the board.

Finally, FERC should empower a Market Monitoring Unit that reports directly=
 to the Commission as well as the board.

With these steps, the birds of a feather that PJM, NYISO, and NEISO really =
are could finally flock together.
