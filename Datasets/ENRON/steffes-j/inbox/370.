The September 26, 2001 order had established December 10, 2001 as the date  for  "Simultaneous rebuttal testimony on November 6, 2001 evidentiary  presentations."  On November 6, 2001 several parties had filed responsive  testimony on issues relating to other sources of cost recovery, including NOx  emissions and startup costs
The November 23, 2001 order said these issues will be addressed at the  February hearing on issues 2 and 3. 
This combination left Staff uncertain as to when rebuttal testimony on  these issues is to be filed.  We called Bryan Clark,  Judge  Birchman's  new law clerk, and asked when we are to file rebuttal  testimony.  He checked with Judge Birchman, and said we are to file all  rebuttal testimony on these issues on February 6, 2002.
