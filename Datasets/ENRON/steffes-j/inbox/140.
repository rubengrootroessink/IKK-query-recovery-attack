Jim and Rick,

	I will am resigning from Enron and terminating my employment, effective December 31, 2001.  At the first of the year, I will be joining the consulting team building RTO West.  

	It has been a great opportunity to work with you here at Enron.  I have learned a great deal.  Thanks for all you kindnesses to me.
