We do need to pay PJM- the two profitable deals have NOT been terminated.

I think this should capture our positions by region.  We need to confirm such that we can decided whether we let PJM and NEPOOL go away.

I've prepared a few slides illustrating the liquidation of various positions which appear not to have been terminated based on the information provided to me.  Perhaps these slides could be used as a tool for prioritizing contracts for potential prepay transactions, in an effort to reduce the depletion/economic erosion we currently face.  As well, I have provided this same information to Calger in the West.
