IV.	FDI News Highlights

UNCTAD predicts a further decline in global FDI this year due to the recent events

According to UNCTAD -- http://www.unctad.org -- the events of September 11, 2001 on global FDI flows will accentuate the 40 percent decline expected in 2001 (US$760 billion) -- http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/poitem49.en.pdf (Acrobat reader required). The further weakening of the domestic economies of the United States and other leading industrialized countries and higher levels of uncertainty are likely to induce companies to adopt a wait-and-see approach and put planned investments on hold until they gain a better understanding of the longer term impact of the events as they unfold. FDI in industries, such as transportation services, airplane manufacturing, tourism, insurance and financial services may in particular be negatively affected. The recent events may lead to higher FDI in low-cost countries, as companies facing declining demand seek to cut costs further. While the longer term impact of the recent events on FDI flows is difficult to forecast at this point, in 2001 !

tal FDI flows are anticipated to be less than US$700 billion.

OECD meeting addresses international taxation and cross-border investment

In the recent Global Forum on Taxation -- http://www.oecd.org/oecd/pages/home/displaygeneral/0,3380,EN-document-103-3-no-12-18277-103,00.html -- organized by OECD -- http://www.oecd.org -- participants addressed several issues regarding international taxation of multinational enterprises, tax havens, harmful tax practices and transfer pricing. Over 1,500 bilateral tax treaties around the world provide a framework for avoiding double taxation and for co-operation between tax authorities to resolve disputes and exchange information. In today's global economy a large share of world trade consists of transfers of goods, intangibles and services within multinational enterprises. Transfer pricing rules are therefore an important tool to determine tax liabilities in each jurisdiction. Competition for FDI has encouraged countries to make their tax systems more attractive to investors. However, some tax and related practices are anti-competitive and can undercut the gains that tax co!

VII.	Overview of IPAnet Sponsorship Benefits

IPAnet is one of the most frequently utilized Internet sites focusing on foreign direct investment information and investment promotion. IPAnet's databases now catalog over 11,800 information resources (links to other Web sites or documents hosted on our server) drawn from over 600 organizations. These resources make IPAnet the leading Internet portal for information on investment conditions, legal and regulatory issues, as well as specific investment and privatization opportunities worldwide. Today over 19,000 professionals from more than 5,000 institutions in 195 countries -- mainly private sector organizations involved in cross-border investment -- use IPAnet to meet their information-gathering and research needs and contact relevant decision-makers in government, industry and the financial sector.

Sponsorship: You can reach this exclusive audience of multinational companies and investors by becoming an IPAnet sponsor. Sponsors receive a package of on-line marketing services, including a banner advertisement linked to your Home Page. By including an e-mail link in your marketing presentation you can facilitate inquiries by interested IPAnet users. IPAnet also offers online distribution of relevant press releases via the News Sources section and notices of upcoming conferences or other investment-related events via the Events Calendar section.

Annual sponsorship of IPAnet costs US$2,000 per year. A lifetime sponsorship costs US$10,000. Compare the cost of sponsorship to advertising rates in many trade publications -- a full-page advertisement in a single issue of many print publications can be as much as three times the IPAnet annual sponsorship rate!

Sponsored Surveys: IPAnet will work with selected organizations to develop and host sponsored surveys addressing specific investment-related topics or sectors. These sponsored surveys can provide information resources, case studies and "best practice" guidelines that both highlight and leverage upon the expertise of the partner organization.
