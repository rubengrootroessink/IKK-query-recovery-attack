I just told ConEd that no money was going out today - they are going to start switching customers to dual bills.  I've asked for a list of the customers who will be switched and when it will occur.

Bob, 

Given the uncertainty today as to whether we are going to accept or reject the customer contracts behind Con Ed., the fact that most if not all of the amounts outstanding are pre-petition claims and our inability to verify quickly whether we in fact have received customer monies not remitted to ConEd. we cannot remit payment to them today.  The letter they sent indicates that we have to remit monies to them that we collect from customers.  Given our billing procedures of not invoicing customers until we get Con Ed.'s bill we cannot determine whether in fact the money they say is owed has actually been paid to us by customers.  We are in the process of reconciling this along with every other pre petition bill we have.

Not sure what or how you need to communicate with Con Ed., or not at all.  If you want to discuss further please give me a call.

Thanks
Wade
