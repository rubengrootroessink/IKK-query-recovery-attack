Here are the meetings that I have scheduled for the balance of November at ERCOT/PUCT:

November 16  Protocol Revision Subcommittee.  No voting seat, however, any attending can vote, limited to one vote per company.

November 19 -- ERCOT Board Meeting.  No Voting Seat, (until Jean wins one next month).
		TEX MEX will be discussed, however, not in detail.  

November 20 -- PUCT Open Meeting

November 26 -- Congestion Management Working Group -- Development of the TCR. I chair the group, however I will not continue to do after leaving Enron.

November 28 --  There is a capacity auction rulemaking at the PUCT.  This will be to determine the rules under which the September 2002 and subsequent auctions will take place.
