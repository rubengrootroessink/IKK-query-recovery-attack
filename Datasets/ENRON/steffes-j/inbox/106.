If we don't pay this $5000 invoice, we still maintain our ability to participate in the NY ISO markets/transmission, etc. (subject to our other collateral issues).  We would, however, lose the ability to vote on market design, governance, attend committee meetings as a member, etc.  We simply pay the $5000 to get "reinstated" if we choose to begin participation during the year.

I doubt that we should pay this $5000, but let me know.
