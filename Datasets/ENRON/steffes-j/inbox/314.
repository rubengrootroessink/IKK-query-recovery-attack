AEP may be looking for some origination and marketing people.  Would you
consider Columbus, OH?

I'll ask around floor.  Given my background, this position does not
sound like the best fit - I'd rather be more on the long-term
contracting (origination) side or business development.  Thanks for the
inquiry.

As you know, things are pretty crazy right now here at Enron.  I intend
to take the week off after Thanksgiving and intend to give you a call
during that period.  Have a great Thanksgiving.

Jim
