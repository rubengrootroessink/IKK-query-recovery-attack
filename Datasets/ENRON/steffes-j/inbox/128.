We have previously told the TX PUC Staff we will be posting required collateral of $100,000 by the end of the month  (as required by Rule 25.107(f)) in order to maintain EES certification.  The requirement is that we maintain "unused cash resources of at least $100,000, which will allow the REP to incur in Texas up to $250,000 in total monthly billings from TDUs."

Staff says we can meet this requirement by posting the $$ to an account of our choice.  We just need to notify them where the money is and state the money is for the purpose of this rule.  

Wade, could you please provide this information when available to 
Martha Hinkle

Thanks.
