I can follow up on this one.  I know Mark Valvanis.  I don't think that will translate into avoided security, but perhaps I can get right to the issue.

Jim and Harry

Here is another utility asking for collateral.  In the past 2 weeks, Credit has been contacted for margin purposes from Socal, NIMO and now BGE.  Where do you stand on evaluating the remaining utilities requirements for collateral?

Thanks
Molly

Molly,

What are we doing with the collateral requests for incremental business?

Rolf, the following excerpt was sent to me from BGE - who should it be forwarded to? 

Mark Valavanis (my workleader) asked me to notify the enrollment
person from Enron that no future enrollments (DRS and daily metered) can be
processed until additional collateral requirements are met.  Any questions
concerning this issue should be addressed to Tony Evering of our credit
department @ 410-209-1613.  From what I understand, a letter was mailed to
Enron concerning this.

You can still issue terminations, just not enrollments.
