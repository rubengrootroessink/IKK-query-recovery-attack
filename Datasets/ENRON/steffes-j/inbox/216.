Wade --
 
The PUC needs more than just the account number.  They want some formal verification that the $100k sits in an account for EES.  What form of "proof" do you guys have?

WE MUST SEND THIS NO LATER THAN DEC 31 (today if possible).  Is there some wire confirmation notice?

Please call me on my cell phone at 713-851-2499.
 
Thanks.

Tim, you indicated you guys could get this set up/identified for us.  Can you provide back to all the details of where the $100K sits.

Wade

Please give Steffes the account number that holds the $100k for our TX REP license.  He has a fax number to send it to the PSC.
