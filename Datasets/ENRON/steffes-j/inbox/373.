There has been significant recent activity at the CPUC, specifically an effort by one of the commissioners to obtain copies of every DA contract in CA.  The commissioner has sent this order both to ESP's and customer's alike.  Jim Steffes and I are working to pull together a defensive strategy for both us and our customer's.  What I need from each of you by COB Monday 11/26 is a comprehensive list of your CA customer's that are EES DA customer's in CA.  I will also need to know which of your customer's is Enron obligated to add additional customer facilities.  

Jim hopes to have something in draft form for our review by COB Tuesday.  I have included a copy of the decision for your review.  Any and all suggestions, thoughts (keep it clean), or ideas are welcomed. 

Regards,

Lamar


Diann - Can we get together on Monday to discuss CPUC fillings we have made to date.  Specifically fillings/disclosures inwhich we identified our CA customer's.
