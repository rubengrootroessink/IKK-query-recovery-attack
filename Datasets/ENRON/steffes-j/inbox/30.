Sorry I missed you last night.  I was running about half an hour late, then
arrived only to circle around for another 30 minutes looking for parking.
Unfortunately, I had accidentally left your phone number on a slip of paper
at work.

In any event, sorry again to miss your visit.  Hope to see you the next time
you swing through town,

Randy
