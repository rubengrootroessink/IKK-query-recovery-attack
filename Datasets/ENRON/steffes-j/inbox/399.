Rick, I had Legal (Steve Hall) look over the document and he was ok with it=
 and thought it was quite a good deal.  I will try to get it finalized this=
 afternoon.  The other significant CA items are Seabron Adamson's estimates=
; the first one was $25k and the second totals $167k (through issue 1).  Sh=
ould I try to pin him down and cap the second estimate?  We have pending in=
voices from him for $25k (relating to the first estimate) and $82k and $5k =
relating to the second.  Ray =20
