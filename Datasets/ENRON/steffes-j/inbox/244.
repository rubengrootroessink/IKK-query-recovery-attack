Yes we need to amend the timeline to comply with the rules. The 50kw thresh=
old is for the ERCOT market.

So the short answer is that EES needs to change its procedures?  Also, is t=
he 50kw right for all markets?

Jim,

Review of the past due process flow chart shows substantial compliance with=
 the rules, except that the final notice (termination notice) in the 2nd ch=
art must specify a termination date that is not less than 10 days from date=
 notice was issued. Thus the next action cannot commence earlier than the 2=
3rd day per this time line. However, under the rules EES can issue the term=
ination notice any time after the 2nd day following the past due date, ie o=
n or at any time after the 5 days set in the first chart. Please note that =
for larger than >50KW customers, EES can by agreement with the customer, fu=
rther shorten the timeline in the rules.

To facilitate full compliance with the rules regarding valid reasons for te=
rmination, issuance of termination notice, and contents of the notice, I ha=
ve provided short attachements of rule requirements.

Attached is the past due process as approved by The Office of the Chair. We=

e will be rolling out a separate process for dispute resolution and for the=
 termination procedures by Service Management. If you have any questions or=
