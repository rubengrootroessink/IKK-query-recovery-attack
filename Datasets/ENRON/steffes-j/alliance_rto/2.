At yesterday's FERC-faciliated meeting, stakeholders were successful in voicing concerns regarding constitution of an Advisory Board that would report to a non-independent entity, i.e. Bridgeco.  As a result, Alliance floated a proposal to constitute an interim independent board which stakeholders responded to, demanding signficant changes including an expanded scope of authority for that board.  Details of the discussions are included in the attached Word document.  

On the matter of affilate representation on the Advisory Committee, Alliance agreed that the corporate entity must decide which segment it wishes to be represented in, and that the corporate entity could be represented via its affiliates in only one sector.  

As the discussions were lengthy and mult-focused, I have captured most of the salient points in the attached document.  A meeting is scheduled for August 21st at 10am in Cincinnati, at which time the Alliance will present its interim independent board proposal incorporating to the extent it can stakeholders' concerns.  Where those concerns (identified in the attachment) cannot be incorporated, the Alliance promises to explain the reasons why.  Alliance hopes to circulate its revised proposal by close of business on the 20th, but if not will bring a written revised proposal to the meeting in Cincinnati.  I will attend the meeting if you wish.

The self-designation process initiated on the Alliance website to begin to constitute the Advisory Committee is being suspended, in view of the discussions yesterday.  The FERC facilitators are putting language to that effect together which Alliance intends to post on its website.
