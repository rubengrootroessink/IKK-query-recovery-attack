Attached is the Weekly Power Deal Ticket report.  Please note a couple of changes:
A column was added to indicate if the deal was an ENFORM or ENLITE transaction
Short positions are represented by negative numbers and long positions are represented by positive numbers

We have two unwind transactions in the report for deals that did not meet the credit requirements.

 

Also, please find the Weekly Gas Report which summarizes information from the RGS Daily Deal Summary reports.
