Dear Jim,=20
=20
Sometime within the past week you may have received a catalogue that  descr=
ibes Xenergy's Multi-Client Research offerings for 2001. In case it  did no=
t reach you, I have attached a pdf version for your convenience. The  catal=
ogue gives an overview of the various core and companion studies that  Xene=
rgy is currently working on. The REM 2001 program is described on page  2. =
I have attached a REM 2001 powerpoint presentation to better  explain our w=
ork.  The slides go into more depth about the current status  of retail ene=
rgy markets (slides 1-22), and then where things stand with  the research t=
hat is underway.  Do let me know if you'd like more  information about the =
REM 2001 study and I will be happy to arrange a conference  call with Taff =
Tschamler, one of the key people involved with this  project.  The final me=
eting for sponsors will be held Feb 25 -27, 2002 at  the Four Seasons Hotel=
 in Austin Texas.  Aside from hearing about the final  study results, this =
meeting is an excellent opportunity to meet informally  with all of our Ret=
ail Energy Market sponsors.=20

I will check back with you in a week or so to see if you have  questions. =

Thanks very much for your time.
