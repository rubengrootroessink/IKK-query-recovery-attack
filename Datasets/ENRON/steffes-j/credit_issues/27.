Hi Becky, as we discussed today a short time ago on the phone, attached are
the letters requesting the financial statements and other credit references
as allowed for under the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy for Enron Energy
Services and Enron Energy Marketing.  Please call me with any questions you
may have regarding this request.

Thanks Cheryl
