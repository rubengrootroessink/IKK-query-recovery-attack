Jim - I am in the process of reviewing many of EES' utility agreements for the northeast.  The Application to Supply Gas under Schedule DSG with BGE signed 6/5/95 requires EES to notify BGE of any deterioration in its creditworthiness or any assignment made for the benefit of creditors within the month such deterioration or assignment occurs.

I will let you know if I find anything else of note.  Give me a call if you have any questions.

Will
