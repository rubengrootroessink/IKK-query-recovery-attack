I have confirmed with Mark Valvanis that BGE, for the time being, will not insist on an increase in collateral from $250k to $500k, as they were requesting.  The caveat is that we can not add additional customers.  Of course, if we anticipate any stop in flow of gas, they would like to know ASAP.  

I don't think any further action is needed for BGE as long as we flow gas.
