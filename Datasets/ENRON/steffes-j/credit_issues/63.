Joseph,
I have checked our system on these accounts.

TXU did a manual cancel on 3538593, however on account 6171483 it switched
on 11/6.  We will do a manual drop to polr, however, I just want to give
you a heads up that you will be receiving an invoice on this account as it
was switched prior to the cancel request date.

Thanks
Di
