Slightly more complex than usual, but here are the credit/financial guarant=
ees requirements in Illinois for single billing service, and for providing =
nonresidential customers with 1 MW or more.  I also included the requiremen=
ts for billing, collection, and remittances for IFC charges.  Please advise=
 if you want the conditions for greater than 15 MWh customers, all retail c=
ustomers excluding residential. =20

It is noteworthy that there is an obligation that within 15 days of downgra=
de of the agent, creditors, affiliates, or guarantors to a rating below A-1=
 or A-, if issued from S&P or, P-1 or A3, if issued from Moody's, D-2 or A-=
, if issued from Duff & Phelps, or F-1 or A-, if issued from Fitch IBCA . W=
ithin 30 days after a downgrade the agent shall submit a report that identi=
fies the subsection under which it is seeking to demonstrate that its finan=
cial resources remain sufficient for providing the services for which it ha=
s received a certificate of service authority and includes the information =
and documents that subsection requires.  See Illinois Administrative Code, =
Art. 451.740. =20


Please let me know if you have any question.
