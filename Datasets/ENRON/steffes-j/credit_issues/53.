I do not see any reason to pursue a license to do business anywhere at this time.  I also do not think we need to suspend anything, we should withdraw, unless the suspension is free and carries no risks.

Subject: VA gas licenses


The Virginia Corp. Commission is about to reject EES's application for a retail gas license and revoke EEMC's license.  My recommendation is that we should withdraw (without prejudice) EES's pending application and agree to suspend EEMC's license, which could be reinstated when/if we meet credit requirements.  The filing will be made by Wed. COB unless anyone disagrees.  Please call w/ questions.
