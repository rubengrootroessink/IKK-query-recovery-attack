Jim:

Sorry we have played phone-tag.

The couple issues I wanted to talk with you about are 1) the reference in
your Dec 4 letter regarding re-enrolling customers for switching to Enron,
and 2) the listing of Massachusetts Electric as a creditor in Enron's
bankruptcy filing.

The pending switches of the 1013 customer accounts were canceled based upon
our conversation last week.  This does not put them on 'hold' for a later
switch, since that is not feasible or appropriate.  The customers simply
remain on their former rate (Default Service or Standard Offer) until they
choose otherwise.  When/If Enron wishes to re-initiate a switch for the
customers, you would need to send through the appropriate EDI switch
transaction as usual.  If the customer has not yet chosen another supplier,
the switch would be processed.  We assume you'd take care of any contract
updating that needed to be addressed with the customers, as that is a matter
between you and them.  Hope that clarifies.  Please let me know if
questions.

Have you been able to identify someone in the financial area that could
answer some questions on the calculations of the amounts listed under the
creditor section of the bankruptcy filing?  We'd like to speak with someone
ASAP.  Thanks.

- Maureen
