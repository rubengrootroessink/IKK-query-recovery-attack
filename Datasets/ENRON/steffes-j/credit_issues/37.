See Dave's message below.  You guys have to give me every bit of information that give us as much texture as to the criticalness of any payment coming out of your area.  We are having to clear EVERY payment through a central ENE clearing led by George Wasaff.  We have to describe in as much detail as possible why any payment made preserves value to the company.

Thanks for all your help and sorry this is so detailed.

Wade

Wade, you need to give George and Ray more texture ie) we lose $30M in value - in active sale mode that looks promising and we buy Enron ten days with New York ISO.

Been approved by Rogers Herndon (Risk) and Dave Delainey

Below in blue are the amounts related to each transfer. We also have a $680,000 payment to the NY ISO that has to go tonight as well if we don't we can't deliver to our NY customers, they return to utility service and we lose $30MM of value.  That wire request is on its.
