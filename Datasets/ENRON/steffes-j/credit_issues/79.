John - this note is to confirm our earlier discussion today.  Given that pending switches to Enron retail service must be processed or withdrawn, Enron requests that you withdraw any such pending requests for switch to Enron retail service.  I understand these customers will be tracked and the information made available to CSC or will be sent directly back to Enron.

Please do not hesitate to call me at 713 853-5786 with any additional questions.

Harry Kingerski
Sr. Director
Enron Corp.
