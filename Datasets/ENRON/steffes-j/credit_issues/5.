Jim, I have pulled the tariff language on credit for the pipelines in this report.  (If you want to see it, I'll leave it in my chair.  I'm off to the doctor for the rest of the day.)   Monica says they are putting together information on markets affected, etc. but that won't be ready til later.

Also, Superty's group is pulling together information for ENA.  I've only traded voice mails with him and Jeff Gossett, but I asked Bob to let me have a copy of it.  Don't know when it will be done.

I'll check my voice mail later, and my e-mail when I get home.  If you have any questions, you can contact me thusly.

Thanks,
