I spoke to Texas PUC staff and the have informed us that we should contact Martha Hinkle (contact details below) and she will work with Enron on exactly how things needs to be handled and filed.  We also need to address this for both Enron Energy Services and Enron Power Marketing Inc, because they are both registered REPs.  They would also like to know how many customers we have signed up for January delivery, what customer classes they are in and they would like this information by service territory.    Please let me know if there is anything I can do or if you have any questions.  You can reach me by pager tomorrow and I will be in my office on Friday.  Thanks.

Nancy,
To memorialize our phone conversation, you indicated that you will have a
better idea of a contact person for PUC staff following your 4 pm conference
call.  You expect to have contact info for both Enron Energy Services and
Enron Power Marketing.  Those people should followup with Martha Hinkle,
Director of Financial Review here at the Commission.  Her phone number is
512-936-7425 or e-mail to martha.hinkle@puc.state.tx.us.

Thanks.
