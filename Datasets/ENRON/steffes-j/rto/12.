Mirant has nine gens/mkters signed on to doing a MW cost-benefit study.  They have estimated a total cost of the study to be $75,000 - 100,000 and will use the same consulting firm, EEA, that was used for the NE study. Each of the companies would pay maximum $7500-10,000. 

Mirant made its presentation last week at FERC and I attended.  Overall, I thought the study would be useful to FERC in supporting their decision for one NE (and also one MW) study.  The presentation at FERC was headed up by a regulatory person at Mirant rather than the consultant and of course there were some skeptics in the public forum.  Some of the questions raised may have been better answered by the consultants or by someone with more NE trading experience.  However, upon review of the EEA affidavit for the "One RTO Coalition", I think this study would be a benefit to FERC on the MW decisions to be made.

If you agree that supporting this proposed study is a good idea, let me know and I will submit an RCR and follow up with Mirant.

sponsoring the study. 


As I had mentioned to the Coalition last week,  Mirant is proceeding with
preparing a study evaluating the RTO and Market inefficiencies in the
Midwest. This study is a followon to the study that was sponsored by Mirant
for the Northeast.


I have received indications from the following Companies that they have an
interest in sponsoring the study with Mirant.   

Mirant;   AES; Constellation;  DENA; Edison Mission; Calpine; Reliant; NRG
Energy, PSEG; NEG/PGE; 


For those companies that I have not listed,  please let me know if your
company has an interest in the study sponsorship.   We are now attempting to
schedule a meeting in Washington next week to review proposed scope,
sponsorship, utilization and other issues related to the study.
