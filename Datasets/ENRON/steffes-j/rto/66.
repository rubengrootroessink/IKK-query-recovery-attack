As per your request, I examined the attached doc (Response of National Grid=
 US to Questions posed by the comission)

My initial reaction is:

1) The simple answer to your question is: yes, I think the proposed governa=
nce and organization structure can live with an LMP model. I am not familia=
r with other MISO CM model, but at least in terms of LMP, my feeling is tha=
t those are not mutually exclusive. It may be worth asking Ashley Brown

2) National Grid and other proponents of For-Profit-Transcos may have other=
 ideas on how to manage congestions (e.g. different reliability level produ=
cts by customer segment). However, the attached paper makes no allusion to =
avoid LMP and to introduce other congestion management models. The paper do=
es not imply a physical model either. Your feeling may be right, but it doe=
s not surface from the paper per se.

3) National Grid proposal is, in fact, an expanded version of the Southeast=
 Model proposed at the Mediation. It reinforces the role of the Transco Com=
pany, preempting, to some extent, the role of the System Admininstrator. Th=
is was a very controversial topic in the mediation: the System Adminstrator=
 was in charge of some functions to avoid potential bias.  (particularly fr=
om transmission companies who are not willing/able to transfer their T asse=
ts)

4) National Grid will face a lot of resistance when selling this idea; Your=
 concerns on generation redispatch and long term transmission planning are =
"surfaced" in the paper, by creating a concept of "core vs. additional" fun=
ctions and a chinese wall, if necessary.  But the perception of potential b=
ias does exist. National Grid will probably face a lot of difficulty in " s=
elling"  this idea. Particularly when we get to the details

FYI.  If we were to ask NG, could they live with the MISO CM/market model??

Thanks.

NG proposal for "splitting" work between Transco and other parties.  Don't =
think they do a great job of managing the key fears - (1) generation redisp=
atch and (2) long-term transmission plant over generation investments. =20

As I read this document, I get the strange feeling that NG is a physical-ri=
ght player.  Meaning, NG needs to build a model based on physical flows so =
they can control (a) TTC/ATC and (b) use of non-firm transmission. =20

While the NG letter states that the "functions related to energy markets ca=
n be performed by a disinterested third-party", NG specifically reserves as=
 a Core Function the "Ability to propose congestion pricing methodology".  =
Sure APX could go in and operate the balancing and CM system, but NG has th=
e right to design subject to FERC procedures.

Not sure what you guys think? =20

I will probably get back to Ashley Brown later this week.
