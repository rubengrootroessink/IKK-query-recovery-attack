Hi,
I have drawn up a diagram for the architecture of the index/search
system I am building. It will use JMS Queues to provide SEDA like
capability.
Basically, a document change notification comes into the system, this is
serviced by an indexing node that builds a new index based on it, which
is sent onto a topic that the search nodes are subscribed to. Any
deletes are also published onto this topic. The searchnode takes it's
search functionality offline, updates it's index and then brings it's
search functionality online. 
I have not implemented this yet, so any comments on this design would be
appreciated.

Kind regards
Peter Gelderbloem

Martijn,

Sorry for the late reply.
I've been on holiday.
I had other more pressing things come up.
The problem I was trying to solve was clustering the indexing and
search.
I am thinking of breaking my application into indexing and search nodes
and keep them coordinated in some fashion. It would be nice to do this
coordination with established rdbms functionality as strategy, but I
could also use JMS. I will keep you updated when I get to that point. It
is still simmering in my mind at the moment.

Regards
Peter

Peter,

Have you had any success yet on this particular approach?
