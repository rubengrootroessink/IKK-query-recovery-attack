SUBJECT: How do I implement "find documents like document x."
DATE: 19 Sep 2005


Hi
I was wondering how would you search for documents similar to a
specified document using Lucene? 
The context would be that I categorise document A manually, and then
search for documents with similar terms. Hopefully the documents
returned would be in the same category/theme as document A.
The system would eventually build up a set of documents for each
category to match against.
