Martijn,

Sorry for the late reply.
I've been on holiday.
I had other more pressing things come up.
The problem I was trying to solve was clustering the indexing and
search.
I am thinking of breaking my application into indexing and search nodes
and keep them coordinated in some fashion. It would be nice to do this
coordination with established rdbms functionality as strategy, but I
could also use JMS. I will keep you updated when I get to that point. It
is still simmering in my mind at the moment.

Regards
Peter
