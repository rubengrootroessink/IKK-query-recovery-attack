DATE: 30 Aug 2005

Hi,
First off, I would just like to thank everyone who has contributed to
the gem we all know was Lucene.

I am thinking of using Lucene purely for text indexing and using a
persistence mechanism like hibernate to search structured data. Would it
be a good idea to use filters that do hibernate queries as criteria with
Lucene queries?

Thanks,
Peter Gelderbloem
