SUBJECT: Lucene and J2EE transactions
DATE: 21 Apr 2005

Hi,
I am looking to get Lucene to participate in a JTA transaction.
What would be the best way to do this?
I am thinking maybe use a message queue that feeds an indexing
thread/message driven bean with add update and delete information.
Or maybe using a subclass of Directory that uses a relational database.
Regards
Peter
