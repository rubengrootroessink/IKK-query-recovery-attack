Hi,
I foresee that I may run into similar problems as I am opening and
closing IndexSearchers all over the place. 
Unfortunately I do not see a way to keep the IndexSearcher open as
indexing occurs at random times in my system and the searches need to be
current.
Any suggestions on how to reuse the IndexSearcher in this situation?

Lucene will try to allocate an array of 6721726/128 ~= 50k terms.  The 
array alone will require a 200kB "slab" and the terms perhaps 1MB or 
more.  But not 500MB.  So I think something else is the culprit here.

Have you tried inserting print statements at the suspected allocations, 
to see how big the arrays actually are?  Are you perhaps creating a new 
IndexSearcher per search, rather than reusing a single IndexSearcher? 
1MB per query could quickly exhaust RAM if the GC can't keep up.
