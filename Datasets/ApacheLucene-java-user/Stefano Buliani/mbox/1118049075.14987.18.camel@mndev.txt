SUBJECT: searches and updates concurrency problem
DATE: 6 Jun 2005

Hi everyone,
I'm a newbie of Lucene, just installed it.
My problem is that the index update procedure and the searches could run
simultaneously, and, if they do, they corrupt the index file.
Is there a way to let Lucene handle this concurrency automatically (like
stop the searches till the update is finished)?
Thanks,
	Stefano
