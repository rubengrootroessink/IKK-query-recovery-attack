Erik,

They both use the StandardAnalyzer... however looking at the toString() makes
everything clearer.  In the case a string has the following email address:
first.last@domain.com, it gets split like so: first.last domain.com

However in 1.4 it does not get split.

So now we just check to see if an index was built using 1.2 or 1.4 and have
some checks thrown in.

Thanks for the guidance.

Roy.
