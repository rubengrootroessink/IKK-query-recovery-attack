Well we have some MASSIVE indexes so updating needs to be planned out.  In the
meantime we continue with 1.2.  So, just for curiousity's sake... any clue on
the filter?  Or perhaps someone could clue me in on what kind of terms the
query parser creates ( and what the searcher class does with them ) when it
has something like "(From:(blah OR blah2) OR To:(blah OR blah2))".  Tried to
look at the QueryParser.jj file but javacc makes my head hurt...

Roy.
