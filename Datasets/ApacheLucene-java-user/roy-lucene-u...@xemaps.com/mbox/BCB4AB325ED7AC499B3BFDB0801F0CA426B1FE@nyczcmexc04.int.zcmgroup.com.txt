Ah, for some reason i thought none of the Lucene methods were thread safe,
or is this only in the case of reading and writing at the same time?  I
thought I read this in the FAQ.

IndexWriter.addDocument(Document) is thread safe, so you don't need a 
separate indexing thread.  So long as your analyzer is thread safe, you 
can index each messages in the thread that parses it, for even greater 
parallelism.
