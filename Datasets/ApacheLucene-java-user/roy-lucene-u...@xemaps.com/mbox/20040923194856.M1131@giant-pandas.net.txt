While we're on the subject...

When using the HTMLParser I tend to get a lot of token manager errors that
basically kill the thread (usually unexpected EOF).  Even if we were to remove
the multi-threading of the HTMLParser, these token manager errors would pretty
much kill the calling app (Error vs Exception).  Any idea how to get around this?

Perhaps this question really belongs on the javacc list?
