SUBJECT: compiling 1.4 source
DATE: 23 Sep 2004

Hi guys,

So we started upgrading to 1.4 and we need to add some of our own custom code.
 After compiling with ant, I noticed that the 1.4 ant script builds a jar
called lucene-1.5-rc1-dev.jar, not lucene-1.4-final.jar.  I'm pretty sure I
did not download the wrong source.  Is this just a wrong name in the
properties or does the source code actually contain lucene 1.5 rc1 code?

Roy.
