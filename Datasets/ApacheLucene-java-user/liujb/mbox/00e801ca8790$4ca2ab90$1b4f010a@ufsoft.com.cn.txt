oh,my god,

Query Parser Syntax 

CANNOT use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.

that's mean I can't wrinte a search string like '*test'. this will be cause a great restriction
to use lucence.
but ,that's a really a important search scene.

can you give me some advice on this problem.

tks.
