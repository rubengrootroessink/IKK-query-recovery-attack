SUBJECT: Term Limit?
DATE: 4 Apr 2009

http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/fileformats.html

The file format page at the bottom cites that there is a 32 bit limit to
term numbers.  I fail to see where in the file formats documentation that is
actually true.  Is the bottom of the page simply out of date?  I'm also
wondering whether the code may be a limiting factor even if the file formats
are ok.

Thanks.
