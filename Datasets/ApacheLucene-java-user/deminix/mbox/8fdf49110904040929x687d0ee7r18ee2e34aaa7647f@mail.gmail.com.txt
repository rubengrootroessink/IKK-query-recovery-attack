Ah yes.  I'd be happy with the ability to monitor it for now.  Assuming it
is too involved to remove the limitation.

For all practical purposes we should only be using, worst case, 10% of the
term space today.  That happens to make it risky enough that it needs an eye
kept on it, as this will be our authoritative store and the data isn't
within our control.

I'll see what I can do about trying to break it during perf testing ;)
