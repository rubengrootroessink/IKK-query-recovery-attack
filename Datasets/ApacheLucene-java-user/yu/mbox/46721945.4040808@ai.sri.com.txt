SUBJECT: efficient way to filter out unwanted results
DATE: 15 Jun 2007

Hi everyone,

I am trying to remove several docs from search results each time I do 
query. The docs can be identified by an exteranl ids whcih are 
saved/indexed. I could use a Query or QueryFilter  to achieve this but 
not sure if it's the most efficient way to do that.
Anyone has any experience or idea?
Thanks!

Jay
