SUBJECT: Re: update field boost
DATE: 12 Feb 2008

thanks, Hoss!
I read the doc for the api indexreader.setNorm() after I posted the 
question earlier. To use that setNorm() to modify the field boost, it 
seems to me that one has to know how the boost is folded to the norm (in 
the default impl, it's boost* lengthNorm) and has to know the old norm 
value which is impossible to get without getting all the norms for all 
the docs. Am I missing other apis to use?
