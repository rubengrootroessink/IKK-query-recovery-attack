SUBJECT: boosting indexing  terms
DATE: 27 Jun 2007

I like Lucene's ability to boost each query term during query time.. 
However, for indexing, the smallest unit you can boost is a field.
I wonder if anyone here has good idea or suggestion on how one might 
boost terms without putting them in separate fields?

Thanks.

Jay
