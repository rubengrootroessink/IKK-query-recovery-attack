SUBJECT: is there a Query for this?
DATE: 18 Jan 2007

Just wondering if there was a query for this:

 

Let's say I want to query: "white hard hat".  Is there a query that will
build something like this:

 

(+field:white +field:hard field:hat) (+field:white field:hard
+field:hat) (field:white +field:hard +field:hat)

 

In other words... the query needs to contain most of the words, but not
all.
