SUBJECT: using MultiFieldQueryParser and WildcardQuery?
DATE: 18 May 2006


I've read through the book and was unable to find a solution to this
problem. Currently, my query looks like this:

(+description_short:white +description_short:hard
+description_short:hat) (+description_long:white +description_long:hard
+description_long:hat)

using a MultiFieldQueryParser and setting the default operator to AND.

Code:
String[] fields = {"description_short", "description_long"};
MultiFieldQueryParser queryParser = new MultiFieldQueryParser(fields,
new StandardAnalyzer());
queryParser.setDefaultOperator(QueryParser.AND_OPERATOR);
Query query2 = queryParser.parse(line);


Is there a way to do create a query that does this:

(+description_short:white* +description_short:hard*
+description_short:hat*) (+description_long:white*
+description_long:hard* +description_long:hat*)
