SUBJECT: fuzzyquery question
DATE: 1 Jun 2006

I have a question regarding the results I get back from a fuzzyquery.
If I were to do a fuzzy search on:
 
Classic series
 
Should it come back with a result like:
 
Standard Series Non Vented Hat - Class E&G
 
If I do a search on:
 
Clssic Series
 
it will return the same results I get from a non-fuzzy search.
 
------
 
This is the code:
 
String[] searchTerms = however I parse the search string
 
BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
            
            for (int i=0; i<searchTerms.length; i++)
            {
                Query temp = new FuzzyQuery(new Term("CONTENTS",
stringField[i]));
                // add search words into query
                query.add(temp, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
            }
Hits hits = is.search(query);
