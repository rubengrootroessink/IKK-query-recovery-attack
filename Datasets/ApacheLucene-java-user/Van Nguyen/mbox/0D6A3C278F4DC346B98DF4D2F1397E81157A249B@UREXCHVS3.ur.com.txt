SUBJECT: StandardAnalyzer question
DATE: 29 Sep 2006

I have a field in my index that is being tokenized using the
StandardAnalyzer.  Let's say that field was:

 

TOOLS FOR TRAILER

 

The word "FOR" is a stop word so it is not being indexed (based on the
StandardAnaylzyer).  When someone types in TOOLS FOR TRAILER in, I have
a BooleanQuery search for:

 

+CONTENTS:tools +CONTENTS:for +CONTENTS:trailer

 

Which will result in no match because of the "AND" search on
"+CONTENTS:for".  

 

Do I have to have any logic to stripe the BooleanQuery of any stop words
used in the StandardAnalyzer?
