SUBJECT: Question about applications using different versions of Lucene
DATE: 13 Feb 2007

I have two applications that share some of the same Lucene Indexes.  I
recently upgrade the Lucene-core.jar from v2.0 to a nightly build (Feb.
04, 2006 - I was looking for the IndexWriter class that allows you to
merge indexes w/o optimizing).

 

Now I notice the index is a little different:

 

Prior to upgrading:

          _0.cfs

          deletable

          segments

 

After upgrading:

          _g.cfs

          segments.gen

          segments_17

 

Didn't think much of it until I started my test server and things
stopped working.  I started debugging, and it seems like the
Lucene-core.jar (the version that was not built on Feb. 04, 2006) looks
at the new index and thinks that it does not exist... so it tries to
create a new index.  It is successful at deleting the .cfs file, but not
the .gen and segments_17 (I'm assuming it doesn't recognize those types
of file).  

 

Has anyone else run into this problem?
