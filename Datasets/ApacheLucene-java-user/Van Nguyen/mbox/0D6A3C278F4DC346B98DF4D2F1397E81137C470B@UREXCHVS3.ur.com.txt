SUBJECT: Question regarding URL encoding
DATE: 17 Jul 2006

I'm trying to search my index using this search phrase:  1"

 

That returns zero search results and throws a ParseException: Lexical error at line...  I
can see that 1" is part of that particular document by searching that same document using
a different search term.

 

How should the Lucene index store characters like that - and characters with accents (foreign
language: á, í, ç, etc)?  Should it be encoded in UTF-8 before and stored that way:

 

François or Fran%c3%a7ois

1" or 1%22
