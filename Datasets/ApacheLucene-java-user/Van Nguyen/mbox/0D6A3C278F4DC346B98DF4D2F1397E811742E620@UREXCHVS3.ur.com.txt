SUBJECT: any ides on this type of analyzer?
DATE: 1 Dec 2006

I've been trying to brainstorm on this but could not figure out a way to
go about this.

 

Let's say I'm searching for "batman".  I want results that include:

 

batman

bat man

bat-man

etc.

 

or if I search screwdriver, I would want results to include:

 

screwdriver

screw drivers

etc.

 

I've tried using the SnowballAnalyzer.  I've thought about creating a
"SynonymAnalyzer" as described in the Lucene In Action book (but that
would mean I would have to know all the synonyms for each word I need to
index - at this point I do not).  Any suggestions on how to go about
this?
