Hi,
    I get the error "Unknown format version: -9" when I try to create an
index from the latest lucene build (built from the recent code in the
repository - lucene_2_4:748824). I use Luke from the website. Assuming that
the luke is the most recent one, did anything change in lucene-core because
of which I might have a version mismatch ?


Thanks,
A
