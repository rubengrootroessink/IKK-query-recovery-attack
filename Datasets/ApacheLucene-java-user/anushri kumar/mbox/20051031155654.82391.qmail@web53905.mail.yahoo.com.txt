SUBJECT: Indexing
DATE: 31 Oct 2005

Hi,
 
I've 4 fields in a document ie. id, URL, modified date, contents. id is unique for each document.
I wanted to know if I index a document with the same id again , will the previous document
(in the index) be overwritten or do I have to delete the index for that document first and
then re index the modified one. 
 
Thanks,
Anu
