SUBJECT: update a specific document
DATE: 18 Jun 2009

Hi,
I want to update a specific document,
but i didn't found updateDocument(Query)
or updateDocument(Term[]), so to make
a update, i will need to have a term with an
unique id, so a retrieve a u)nique document,
There's any way of access the internal document
id?
For example, imagine that i have the id of document
to update, and i want to update(Term,Document) but passing
the internal id as Term.

cheers,
João
