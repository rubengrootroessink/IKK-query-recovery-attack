Hello

As the developer responsible for the search engine in our products, I can 
give you some examples of the sites that use Lucene (there are more, but I 
can't remember all of them right now) that were created by the company I work 
for:

www.bzwbk.pl
www.rabobank.pl
www.ing.pl
www.pfm.pl

It's a version modified to accomodate specific polish characters, that would 
otherwise produce errors (I described the issue in a bug report some time 
ago).
