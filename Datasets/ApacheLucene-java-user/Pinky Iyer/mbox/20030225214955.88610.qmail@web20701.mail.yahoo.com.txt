SUBJECT: xpdf  parser usage for lucene
DATE: 25 Feb 2003


Hi !
   I am trying to use xpdf for pdf parser, the problem i encounter is when i encounter a file
with .pdf extension, i call the pdftotext script to convert to text, which in turn uses the
file system and leaves the same file with .txt extension in same dir. How can i get this as
a stream and not use the file system at all. Also How do i access the summary and title info.
Anybody who has done this before, please help!
Thanks!
