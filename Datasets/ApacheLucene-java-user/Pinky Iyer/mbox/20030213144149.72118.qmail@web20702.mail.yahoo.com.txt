HI!
    Go to download and scroll all way down, and chose lucene1.2, the resulting page has the
actual downloads, the last one had all the demo jars and wars.
Thanks!

I have succesfully built Lucene using ant, (thank you for help!), and I am now 
trying to follow the

demo given on the page http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/demo.html.

I have set my Classpath correctly for lucene-{version}.jar., however I can't 
find the lucene-demos-{version}.jar in the Lucene directory.

When I u run the command "java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles 
{full-path-to-lucene}/src"
I just get an error, as no IndexFiles.class exists in my Lucene directory.

Please help

Thanks,

Emma
