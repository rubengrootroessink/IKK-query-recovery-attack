DATE: 5 Mar 2003


I am trying to setup the i2a websearch app, when i go to admin section and choose the index
with detail or any of the option i dont see any indexex being created under the main directory,
am I doing anything wrong?
I did change the websearch.xml to point to appropriate site (http://localhost:8080/index.jsp)
still no index is being created.
Any help???

Wow the features of i2a Web Search are just what I need!
I have just added to my servlet engine, but so far I read the readme, but could not find if
this application is GPL or LGPL, is it?

COuld anybody tell me where in the Jakarta site is this "i2a websearch
application demo". Is this the demo under "getting started" under "lucene".
If thats so i dont see that using any crawler.
It would be nice if the jakartha site itself has a search incorporated in
the site.
Thanks!

hi there !
we have almost the same configuration (site, index, paths, etc) like you.
we used for our search on the site another approach.

eg: use a small crawler to index some feeded urls,
make the lucene index, make the web search app to use that index.

for crawling:
http://cvs.cabanova.ro/viewcvs.cgi/indexer/

for webapp:
http://cvs.cabanova.ro/viewcvs.cgi/wsearch/

running online:
http://www.anet.ro/search?query=star+wars

the code of the indexer is based on i2a websearch application demo
that is listed on lucene jakarta site.

take a look, maybe you might find something usefull !
there is no .zip available for download.
but if somebody requests the .zip
we can put it online.

have fun !

Catalin

Yes I have
1.- The directory with the files to index:
C:/filesToIndex/www/

2.- A path where the index files from the search engine will be created,
lets say
C:/index/
3.- I have an internet domain whose name is: www.mysite.com
4.- A web application context that runs at http://www.mysite.com/search

Once I have set all the above things I want to be able to use the search
aplication:
http://www.mysite.com/search/search.jsp
And I dont want that the results that I get from the index (step 2) give
me results like
Your file is at
C:/filesToIndex/www/some_html/my_doc.html
The results should be:
Your file is at
http://www.mysite.com/some_html/my_doc.html
For the comments I have read (THANK YOU VERY MUTCH) I conclude that there
is no way to generate the index with some custom prefix (as
http://www.mysite.com/ for the documents at C:/filesToIndex/www/).
It seems that I have to modify my web application
(http://www.mysite.com/search/search.jsp) to include some logic to repalce
"C:/filesToIndex/www/" to "http://www.mysite.com/".
If you could point me to the source code of lucene to include this logic
and this way fix it once and for all, will appreciate a lot.
The command I used to generate this index was:
java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index index C:\index
C:\filesToIndex\ www\
Now in the web application I have to modify
IndexSearcher searcher;
Query query;
Hits hits;

// some code after...
hits = searcher.search(query);

for ( /* search through the hit list*/)

Document doc = hits.doc(i);
String doctitle = doc.get("title");
String url = doc.get("url");

I have to do some thing like url = "http://www.mysite.com/" +
url.substring("C:/filesToIndex/www/".length);

Regards!!!
And thanks again

I dont understand the explanantion. When I try and index the documents as
mentioned in the examples, and then when i run the app and do a sample
search, it does point to the directory structure say "c:/filesToIndex/www/"
instead of "http://localhost:8080/www/". So how can this be changed to
reflect the website domain as mentioned by you. Could you explain again. Say
my docs are under a directory c:/filesToIndex/www/ and the wesite is as you
said http://localhost:8080/ , then how to proceed!
Thanks in advance!

Oh ok, I thougth it was going to be some thing like the egothor search
engine (A java based search engine). When you create the Index, you issue a
command like:
java org.egothor.indexer.mirror.DoTanker /tmp/my_www
Project/Egothor/var/www as http://localhost:8080
/thmp/my_www: Is the path to the directory where the index is to be
created
Project/Egothor/var/www: is the path to the local file system files to be
indexed.
and as http://localhost:8080 is the prefix that the index will keep on the
hit list. This way the index will be relative to http://localhost:8080. Even
if your production site may be an other site.
Thanks for your comments, any way now I know that I have to modify code to
do this.
Regards!

I'm not a hundred percent sure I understand what you are asking, but when
you get the results back from Lucene (the hits) it's up to you to format
them to display on a web page - you can always do the modification there
when you display the links to the results.

by
creating the index you'll need for the web examples. Since you've already
set your classpath in the previous examples, all you need to do is type
"java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index {index-dir} ..".
You'll need to do this from a (any) subdirectory of your {tomcat}/webapps
directory (make sure you didn't leave off the ".." or you'll get a null
pointer exception). {index-dir} should be a directory that Tomcat has
permission to read and write, but is outside of a web accessible context.
By
default the webapp is configured to look in /opt/lucene/index for this
index.
