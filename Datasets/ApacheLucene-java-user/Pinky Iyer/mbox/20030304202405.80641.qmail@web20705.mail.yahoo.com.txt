I dont understand the explanantion. When I try and index the documents as mentioned in the
examples, and then when i run the app and do a sample search, it does point to the directory
structure say "c:/filesToIndex/www/" instead of "http://localhost:8080/www/". So how can this
be changed to reflect the website domain as mentioned by you. Could you explain again. Say
my docs are under a directory c:/filesToIndex/www/ and the wesite is as you said http://localhost:8080/
, then how to proceed!
Thanks in advance!

Oh ok, I thougth it was going to be some thing like the egothor search engine (A java based
search engine). When you create the Index, you issue a command like:
java org.egothor.indexer.mirror.DoTanker /tmp/my_www Project/Egothor/var/www as http://localhost:8080
/thmp/my_www: Is the path to the directory where the index is to be created
Project/Egothor/var/www: is the path to the local file system files to be indexed.
and as http://localhost:8080 is the prefix that the index will keep on the hit list. This
way the index will be relative to http://localhost:8080. Even if your production site may
be an other site.
Thanks for your comments, any way now I know that I have to modify code to do this.
Regards!

I'm not a hundred percent sure I understand what you are asking, but when
you get the results back from Lucene (the hits) it's up to you to format
them to display on a web page - you can always do the modification there
when you display the links to the results.

creating the index you'll need for the web examples. Since you've already
set your classpath in the previous examples, all you need to do is type
"java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index {index-dir} ..".
You'll need to do this from a (any) subdirectory of your {tomcat}/webapps
directory (make sure you didn't leave off the ".." or you'll get a null
pointer exception). {index-dir} should be a directory that Tomcat has
permission to read and write, but is outside of a web accessible context. By
default the webapp is configured to look in /opt/lucene/index for this
index.
