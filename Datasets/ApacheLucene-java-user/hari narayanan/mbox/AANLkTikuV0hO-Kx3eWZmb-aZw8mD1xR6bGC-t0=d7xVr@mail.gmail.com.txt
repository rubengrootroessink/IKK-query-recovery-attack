SUBJECT: Using Lucene with an existing dataset
DATE: 27 Mar 2011

Hello,

I am completely new to Lucene... I would like to implement a searching
algorithm called GBRank and test it using Lucene on an existing dataset ...
Is it possible ? I dont know how to go about this. Can anyone give me
directions on how to proceed?

Thanks,
Hari
