SUBJECT: Is the lucene index serializable?
DATE: 23 Sep 2003

Can I send a small lucene index by SOAP/TCP/HTTP/RMI? Is there a way to 
serialize a Lucene Index?
I wan to send it from the Indexer server to the Search Server, and then 
do a merge operation in the Search Server with the previous index file.

Thanks.
