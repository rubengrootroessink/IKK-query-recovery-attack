SUBJECT: Large data sets benchmark
DATE: 16 Sep 2003

Hello

 I'm planing to use Lucene in a big environment, with large data sets 
(between 50-100Gb of data). I've seen some people have experience in 
this kind of environments.
 I was wondering, if someone can provide a benchmarking with this amount 
of data.
 
Another question, is someone using Lucene in a distribute environment? 
I'm planing to use it in a distribute environment to manage such amount 
of data. I'm interested in the C++ version (CLucene) too, because I 
think the C++ version is faster (someone has real numbers (in 
performance) between the Java and the C++ version).

Thanks,
Albert.
