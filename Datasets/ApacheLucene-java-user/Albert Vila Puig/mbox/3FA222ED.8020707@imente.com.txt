SUBJECT: Remove a token from a field
DATE: 31 Oct 2003

Hi,

    Is there a way to remove a token from a document field entry?. For 
example, I've got a UnStored field in my index and I want to remove a 
token from this field without doing the delete and add document (because 
I'm inserting the documents by date and I don't want to loose that sort).

    Is there an easy way to do that? Has anybody already started 
implementing it? Any suggestions about if I can do it in an efficient 
way? Maybe with another deletable file by fields?

   Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks

Albert
