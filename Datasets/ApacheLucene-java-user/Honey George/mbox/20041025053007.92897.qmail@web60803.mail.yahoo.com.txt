Yes, you need to use some external tools to extract
the text from the PDF file and then pass it to lucene
for indexing. If you do a search of this list you will
get lot of mails related to that.

I have used a tool called xpdf (in linux) and it works
with both chinese traditional and chinese simplified.
It gives language support packages for many of the
languages. Please take a look at the URL below.

Now the tool only helps in extracting the text.
Whether you can search chinese text or not depends on
the analyzer you use in Lucene. Try CJKAnalyzer for
CJK text search.

Thanks,
  George
