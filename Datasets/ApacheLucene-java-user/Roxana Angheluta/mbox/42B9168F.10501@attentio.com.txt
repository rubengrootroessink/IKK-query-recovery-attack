Hi Erik, thanks for the answer.
I would like to index the following document:

This is a sample document.

something like:
"this"
"is"
"a"
"sample"
"document"
"this is"
"is a"
"a sample"
"this a"
"is sample"
"a document"
"sample document"
"this is a"
"is a sample"
"a sample document"

In this example the maximum length of an n-gram is 3 and the length of 
the moving window accross text is also 3.
In fact I would like a full analyzer to do the job, i.e. define a 
strategy to filter out/clean spurious n-grams: e.g. remove n-grams made 
out only/partially of stopwords, eliminate just stopwords from the n-gram.

Sebastian has kindly provided his code, which does the job.
