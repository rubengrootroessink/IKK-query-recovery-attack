SUBJECT: how to get the number of terms in an index
DATE: 3 Jun 2006

Hello,

Is it possible to quickly get the total number of terms from all
documents in an Lucene index  for a given field?
For example IndexReader has a method "int numDocs()", I would need  a
similar method "int numTerms(String field)".
It looks a bit silly to use IndexReader.terms() and count the number of
terms by iterating over the result.

Thanks,
Roxana
