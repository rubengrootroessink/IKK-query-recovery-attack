Dear all,

I am using Lucene for indexing documents.

I would like to include phrases (of a certain maximum length given as a 
parameter) in the index. I know this is non-standard for e.g. searching, 
where a PhraseQuery can be built which makes use of the terms positions. 
However, I am not interested in searching, but rather in using the 
indexing terms for some statistics.

What would be an efficient way to do this? Is it possible to build 
phrases in a filter after tokenization?

Thanks,
roxana
