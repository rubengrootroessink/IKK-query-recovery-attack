DATE: 13 Jun 2007


Hello,I tried uninstalling and installing Lucene 2.1.0 and Tomcat 5.5.  I followed the Lucene
demo instructions and set the CLASSPATH as follows:  .;C:\lucene-2.1.0\lucene-core-2.1.0.jar;C:\lucene-2.1.0\lucene-demos-2.1.0.jar
 I tehn typed java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles C:\lucene-2.1.0\src into the commandline
prompt and received the following:  Cannot save index to 'index' directory, please delete
it first.  Thank you in advance for your help.  -Lucene User
