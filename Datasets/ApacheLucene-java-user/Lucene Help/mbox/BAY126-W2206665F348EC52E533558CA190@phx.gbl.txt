SUBJECT: ERROR opening the Index - contact sysadmin!
DATE: 12 Jun 2007


Hello,I just downloaded Lucene and tried running the demo.  I seem to be okay up until I type
in a query into the "Search Criteria" page and click on the "Search" button at the URL:  http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/At
this point I am at the URL http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/results.jsp?query=test&maxresults=2
which gives me the following:  
Welcome to the Lucene Template application. (This is the header)



                ERROR opening the Index - contact sysadmin!
                Error message: no segments* file found: files:   





	Apache Lucene Template WebApp 1.0 If someone could help me out ASAP, that would be great.
 Thanks!Lucene User
