SUBJECT: Re: Type information on Tokens?
DATE: 30 Apr 2003

I've already posted a message concerning meta info and am wondering if 
there might be some interest that there be (in the future) a standard way 
of holding (or encoding in the token) meta-info. I've got to store weights 
given to specific tokens (and perhaps even change the scoring for this. I 
won't go into details here because of my previous post ).
