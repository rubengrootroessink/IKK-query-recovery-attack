My IR server extracts entities such as geographic locations and 
people names and give a weight using some sort of combination between a 
statistic and linguistic model to attribute a weight that should 
determine the importance of the term. It's been a while since my AI 
course, so I hope I'm not saying nonsence, but it probably is fuzzy.

example:
If an input is a news article, it can return for example:
"United States" type=geo location weight=98 frequency=4
"Bush"          type=person name  weight=78 fequency=2

I hope I answer your questions correctly:

a) a query could include geographical locations extracted, so a user might 
want to search for american news, so he might specify "United States" and 
articles with a high weight for U.S. should show up first.
b) I'll have to store these concepts in a (or multiple fields) so I can 
search on it. I need to find a way to represent the weight though...
c) I'll have fields with concepts. How I use it will depend on the way I 
index the docs.
d) I would like to show the concept found in the result set, so I can help 
a user refine his search. e.g. a search "manchester uniter" returns docs 
with concepts 'sports'. I would allow a user to add the concept 'sports' 
to his query.

My two points described the ways I thought I could index concept fields.
