Hi Tate (didn't know you were lurking on the list),

I've found that it's often not very clear what truly affects performance. 
Doing batch indexes with  a data set of 250,000 docs (with 10 fields each) 
on a machine with 2 Gbytes of 400 DDR RAM, I've tested a few merge factors 
to discover that it seemed optimal at 50 and even then, performance wasn't 
much better than with a MF of 20. Nowadays, there can be so many hidden 
optimisations by HDs and OSs, that it's often worth testing with each 
configuration used.
