SUBJECT: Re: Term Based Meta Data
DATE: 9 Aug 2008

Hi,

    Following the history of Payloads from its beginnings 
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-755, 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-761, 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-834, 
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/Payload_Planning) it looks like 
TermPostionsVector was never considered as part of the Payload 
functionality.  I think this is based on the underlying index file 
structure???  I don't see any way to get at a Payload other than through 
a TermPositions object.  I don't think there is a way to translate code 
which uses TermPositions to using TermPositionVector with regards to 
payloads  -- but I welcome someone to show me how they could.

    It looks like this conversation has happened at least twice before: 
http://www.nabble.com/Best-Practices-for-getting-Strings-from-a-position-range-td11608273.html#a11609245

and 
http://www.nabble.com/Best-way-to-get-payloads-td17399361.html#a17399361.  
Unfortunately it doesn't look like anything came of it.

    Maybe there is some other work around.  What are you trying to 
accomplish "historically" with TermPositionsVectors instead of 
TermPositions?
