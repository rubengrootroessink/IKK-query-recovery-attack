Hi Mike,

The first thing that comes to mind is to run a query for each document 
type (assuming that you have a field that stores the type) and qualify 
the document type: for example type:pdf.  Then you would have to write 
something to combine the query results drawing an equal number of hits 
from each query result.  I think that the score would still be able to 
provide you with an appropriate relevance score if you wanted to 
maintain relevance order across all the hits from all document types, 
but my logic could be faulty there.
