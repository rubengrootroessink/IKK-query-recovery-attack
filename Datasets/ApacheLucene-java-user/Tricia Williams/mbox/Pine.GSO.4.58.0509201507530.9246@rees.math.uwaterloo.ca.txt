SUBJECT: Storing HashMap as an UnIndexed Field
DATE: 20 Sep 2005

Hi,

   I'd like to store a HashMap for some extra data to be used when a given
document is retrieved as a Hit for a query.  To add an UnIndexed Field
to an index takes only Strings as parameters.  Does anyone have any
suggestions on how I might convert the HashMap to a String that is
efficiently recomposed into the desired HashMap on the other end?

Thanks,
Tricia
