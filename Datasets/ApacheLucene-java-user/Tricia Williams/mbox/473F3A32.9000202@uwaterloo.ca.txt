Hi Grant,

    Thanks for your response!

    Taking a closer look at the TokenFilter(s) that causes my problem 
with the Payload are all from org.apache.solr.analysis rather than 
org.apache.lucene.analysis.  I had originally thought that all the 
TokenFilters available through Solr's TokenFilterFactory(s) were part of 
Lucene.  But I guess there are TokenFilters specific to Solr, such as 
the WordDelimiterFilter, that aren't aware of Payloads.  Thanks for 
saying exactly the right thing to make me realize that.

    Erik Hatcher suggested storing the bulky XPath strings in a table of 
contents field and just storing a smaller representation of the 
information at each token with the intention of doing a lookup to get 
the bulky stuff at query time.

    Has anyone actually completed anything with XPath queries and Payloads?

    I look forward to seeing more of Payloads!  I can already see how 
they can be extremely useful.

Thanks,
