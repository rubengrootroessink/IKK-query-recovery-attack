When you create a Document by adding Field(s) 
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html) 
consider the last constructor which allows you to specify if the the field 
will have its TermVector stored or not stored.  Also, Luke has a column in 
its document view which tells you if the TermVector is stored or not 
stored by the presence or lack of precence of a + under the T column.

Cheers,
Tricia
