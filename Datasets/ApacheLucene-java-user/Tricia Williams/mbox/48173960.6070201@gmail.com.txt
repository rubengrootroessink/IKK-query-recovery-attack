SUBJECT: Re: applying patches (was [jira] Commented: (LUCENE-794) Extend contrib Highlighter to properly support PhraseQuery, SpanQuery,  ConstantScoreRangeQuery)
DATE: 29 Apr 2008

Hi Maurizio,

    I'm replying in java-user because I believe this is the appropriate 
place for a question like this.

    All the patches that I have encountered (including this one) are 
usually applied at the root.  One should download the source code from 
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/.  From the trunk 
directory all you should need to apply is the most recent patch: 
SpanHighlighter-02-10-2008.patch.  The syntax for applying patches is 
typically:
patch -p 0 -i <path to patch> [--dry-run]
where the dry-run flag allows you to see if the patch applies cleanly 
without gumming up your source.

Hope that helps,
Tricia

>> This patch adds a new Scorer class (SpanQueryScorer) to the Highlighter package that
scores just like QueryScorer, but scores a 0 for Terms that did not cause the Query hit. This
gives 'actual' hit highlighting for the range of SpanQuerys, PhraseQuery, and  ConstantScoreRangeQuery.
New Query types are easy to add. There is also a new Fragmenter that attempts to fragment
without breaking up Spans.
