I'd like to repeat Erik's question since as far as I can tell from
searching the arhives, doesn't seem to have been answered yet.

I need to do almost exactly the same thing as Erik - create a read-only
index on our "help" webapp that will be packaged inside an ear file.
I'll probably end up creating an ant task to do the actual indexing.

Has anybody packaged indexes into a jar before? Why is the API so
restrictive as to require an open filesystem?

Thanks,

Tim
