Problem with SimpleAnalyzer! It ignores digits. 

For text "customer 123 found" it will take only "customer" and "found", but
will ignore "123". StandardAnalyzer handles OK the digits but has the dots
problem, I mentioned before.

Is there an understandable guide how to write my own Analyzer - a hybrid of
StandardAnalyzer and SimpleAnalyzer?
