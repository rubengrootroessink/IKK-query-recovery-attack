SUBJECT: parsing Java log file with Lucene 3.0.3
DATE: 31 Dec 2010

Hi,

I need to parse the Java log files with Lucene 3.0.3. The StandardAnalyzer is 
OK, except it's handling of dots.

E.g. it handles "java.lang.NullPointerException" as one word and searching for 
"NullPointerException" will bring nothing.

I need an Analyzer that will work as StandardAnalyzer,but will handle dots as 
word separators (e.g. as it handles commas).

Please advice.

Thanks.
 
Regards,
Benzion.
