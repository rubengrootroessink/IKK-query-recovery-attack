SUBJECT: "GROUP BY" query
DATE: 1 Jan 2011

Lets' say I have documents with following. 

id    text
1     User not found
2     User not found
3     Address not found
4     Fatal error
5     User not found
6     Address not found
7     User not found


How can I get each text only once in search results (similar to SQL "GROUP BY"), 
i.e.

id    text
1     User not found
3     Address not found
4     Fatal error

 
Regards,
Benzion.
