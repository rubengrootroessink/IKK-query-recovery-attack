If you can define one searchable word for the whole log message and index
this word only maybe you can use DB instead.
I apply Analyzer to every and whole log message text - and then I can
quickly find all messages, that have e.g. "NullPointerException" or "user
not found" text or anything else.

In DB using select with "LIKE '%something%'" will do full table scan.
