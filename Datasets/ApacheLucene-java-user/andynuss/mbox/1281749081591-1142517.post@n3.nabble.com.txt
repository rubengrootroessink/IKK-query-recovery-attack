SUBJECT: scalability limit in terms of numbers of large documents
DATE: 14 Aug 2010


Hi,

Lets say that I am indexing large book documents broken into chapters.  A
typical book that you buy at amazon.  What would be the approximate limit to
the number of books that can be indexed slowly and searched quickly.  The
search unit would be a chapter, so assume that a book is divided into 15-50
chapters.  Any ideas?

Andy
