SUBJECT: Re: scalability limit in terms of numbers of large documents
DATE: 14 Aug 2010


Hi Erick,

My documents are roughly a 0.5 to 1 million chars divide into normal words,
and divided into 50 chapters, each chapter streamed into a docid unit.  So a
search hit is a chapter.

How do I find out more about sharding and SOLR?

Andy
