SUBJECT: index field used for boosting rank
DATE: 7 Jun 2010


Hi,

I want to add a rank field to my index with numbers 1 thru 10, and apply a
boost appropriate for each of the values.  One of the other indexed fields
is huge, about 40,000 chars.  My understanding is that if I change the new
"rank" field from 1 to 2, the huge field is reindexed.  Is there any way to
avoid this?  What do others do?

(I would use IndexWriter.updateDocument "which deletes and readds the entire
document".)

Andy
