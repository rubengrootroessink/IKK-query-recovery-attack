SUBJECT: search hits not returned until I stop and restart application
DATE: 21 Jun 2010


Hi,

I have an IndexWriter singleton in my program, and an IndexSearcher
singleton based on a readonly IndexReader singleton.  When I use the
IndexWriter to index a large document to lucene, and then, while the program
is still running, use my previously created IndexSearcher to find hits in
that book, they are not found.  But if I stop and restart the application,
then they are found.

Andy
