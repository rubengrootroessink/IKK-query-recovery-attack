do you know of any method to reduce the memory consumption of lucene 
when searching? I've just increased from 400 to --Xmx500m, since 
sometimes OutOfMemoryExceptions occured (running suns java 1.4.2_04 and 
lucene-1.4rc3 on an index with ca. 18 Mio entries, building an index 
(including stored-only-fields) of 9 GB).

I've seen that there are ways to limit the memory need for indexing and 
optimizing(?) by reducing the MergeFactor, but that doesn't seem to 
apply for searching :-(

Thanks,

Sascha
