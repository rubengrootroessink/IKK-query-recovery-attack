Mike cheers for the reply.

Is it worth setting up your own caching or letting the OS do it? I've setup 
a caching system, but if the OS is doing it it seems pointless.

No, Lucene doesn't.  But the OS usually does (in is IO cache),
assuming there is spare RAM.

The "only" things that are explicitly held in memory by Lucene are the
norms ("boost bytes"), terms dict index, deletions bit vector and
field cache (used eg when you sort by a field), I think.
