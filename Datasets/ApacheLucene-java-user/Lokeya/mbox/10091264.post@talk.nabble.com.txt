SUBJECT: Re: How to calculate centroid from HITS?
DATE: 20 Apr 2007


I figured out that there are already java API's written for this and
available. LucQE has that : 

QueryExpansion.expandQuery(java.lang.String queryStr,
org.apache.lucene.search.Hits hits, java.util.Properties prop) which returns
the expanded query (will have centroid)
