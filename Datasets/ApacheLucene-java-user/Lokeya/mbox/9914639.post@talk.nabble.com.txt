SUBJECT: Issue with search() Help Appreciated.
DATE: 10 Apr 2007


I have indexed the docs successfully under the directory "LUCENE" under
current directory, which have segments, _1.cfs and deletable.

Now trying to use the following code to search the index but not getting any
HITS. But when I try to read through Reader and get the document with field
mentioned it works which means the index done properly and its just that
search is not working. Code is as follows:

The following code gets a Hits object like :
org.apache.lucene.search.Hits@14a9972
But when i try to get hits.length() it is 0. 

Can anyone point out whats wrong ?

IndexSearcher isearcher = new IndexSearcher("./LUCENE");
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("Description", analyzer);
Query query = parser.parse("based");
Hits hits = isearcher.search(query);
for (int i = 0; i < hits.length(); i++) 
{
	Document hitDoc = hits.doc(i);
}
isearcher.close();
directory.close();
