SUBJECT: OutOfMemory Error while searching Index - Help Appreciated.
DATE: 12 Apr 2007


I have gone through the mailing list in search of posts for this error.
Though there are many, I feel my problem is little different from that and
like to get some advice on this.

Details: 
1. Using a machine with RAM 2GB
2. Created an Index of size 200 MB.
3. Trying to do a search on this for certain fields.
4. Retrieves Hits with 22 documents(each doc size is around 1KB in size).[I
have issue with the results returned and I have posted that already].
5. I use a for loop like below to retrieve the Hits documents as below which
throws a OutOfMemory Error, and how I am saying the for loop only throws
error because when i comment the following code there is no error:

for (int i = 0; i < hits.length(); i++) 
{
  Document hitDoc = hits.doc(i);
  System.out.println("Valuee Title  ---------------> "+hitDoc.get("Title"));
  System.out.println("Valuee Desc --------------->
"+hitDoc.get("Description"));
}

Thanks in advance.
