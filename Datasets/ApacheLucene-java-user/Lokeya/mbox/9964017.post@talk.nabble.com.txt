SUBJECT: Basic Question in Lucene Indexing.
DATE: 12 Apr 2007


I have one million records to index, each of which have "Tiltle",
"Desciption" and "Identifier". If take each document and try to index these
fields my program was very slow. So I took 100,000 records and get the value
of these fields, add them to the addDocument() method. Then I use the Index
writer to write this document. So by doing this looks like it creates only
one document id and have all contents in that.I repeat this writing for
700,000 records so 70 doc ids are craeted in total. Till now no
issue(atleast I assumed)

Then I tried to search the for some value, I was getting Hits whose length
would be some number say 21 and when i try to retrieve the documents
assuming all 21 documents have matches they actually dont have, so whats
happening is, it just gets the docs from same document id. Luke was helpful
in finding this issue. Later I took just around 20 records and tried to
index then separately and tried to retrieve and it worked fine. 

Now my major issue is when I try to open index 700,000 times, it will be
really very slow. I am wondering what is the ideal way to do this.

Thanks in Advance.
