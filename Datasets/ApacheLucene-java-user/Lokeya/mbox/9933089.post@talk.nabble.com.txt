SUBJECT: Issue with : Searcher.search() returning Hits of same length for different searches
DATE: 11 Apr 2007


I am following all the points which are mentioned in the following link:

http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#head-3558e5121806fb4fce80fc022d889484a9248b71

I am having the following issues:

1. For different Queries I give I get a Hits object where there are always
21 documents, but getting different set but same number everytime. Also not
all documents have the query term which I have set.

I have extended the Analyzer and using a new class
:StopStemmingAnalyzer.java. But that should not be the issue because I am
using that again for searching. Also I use  Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.TOKENIZED for indexing.

Help Appreciated.
