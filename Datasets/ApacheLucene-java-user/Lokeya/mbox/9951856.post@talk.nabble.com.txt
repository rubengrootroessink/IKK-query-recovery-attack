SUBJECT: Re: OutOfMemory Error while searching Index - Help Appreciated.
DATE: 12 Apr 2007


It  is using the default size allocated by the OS, which I don't have any
idea how much exactly. But when I use the -Xmx1024m and run this is not
occuring. Also I make some change in that loop now keeping only the Document
hitDoc = hits.doc(i); line and thats where it starts throwing error. But I
am not very sure why this should throw and error.
