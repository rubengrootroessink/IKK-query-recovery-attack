SUBJECT: Re: Issue with : Searcher.search() returning Hits of same length for different searches
DATE: 11 Apr 2007


Thanks for your reply. I should have given more information and will keep in
mind this for my future queries.
Regarding this one I have already done most of things you have asked like:

1. I am confirming what query is getting executed by using query.toString()
2. I read lot of posts in the forum particulary,
http://www.nabble.com/Search-matching-tf2030477.html#a5585431
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#head-3558e5121806fb4fce80fc022d889484a9248b71

I made sure all the above except the case that analyzer used is not the
simple one, which I will now test with some simple one. I like to point out
that my issue is unique for which I didn't see any posts in the forum :
Getting Same number of documents in the Hits when I test for a different set
of queries.
