SUBJECT: How to calculate centroid from HITS?
DATE: 3 Apr 2007


Hi All,

I have queried and have got a HITS object which is a collection of
documents. I want to find out the centroid of these documents. Centroid =
Top Most 35(for eg)common  terms across all the documents in the HITS
object. 

Is there any API in Lucene for this?

Thanks in Advance.
