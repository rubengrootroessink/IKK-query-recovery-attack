SUBJECT: Question about Field.TermVector
DATE: 18 Jul 2006

hi, i'm using lucene 2.0. 

To index a very long text i use Field.Index.TOKENIZED & Field.Store.NO. I
don't know how to get its content (actually, only need words near keywords,
like google's results: ... found this keyword here...) without querying
database?

Someone told me using term vector to perform highlighting, but i found
little information about Field.TermVector, could anyone give me a sample
code?

Thanks in advance!
