SUBJECT: breaking a single index in to two indexes
DATE: 27 Jun 2007

I am in need of some help with the following problem.  I have a single 
index that I am currently searching against, but it has the property 
that a small set of the documents get updated frequently while a large 
majority of them are very static and are rarely updated.  Documents can 
move from being a static type document to one that begins to be updated 
on a frequent basis.  I'd like to break this up into two separate 
indexes with one large one being the index of the static documents and a 
smaller one of the constantly updated documents. 

I am looking for some help on optimal update policies for each index and 
managing of migration of a document from the static index to the active 
index.  Hopefully this should allow me to make much better use of cached 
filters.

I am sure that someone else has run into a very similar problem.  I did 
some poking around, but was obviously not searching for the right 
thing.  Any suggestions or insight into dealing with this would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Les
