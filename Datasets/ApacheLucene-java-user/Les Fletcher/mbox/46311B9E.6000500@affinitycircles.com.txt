SUBJECT: filter caching
DATE: 26 Apr 2007

I have a question about filter caching.  I have a lot of QueryFilters 
that I use when searching that filter on a single field.  Sometimes 
alone I use them by themselves, but mostly I use them in some 
combination using ChainedFilter.  Does the caching take advantage of 
only the final filter that used in the query, or would a ChainedFilter 
(say 'A and B and C') make use of the cached versions of the single 
field QueryFilters A,B and C and just combine their bitsets? 

The reason I ask about this is for when I comes time to warm a new 
IndexReader.  Ideally I'd like to just run all of the single field 
QueryFilters against the index and have it cache those, and then be able 
to make use of those cached filters in my more complex filters.

This seems like a fairly basic concern, but I was unable to find 
anything addressed this concern explicitly.  (I could just have been 
searching for the wrong stuff).  Anyways, thanks.

Les
