SUBJECT: query syntax question
DATE: 10 May 2007

I have a question about empty fields.  I want to run a query that will 
search against a few particular fields for the query term but then also 
also check to see if a two other fields have any value at all.  i.e., I 
want to search for a set records but don't want to return a record if 
that record has blank first and last name fields.  Any help would be 
greatly appreciated.
