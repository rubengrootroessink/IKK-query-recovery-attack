SUBJECT: Re: filter caching
DATE: 1 May 2007

If the Chained filter works off of the cached QueryFilters, then that is 
great and I don't mind not caching the ChainedFilter and doing the work 
to combine those bit vectors (assuming that is what it is doing).  I 
want to build up a set of small QueryFilters and that can be cached and 
be combined in any order (using the ChainedFilter operations) while 
still making use of caching.  If ChainedFilter does this (or doesn't), 
it would be nice to have it mentioned in the API docs.
