I am also releatively new to lucene and was wondering about this.  The 
way it seems to work, is that if you boost a field then you have to 
actually specify that field in your query to benefit from that field 
boost.  Otherwise you'll search the default field and the boost will be 
ignored.  I hacked around this by just adding the field's text to the 
default search field n times where n is the boost for that field.  I 
seriously doubt that this the ideal way to do it, but I couldn't figure 
out how to do it other than reforming all of my queries to search all 
the fields.

If someone has a real solution to this or could shed some more light on 
the practical use of field boosts, I would appreciate it.
