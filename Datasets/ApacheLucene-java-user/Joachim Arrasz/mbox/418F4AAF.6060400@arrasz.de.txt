SUBJECT: Filters for Openoffice File Indexing available (Java)
DATE: 8 Nov 2004

Hello List.

we have written an application which includes OpenOffice Integration 
into an OpenSource CMS (OpenCms).

For this CMS there is a Lucene Integration available under sourceforge.

So now we are looking for search and index Filters for Lucene, that 
weÂŽre able to integrate out OpenOffice Files also into search result.

Is there any project or code available for doing this, or must we write 
everything by ourself? Do anybody know good beginner Tutorials for doing 
things like this?

Best Regards

Joachim Arrasz
