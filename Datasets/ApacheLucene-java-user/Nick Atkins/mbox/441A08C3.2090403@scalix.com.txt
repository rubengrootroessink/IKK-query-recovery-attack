Hi Yonik,  I'm not actually using any IndexReaders, just IndexWriters
and IndexSearchers.  I on;y get an IndexReader when I'm doing deletes
but that isn't the case in this test.  I definitely optimize() and
close() each IndexWriter when it's done writing its documents (about 200).

Anyway, I the problem occurs even when I do zero searches and deletes,
therefore I am only working with IndexWriters.

Cheers,

Nick.
