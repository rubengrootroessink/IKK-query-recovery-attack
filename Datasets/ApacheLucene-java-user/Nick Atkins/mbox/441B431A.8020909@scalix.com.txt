Guys, thanks for your help yesterday, I solved my problem!  I was
actually  using an IndexSearcher in another thread that I had forgotten
all about.  Whoever suggested that IndexReader was to blame was right on
the money.  I now make sure I close my Readers and, bingo, the open
files are managed nicely and kept within reasonable bounds (no more than
200).

Thanks,

Nick.
