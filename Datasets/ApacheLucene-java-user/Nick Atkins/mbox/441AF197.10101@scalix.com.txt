SUBJECT: Unnormalized score
DATE: 17 Mar 2006

Hi,

Apparently there is a way of retrieving the unnormalized score from a
Hit but I have been unable to track this down.  I need to return this
value because an external client wants to compile results from multiple
queries itself.

Any help much appreciated.

Cheers,

Nick.
