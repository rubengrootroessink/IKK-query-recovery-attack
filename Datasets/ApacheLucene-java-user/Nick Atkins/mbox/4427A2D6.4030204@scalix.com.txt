Luc,

I tried adding your DelayCloseIndexSearcher to my project (a Tomcat app
where the index is repeatedly searched and frequently updated) and as
soon as an index modify occurs (by a separate thread) and I call
closeWhenDone() in the main thread I get
IllegalStateException("closeWhenDone() already called").  The Exception
is thrown for every subsequent search attempt.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Nick.
