SUBJECT: Query for a non-value
DATE: 22 Mar 2006

Hi there,

How do I do a query for the value of a field not being equal to
something?  For example, we all do Query("field:value") but I want to do
Query("NOT field:value") to essentially return all the documents that do
not have fields with this value?  I've tried this but Lucene always
returns no documents when I know there are plenty of documents without
that field set to that value.

Many thanks,

Nick.
