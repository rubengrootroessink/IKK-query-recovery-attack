My next recommendation would be to manually specify the classpath by 
using the -cp or -classpath arguments, for example:

/usr/java/default/bin/java -cp /usr/java/default/lib/lucene.jar 
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles /opt/lucene/src/

By the way, you are aware that IndexFiles is not included in the 
"official" Lucene library, right? IndexFiles is a class that relies on 
Lucene, however it is distributed as a separate library as part of 
"PDFBox". Perhaps that's the problem?
