SUBJECT: Re: Clustered Indexing on common network filesystem
DATE: 2 Aug 2007

Hi,

It's been a couple of days now and I haven't heard anything on this 
topic, while there has been substantial list traffic otherwise.

Am I asking in the wrong place? Was I unclear?

I know there are people out there that have used/are using Lucene in a 
clustered environment. I am just looking for any sort of feedback 
(general or specific) about clustering lucene as well as filesystem 
compatibility (windows shares, NFS, etc.).

Thanks again,
-Zach
