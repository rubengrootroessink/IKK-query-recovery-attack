SUBJECT: Multiterms query and payloads
DATE: 26 Oct 2009

Hi to everyone,
I started to use payloads in my indexes.
However, I didn't find a class that permits to perform queries using
more than one term.
The only way that works is to use the BoostingTermQuery class, but by
using this class, I can search only one term a time.

Does exist a way to do a multiterms search or I have to implement a
workaround that aggregates the results of single term searches?
Any other suggestions are accepted.

Thanks to everyone.
