SUBJECT: Iterate through the TermFreqVector
DATE: 24 Sep 2004

Is there a simple way to iterate through all the documents to
get their TermFreqVectors?  Do I need to write a custom
IndexSearcher for this?  Or can I just get an enumeration of
the  document ID and call IndexReader.getTermFreqVector(int)?

Thanks,

Will
