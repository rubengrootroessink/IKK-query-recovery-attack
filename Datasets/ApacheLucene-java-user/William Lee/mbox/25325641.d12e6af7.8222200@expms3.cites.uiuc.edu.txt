SUBJECT: Iterate through all the document ids in the index?
DATE: 19 Feb 2005

This should be a very simple question.  But I can't seem to
find the right way to do so.  Anyway, is there a simple and
fast way to get a list of document IDs through the lucene index?  

I can use a loop to iterate from 0 to IndexReader.maxDoc and
check whether an the document id is valid through
IndexReader.document(i), but this would imply that I have to
retrieve the documents fields.

Iterating through from 0 to numDocs would work, I assume, if
the index is optimized (?).  I don't know what would happen if
it's not though.

I also don't think a WildcardQuery would work, since doing a
"*" would give me all the terms and I'd blow over the maximum
term limit in the BooleanQuery.

I'm probably missing something, and I'm sure the experts here
can point me to the obvious.

Thanks,

Will
