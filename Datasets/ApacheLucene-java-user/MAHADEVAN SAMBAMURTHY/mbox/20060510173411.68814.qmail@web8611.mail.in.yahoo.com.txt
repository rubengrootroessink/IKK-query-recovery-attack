SUBJECT: Lucene - index writer
DATE: 10 May 2006

Hi,

 I am new to Lucene and recently started making use of
it. Can anyone please clarify the following: 

I have 2 services and need to have index on the
fetched datas from respective services. I am trying to
create the index for both of them in the same
directory with 2 different analyzers like this: 

========================================= 

private final String indexDir = "/data/index"; 

(Service 1 creates INdexWriter as follows ) 
IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter(indexDir,
new StopAnalyzer(), false);

 (Service 2 creates INdexWriter as follows )
IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter(indexDir,
new StandardAnalyzer(), false); 

========================================== 

1. Can I have the IndexWriter like this using diferent
Analyzers.. for writing the INdex in the same dir. for
different services ? 

2. I could see from Lucene that I have to make use of
the SAME Analyzer when creating the INdex as well as
during searching.. but for the above mentioned
situation, will it have any conflicts ? 

Thanks & Regards, 
S. Mahadevan
