SUBJECT: Re: Escaping Special Characters
DATE: 5 Jul 2011

Hi,
I'm not getting you. escape() method takes String as an argument.

The code snippet I am using is as follows

*String escaped = MultiFieldQueryParser.escape(queryString);
Query query1 = parser.parse(escaped);
TopDocs results = searcher.search(query1);

*Please point out where I may be going wrong.
