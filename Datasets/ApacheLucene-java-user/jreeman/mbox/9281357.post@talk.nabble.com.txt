Because in this case only, the scores will be all 100% but in other case
not. The fact is I don't want the the score depends on the frequency. I
don't want this "smart" feature.

> Anyhow, if all you want to modify is idf(), using the modified similarity
class only at search time is ok. For further pointers and explanations take
a look at http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html

thanks a lot.
