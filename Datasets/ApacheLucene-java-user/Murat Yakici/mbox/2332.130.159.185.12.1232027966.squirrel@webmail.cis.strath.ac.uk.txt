SUBJECT: Re: Term Frequency and IndexSearcher
DATE: 15 Jan 2009

Hi Paul,
I am tempted to suggest the following ( I am assuming here that the
document and the particular fields are TFVed when indexing):
 For every doc in the result set:
   - get the doc id
   - using the doc id, get the TermFreqVector of this document from the
index reader (tfv=ireader.getTermFreqVector(int docNumber, String
field) )
   - get the index number of the term by int index=tfv.indexOf(String term)
   - use this index number to get the frequency of the term by int
freq=tfv.getTermFrequencies()[index]

Remember, this frequency is the field frequency (number of times term T
occurs in field F in document D). If you are after the term's frequency in
document D (which includes all the fields), then you have to do the above
for every field that you are interested or the document has. This approach
has some drawbacks, loading TFV is slower than direct access. So if you
have like a thousand documents in the result set, you may want to put a
threshold or cache some of the most repeated documents/term pairs.

Having said that, there may be a better and efficient approach.
