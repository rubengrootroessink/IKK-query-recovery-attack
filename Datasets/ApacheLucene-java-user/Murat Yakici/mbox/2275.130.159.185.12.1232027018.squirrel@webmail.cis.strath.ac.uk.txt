SUBJECT: Re: Testing Precision and Recall on Lucene
DATE: 15 Jan 2009


I am not aware of any open source LSA framework out there. If you are
interested in PLSA, Lemur has got an implementation.

In a "simplest" sense Lucene is using a type of TFIDF scoring mechanism.
If you are not really concerned with Lucene's particular implementation,
then just use Lemur for your research purposes. I think Lemur is a better
choice for research than Lucene. It is got lots of other IR model
implementations that you can benchmark with. But on the other hand, Lucene
is an excellent choice for query representations, fielded searching etc.
And according to my humble experience, Lucene is really really faster than
Lemur ( both multi-threaded search apps on 80 cores 256G memory, tested
for TFIDF only). OR if you think plain TFIDF implementation is ok for you,
may be just search  some conference papers (SIGIR, ECIR etc.) with your
favourite search engine, and may be you can find a paper which already
compared TFIDF vs. LSA vs. BM25 etc. (I am sure there is a paper, I can't
remember the title). At least, in TERABYTE Track in TREC, there was a
group did perform some benchmarks including Lucene a couple of years ago.

For the metrics, if you make sure the output from your query runs is in
TREC format, again you can use  Lemur's evaluation application to get a
varity of metrics (including standart precision and recall). Lucene also
has a bechmark contribution, but I never worked with it.

LSA is a bit demanding, isn't it? You have to construct a term/document
matrix and then decompose (SVD). This could be a > 1M X 700K matrix. Are
there any matrix decomposition tools to support this size? Apache Mahout
may be.. I don't know the progress of that project with respect to matrix
implementation. You may want to check-out their list.
