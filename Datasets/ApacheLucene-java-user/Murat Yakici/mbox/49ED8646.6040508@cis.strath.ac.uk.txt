SUBJECT: Using Payloads
DATE: 21 Apr 2009

Hi,
I started playing with the experimental payload functionality. I have 
written an analyzer which adds a payload (some sort of a score/boost) 
for each term occurance. The payload/score for each term is dependent on 
the document that the term comes from (I guess this is the typoical use 
case). So say term t1 may have a payload of 5 in doc1 and 34 in doc5. 
The parameter for calculating the payload changes after each 
indexWriter.addDocument(..) method call in a while loop. I am assuming 
that the indexWriter.addDocument(..) methods are thread safe. Can I 
confirm this?

Cheers,
