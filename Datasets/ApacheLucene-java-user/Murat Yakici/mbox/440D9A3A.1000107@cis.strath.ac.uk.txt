SUBJECT: Unreported IOException received for SpanTermQuery class
DATE: 7 Mar 2006

Hi,
I was building the Lucene 1.9.1 source code. I have received the 
following error msg:

"Unreported exceptions: java.io.IOException must be caught or declared 
to be thrown. " in class SpanOrQuery, line number 154.

Any ideas how to resolve it?

Regards,
Murat
