SUBJECT: Re: Unreported IOException received for SpanTermQuery class
DATE: 7 Mar 2006

Yeah, I know, sorry for that.
The reason is, first I tried to solve the problem by wrapping the line 
with a try-catch block. Then, the next build gave the same error for 
SpanTermQuery and some other classes.

I will try to compile that on 1.5.0_01.

Thanks,
Murat
