SUBJECT: Writing terms/freq pairs directly to the inverted file
DATE: 7 Mar 2006

Hi,
I would like to by-pass the IndexWriter and directly write the terms and 
their frequencies to the index (and may proximity info later on). I 
might have missed any discussion if previously. As far as I know, the 
high level API in Lucene only allows you to add documents (which are 
populated by terms) to the index through IndexWriter. These are resolved 
to low-level method calls and written to the index. However, I'm getting 
the following information (term frequency pairs) to be push to the 
index: t1->f1, t2->f2, t3->f3 and so on. In other words, a functionality 
equivalent to IndexReader's termEnum, termDocs for IndexWriter (for 
directly pushing the terms to a document which already exists in the 
index ).


Is there a way to use the low-level API (FieldInfos,TermVectorWriter 
etc.) securely without breaking the integrity of the index?

Which classes I should be looking at specificaly?

Regards
Murat
