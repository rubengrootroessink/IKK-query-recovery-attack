SUBJECT: Using a QueryParser with an untokenized field?
DATE: 31 Jan 2008

In my Lucene index there's a field that contains the local names of XML 
elements, one name per document.  Users can enter arbitrary queries for 
this field, so I'm using a QueryParser.

>From reading around it looks as if the field needs to be tokenized, but 
since the field's content is always a single term, is this really 
necessary?  What difference does it make?  I know that the QueryParser has 
to use a token stream, but for this field, tokenizing ought to be a no-op. 
Or am I missing something?

Thanks,

Eleanor Joslin
