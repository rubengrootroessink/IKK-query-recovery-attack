Ryan (the guy behind it) has gone to work for a firm that has the full 
word format documentation from Microsoft, so he's no longer able to 
contribute to open source projects working with word documents.

You can use POI (http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/) to extract text from word 
documents, along with your Excel and PowerPoint files.

The current word code is similar to the textmining stuff (it was also 
written by Ryan). There's snazier word support coming quite soon for POI 
(a company has paid for it, and it's getting open sourced once they sign 
off on it), but you'd have to ask on poi-user for the latest timescale on 
that.
