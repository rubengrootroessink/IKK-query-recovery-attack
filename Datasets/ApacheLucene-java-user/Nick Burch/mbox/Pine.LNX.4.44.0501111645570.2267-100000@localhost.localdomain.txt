SUBJECT: Looking for UK based Lucene consultant
DATE: 11 Jan 2005

Hi All

My company is looking to hire someone UK-based for a few day's Lucene 
consultancy. Experience with coupling Lucene to large scale web 
spidering is a must, experience with term vectors would be a bonus.

Please contact me off-list if interested

Thanks
Nick
