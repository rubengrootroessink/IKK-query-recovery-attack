It's commonly caused by mis-matched versions of Log4J. Between two 
versions (I think 1.2 and 1.3), a few of the method signatures changed. If 
you try and call one version with the signatures of the other, you hit 
this problem. IIRC, PDFBox requires 1.3

You'll probably either have to upgrade your app to use the newer Log4J, or 
recompile PDFBox against the older one.
