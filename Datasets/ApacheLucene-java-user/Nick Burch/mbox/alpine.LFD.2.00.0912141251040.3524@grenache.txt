SUBJECT: SnowballAnalyzer and StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET ?
DATE: 14 Dec 2009

Hi All

I'm upgrading my code from 2.4 to 2.9, and I've hit an issue with 
deprecations.

My old code was:
 	new SnowballAnalyzer("English", StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS);

Looking at the JavaDocs, I'd expected that the new format would be:
 	new SnowballAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, "English", StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET);

However, while StopAnalyzer has depcrecated ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS in favour 
of ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET, and while SnowballAnalyzer seems to use a Set 
based stopwords list internally, there doesn't seem to be a constructor 
for SnowballAnalyzer that takes a set, only a String[] one

Has anyone hit this before? Am I safe to make a patch to SnowballAnalyzer 
to create a matching constructor taking Set rather than String[] so I can 
use the non deprecated stopwords from StopAnalyzer, or am I barking up the 
wrong tree here?

Thanks
Nick
