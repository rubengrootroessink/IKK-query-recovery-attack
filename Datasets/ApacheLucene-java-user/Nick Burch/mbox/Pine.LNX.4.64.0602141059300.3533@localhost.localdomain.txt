OK, that's now in POI (you'll need a scratchpad build from late yesterday 
or today, see http://encore.torchbox.com/poi-cvs-build/ for jars)

The code is in org.apache.poi.hwpf.extractor.WordExtractor, and it 
supports grabbing all the text, or grabbing an array of the text in each 
paragraph

If you have any problems/queries/comments on it, then you'll probably get 
a better response on poi-user than here!
