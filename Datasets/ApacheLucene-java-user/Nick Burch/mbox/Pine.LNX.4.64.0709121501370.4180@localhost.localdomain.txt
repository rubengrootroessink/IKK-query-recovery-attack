Go to http://poi.apache.org/

Follow the download link from the left hand menu to 
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/poi/ , and pick which mirror you want 
to use

You'll probably want a release rather than dev, then pick between source 
(src) and binary (bin). Download in your prefered archive format
