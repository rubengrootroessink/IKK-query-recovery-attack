We use poi for text extraction, and it works just fine for us. POI 3.1 
should offer a few improvements on text extraction, and POI 3.5 will give 
you OOXML text extraction too.

You might also like to take a look at Apache Tika 
<http://incubator.apache.org/tika/>. It wraps up POI (and a few other 
document extractor libraries), giving you a simple, common interface for 
text extraction
