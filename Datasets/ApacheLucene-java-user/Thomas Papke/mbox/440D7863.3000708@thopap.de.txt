Hello,

anyone implement the "Google Suggest" Feature using Lucene? The Frontend 
is clear - but i need a very fast way to retrieve matching terms. For 
example: The user typed "Ab" and i want to give him a list of 10 
possible words in term "name" starting with "Ab*". So i don't need the 
hole document and i need this information realy fast.

Thx,
Thomas
