SUBJECT: Question to Lucene Index
DATE: 24 Feb 2006

Hello there,

i am a "newby" in usage of Apache Lucene. If have a relativly big 
database indexed by lucene (about 300MB File). Up to now - all users 
could search over the hole index. How to restrict the resultset? I have 
tried it with adding some BooleanQuerys to restrict entries. But with 
this solution i get sometimes a "More than 32 required/prohibited 
clauses in query." Exception. Anyone a solution for my that problem or 
some sites for me where i could look at (with some examples)? Or is 
there a way to generate (relativly fast) a subindex?

Thanks a lot for answer,

Thomas
