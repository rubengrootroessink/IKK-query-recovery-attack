Hi,
I have the same problem.
This is useful when you try to extract the contexts (terms before and after) of a certain
term (for example).
I found a solution but it performs badly: when you try to retrieve those contexts you have
to re-tokenize the documents containing the given term (i.e. "soccer") and you have to keep
the before and after tokens using TokenStream and the current position. Re-tokenizing could
be ok on small files, but on large files it induces a bad performance of the applications.
Any different solution is welcome.

Catalin.

I think this is a non-sense to try to find a term. In Lucene, you search with 
a term, you are not trying to get some. Basically, in Lucene, you have a list 
of term pointing on documents, not the reverse.

Maybe if you explain why you are trying to do that, we can find a better way 
to do it.
