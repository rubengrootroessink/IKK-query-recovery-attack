One more hint for 2) and 3): use SimpleAnalyzer on your xml (give up at XmlContentExtractor).
In this manner you can index all "words" from xml file at lower case (tag name, attribute
name, attribute value and content). 
Of course, you should use the same analyzer for searching.

DEFAULT_MAX_FIELD_LENGTH is a constant of IndexWriter.
to set your own value use IndexWriter.html#setMaxFieldLength(int)

JavaDoc:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#setMaxFieldLength(int)

>   2) how can i index all the words of XML file as Case Insensitive means either in lowercase
or in Uppercase. So that i can search case insensitive.
How your text is processed depends on the analyzer you use for
indexing a certain field. A lot of the available analyzers do
lowercase processing using a lowercasefilter like the
(whitespaceanalyzer)
see (Analysis) at:

You should have a look at
>   3) I am using XmlContentExtractor. Actually it extract only Content of the xml tag.
If i want every thing (including XmlTag or contents or properties - attributes ) of xml file
to be indexed, where should i do change the code.

I'm not 100% sure but isn't XmlContentExtractor a part or jakarta
slide? If so please contact the slide mailing list. But there are many
xml apis available to extract every content of your document. If you
really want to index the whole xml file just read the file using java
io anyway I would not suggest doing that at all.

will be the problem.
