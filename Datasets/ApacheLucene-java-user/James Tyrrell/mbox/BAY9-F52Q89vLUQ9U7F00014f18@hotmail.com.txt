Right got back to work with newly created  index to try these ideas,

I'm creating them on the command line using a variation on the standard 
shown in the demo (has some additional optimisation input that is set to 
default until I can fix this bug).

It definately hangs when shutdown you can't access it, when re-started it 
just sits there trying to access  port 8080

Good news this did work, however I never see tomcat in top or even using ps 
-A | grep tomcat, the only way I've found tomcat is using ps -auwx | grep 
tomcat. The output is

*after tomcat shutdown.sh run*

I did however find two java proccesses running so I duitifully used kill -9 
on both pid's, hey-presto when I restarted Tomcat it ran perfectly. So while 
I can work around this.... I think, I guess now the question becomes, does 
anyone have any advice as to what could be causing this? Bearing in mind I 
can still run java proccesses (even create new indexes) on the same machine 
so it is just Tomcat thats affected.

Meanwhile, I will try as Dan suggested to raise the default memory of Tomcat 
significantly and run another index (it seems a likely culprit).

Thanks for all the help thus far, its more than appreciated regards,

JT
