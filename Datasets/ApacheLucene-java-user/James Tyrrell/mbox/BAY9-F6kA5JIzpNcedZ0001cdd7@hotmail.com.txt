SUBJECT: RE: Indexing process causes Tomcat to stop working
DATE: 27 Oct 2004

Aad,
      D'oh forgot to mention that mildly important info. Rather than 
re-index I am just creating a new index each time, this makes things easier 
to roll-back etc (which is what my boss wants). the command line is 
something like <java com.lucene.IndexHTML -create -index indexstore/ ..> I 
have wondered about whether sessions could be a problem, but I don't think 
so, otherwise wouldn't a restart of Tomcat be sufficient rather than a 
reboot? I even tried the killall command on java & tomcat then started 
everything again to no avail.

cheers,

JT
