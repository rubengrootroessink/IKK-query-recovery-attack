SUBJECT: PrefixQuery Scoring

Whenever I add a PrefixQuery to my search the scoring gets really small. For
example if I do a query like this: +java then the scoring starts around
0.866... and so forth. But if I do a query like this: +java* then the
scoring start like 0.00034... Is there a specific reason for this? or is it
a bug?

Thanks,
Jonathan Franzone
