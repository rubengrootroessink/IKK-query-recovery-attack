I'm actually using a WhitespaceAnalyzer and WhitespaceTokenizer that I
wrote. It parses terms on, of course, whitespace. Is there a way to get a
list of the tokens that are generated after indexing?

If you're using any of the basic analyzers, the / and + terms will be
dropped in tokenization.  If you want to search for terms like C++, you'll
need a tokenizer that treats + as a letter.
