First off, Erik, thank you for taking an interest in any way. As I've said
before, I'm not trying to represent myelf as a Lucene expert, so having
someone point out flaws is goooooooood.

Absolutely. I'm not trying to make fun of pragmatic, working solutions.
Nor am I sneering at those who've done it by sharing filesystems or
whatever.

Well, I'd prefer to avoid RMI. App servers typically have far better
transport layers than raw RMI, internally, and JCA can leverage that.

*nod* I'll look it up.

Well, in all honesty, there IS a small factor of "Gee, I can use an
acronym here!" involved. It's not ALL that's involved, of course - I think
the connector's transparency might be a real benefit for others as well as
satisfying my own "I need a deployed component, and not a service I have
to tune" need.

Just as a general question... is it efficient to retrieve a Document by,
uh, a sort of Lucene key? (Is there such a thing?) If there is, I can code
up a callback procedure in almost no time. (There are some other issues to
address first, but THAT would be easy to do.)

Dunno, I'll investigate.

On my part, too. If I coul get a Directory reliably and quickly using an
RDMS, I'd have gone that route.

Again, no problem - and thank you. The things you bring up are issues I
might not be aware of, so it's good to see them and evaluate them.
