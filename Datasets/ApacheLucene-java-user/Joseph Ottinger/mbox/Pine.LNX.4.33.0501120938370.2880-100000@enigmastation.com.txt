SUBJECT: HELP! Directory is NOT getting closed!
DATE: 12 Jan 2005

*sigh* Yet again, I apologize. I'm generating altogether too much traffic
here lately!

I'm stuck. I have a custom Directory, and I *need* a callback point so I
can clean up. There's a method for this: Directory.close(), which I've
overridden.

It never gets called!

According to IndexWriter.java, line 246 (in 1.4.3's codebase), if closeDir
is set, it's supposed to close the directory. That's fine - but that leads
me to believe that for some reason, closeDir is *not* set.

Why? Under what circumstances would this not be true, and under what
circumstances would you NOT want to close the Directory?

This is absolutely slaughtering my attempt at a Directory, because I need
a single unit-of-work, and I need a place to commit it, when it's done. If
I commit it inside the directory's innards, then the UOW gets corrupted
(and looks like it's more than one atomic action, which is EXACTLY what I
don't need.)
