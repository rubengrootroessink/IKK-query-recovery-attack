SUBJECT: Re: Clustering with Lucene?
DATE: 26 Apr 2011

Thanks Dawid for the reply. Here is what we are trying to do,

1) We index around 20 fields, of that we want to have grouping option
for five of them. For ex., user can search on name of the city and we
should have option to group by products available in that city (and
vice-versa).
2) We also need an aggregation facility, which would allow to
aggregate certain field value from that group. For ex., sum the qty
for all the products in a category. The aggregation may not be part of
clustering, but could be something add-on to it.

Any suggestions on what algorithm or even Mahout may help in this scenario.

Thanks,
-vivek
