I need to be able to sort on optime as well, thus need to store it .
Isn't there any way to filter without indexing? Not sure why do I need
to index some field I need to filter on. I thought we could get all
the documents from an index and then filter out the documents from it
for a field within a given range - isn't this possible?

Just a side question, what takes more space - indexing a field value
or storing a field value?

Thanks,
-vivek
