SUBJECT: Background merge hit exception
DATE: 17 Sep 2008

Hi,

 We have been running Lucene 2.3 for last few months with our
application and all the sudden we have hit the following exception,

       java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: background
merge hit exception: _2uxy:c11345949 _2uxz:c150 _2uy0:c150 _2uy1:c150
_2uy2:c150 _2uy3:c150 _2uy4:c82 into _2uy5 [optimize]

I don't see any other error messages (or stacktrace) around this
exception message. This problem doesn't seem to be recoverable and the
indexer process is failing even after the reboot of the machine.

I've gone through the mailing list over this issue and saw few suggestions,

 1) Make sure you've enough disk space (x2 the index size)  - our
index size is around 5 GB and we have around 50GB space available so
this shouldn't be the case
 2) Is your machine multi-core - yes, this application is running on
Linux box with 8 CPUs, not sure if this is the problem

I can't update the code as this is running on the customer site. Here
are my questions,

   a) Is there any workaround to this problem without updating the code base?
   b) Is there a jira opened on this issue?
   c) Has this been fixed in the subsequent Lucene releases?

Thanks,
-vivek
