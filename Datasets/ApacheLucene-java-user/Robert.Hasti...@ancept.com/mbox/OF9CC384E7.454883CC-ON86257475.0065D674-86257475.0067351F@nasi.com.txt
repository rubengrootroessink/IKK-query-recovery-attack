Actually, I do a global search and the order comes out: 1, 2, 8, 3, 5, 6, 
7,8, 4, 9.  I'm having trouble finding in the code where the sort actually 
gets applied.  Can you help me out there?

Re: Sorting issues






That's surprising. Could you post a brief example of your
index and search code?

It sounds like you're saying
docs 1, 2, 3 all have category aaa
docs 4, 5, 6 all have category bbb
docs 7, 8, 9 all have category ccc

But if you search for category:bbb
you don't get docs 4, 5, and 6

Is this a fair statement of the issue?

Best
