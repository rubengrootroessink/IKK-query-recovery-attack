Thanks Eric,

I did find the problem using Luke, I see that all of the documents have 
the same category field, so I must not be adding the field correctly when 
I index them.

Re: Sorting issues






I can't really help since I've never had to go into the guts of Lucene and
see where sorting is applied, so I don't know where to point you <G>.

But the sorting has always worked for me, and I don't remember anyone
else posting a similar issue in the last year or so. Which means that
the first thing I'd suspect is that something in your code.

Which is why it would be helpful if you'd post some code snippets
showing
1> how you index your field
2> how you construct your sort object
3> how you search using your sort object

Best
Erick
