SUBJECT: Sorting issues
DATE: 27 Jun 2008

I just implemented a sorting feature on our application where the user can 
change the sort on a query and reexecute the search.  It works fine on 
text fields where most of the documents have different field values. 
However, on fields that are categories, that is, there are only four 
distinct values for the category field and
all of the documents fit into a distinct category, the results are not in 
the sorted values.

All of the sort fields are untokenized and stored. and each document has 
only one value for the sorted field.

Are there any known issues (Lucene 2.3.0)?  How can I go about debugging 
this? I have tried Luke, also I have the Lucene source.
