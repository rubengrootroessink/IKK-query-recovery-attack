We are using Aspose: www.aspose.com.  We are still in pre-release, it 
works fine for all of the MS products.  It's commercial, but is a good 
deal as long as you don't have too many developers working on it, since 
the licensing is per seat.  We had a little trouble with thier PDF 
product.  The other thing is that their main product line is .NET but the 
Java line has kept up pretty well.  For text extraction the APIs are 
straight forward.

On the commercial front, Oracle's "Outside In" (previously Stellent) is 
the one that gets used in a lot of search engines.

Being a C-based product though, integration isn't quite as nice/easy as 
pure Java solutions.

We are using POI 3.0.2 FINAL.  Like you, it is not very reliable for many 
Word 
files.  It does not support Word 2, Fast saved files, files which are not 
padded 
to 256 bytes.  PPT and Excel are quite bad, a large % of our PPT files 
throw 
Exceptions.  Not tried 3.1 as it's just gone BETA 1, but I expect that the 
Word 
parsing is unchanged and the changelog doesn't show any Word changes.

TestMining.org http://www.textmining.org/ is quite good, but the 0.4 
version did 
not do Word 2 or Fast Saved files.  1.0 version should fix that, but I've 
not 
yet tried it.  Licene for 1.0 is LGPL, whereas 0.4 was Apache 2.

AbiWord http://www.abisource.com/ is pretty good, but it's a complete GUI 
so is 
quite slow if you want to use it for a lot of parsing.  It can do text 
extraction via the command line.  The Linux versions suports pipes. It's 
based on WvWare http://wvware.sourceforge.net/

Catdoc (http://ftp.wagner.pp.ru/~vitus/software/catdoc/) is quite 
effective, 
fast.  It also has catppt.  I'm not sure if the text order is 100% 
according to 
the original though.

The last two are not licence friendly for distribution.

I've extracted the Nutch parsing framework and am using it in our product 
and 
have tested all of the above and the priority for Word parsing is 
TextMining 
v0.4, before POI and then the other two which I plugged in via the 
parse-ext parser.
