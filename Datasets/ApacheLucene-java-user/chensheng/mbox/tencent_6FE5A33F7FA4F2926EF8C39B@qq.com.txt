Hi, I have a similar case.
If I only index some fixed fields with single-word/number, instead of full-text search,
is Lucene any better than a relational database?

Hi,

I almost finished these days to write such a tool.

It reads via FTPClient the log files and adds to Lucene index.

Via small Web application you can see/filter/sort the log messages.
