SUBJECT: Lucene as syslog storage
DATE: 18 Jun 2006

Hello,

I would like to write a application to browse around and search the log
files of linux machines, like www.splunk.org does.

Would lucene be the right db to store such text information ?
Because the log info should be stored in the db continuously and not as
batch, this would create many thousand small documents. Is this a problem
for lucene ?

Bye
Andreas
