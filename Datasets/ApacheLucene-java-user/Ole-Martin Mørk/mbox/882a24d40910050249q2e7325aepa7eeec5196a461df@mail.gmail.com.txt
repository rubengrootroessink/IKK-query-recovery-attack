SUBJECT: Re: Help understanding fieldNorm
DATE: 5 Oct 2009

Did another update:
9.707364 = fieldWeight(url:"our super secret url" in 0), product of:
  1.0 = tf(phraseFreq=1.0)
  31.063566 = idf(url: www=7329 host=323 com=7329
article=2458 something=4 something=46 704290075=3)
  0.3125 = fieldNorm(field=url, doc=0)

FieldNorm value is not changed this time. It might be that the index was
really small the first time the document was added. Could that affect the
fieldNorm value?
