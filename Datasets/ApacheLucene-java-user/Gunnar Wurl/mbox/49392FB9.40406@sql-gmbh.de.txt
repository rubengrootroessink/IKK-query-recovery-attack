SUBJECT: Deleting documents from index
DATE: 5 Dec 2008

Hi,

I am trying to delete documents from an index. When using the 
IndexReader#deleteDocuments(Term) method this works fine. But when using 
the IndexWriter#deleteDocuments(Term) it is not working, although I am 
using the same term. When using the IndexWriter I tried to commit and 
optimize but a reader opened on the index afterwards still finds the 
document. Is there something special when using the 
IndexWriter#deleteDocuments(Term) method what I have to care for?

Thanks in advance

Gunnar
