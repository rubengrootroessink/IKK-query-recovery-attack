SUBJECT: Re: Straigtforward stemming example? Dictionary needed?
DATE: 24 Apr 2007

I guess there are a few points

- it is impossible to stem with total accuracy using rules alone

- combining a rule based stemmer with a dictionary could also be error
prone. Unrelated words can have the same stem - consider the past tense of
see and the stem of sawing ( cutting wood )

- Stemming would be even more error prone in Spanish - inflexion in
Spanish causes changes to the root more often than in English.

Martin Porter goes into a little more detail here :

Hope this Helps,

Damien
