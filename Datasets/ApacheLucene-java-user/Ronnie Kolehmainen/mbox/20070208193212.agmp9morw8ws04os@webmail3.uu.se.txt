If you are refering to QueryParser, and if you mean that you want  
Lucene to *find everything* when you actually say *search for  
nothing*, you could easily extend current Queryparser to suit your  
needs:

public class MyQueryParser extends QueryParser
{
     public MyQueryParser(String f, Analyzer a)
     {
         super(f, a);
     }

     public Query parse(String query) throws ParseException
     {
         if (null == query || query.trim().length() == 0)
         {
             return new MatchAllDocsQuery();
         }
         return super.parse(query);
     }
}

Regards,
Ronnie
