SUBJECT: Batch deletions of Records from index
DATE: 25 Nov 2005

hii erik and other gurus,

I have a big index with millions of document where every indexed document points to some system
files and database rows.
we are archiving the system files and database rows older then three months.

Need is to device a solution that will delete all the old records ( three months).
I tried keeping the record of Docid's added but that is not really helping cause number of
record added can vary.
one solution can be indexing the date of index also but i can not alter the index now.

Thanks in Advance
~Manish
