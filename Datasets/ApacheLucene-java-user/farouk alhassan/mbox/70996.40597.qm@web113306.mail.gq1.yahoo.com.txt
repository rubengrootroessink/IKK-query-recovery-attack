Hi All,

I'm new to Lucene and have picked up the Lucene in Action book to get started. Really enjoying
it but I have a small nagging question.

Is the index stored in the same "physical document" as the fields and values? If not, where
is it stored and how is it linked.

This is because of this statement in the book

When you retrieve a document from the index, only stored fields will be present. For example,
fields that were indexed but not stored won't be in the document. This behavior
is frequently a source of confusion

Thanks
Farouk A
