Thanks for your response.
I have already done that and understand the code perfectly.

Just to rephrase my question

What is the relationship between an index and a document at the conceptual level.

Does an index include a document or an index is a collection of documents?

Also is index == document if there is only one document?

Thanks

Hi,
  I recommend you to try simple indexer and searcher code from book which
clear the confusion.

  You need to specify the indexing folder and all the fields and values
selected for indexing will stored in that folder. And during search, it
searches from index and get the reference file path for search result too.

regards
Senthil
