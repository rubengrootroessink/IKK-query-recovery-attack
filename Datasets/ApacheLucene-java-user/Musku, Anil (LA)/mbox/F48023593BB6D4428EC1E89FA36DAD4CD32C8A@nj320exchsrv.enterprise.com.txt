SUBJECT: building custom-stemmer
DATE: 2 Jun 2004

Hi,
 
I have a fairly decent idea of using Lucene. I need to use it with some
non-European, Indian and CJK languages. There are some languages among these
that do not currently have a stemmer (I've looked in Snowball). I was
wondering how I could write my own stemmer, say for e.g. for Hindi.
 
Regards,
Anil
