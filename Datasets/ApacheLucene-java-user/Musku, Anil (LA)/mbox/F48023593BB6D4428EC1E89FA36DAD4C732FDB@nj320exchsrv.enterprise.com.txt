Thanks for your reply. I have taken a look at egothor.org. It does appear to
be pretty simple. However, I need to use Lucene as my search engine.

>From what I understand, it appears that I need to be pretty conversant (if
not an expert) with a language for which I wish to write a stemmer. Moreover,
this stemmer can be used with the egothor search engine only? Can I use this
stemmer with Lucene? If yes, how?

Regards,
Anil

I'm sorry for a self-promo ;), but
the stemmer of egothor project can be
adapted to any language, and you needn't be
a language expert. Moreover, the stemmer
achieves better F-measure than Porter's stemmers.

Cheers,
Leo
