SUBJECT: tf=0 while lucene is finding matches?
DATE: 24 May 2005

Hi,
 
Anyone knows what is exactly Similarity.tf()?
I understood it's term frequency on a document.
Still, when I'm searching for a string a document contains, and the
Explain().toString() shows tf=0.
 
 
search string: "SubTitle:(Without)"
matching documents: 3
 
0: 1.0: "Dropping Out," Drifting Off, Being Excluded: Becoming Somebody
Without School
0.0 = fieldWeight(SubTitle:without in 0), product of:
  0.0 = tf(termFreq(SubTitle:without)=0)
  7.214108 = idf(docFreq=3)
  0.5 = fieldNorm(field=SubTitle, doc=0)
 

1: 0.625: "I Have A Life" Bride's Guide: Plan The Wedding You've Always
Wanted--without Losing Your Mind
0.0 = fieldWeight(SubTitle:without in 1), product of:
  0.0 = tf(termFreq(SubTitle:without)=0)
  7.214108 = idf(docFreq=3)
  7.5161928E9 = fieldNorm(field=SubTitle, doc=1)
 

2: 0.625: 1 Microsoft Way: A Cookbook to Breaking Bill Gates Windows
Monopoly Without Breaking Windows
0.0 = fieldWeight(SubTitle:without in 2), product of:
  0.0 = tf(termFreq(SubTitle:without)=0)
  7.214108 = idf(docFreq=3)
  7.5161928E9 = fieldNorm(field=SubTitle, doc=2)
