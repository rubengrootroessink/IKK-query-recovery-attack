SUBJECT: using the CachingWrapperFilter
DATE: 26 May 2005

Hi,
 
Can someone please explain me how do I use the CachingWrapperFilter?
I see that it's built in a decorator way (getting on the constructor another
filter and decorate it with caching), still I don't see any basic filter to
be the 'root'.
 
On the tests I saw there is a MockFilter, but I couldn't find it on the
jars.
Do I need to create such a filter myself? Does anyone using the cache needs
to create his own dummy class?
 
Thanks,
Mickey.
