SUBJECT: RE: using the CachingWrapperFilter
DATE: 2 Jun 2005

Hi Erik,

Thank you very much for your reply.

The problem is I need only the caching without any date or query
functionality.
Since the only two constructable-without-wrapping Filters are the
QueryFilter and DateFilter, I need either to have a dummy filter, or to have
a constructor for the CachingWrapperFilter that doesn't wrap (meaning a
constructor that doesn't get a filter as a parameter).

Am I missing something?

Regards,
Mickey.

There is a bit of it demonstrated in Lucene in Action.  Here are some  
snippets that (sort of) describe it:

     http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=CachingWrapperFilter

You can grab the LIA source code from that site also.

There are two concrete Filters built in to Lucene - QueryFilter and  
DateFilter.  QueryFilter already has built-in caching, but DateFilter  
does not.  CachingWrapperFilter was created to separate caching from  
the filtering aspects, allowing filters to free themselves from  
having to cache themselves.

We don't package up the test code as a JAR file - but if you check  
out Lucene's code from Subversion you'll find it under src/test

This all depends on what you're trying to do.  A Filter is used for  
long standing constraints of the document search space.  You would  
not use a "dummy" class, but rather a real filter such as the ones  
just mentioned.  And whether you use the CachingWrapperFilter depends  
on which filter you choose or if you create a custom one.  The Lucene  
in Action source code has an example of a custom Filter.
