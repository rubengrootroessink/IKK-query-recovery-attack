SUBJECT: MultiSearcher with mulitple filter
DATE: 14 Aug 2007

Hi List,

 

Thanks in advance for the help. I can't wrap my head around the
MultiSearcher. I need to search across multiple indexes, but also need to
filter documents from users based on Access. The problem seems to be that
MultiSearcher takes in 1 filter, however my filter varies from one index to
another. Any advice on implementing this would be a huge help.

 

Thanks,

 

Spencer
