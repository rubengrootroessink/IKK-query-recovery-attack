SUBJECT: Contrib Highlighter and Phrase search
DATE: 18 Mar 2008

Hi List,

Thanks in advance for any help. I'm working with the contrib
highlighting class and am having issues when doing searches with a
phrase. I've been able to duplicate this behaviour in the
HighlighterTest class.

When calling the testGetBestFragmentsPhrase() method I get the correct:

<b>John</b> <b>Kennedy</b> has been shot

However when I add "John" to the text so it reads:

"John Kennedy has been John shot"

I get:

<b>John</b> <b>Kennedy</b> has been <b>John</b> shot

It makes sense to me that John should not be highlighted. Has anyone
else run into this problem? Anyone have a fix?

Cheers,

Spencer
