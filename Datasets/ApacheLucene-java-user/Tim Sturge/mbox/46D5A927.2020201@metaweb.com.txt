SUBJECT: Re: indexing fields with multiplicity
DATE: 29 Aug 2007

I'm looking for a boost when the anchor text is more commonly associated 
with one topic than another. For example the United States of America
is called "USA" by a lot of people. The United Space Alliance is also 
called "USA" but by many less people.

If I just index them both with "USA" once, they will rank equally. I 
want the United States of America to rank higher.
