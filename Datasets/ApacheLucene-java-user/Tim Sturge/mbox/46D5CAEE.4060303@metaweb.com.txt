That's exactly my question. I feel like

for (i = 0 ; i < XXXX ; i++) {
document.add(new Field("anchor","USA"));
}

is exactly equivalent to

field = new Field("anchor","USA"));
field.setBoost(YYYY);
document.add(field);

but I don't know the function that relates XXXX and YYYY. I feel like 
there's a correct information-theorectical answer and I'd like to know 
what it is.
