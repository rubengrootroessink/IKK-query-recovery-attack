SUBJECT: Re: indexing anchor text
DATE: 27 Jun 2007

Case B -- I believe the more inbound anchor text, the better the match. 
Right now I'm also boosting the documents by calling

setBoost( log( numInboundLinks+1 ) + 1 )

which seems to be quite effective; is there some sort of guidebook for this?

I'm also interested in figuring out how to rank the boost for title vs 
body vs anchor; this seems to be 90% black magic to me.

Thanks,

Tim
