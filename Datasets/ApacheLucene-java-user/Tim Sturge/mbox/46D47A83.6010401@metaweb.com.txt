SUBJECT: indexing fields with multiplicity
DATE: 28 Aug 2007

Hi,

I have fields which have high multiplicity; for example I have a topic 
with 1000 names, 500 of which are "USA" and 200 are "United States of 
America".

Previously I was indexing "USA USA .(500x).. USA United States of 
America .(200x).. United States of America" as as single field. The 
problem is that this causes this field to be less weighted for "USA" 
than a topic with a single name "USA".

So what I am now going to do is call

for (i = 0 ; i < 500 ; i++) {
    document.add(new Field("anchor","USA"));
}

There must be a more efficient way than this; I surely don't need to 
tokenize the thing 500x for starters (and yes, I know the multiplicity 
in advance)

Can someone tell me the magic ingredient to get a new field that looks 
like 500 *seperate* names "USA"?

Thanks,

Tim
