SUBJECT: calling commit() on IndexReader
DATE: 31 Jul 2007

Can anyone explain to me why commit() on IndexReader is a protected method?

I want to do periodic deletes from my main index. I don't want to reopen 
the index (all that is changing are things are being deleted), so I 
don't want to call close(), but I can't call commit() from outside the 
class directly (which writes the *.del file)

Is this done for my protection or for my annoyance? (meaning, if I 
subclass just this to make the method public am I going to cause any 
problems?)

Thanks,

Tim
