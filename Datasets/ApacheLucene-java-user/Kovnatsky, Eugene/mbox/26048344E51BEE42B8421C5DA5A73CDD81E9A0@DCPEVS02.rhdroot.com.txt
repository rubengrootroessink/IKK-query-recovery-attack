SUBJECT: Lucene Software/Hardware Setup Question
DATE: 26 Oct 2010

Hi guys, 

I am trying to get some information on what enterprise hardware folks
use out there. We are using Lucene extensively. Our total catalogs size
is roughly 50GB between roughly 8 various catalogs, 2 of which take up
60-70% of this size.

So my question is - if any of you guys have similar catalog sizes then
what kind of software/hardware do you have running, i.e. what app
servers, how many, what hardware are these app servers running on?

Any information would be helpful.

Thanks in advance. 
 
Eugene.
