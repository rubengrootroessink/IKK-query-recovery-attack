Essentially, we have a database (can't recall if it is Oracle or MSSQL) that
contains a bunch of articles. There is a website with search functionality
that allows the user to retrieve those articles and display them on the
page. Essentially it's like a Wikipedia type website. If it's relevant, I'll
see if I can get the existing architecture that we currently use.

I'm not sure if it's a better idea to use something like Solr or start from
scratch and customize the application as I move forward. What do you think?

Thanks for all the replies btw.
