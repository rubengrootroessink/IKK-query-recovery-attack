Hello,

I came across some new information regarding the original architecture. We
have a file on a website that basically contains all the links of all the
articles that are searchable. This file is meant to be a crawler starting
point. The articles already have metadata that can be used for indexing. The
data retrieval from the database is handled by something else which I
currently do not have access to (so I'm not exaclty sure how it's done).

Would a crawler have to be written from scratch or would something like
Nutch be useful in this case? Basically I want to build an index from the
metadata of all the articles that are available.

Thanks for all your help/suggestions

Cheers

P.S. Wasn't sure if I need a new topic for a new question, so I just used
this one
