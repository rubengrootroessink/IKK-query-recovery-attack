Thanks to Steven J. Owens for his small tutorial. It
was good, i was quite informative, we can always
improve as we go along.

It will be good to post few samples as a tutorial
which might have:
- Simple servlet Example  for Search
- Simple application example
- How to create index files for servlets and
application.
-  any more suggestion.

I am pretty new , just joined 2 days ago. But i will
be happy to contribute, I can create some Html pages
once I get index search working properly with Servlet.


The problem I am having is in creating "indexing" to
use it for servlet. Right now I have to give full
qualified path ("C:\Websphere\installedApps\"), when i
generate the index file.

How can i create an index file so query shows relative
path on the browser for example:
Currently query Links are shown==> 
         C:\Websphere\installedApps\dv.jsp
I want to see :
      http://localhost:8080/dv.jsp

If someone knows how to build indexing using relative
path. If soemone has built a sevlet before that would
be very helpful.


Thanks
