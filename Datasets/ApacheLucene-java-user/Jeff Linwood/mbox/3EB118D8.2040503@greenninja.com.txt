Hi,

The demo is set up as a JSP application.  If you want to use Velocity 
with Lucene, it's actually very easy.

 From inside your application, when the user calls your Search action, 
use the search() method on IndexSearcher to get a Hits object.  The 
easiest (not necessarily the best performance, though) thing to do is to 
put that Hits object into a Velocity Context, and then loop through that 
Hits object in your Velocity template to get Documents. Read the Fields 
  off of your Document objects, and display them to the reader however 
it works for your app.

Hope this helps some,
Jeff Linwood
