I think you might need to post a little bit more detail about what you are
trying to solve.  Are you trying to index one field in one table in your
database, several fields, several tables?

As a general idea, you will need to create a Lucene Document object for each
record you put into the search engine. The document consists of fields,
which are name/value pairs.  So if you had a "title", "content", and
"uniqueid" fields in your table, you would create Lucene Field objects for
each of those fields, add them to a Document, and then add the Document to
an index. This is a very simplified explanation :)
