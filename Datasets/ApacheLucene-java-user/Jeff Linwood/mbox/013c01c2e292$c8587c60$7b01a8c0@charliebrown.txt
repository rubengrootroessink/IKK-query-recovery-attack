One point to note about Lucene is that it isn't a stand-alone search engine
like Inktomi.  It lets you build a search engine into your application.
You (as a developer) are responsible for writing the code that adds your
content to the index, and for writing the code that displays the search
results to the user. The demo code is great, but it's really just a start
for your applications

One approach would be to store the paths of each file (relative to
c:\myfiles\www) as a field on the document, and then use that path to build
up a link in the search results page.   You could add a server name here if
you needed to

Hope this helps,
Jeff

mentioned in the examples, and then when i run the app and do a sample
search, it does point to the directory structure say "c:/filesToIndex/www/"
instead of "http://localhost:8080/www/". So how can this be changed to
reflect the website domain as mentioned by you. Could you explain again. Say
my docs are under a directory c:/filesToIndex/www/ and the wesite is as you
said http://localhost:8080/ , then how to proceed!
