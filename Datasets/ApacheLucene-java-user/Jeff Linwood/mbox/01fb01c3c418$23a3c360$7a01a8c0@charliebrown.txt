You should create a Lucene Document for each record in your table.  Make
each of the columns that contains text a field on the Document object.  Also
store the primary key of the record as a field.

Here's a very basic article I wrote about using Lucene:

database.
Is there any tutorial how to implement this kind of search feature.

Best regards,
Stefan
