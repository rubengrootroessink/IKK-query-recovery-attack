Israel, if you have this implemented, I'd appreciate if you can crunch some  
numbers so I know how slow it actually is, for future comparison? Let's say  
on 100.000 results, each of which have up to 50 words, or 50.000 results  
with 100 words each ... how much time does it take or how many queries per  
second can it handle. Do you have your implementation as open source  
somewhere?

Thank you
