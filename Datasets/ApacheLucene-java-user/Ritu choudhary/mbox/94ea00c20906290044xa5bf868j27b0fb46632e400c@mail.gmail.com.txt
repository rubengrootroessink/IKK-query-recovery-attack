SUBJECT: highlighting the result within a file
DATE: 29 Jun 2009

hi all,
 I am trying a program that could highlight a searched term and writes
the result into a demo.html file. As of now this demo.html can show
only few pages of the book . Is there any way i can use it show the
whole book. (Can increasing the fragment size upto filesize help?)

        I have attached the program  i am using(please use a large xml
file as it runs fine with shorter ones). F1 F1 F1

Thanks in advance.
