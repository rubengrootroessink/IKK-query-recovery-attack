SUBJECT: Re: highlighting searched results in document
DATE: 28 May 2009

The output i want is to show the text i searched let's say "search" in the
document where it occured. Like this:


the text i want to search is this and it should be highlighted as this .
Search currently is giving just the word "search". The result i want is to
highlight the searched word in the document. How can i do that. Doesn't
getBestFragment() return the whole fragment(or the document) in which the
searched word occur or does it give just the word. How can i achieve this?
