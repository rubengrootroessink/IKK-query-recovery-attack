SUBJECT: highlighting searched results in document
DATE: 27 May 2009

hi there,
    I am using lucene highlighter to highlight the searched result
but it shows only the query string in bold highlights.
IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN USE IT TO SHOW THE HIGHLIGHTED TEXT IN THE
DOCUMENT WHERE IT IS FOUND?
 I need to show the searched terms in highlights in the
document where it is found and i want to do it without using
org.apache.lucene.search.Hits
Please help. Thanks in advance.
