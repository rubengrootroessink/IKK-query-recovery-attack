I  have added the lines you suggested and now its giving the following
output , still can't get what's wrong...

THE CHANGES I HAVE DONE:

SimpleHTMLFormatter formatter =
       new SimpleHTMLFormatter("<span class=\"highlight\">",
           "</span>");
   Highlighter highlighter = new Highlighter(formatter, new QueryScorer(query));
	
	    int maxNumFragmentsRequired=200;
		 String FragmentSeparator="...";
		 Fragmenter fragmenter = new SimpleFragmenter(50);

		   highlighter.setTextFragmenter(fragmenter);
		  	
		 TokenStream tokenStream=analyzer.tokenStream(FIELD_NAME,new
StringReader(text));
	     String result=highlighter.getBestFragments(tokenStream,text,maxNumFragmentsRequired,FragmentSeparator);
	
	    	System.out.println( "This is the result "+result);


OUTPUT:

Content field found--->>accept
This is the result <span class="highlight">accept</span>
