SUBJECT: AW: PDF parser
DATE: 22 Nov 2002

There are different Parsers available - every Parser has other advantages
and disadvantages.
I use a combination of the PDFBox  http://www.pdfbox.org/ and Etymon PJ
http://www.etymon.com/pjc/, cause their APIs are very simple. Both of them
parse PDF in a format of their own an provide interfaces to get the PDF
Documents contents.

Other developers on this list prefer JPedal http://www.jpedal.org/ which
parses PDF into XML an provide a XML Tree with the PDF Documents contents
