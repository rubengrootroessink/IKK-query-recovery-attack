Hi, Erik,

I some time ago played with the Lucene 1.2 source code and made some 
modifications to it, trying to add my own ranking algorithm. I am not sure 
if Licence wise, it is permissible to modify the earlier source code, also 
if it is allowed to put the modified version or the description of what I 
have done on wiki?

Thanks for your reply.

Jian
