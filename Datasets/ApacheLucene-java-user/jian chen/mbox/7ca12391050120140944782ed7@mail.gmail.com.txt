Hi,

One thing to point out. I think Lucene is not using LSI as the
underlying retrieval model. It uses vector space model and also
proximity based retrieval.

Personally, I don't know much about LSI and I don't think the fancy
stuff like LSI is workable in industry. I believe we are far away from
the era of artificial intelligence and using any elusive way to do
information retrieval.

Cheers,

Jian
