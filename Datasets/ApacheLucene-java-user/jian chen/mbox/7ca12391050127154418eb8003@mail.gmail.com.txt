SUBJECT: google mini? who needs it when Lucene is there
DATE: 27 Jan 2005

Hi,

I was searching using google and just found that there was a new
feature called "google mini". Initially I thought it was another free
service for small companies. Then I realized that it costs quite some
money ($4,995) for the hardware and software. (I guess the proprietary
software costs a whole lot more than actual hardware.)

The "nice" feature is that, you can only index up to 50,000 documents
with this price. If you need to index more, sorry, send in the
check...

It seems to me that any small biz will be ripped off if they install
this google mini thing, compared to using Lucene to implement a easy
to use search software, which could search up to whatever number of
documents you could image.

I hope the lucene project could get exposed more to the enterprise so
that people know that they have not only cheaper but more importantly,
BETTER alternatives.

Jian
