Hi,

Lucene uses a variant version of vector space model for ranking the
documents.

You can look at
1)
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.htmlfor
the fomula,

2) there is an article some one wrote about the Lucene's Ranking function
vs. standard vsm. However, that link has been removed and I think it does
not exist anymore. I still keep a copy of that file, so, you may download it
from my website at the following url:
http://jhsystems.net:9090/lucene_ranking.pdf

Let me know of any other problem.

Cheers,

Jian
