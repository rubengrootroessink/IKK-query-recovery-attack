SUBJECT: Re: Lucene index integrity during a system crash
DATE: 16 Jul 2005

Hi, Otis,

Thanks for your email. As this is very important for using Lucene in
our production system, I looked at the code to try to understand. Here
is my observation why the index won't be corrupted during a system
crash.

In the IndexWriter.java mergeSegments(...) method, there are two lines:
segmentInfos.write(directory);	  // commit before deleting
deleteSegments(segmentsToDelete);//delete unused segments

The sgementInfos.write(...) writes the new segments file as
"segments.new", once the write is complete, it renames "segments.new"
to "segments".

I guess the rename operation is atomic as guaranteed by the operating
system. Otherwise, the "segments" file will be left in an inconsistent
state during the system crash.

It also appears to me that the "segments" file is the single point to
switch from old set of index segments to new ones. In case of a system
failure, the old "segments" file will be used anyway, so, no
corruption.

Is this understanding correct and thorough?

Thanks a lot,

Jian
