SUBJECT: document ids in "cached" in Hits and index merge
DATE: 25 Jun 2005

Hi,

I have a stupid question regarding the transient nature of the document ids. 

As I understand, documents will obtain new doc ids during the index
merge. Suppose if you do a search and got the Hits object. When you
iterate through the documents by id, the index merge happens. How the
merge and new ids created do not mess up the retrieval of Hits
documents?

Could anyone please enlighten me on this synchronization issue?

Thanks a lot,

Jian
