Hi, 

I haven't heard anything back. Probably this email got lost on the way
or whatsoever.

Anyway, could anyone enlighten me on this?

Thanks,

Jian

Hi,

I am looking at and trying to understand more about Lucene's
reader/writer synchronization. Does anyone know when the commit.lock
is release? I could not find it anywhere in the source code.

I did see the write.lock is released in IndexWriter.close().

Thanks,

Jian
