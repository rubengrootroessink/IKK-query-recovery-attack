SUBJECT: Re: How to give recent documents a boost?
DATE: 25 Jan 2005

Hi,

I think setting boost to the recent document is tricky. There is no
clear cut except trial and error to make the boost value right.

Could you let the user specify a date range and sort the documents
within that range by relevance? This way, the users get what they
exactly specified, and won't be annoyed by in-proper setting of the
boost factor.

Workable?

Thanks,

Jian
