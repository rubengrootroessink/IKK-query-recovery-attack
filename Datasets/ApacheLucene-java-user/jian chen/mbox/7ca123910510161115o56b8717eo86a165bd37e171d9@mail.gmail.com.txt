Hi, Trond,

By the way, it appears to me that Lucene uses the iterator pattern a lot,
like SegmentTermEnum, TermDocs, TermPositions, etc. Each iterator uses the
underlying fix sized buffer to load a chunck of data at a time. So, even you
have millions of documents, you shouldn't run into memory problem given
Lucene's index data structure.

That said, there are some parameters that you can tweak given really large
amount of documents. But I suggest that you don't need to worry about it
unless you really run into it.

Cheers,

Jian
