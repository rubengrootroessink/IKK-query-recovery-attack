SUBJECT: Lucene index integrity during a system crash
DATE: 16 Jul 2005

Hi,

I know Lucene does not have transaction support at this stage.
However, I want to know what will happen if there is an operating
system crash during the indexing process, will the Lucene index got
corrupted?

Thanks,

Jian
