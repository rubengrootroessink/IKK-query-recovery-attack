Hi,

Just to continue this discussion. I think right now Lucene's retrieval
algorithm is based purely on Vector Space Model, which is simple and
efficient.

However, there maybe cases where folks like me want to use another set
of completely different ranking algorithms, those which do not even
use tf/idf.

For example, I am thinking about adding Cover Density ranking
algorithm to lucene, which is for now purely based on the proximity
information and does not require any global ranking variables. But
looking into the lucene code, it seems not very easy to make a hack
for that. At least, for me, a novice lucene user.

I read on the lucene whiteboard 2.0 that lucene will accomodate more
in terms of what to be indexed and such. That move might be good for
implementing other or ad hoc ranking algorithms.

Cheers,

Jian
