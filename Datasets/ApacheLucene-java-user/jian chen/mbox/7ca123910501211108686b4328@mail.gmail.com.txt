Hi,

I have some studies in Chinese text search. The main problem is how to
separate the words. As in Chinese, there is no white space between
words.

The typical commercial search engines these days use a dictionary
based approach. That is, look through the Chinese text and find the
words that are in the dictionary. As for those characters that do not
match words in the dictionary, you could use bi-gram based approach.
Say, a b c,  you could index as 2 (pseudo) words, ab, bc.

I think pure bi-gram based approach is not good for relative large
Chinese text collection, as you end up with many pseudo terms that are
not actual words.

Cheers,

Jian
