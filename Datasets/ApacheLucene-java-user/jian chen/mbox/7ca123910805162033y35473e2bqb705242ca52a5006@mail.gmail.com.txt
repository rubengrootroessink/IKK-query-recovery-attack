SUBJECT: two copies of indexes vs. master/slave indexes
DATE: 17 May 2008

I have seen two different designs for incremental index updates.

1) Have two copies of indexes A and B. The incremental updates happens on A
index while B index is being used for search. Then, hot swap the two
indexes. Bring B index up to date and perform incremental updates
thereafter.  In this scenario, searches are performed on index A or B
alternatively.

2) Have a master index where the incremental updates are applied. Then, the
slave indexes got synced up with the master index. Searches are performed
only on the slave indexes.

So, I want to know what are the trade offs between the two approaches? For
scalability, what's the best approach?

Thanks,

Jian
