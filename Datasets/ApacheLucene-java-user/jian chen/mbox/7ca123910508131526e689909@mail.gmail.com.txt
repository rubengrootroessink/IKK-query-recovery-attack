SUBJECT: Re: Integrate Lucene with Derby
DATE: 13 Aug 2005

Hi, 

I am also interested in that. I haven't used Derby before, but it
seems the java database of choice as it is open source and a full
relational database.

I plant to learn the simple usage of Derby and then think about
integrating Derby with Lucene.

May we should post our progress for the integration and various
schemes of integration in this thread or somewhere else?

Thanks,

Jian
