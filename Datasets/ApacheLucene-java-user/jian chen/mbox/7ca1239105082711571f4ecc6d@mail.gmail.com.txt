SUBJECT: Re: read past EOF
DATE: 27 Aug 2005

Hi,

It seems this problem only happens when the index files get really large. 
Could it be because java has trouble handling very large files on windows 
machine (guess there is max file size on windows)?

In Lucene, I think there is a maxDoc kind of parameter that you can use to 
specify, when the index gets really large containing more than that many of 
documents, it will not try to merge the index files into one. Could this be 
used to stop the index files from growing forever?

Cheers,

Jian
