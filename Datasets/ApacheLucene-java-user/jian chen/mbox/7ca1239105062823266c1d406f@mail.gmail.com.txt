SUBJECT: question regarding the "commit.lock"
DATE: 29 Jun 2005

Hi,

I am looking at and trying to understand more about Lucene's
reader/writer synchronization. Does anyone know when the commit.lock
is release? I could not find it anywhere in the source code.

I did see the write.lock is released in IndexWriter.close().

Thanks,
