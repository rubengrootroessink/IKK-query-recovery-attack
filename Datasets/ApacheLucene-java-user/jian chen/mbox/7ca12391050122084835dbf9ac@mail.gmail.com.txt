SUBJECT: Re: Opening up one large index takes 940M or memory?
DATE: 22 Jan 2005

Hi,

If it is really the case that every 128th term is loaded into memory.
Could you use a relational database or b-tree to index to do the work
of indexing of the terms instead?

Even if you create another level of indexing on top of the .tii fle,
it is just a hack and would not scale well.

I would think a b/b+ tree based approach is the way to go for better
memory utilization.

Cheers,

Jian
