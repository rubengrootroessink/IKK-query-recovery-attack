SUBJECT: Re: How to search between dates?
DATE: 3 Sep 2005

Hi, 

The other way maybe, store the date in a separate database, like derby 
embeded database. Then, do a joint query between the Lucene result and the 
derby database select result, and merge the two result set into one by 
handing coding a database intersection like type of operation.

Just a thought but I am looking into using derby to store all the 
numeric/date data that requires range query, and only store in Lucene the 
free text data. Then, using a primary key to associate the two. 

Since typically, range query is best handled by B+ tree indexing, so, that 
is why I want to give derby a try and see how to best integrate it with 
Lucene.

Cheers,

Jian
