Hello,

You could use a PhraseQuery with the terms "cool" and "gaming" and
"computer" and set the slop factor you reckon is right. Then could assign a
boost to this query only, which will make it bubble up the list.
I don't think you can get away without specifying a slop factor though(like
in the proximity scenario you mention).

Regards,
Savvas
