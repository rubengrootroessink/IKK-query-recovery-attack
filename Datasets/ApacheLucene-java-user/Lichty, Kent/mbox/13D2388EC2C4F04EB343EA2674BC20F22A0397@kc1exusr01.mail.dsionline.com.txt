Thanks! Yeah, that's exactly what I need to do. I can really just leave
Lucene out of the picture, and just feed it the "content" text that I have
parsed out of the html "document". Thanks again for your help!

Oh wait...I just re-read your original post and apparently I misunderstood
(I had
just found a hammer and at a glance
your problem looked like a nail). Sorry about that.

But it's not entirely unrelated...You *could* write your own Analyzer that
uses
the HTMLEditorKit stuff to only index
the text of your HTML documents and not the tags. I'm not sure if that's
exactly
what you want, but it's an option.

Regarding the HTMLEditorKit and related stuff, it's not that hard, actually.
It's
not entirely unlike using a SAX parser to
parse XML documents. The gist of it is as follows:

     First you create a class that extends HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback. By
default all of the "handleXXX()"
     methods are empty implementations, so override the ones you care about.
In
my case, I only needed to read
     comments and text, so I overrode the handleComment() and handleText()
methods.
     Now, in the code that will use all of this, I started by opening a
java.io.FileReader on my HTML document.
     Next, I created an instance of ParserDelegator (I've not delved into
the API
code yet to know why I had to do
     this).
     Then I called the parse() method of my ParserDelegator, passing it the
reader, an instnace of my ParserCallback
     class, and a boolean true.
     At that time, the parser took over and started making calls back to the
handleXXX() methods that I wrote.
