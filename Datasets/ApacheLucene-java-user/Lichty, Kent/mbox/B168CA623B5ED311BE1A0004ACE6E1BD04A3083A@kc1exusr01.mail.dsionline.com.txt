Hi... I am both a "newbie" to Lucene and to using this list, so please
forgive me if I make some mistakes. I am trailing onto this post because I
cannot seem to get the "wildcard" function to work at all, while all of the
other features seem to work just fine.  I am using a very standard
application (actually, it is just the demo version slightly modified) with
the StandardAnalyzer and the QueryParser.  But the wildcard feature (using
either "?" or "*") just doesn't work. I must be missing something very
basic.  I would appreciate any ideas. Thanks!

Left wildcards seem to work if you explicitly use a
WildcardQuery e.g. 

	Term t = new Term("id", "*ucene");
	Query query = new WildcardQuery(t);


but if use QueryParser with an analyzer e.g.

	Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
	Query query = QueryParser.parse("*ucene", "id", analyzer);

get an exception:

org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException: 
Lexical error at line 1, column 1.  Encountered: "*" (42), after : ""
  at org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.parse(Unknown Source)


Tested on RC5.  Haven't tried other ways of building a query.  In my
simple tests terms with left and right wildcards like "*lucene*"
worked too, even if the whole word was included.
