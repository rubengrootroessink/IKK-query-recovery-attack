SUBJECT: Is the functionality to highlight matched words currently availab	le?
DATE: 11 Nov 2002

We use Lucene as the search engine in a web application.  The users would
like to be able to have the matched words highlighted on the HTML pages
(documents) that are found. According to the current FAQ on the web (June
2001) Lucene does not offer much in the way of assisting with this
functionality. Does anybody know of more recent versions of Lucene contain
this "highlighting matched words" functionality and/or if there are any
"workarounds" to achieve this?

Thanks.
