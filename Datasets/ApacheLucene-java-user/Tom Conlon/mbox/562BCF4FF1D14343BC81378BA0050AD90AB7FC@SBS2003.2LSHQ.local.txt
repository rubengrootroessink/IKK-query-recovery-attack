DATE: 25 May 2008

Hi Mark,

For example:
you have a content field (default) and you also have an 'attributes'
field.

I'd like to add multiple attributes for a given document rather than
just one value and be able to somehow search on the attributes.

Ie. Similar to a One-to-many DB relationship between document table(pk
docid) and docattribute table (pk docid,attributeid)

TIA,
Tom

Could you elaborate a bit Tom? Your question is not very clear. If by
keywords, you mean terms, and instead of from one doc, you mean to one
doc, then the answer is yes. But as phrased, I am not sure what the
question is.
