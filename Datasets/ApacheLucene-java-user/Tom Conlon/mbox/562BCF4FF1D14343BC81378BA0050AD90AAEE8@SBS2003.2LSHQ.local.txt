SUBJECT: Escaping special characters
DATE: 23 Sep 2007

Hi,

Unless I'm missing something, according to:

http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html#Escaping%20Spe
cial%20Characters

I should be able to search for C++ and C# using something like: 
C\+\+ and C\#.

This doesn't work. 

I apologise if this sort of question has been asked many times in the
past but I've not found any examples or answer to this problem.

Thanks,
Tom
