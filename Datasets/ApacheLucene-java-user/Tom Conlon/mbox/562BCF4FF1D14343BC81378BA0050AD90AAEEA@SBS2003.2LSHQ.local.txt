Thanks for the input Erick,

I changed the analyser to WhitespaceAnalyzer but same results.

You're right about what was indexed

Enter Querystring:
(c++ and c#)
Searching for: c c

Enter Querystring:
(c\+\+ and c\#)
Searching for: c c

Default as in StandardAnalyzer? "Stuff happens" with StandardAnalyzer.
I'd recommend that you use something really simple like
WhitespaceAnalyzer for something like this, or possibly create your own
analyzer that uses LowerCaseFilter and breaks on whitespace.

I suspect that if you open your index with Luke, you'll find that what
you actually indexed was "C" rather than "C++" etc. But that's only a
guess.

What does query.toString() return?

Best
Erick
