Hi Grant,

I was half-expecting this answer. :(

The query is very basic and the scoring seems completely arbitrary.
Documents with the same number of ocurrences and (seemingly)
distribution are being given widely different scores.

Thanks for re-emphasizing these points (I was aware of them in any
event).

Not sure what UI you are referring to, but you should have a look at
Searcher.explain() for giving you information about why a particular
document scored the way it does
