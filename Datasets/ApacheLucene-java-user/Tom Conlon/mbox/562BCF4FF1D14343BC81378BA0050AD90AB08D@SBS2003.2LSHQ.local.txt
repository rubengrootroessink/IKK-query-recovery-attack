The reason seems to be that I found I needed to implement an analyser that lowercases terms
as well as *not* ignoring trailing characters such as #, +. 
(i.e. I needed to match C# and C++)

public final class LowercaseWhitespaceAnalyzer extends Analyzer 
{
  public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
    return new LowercaseWhitespaceTokenizer(reader);
  }
} 

Problem now exists that "system," etc is not matched against "system".

Can anyone point to an example of a combination of analyser/tokeniser (or other method) that
gets around this please?

Thanks,
Tom

Thanks Daniel,

I'm using Searcher.explain() & luke to try to understand the reasons for the score.

45.txt might be a document with more therms so that its score is lower although it contains
more matches.
