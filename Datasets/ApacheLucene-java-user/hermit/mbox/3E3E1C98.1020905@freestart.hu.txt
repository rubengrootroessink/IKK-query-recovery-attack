SUBJECT: '-' character not interpreted correctly in field names
DATE: 3 Feb 2003

Hello!

I have a problem, a big one. I have successfully indexed 600 MB of XML 
data, but the search can't give any results if the field contains any  
'-' characters .
For example: compound@cgx-code:[2 - 5] must match at least two results 
based on my XML data but it gives nothing.

Can you advice me a simple solution? Or is it a bug?

    The Hermit
