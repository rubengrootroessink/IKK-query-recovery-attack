  Sorry Otis or some body else, the  search result of 'hgg:efs~ hd~ uuir*~' 
might make you disappointment, it's due to my careless--im just fixing a 
little budg in the application.
  in addition, the search.soufun.com is the web site for a little 
company(soufun.com ) which can search just the content of  the company as 
yet. but it's solution can used as a universal one, at lease i think so, for 
many moderate company, and we will make it better!
