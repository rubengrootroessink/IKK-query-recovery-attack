SUBJECT: Re: How to search special characters in LUcene
DATE: 24 Apr 2009


Hi Thanks for your reply.

After gone threw with the site which you given... i understood that
StandardAnalyzer is enough to handle these special characters.

i'm attaching one class called AnalysisDemo.java. By executing that class
i'm able to say the above sentance(i.e StandardAnalyzer is enough).

Here is the out put when i ran the above java file.
Analzying "Vedr.           :   Amtsgården Århus, Lyseng Allé 1, 8270
Højbjerg"
	org.apache.lucene.analysis.WhitespaceAnalyzer:
		[Vedr.] [:] [Amtsgården] [Århus,] [Lyseng] [Allé] [1,] [8270] [Højbjerg] 

	org.apache.lucene.analysis.SimpleAnalyzer:
		[vedr] [amtsgården] [århus] [lyseng] [allé] [højbjerg] 

	org.apache.lucene.analysis.StopAnalyzer:
		[vedr] [amtsgården] [århus] [lyseng] [allé] [højbjerg] 

	org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer:
		[vedr] [amtsgården] [århus] [lyseng] [allé] [1] [8270] [højbjerg] 

	org.apache.lucene.analysis.snowball.SnowballAnalyzer:
		[vedr] [amtsgården] [århus] [lyseng] [allé] [1] [8270] [højbjerg] 

By the above out put we can say that StandardAnalyzer is enough to get rid
of danish elements.

But only problem is when i'm searching the any term which includes the
danish elements(like højbjerg...)

it is unable to find out. 

Even i checked with LUKE. In that  i given my sample text which contains the
danish elements and selected the StandardAnalyzer as analyser. when i click
analyze in that it cleary making index of danish words.

and also i givne one try on luke by loading my index directory in to luke.
after loading my index i searched for a word which contains the danish
element, But this time it was failed. It was shown nothing(i.e o resluts).

As in my sense the problem might be making the indexes or in searching the
item.


I gone threw the site which you given. From that i'm able to do this kind of
reaserch work.

Please help me in this.
