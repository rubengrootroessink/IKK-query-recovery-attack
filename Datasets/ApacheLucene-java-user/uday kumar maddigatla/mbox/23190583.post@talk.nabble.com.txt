DATE: 23 Apr 2009


HI 

Here are the details about my goals.
1. I want to use this lucene for mixed languages.
2. I want to make indexes of the documents which are either english or
danish etc.
I'm attaching my IndexFiles.java file.

When i'm searching i'm giving the index path location  as well as doucmets
folder.

If i use StandardAnalyzer as an argument to IndexWriter's method it is able
to search the english characters.

How can i use DutchAnalyzer in order to make this IndexFiles.java to index
the danish elements.

In my Code which i attached, you can see 'C:\test3'. This is my location
where i want to store my indexes.

I'm giving documents folder location as comand line argument.

In my document the content will be like this

<com:Note><![CDATA[Kreditnota til udligning af faktura nr. 13927 pga skal

i"m searching the word like rådgiver . When i see the result it is clearly
searching for r dgiver. It is omitting the danish element.

Please help me in this.
