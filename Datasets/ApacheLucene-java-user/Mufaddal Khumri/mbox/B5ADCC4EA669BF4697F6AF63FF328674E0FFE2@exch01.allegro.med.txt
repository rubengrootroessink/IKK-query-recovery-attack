DATE: 7 Apr 2005

I have indexed the product names using the StandardAnalyzer and I store
the product names as Field.Text. I suspect the StandardAnalyzer uses my
hyphens as a token separator. What do I do to get around this problem?
Can I tell StandardAnalyzer not to break on hyphens or should I be using
some other Analyzer?

Thanks.

How did you index those product names?  I.e., if you used a tokenized 
field for the product names and an analyzer that breaks on the hyphens, 
then there are no hyphenated tokens for you to match.  I would suggest 
using Luke to browse your index and see what you have.
