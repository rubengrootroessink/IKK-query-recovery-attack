SUBJECT: Lucene loosing documents?
DATE: 28 Apr 2005

Hi,

I am trying to index 20349 records. When I index using the FSDirectory I
get 20349 documents - this is correct. Now when I ude the RAMDirectory
to create my index and write all documents from the RAMDirectory to the
FSDirectory I only get 20340 documents consistently. This is the only
change I made. Why do I loose 9 documents?

int counter = 1;
while(counter <= 20349)
{
	ramWriter.addDocument(doc);
}

Directory d[] = {ramDir};
fsWriter.addIndexes(d);
fsWriter.optimize();
ramWriter.close();

fsWriter.close();

Any ideas as to why I am missing the 9 documents?

Thanks.
