SUBJECT: Escaping special characters
DATE: 7 Apr 2005

Hi,

 

Am new to Lucene. I found the following page:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html. At the bottom
of the page there is a section that in order to escape special
characters one would use "\".

 

I have an Indexer that indexes product names. Some product names have
"-" character in them. When I use my search class to search for product
names with - in them it wont find those products.

 

The code below returns no result.

 

public void searchIndex()

{

            try

            {

              SearchManager sm = new
ManagerFactory().getSearchManager();

              

              String searchPath = "Product-search-index";

              sm.initIndex(searchPath);

              sm.buildIndex(this.daoFactory);

              

              String tk = "Chimi-Bose-765";

              if(tk.contains("-"));

                  tk = tk.replaceAll("-" , "\\-");

                  

              if(tk != null && tk.trim().equals("") == false)

                  tk = tk + "*";

              else

                  tk = "";

 

              try

              {

                  Hits hits = sm.search(searchPath, tk);

                    

                  if(hits != null && hits.length() > 0)

                  {

                      int length = hits.length();

                      log.info(length + " result(s) were found matching
your search criteria.");

                      for(int i = 0; i < length; i++)

                      {

                          Document doc = hits.doc(i);

                          log.info("Score: " + hits.score(i) + " Product
id = " + doc.getField("id").stringValue() + " prod name = " +
doc.getField("name").stringValue());

                      }

                  }

                  else

                      log.info("No results were found matching your
search.");

              }

              catch(IOException ex)

              {

                  ex.printStackTrace();

              }

              catch(Exception ex)

              {

                  log.info("No results were found matching your
search.");

              }

            }

            catch (Exception ex)

            {

                  ex.printStackTrace();

                  Assert.fail();

            }

}
