SUBJECT: Question regarding boosting
DATE: 20 May 2005

Hi,

I wanted to know what method would be the best way to do something that
I am describing below.

I am creating an index of all my products and categories. While
indexing, I am creating the following documents for my products and
categories:

Product:
		doc.add(Field.UnIndexed("id", (String)obj[0]));
		doc.add(Field.Keyword("entity","product"));
		doc.add(Field.Text("name", name));
		doc.add(Field.Text("content", content));

Category:
		doc.add(Field.UnIndexed("id", (String)obj[0]));
		doc.add(Field.Keyword("entity","category"));
		doc.add(Field.Text("name", name));
		doc.add(Field.Text("content", content));

As you can see above the id is stored to retrieve the objects from the
database. The entity field distinguishes whether I want to carry out my
search on products or categories. The content field is a combination of
the name and description of the product and category. The name field is
the name of the product or the name of the category.

My searches and indexing works great.

This is how I am searching:

	Query query1 =
QueryParser.parse(queryString,"content",analyzer);
		
	Term term = null;
	if(entity.equals("product"))
	  term = new Term("entity","product");
	else
	if(entity.equals("category"))
	  term = new Term("entity","category");
		  
	TermQuery query2 = new TermQuery(term); 
	BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
	bq.add(query1, true, false);
	bq.add(query2, true, false);
		
	return indexSearcher.search(bq);

As you can see above I am using the content and entity fields to do my
search and everything works fine. What I want to do now is that I want
to boost the results such that if the query matches the name field it
gives a higher rank. How do I do this?

For example adding something like this:
	...
	Query query3 = QueryParser.parse(queryString,"name",analyzer);
	query3.setBoost(2);
	...
	...
	bq.add(query3, true, false);

When I do the above, I print a toString on my final Boolean query which
is:

	+content:radio +entity:category +name:radio^2.0

When I am doing my search for "products", lets say, how do I tell lucene
that - "Show me all products such that the results are ordered in such a
way that if a product's name matches the querystring more it gets a
higher relevance"

So the relevance should be in the following order:

1. Product name matches more - more relevance.
2. Product content matches - relevance is more but less than the
relevance given to product name in 1.

Any ideas?

Thanks.
