Hi Steve,

If I understand you right, I could use something like the Keyword 
analyzer to tokenize the entire stream as a single token and store that 
in the index. I could definitely the keyword analyzer while indexing 
this particular field "categoryNames".

Now my questions is on how to search and boost this since this is part 
of a bigger boolean query in my case.

My typical query actually looks like:

+(+content:digit +content:camera) +entity:product +(title:"digit 
camera"~2^40.0 ((title:digit title:camera)^10.0) content:"digit 
camera"~2^20.0 (content:digit content:camera) categoryNames:"digit 
camera"^80.0)

As you can see i was trying to do a phrase query on the categoryNames 
field and boosting it by 80.0.
Also I am using the potter stemming filter to stem while searching. (I 
do this while indexing as well). If I go with the KeywordAnalyzer 
approach I can index the categoryNames field using this analyzer .

Would I be using the QueryParser to create my query and specify the 
keyword analyzer to it while searching on categoryNames ? (and then make 
that query part of my global boolean query?)

-Thanks.
