Hi,

The 20000 products I mentioned are 20000 rows. I get the products in
bulk by using a limit clause. 

I am using hibernate with MySQL server on a 2.8GHz, 1.00GB Ram machine. 

I am baffled that 1.2 or 1.5 million records are being indexed in 20
minutes compared to the 20000 records I am indexing in 22 minutes. One
possibility is that the hardware you guys are using is much better. I do
not know what else can cause the indexing to be so slow. Where am I
going wrong with this?

This is the gist of what I am doing in my indexer for all products:

Product prod = list.next();
Document doc = new Document();
String name = prod.getName();
Description desc
=(Description)prod.getDescriptions().get(Description.LONG);
String longDesc = null, shortDesc = null, content = null;
			
if(desc != null) 
  longDesc = desc.getText();
else
  longDesc = "";
			
desc = (Description)prod.getDescriptions().get(Description.SHORT);
if(desc != null)
  shortDesc = desc.getText();
else
  shortDesc = "";
			
content = name + " " + shortDesc + " " + longDesc + " ";
	
doc.add(Field.UnIndexed("id", prod.getId() + ""));
doc.add(Field.Keyword("entity","product"));
doc.add(Field.Text("name", name));
doc.add(Field.Text("shortDescription", (shortDesc.equals("") ? "" :
shortDesc)));
doc.add(Field.Text("longDescription", (longDesc.equals("") ? "" :
longDesc)));
doc.add(Field.Text("content", content));
	
try
{
	writer.addDocument(doc);
}
catch (IOException e)
{
	log.error("Error adding document: " + e.getMessage());
}

Where could I be slowing down the indexing process? Is it because I am
indexing the longDescription as a Field.Text? (longDescription could
have a fair amount of text averaging about 4000 words).

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Mufaddal.

Agree. We run an index with about 2.5 million documents and around 30 
fields. The indexing itself of 20000 items should only take a few 
seconds on a reasonably fast machine.
