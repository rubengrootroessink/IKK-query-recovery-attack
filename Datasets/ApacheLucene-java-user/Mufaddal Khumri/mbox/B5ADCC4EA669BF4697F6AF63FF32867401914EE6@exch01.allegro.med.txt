SUBJECT: de pluralization
DATE: 5 Aug 2005

Hello,

I am just posting this question out here since this might be a common
problem and some of you might have good pointers.

Is there algorithms/api built into lucene that would help de pluralize
words while indexing and/or while searching the index? Are there
analyzers that do this already?

There is tons of academic work on going in this area and I was wondering
the best way to solve this problem. We have ideas and heuristics
ourseleves, but would love input from the community here since this
might be a common problem.

Any pointers/ideas on this?

Thank you,
Mufaddal.
