SUBJECT: StandardAnalyzer .. stemming
DATE: 17 Feb 2006

The SnowBallAnalyzer seems to offer stemming. The StandardAnalyzer on 
the other hand has a bunch of other niceness. What is the best practice 
of leveraging both these analyzers while indexing and searching? Do I 
chain these up somehow and if so what apis do i look at for doing so? Do 
i implement my own analyzer and use both these two process the tokens?

Thanks,
