SUBJECT: get results by relevance, limiting results and then sort the results by some criterion
DATE: 21 Feb 2006

When I do a search for example on "batteries" i get 1200+ results. I 
would like to show the user lets say 300. I can do that by only 
extracting the first 300 hits (sorted by decreasing relevance by 
default) and displaying those to the user.

Now on the search results page, I have a drop down box that lets the 
user sort the results by price. When the user selects the "Sort by price 
low to high", i would like to be able to sort the same 300 hits I got 
above (sorted by decreasing relevance by default) by price.

Essentially I want to be able to sort the first 300 relevant search 
results by price. (in other words I would like to be able to get search 
results by relevance, limit the results and sort the results by some 
criterion).

What would be a good way to do this in lucene?

-Thanks.
