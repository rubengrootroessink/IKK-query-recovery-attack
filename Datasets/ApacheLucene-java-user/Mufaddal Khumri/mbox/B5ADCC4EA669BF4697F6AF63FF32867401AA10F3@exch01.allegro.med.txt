The way you update a document in lucene is by deleting the current one
and adding a new one.

Subject: Update or Delete Document for Lucene 1.4.x

Hi All,

I need to implement the ability to update one document within a Lucene 
collection.

I haven't been able to find anything in the API.  Is there a way to 
update one document or delete a document so that I can add an update?

Thank You
