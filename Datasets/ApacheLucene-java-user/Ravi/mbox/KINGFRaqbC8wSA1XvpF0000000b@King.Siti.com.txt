SUBJECT: Retriving  the data from lucene
DATE: 14 Dec 2005

Thanks Erik,
I have already have the copy of the book and I am referencing  the book to
solve the problems .You have given very nice examples to solve the problems.
I am going on reading this book to solve my problems .

But I still have following problems . 

1) I want to store all the details of the my data in the lucene and I want
to retrieve from the lucene than storing in the database and retrieve that
from database .Is this technique is good or bad  or any other solution to
this type of  problem  Please suggest me.

2) I have one more problem is I want to retrieve the max 1000 docs from the
search. How can I solve this problem .

3) I want to display page by page max 100. 
	a) load all the data at a time and store in temp location and
display 			1-100 ,101-200 and so on.... 900-1000.
	b)  load only first 1-00 and whenever user clicks next 100 I want to
display next hundred by loading or searching again..
  I am not able to figure out how to get the details like this.. Could you
please help to solve this problem . Please I need to submit to my Seniors on
this weekend... I want to have really good solution which can not take much
time in terms of performance... I am waiting for your kind reply

Thanks
     Ravi

Ravi,

A few great starting points... the code from http:// 
www.lucenebook.com (and it wouldn't hurt my feelings if you picked up  
a copy of the book itself too :), the examples from the many articles  
that have been written on Lucene, and last but not least, the unit  
tests of Lucene itself which is a great place to learn the API.
