SUBJECT: new segment for each document
DATE: 10 Feb 2005

How can I create a new index segment for each new document? The reason
for doing this is I want to be able to retrieve a document as soon as it
is added. I tried setting the minMergeFactor on the writer to one. But
it did not work.

Thanks in advance,
Ravi.
