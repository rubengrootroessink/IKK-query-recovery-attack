DATE: 9 Dec 2004

I'm sorry I don't think I articulated my question well. We use a date
filter to sort the search results. This works fine when te user provides
some search criteria. But if he gives an empty search criteria, we need
to return all the documents in the index in the given date range sorted
by date. So I was looking for a query that returns me all documents in
the index and then I want to apply the date filter on it.

Of course.  Have a look at the IndexReader API.
