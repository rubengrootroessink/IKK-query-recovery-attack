Thanks. I was looking for an o/s independent way of copying. Probably I
can use BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream classes to copy the
index to a different location.

You could lock your index for writes, then copy the file using operating
system copy commands.

Another way would be to lock your index, make a filesystem snapshot,
then unlock your index.  You can then safely copy the snapshot without
interupting further index operations.
