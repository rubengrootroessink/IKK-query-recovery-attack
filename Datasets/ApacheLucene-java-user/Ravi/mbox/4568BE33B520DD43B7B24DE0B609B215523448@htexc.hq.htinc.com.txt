SUBJECT: Index delete failing
DATE: 6 Dec 2004

 Hi 
 We need to delete a lucene index from our application using
java.io.file.delete(). We are closing the indexWriter and even all the
index searchers on that folder. But a call to delete returns false.
There is no lock on the index directory. Interesting thing is that the
deletable and segments files are getting removed. But the rest of the
.cfs are not. Has somebody had similar problem? 

Thanks in advance,
Ravi.
