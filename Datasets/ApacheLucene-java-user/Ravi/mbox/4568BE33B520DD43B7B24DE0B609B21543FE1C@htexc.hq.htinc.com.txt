SUBJECT: Searching against index in memory
DATE: 28 Oct 2004

If I have a document set of 10,000 docs and my merge factor is 1000, for
every 1000 documents, Lucene creates a new segment. By the time Lucene
indexes 4500 documents, index will have 4000 documents on the disk and
index for 500 documents is stored in memory. How can I search against
this index at the same time from a different JVM? I can access the 4000
docs on the disk. But what about those in the memory on the indexing
box? Is there a way to do this? 

Thanks
Ravi.
