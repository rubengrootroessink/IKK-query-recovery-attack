Hi 

 

 

I want to find out the intersection of two hits objects  please help me

 

 

Hits hits1 = Searcher.searh(strQuery1); 

Hits hits2 = Searcher.searh(strQuery2);

 

 

Now In hits1 contains records numbers 3,4 ,5,6 and 

       Hits2 contains records numbers 3,6,8,9

Now I need a solution which can give the hits object which contains  3,6
records
