DATE: 13 Feb 2006

Hi ,


I have implemented by using query "mergeBooleanQueries" method... in this
approach I have created one POJO class of RefineQuery which contains one
variable called Query and I will set whenever I get a search..
And next time if it is a refined search I will merge current query with  the
refinedquery object and get new query and pass to lucene and set the new
query to refined search object .... this is working fine.. let me know if
have any further ideas or any new technique to implement refined search



if(objSearchParameters.isBSearchInSearch()){
     	Query q2		=
Query.mergeBooleanQueries(new Query[]{ 	objRefineQuery.getQuery(),
booleanQuery });
          	objRefineQuery.setQuery(q2);
    	hits 	= 	 searcher.search(q2);
            }else{
          	objRefineQuery.setQuery(booleanQuery);
	hits	= searcher.search(booleanQuery); 
            }







public class RefineQuery {

	private Query   query = null;

	
	public Query getQuery() {
		return query;
	}


	public void setQuery(Query query) {
		this.query = query;
	}


	public String toString(){
	  return query.toString();	
	}
	
}

Subject: Suggesting refine searches with Lucene

Hi,

I am trying to suggest refine searches for my Lucene search. For
example, if a search turned out too many searches, it would list a
number of document title subsequences that occurred frequently in the
results of the previous search, as possible candidates for refining
the search.

Does anyone know the right/any approach to implementing this in a
Lucene-based search app?

Thanks.
