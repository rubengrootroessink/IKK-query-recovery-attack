SUBJECT: weights on multi index searches
DATE: 27 Oct 2004

Can I give weights on different indexes when I search against multiple
indexes. The final score of a document should be a linear combination of
the weights on each index and the individual score for that index. Is
this possible in Lucene?
 
 
Thanks
Ravi.
