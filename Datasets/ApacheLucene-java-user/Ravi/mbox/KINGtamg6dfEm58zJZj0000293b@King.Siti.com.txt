SUBJECT: :using different analyzers for indexing and searching:
DATE: 3 Mar 2006

Hi ,

 

I am using Standard Analyzer with stop words when I am trying to index my
documents.. but when I want to support wildcard functionality it is not
working with Standard Analyzer since it ignores the Punctuation character
where * and ? are also part of Punctuations . So I want to use another
analyzer for searcher. If I do like this will I get my required result or
not.. Most importantly I would like to know is this a  good practice to have
two different analyzers for two operations or same analyzer..  

 

 

 

Thanks
