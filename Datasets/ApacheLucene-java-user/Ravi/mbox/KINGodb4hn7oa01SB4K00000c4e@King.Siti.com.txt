Hi Luceners,

  

  This is the my problem . Can any body give the solution for this one..

 

 

I am going to implement for the company which is going to Support ASP
(Application Service Provider )  model. 

 

In this model , around 200 companies are going to register with us and add
there documents and searches them . 

Now the problem is shall I maintain individual index files for each company
or maintain single index file for all the companies.

 

 

If I maintain  individual index files then I need to create 200 searcher
objects for them because. each index should be searched..

 

But if I maintain single index file , I can have one single index searcher
but I need to add the condition for each document. And more over in feature
if any body needed there own data we can not provide them .. so please tell
me which model can help us to solve this problem.. the key point in this
application is add/modify/delete will occur very frequently . Please help me
.... I am waiting for your feed back

 

 

Thanks
