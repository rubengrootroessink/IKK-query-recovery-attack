SUBJECT: :Lucene 1.9 RC1 is not working properly with older version of Code 1.43:
DATE: 22 Feb 2006

Hi ,

 

I  got the latest source code of Lucene 1.9 RC1 and modified my code
according to that by removing the deprecated methods. But once I have
updated to this version the search is not working at all.. if I try with
luke it is working fine but If I try with program it is not returning any
error .. and result.. please let me know If any problems are there with this
version. If that contains  I will replace with old version1.4.3 which is
working fine..

 

 

Thanks
