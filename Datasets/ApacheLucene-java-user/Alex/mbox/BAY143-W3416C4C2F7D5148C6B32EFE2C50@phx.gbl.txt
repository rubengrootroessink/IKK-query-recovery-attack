SUBJECT: slow FieldCacheImpl.createValue
DATE: 19 May 2008

hi,
I have a ValueSourceQuery that makes use of a stored field. The field contains roughly 27.27
million untokenized terms.
The average length of each term is 8 digits.
The first search always takes around 5 minutes, and it is due to the createValue function
in the FieldCacheImpl.
The search is executed on a RAID5 disk array of 15k rpm. 


any hints as to make the fieldcache createvalue faster ? I have tried a bigger cache size
for BufferedIndexReader (8kb or more) ,
but the time it took for createValue to execute is still in the realm of 4, 5 minutes. 


thanks
