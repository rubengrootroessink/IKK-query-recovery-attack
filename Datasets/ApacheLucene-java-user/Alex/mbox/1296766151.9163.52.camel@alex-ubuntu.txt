SUBJECT: Re: Storing payloads without term-position and frequency
DATE: 3 Feb 2011

Hello Grant,

I am currently storing the first term instance only because I just index
each token for an article once. What I want to achieve is an index for
versioned document collections like wikipedia (See this paper
http://www.cis.poly.edu/suel/papers/archive.pdf). 

In detail I create on the first level (Lucene) a document for one
wikipedia article containing all distinct terms of its versions. On the
second level (payloads) I store the frequency information corresponding
to each article version and its terms. If I search now I can find an
article by its term and through the term and its payload I receive
informations about the other versions and how often a token occured (In
my case with one term the payload pos is always 1!). So I look on the
first level and pick only the information from the second level which I
need. By this I can avoid storing informations several times because
most wikipedia versions are very similar (in term context).

This is working so far and I just want to reduce my index size but I
don't know how much I can save by disabling term freqs/pos.
I hope I could explain the problem a little bit. If not just tell me I
try to explain it again. :)

Best regards
Alex

PS: I am currently looking for a bedroom in New York, Brooklyn (Park
Slope or near NYU Poly). Maybe somebody rents a room from 15 Feb until
15 April. :)

there is a way to hack Lucene for it.  You could, I suppose, just store the payload for the
first instance of the term.

a payload when Lucene already does it (and it probably does it more efficiently)
