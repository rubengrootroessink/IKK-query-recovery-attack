SUBJECT: Re: Need a way to set a result limit on a particular field
DATE: 15 Jun 2005

Thanks Tony and Erik for the replies. The trick is we don't know the
hosts that will be returned in advance, we just don't want more than 3
from any one host. It's not unlike searching on Google where you might
see a link that says "More results from foo.com". We essentially want
to discard any results > 3 for any one host. In some of our searches
we might get high scores on 20 or 30 documents, but we don't want to
show page after page from the same host, we'd rather limit it to 3
from each for more diversity.

I may have to use a brute force approach using HitCollector as Tony
suggests. I was hoping to avoid the HitCollector, but there may be no
other way right now.

Many thanks,
-Jay
