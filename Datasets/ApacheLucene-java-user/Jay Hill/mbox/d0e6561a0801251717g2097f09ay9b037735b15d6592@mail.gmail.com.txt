SUBJECT: Stemmers remove part of a query when using QueryParser
DATE: 26 Jan 2008

I have added stemming Analyzer to my indexing and searching. I've tried both
Porter and KStem, have gotten very good results with both with KStem being
the best. The only problem is that, when analyzing on the search end using
QueryParser part of my query is being removed by QueryParser:

+pub:game +__type:pub +pubType:1
becomes
+pub:game +__type:pub

It seems to be the number "1" causing the problem. "+pub:game +__type:pub
+pubType:foo" will work fine.

I've tried escaping the "1" like this: "+pub:game +__type:pub +pubType:\1",
but still get the same result.

Is there a way that I can avoid having QueryParser remove that part of my
query?

Thanks,
-Jay
