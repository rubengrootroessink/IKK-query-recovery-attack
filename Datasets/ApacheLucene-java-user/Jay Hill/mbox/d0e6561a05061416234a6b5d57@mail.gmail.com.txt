SUBJECT: Need a way to set a result limit on a particular field
DATE: 14 Jun 2005

I have a need to limit my Hits returned based on one of the indexed
fields. This is a web application and we want to limit the number of
hits from any one host. We have a field named "host_id" and I'd like
to be able to limit my results to no more than three results for any
one host_id.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
-Jay
