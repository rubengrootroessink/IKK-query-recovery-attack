Thank you both, Umesh Prasad and Anshum.
You've been a great help.

Hi Pelit,
Firstly, number of words that match a query in a document is not term frequency. You may get
some more idea on the terminologies used in search at http://www.miislita.com/term-vector/term-vector-3.html

Looking at what you're trying to achieve, a few solutions to you would be.
Below, I am assuming your query to be for terms "A B":
1. Look at phrase queries and setting a high slop value so matches like "A B" are weighted
more than "A .... B" (separated by a few positions).
2. Also you could have a custom similarity (advanced) http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/SimilarityDelegator.html
and
use the coord value.
3. For wildcard searches, a brute force mechanism could be, you may have an or query  (finally
the query is expanded to an OR query anyways) for RING OR
RING* and boost the former part.

Looking at your current query seems like you'd need more understanding on lucene and getting
a copy of "Lucene In Action 2nd Ed<http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/>."
would be  a good idea for you and everyone in your position.
Hope that helps.
