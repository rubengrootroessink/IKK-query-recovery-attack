SUBJECT: Running query text through an Analyzer without QueryParser?
DATE: 30 Jul 2007

Following up on my recent question. It has been suggested to me that I can
run the query text through an Analyzer without using the QueryParser. For
example, if I know what field to be searched I can create a PrefixQuery or
WildcardQuery, but still want to process the search text with the same
Analyzer that did the indexing. How do I run a query through an Analyzer
without using the QueryParser... is this possible?
