Thanks Erick, I'll try this. My only other question here though, is what if
they specify an incomplete octet of an address? For example, I want '
192.168.10' to match 192.168.10.1 and 192.168.100.1. How can I do this
without wildcards, is there a way to put a PrefixQuery into the Span Query?

Sorry if I don't make any sense
