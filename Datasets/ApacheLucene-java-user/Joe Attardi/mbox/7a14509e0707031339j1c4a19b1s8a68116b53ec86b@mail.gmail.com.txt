SUBJECT: Re: IndexWriter.updateDocument(Term, Document) not removing old Document?
DATE: 3 Jul 2007

Update on my problem.. it looks like I am having the same problem with
deleteDocuments that I am with updateDocument. Not sure why it's not
working, though. I'm using the StandardAnalyzer, as I mentioned. Are there
any other things that I might want to check that would keep this from
working?

Thanks...
