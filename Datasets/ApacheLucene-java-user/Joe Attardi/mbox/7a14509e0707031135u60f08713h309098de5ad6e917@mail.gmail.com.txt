Hi Erick,

I'm guessing that your problem is what gets indexed. What analyzer

I am using the StandardAnalyzer. When I do a test query using Luke, it
returns the object I'm looking for. The query I use is:

id:"com.mycompany.myapp.FooBar 142"

and it returns my FooBar document with id 142.

I am creating a new IndexSearcher object every time I do a search.
But also, when I run the same query again in Luke after I do the update,
after reloading the index in Luke, it returns both objects.
