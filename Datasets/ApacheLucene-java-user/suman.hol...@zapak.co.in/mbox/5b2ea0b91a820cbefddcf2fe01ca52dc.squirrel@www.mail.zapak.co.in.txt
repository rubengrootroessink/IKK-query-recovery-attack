SUBJECT: using lucene from apache threads
DATE: 23 Mar 2010


Hi,

I am using Apache threads to invoke a cgi , which is opening and closing
the index searcher for every thread.
for all threads , m making searches. Does that mean , for every thread
the indexes would be loaded on to memory for searching.
coz, then its very inefficient.

Is there any method by which we can conserve the instance between the
Apache threads.

Thanks and regards,
Suman
