SUBJECT: lucene scanning
DATE: 26 Aug 2010



hi ,

1. whether any search query, will scan for all documents in the
lucene indexes 

2. 

I want to search query faster.So I thought of if I
could reduce the number of docs , lucene needs to search for , when given
some search parameters. It would act lil faster. 

Can we make subset
(subindexes) or say give some subset which should be scanned ,so as the
search performs efficiently (small subset to scan , faster ll b the
result)
Do not want to use filtered query as it will search twice the
indexes and I simply do not have requirement to scan again on the basis of
set of parameters again. I mean every query will be a unique one .


Thanks,
Suman
