SUBJECT: Re: query: order of search
DATE: 2 Apr 2010

Hello Erick,

I was trying to optimise the searching.
Basically my data is like field1 has less no of docs matching compared to
field2, which has larget sets.

So if search goes by order to order, then i can make field1 to be search
first, (by making  order of boolean query such  )and from thr the docs
result set could be searched for field2. 
So number of docs to be matched will be less.
I am not using filters or any caching since the search is unique everytime
acc to parameter, and its using boolean query


or is the searching takes place like searches each doc for  field1="abc"
and field2="def" then get resultset

I hope I am clear in explaining my query. 

thanks,
Suman
