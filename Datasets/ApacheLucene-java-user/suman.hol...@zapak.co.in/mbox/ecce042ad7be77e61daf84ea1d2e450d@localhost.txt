Hello , 

Can we use subset of documents , for searching . 

Lets say I
have hash map of 

P1 -1,2,3,4 

P2 - 3,4,5 

P3-7,5,3 

Now I have an
documents in lucene index stored as  

1-P1 

2-P1 

3-P1,P2,P3 

4-P1,P2


5-P2,P3 

7-P3 

.. 

.. 

when i search docs with P2 I get 3,4,5 

Now I
want my search to b restricted to just 3,4,5 doc only. where by I can
search only these docs for further parameters. 

1. How to go abt it. 

2.
Is there any other seraching mechanism I should use, or Lucene is better
fit? 

3. should i keep my hash map also in lucene indexes and is then thr
a method to link it to another lucene indexes. 

Regards, 

Suman
