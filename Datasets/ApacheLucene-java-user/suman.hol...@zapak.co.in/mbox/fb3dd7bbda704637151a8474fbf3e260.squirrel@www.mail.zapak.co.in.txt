SUBJECT: how lucene search works in memory
DATE: 23 Mar 2010

Hello,


I am trying for optimizing the searching by putting indexes onto
memory. RAMDirectory is not option for me, as I am transferring indexes
built to slave system to use.
So if u could let me know that how to place my indexes onto memory(m
thinking of using mmap) .For this I wanna know how exactly the lucene
searches indexes. Does it put all of the indexes onto memory, when we open
index searcher instance and then does searching.

Curious to know how the lucene searches actually work.Can u get me the
link.


Thanks and regards,
Suman
