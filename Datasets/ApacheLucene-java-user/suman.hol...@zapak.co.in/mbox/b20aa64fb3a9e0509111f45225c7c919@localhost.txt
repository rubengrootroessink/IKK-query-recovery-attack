SUBJECT: subset query :query filter or boolean query
DATE: 14 Jul 2010



Hi , 

I have 4 query search fields. 

case 1 : if i use one search
field to make a query filter and then use the query filter to search on
other 3 fields so as to reduce the searching docs subset. 

case 2: i use
all query parameters using boolean query , whole of index will be searched.


Which of the two approach will give better performance.Or is there ne
other approach to do this . 

Also 

Can we use subset of documents , for
searching . 

Lets say I have hash map of 

P1 -1,2,3,4 

P2 - 3,4,5


P3-7,5,3 

Now I have an documents in lucene index stored as  

1-P1


2-P1 

3-P1,P2,P3 

4-P1,P2 

5-P2,P3 

7-P3 

.. 

.. 

when i search
docs with P2 I get 3,4,5 

Now I want my search to b restricted to just
3,4,5 doc only. where by I can search only these docs for further
parameters. 

1. How to go abt it. 

2. Is there any other seraching
mechanism I should use, or Lucene is better fit? 

3. should i keep my hash
map also in lucene indexes and is then thr a method to link it to another
lucene indexes. 

regards, 

Suman
