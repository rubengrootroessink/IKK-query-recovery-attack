SUBJECT: Re: query: order of search
DATE: 1 Apr 2010


Query I

its written "to do a "search within search", so that the second search is
constrained by the results of the first query"
we can use boolean query.
So doesn't it mean the order of query ll be preserved

give me an simple example of how the docs get searched in lucene.
10 docs with 3 fields to b searched
so ll it search for field1 for all 10 docs..and the result set docs ll b
then searched for field2....and so far...
or is it something else..



thanks,
Suman
