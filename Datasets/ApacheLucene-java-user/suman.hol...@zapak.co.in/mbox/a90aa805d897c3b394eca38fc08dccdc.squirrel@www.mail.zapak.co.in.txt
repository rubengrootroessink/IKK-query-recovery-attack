Hello,

Optimising the lucene search

Use combined search field for all text fields instead (or on the top) of
indexing them separately and searching with complex query like
field1:query OR field2:query ... OR fieldN:query

Reducing number of field make indexing and search much faster. Use
combined field instead or on the top of separate fields if needed


Does that mean that while defining structure of lucene doc ,fields (key-val)
should be in the form of

field1_field2:val1_val2
(combining fields at time of indexing itself)

instead of
field1:val1 and field2:val2

for making the search faster


Let me know for both the cases..
CASE 1: field1 and field2 are not related to each other in any ways
CASE 2: field1:field2 is having 1:n relation
eg student : frnds (where student ABC can  have 5 diff frnds)


thanks,
Suman
