SUBJECT: How the Field.Store flag works?
DATE: 16 Mar 2007


I'm using Lucene for indexing my nutch crawls. But I don't really understand
the difference for this flag Field.Store.YES or NO. It seems (using luke) I
still can read some data who were not 'store.YES'. Where are store this data
if it's not in the index? what is better to use for small fields? (and for
medium ones)
thanks to give me some light in my understanding!
