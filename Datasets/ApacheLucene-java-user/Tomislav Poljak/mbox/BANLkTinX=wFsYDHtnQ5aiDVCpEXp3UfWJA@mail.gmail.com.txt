SUBJECT: MultiPhraseQuery slowing down over time in Lucene 3.1
DATE: 2 May 2011

Hi,
after running tests on both MemoryIndex and RAMDirectory based index
in Lucene 3.1, seems MultiPhraseQueries are slowing down over time
(each iteration of executing the same MultiPhraseQueries on the same
doc, seems to require more and more execution time). Are there any
existing/known issues related to the MultiPhraseQuery in Lucene 3.1
which could lead to this performance drop?

Tomislav
