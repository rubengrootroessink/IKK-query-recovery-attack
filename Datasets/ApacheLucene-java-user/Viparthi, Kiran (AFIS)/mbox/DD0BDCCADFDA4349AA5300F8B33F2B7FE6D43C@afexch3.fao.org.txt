Just a comment, I'm not really answering the questions you ask.

I assume you can manipulate your query to remove the significance of
accented characters when doing searches such that Hühnerstall would find
Huhnerstall. 
I achieved this process by removing accents in my searchString and making
sure that the analyzer indexes the document with replacing accents as well.
