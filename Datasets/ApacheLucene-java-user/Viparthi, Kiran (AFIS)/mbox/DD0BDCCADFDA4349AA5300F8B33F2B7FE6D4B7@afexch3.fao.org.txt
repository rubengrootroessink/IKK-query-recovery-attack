Hi,

We archived this by creating a separate index <words> extracting the
complete list of words.
You can also work on the frequency if you are extracting these from other
indexes but could be expensive.
Manipulating the search for doing a fuzzy search in the <words> index would
give you the better list of matching words for spellings.

Kiran.

But this does not ensure that the word really exists in the index. The word 
google does propose however to exist.
