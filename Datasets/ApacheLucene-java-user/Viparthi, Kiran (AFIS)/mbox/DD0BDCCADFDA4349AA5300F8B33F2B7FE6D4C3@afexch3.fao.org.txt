Hi Timo,

I was mentioning to your previous code that you can collect all the text
from term.

IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(ram);
TermEnum te = reader.terms();
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
while(te.next())
{
Term t = te.term();
 sb.append(t.text());
}

And you can get the tokens using StringTokenizer on the sb.toString() and
put them into Map by calculating the occurrences.
As mentioned I didn't use any information from index so I didn't uses any
TokenStream but let me check it out.

Could you provide or point me to some example code on how to get and use 
TokenStream. The API docs are somewhat unclear to me...
