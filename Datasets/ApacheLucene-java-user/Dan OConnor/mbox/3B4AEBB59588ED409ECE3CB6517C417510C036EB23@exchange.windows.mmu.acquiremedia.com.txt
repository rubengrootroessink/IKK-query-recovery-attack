Jeff,
I would suggest not deleting documents off the back of the index unless you can optimize your
index regularly. (Depending on your volume, this could be every day or once a week)

I would suggest having two indexes, one that is "this" week and one that is "last" week and
a multi-index searcher that is aware of the date. When you get to the end of "this" week,
you would delete "last" week's index and create a new "next" week index. 

Regards
Dan

Hi all,

I only want to index the latest one week's data, the previous data can
be deleted. So I'd like to know about lucene's delete performance and
whether it will has impact on the search performance when I do lots of
delete operation in the meantime.  Thanks
