Hi Jamie,

I would appreciate if you could provide details on the hardware/OS you are running this system
on and what kind of search response time you are getting.

As well as how you add email data to your index.

Thanks,
Dan

We have lucene searching across several terabytes of email data and 
there is no problem at all.
