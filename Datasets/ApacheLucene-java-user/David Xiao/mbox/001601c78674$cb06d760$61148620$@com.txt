Consider reduce size of per file. Split them into smaller pieces will definitely help indexer
working faster.

A 50M pure text file is amazing size, very few text files reach that size: 50M. It must be
very reasonable if you have to keep all information in such one big file.

What you think?

But, I am facing the problem even with -Xms 256m and -Xmx 1024m.

Yes, the file was not added to the index because java process was
already using 1156m of memory, which is much higher than the max heap
memory.
But, even after waiting for a few minutes till the memory came below the
max heap value, the index was not responsive (no documents were being
added/deleted in the index).
What could be the reason for this ?

Use java -Xms50m to start your program, that gives a 50M initial heap
size.
The OutofHeapMemory is because the default heap memory is not enough for
your application.

Subject: Adding large files to index

Hello All,

Could any one help me find solution to the following problem ?

I am facing problems while trying to add files of size 50MB to my
application. The application has on-demand indexing of documents in
place.whenever we add a file to our application, we first put the file
details/metadata to our database, then create an encrytpted copy of the
file
in our own filesystem, then extract the content and add it to Lucene
index.
We set Java heap min = 256 M and max = 1024 mb. Extraction & adding to
index
is done in a background thread. Soon, after we extract the document's
content, add it to index and close the index writer, we are getting
OutOfMemory Error (memory used is about 1160mb). Because, the main
thread is
unaware of the exception, it allows users to continue using the
application.
I observed that the write.lock file continues to remain in /var/tmp
directory for about 10 mins, it is not getting cleaned up soon. On
searching, the 50 MB document do not come up in search. But, when I
continue
using my application by deleting some other documents, after adding the
50
MB file, I find that lucene is not getting updated with the recent
changes.
Once, this error occurs lucene is not getting modified/updated even if I
add
a new 10KB file nor delete any file.

Here, is the stack trace

There are about 30 files in the application of which 6-7 are of 50 MB,
and
the remaining are hardly a few KB.

Is the OutFMemory error corrupting the index ? Why is it that the index
is
not responsive to delete operation after the error ?

I waited for 10mins for the lock file to get removed on its own, then
tried
deleting/adding new 10KB files (after memory usage came back within java
max
heap size), still the index is not responsive.

Please let me know the cause and the solution to the problem.



Divya.
