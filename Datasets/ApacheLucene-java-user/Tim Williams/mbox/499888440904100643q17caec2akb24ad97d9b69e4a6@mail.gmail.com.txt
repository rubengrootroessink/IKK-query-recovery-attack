I think this is limited by...

... not being able to [easily] add new fields over time... you'd have
to reindex all documents (to insert the new magic token) just to add a
new field.

... requiring additional manipulation for appendable, updateable
fields... when you append new data to a field, you'd have to go in and
remove the special token.
