SUBJECT: term position in phrase query using queryparser
DATE: 25 Feb 2009

Is there a syntax to set the term position in a query built with
queryparser?  For example, I would like something like:

PhraseQuery q = new PhraseQuery();
q.add(t1, 0);
q.add(t2, 0);
q.setSlop(0);

As I understand it, the slop defaults to 0, but I don't know how to
search for basically two tokens at the same term position using the
queryparser syntax.

Thanks,
--tim
