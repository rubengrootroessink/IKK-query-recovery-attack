When you index the document, add an ID field that is unique.  Then
when you go to update the document the "Term" will be the ID of the
document you wish to update.  For example, you might add a URL as the
unique ID, then to update it might look something like:

writer.update(new Term("id","http://apache.org/lucene/index.htm"), doc)
