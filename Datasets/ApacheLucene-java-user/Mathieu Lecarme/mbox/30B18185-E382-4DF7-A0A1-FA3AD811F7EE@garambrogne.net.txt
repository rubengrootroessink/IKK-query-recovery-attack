SUBJECT: Re: How to implement AJAX search~Lucene Search part?
DATE: 8 Jun 2007

If you do that, you enumerate every terms!!!
If you use a alphabeticaly sorted collection, you can stop, when  
match stop, but, you have to test every terms before matching.
Lucene gives you tools to match begining of a term, just use it!!
