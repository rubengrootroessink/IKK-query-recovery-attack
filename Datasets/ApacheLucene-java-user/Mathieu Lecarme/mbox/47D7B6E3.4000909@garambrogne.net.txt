SUBJECT: Using Lucene from scripting language without any java coding
DATE: 12 Mar 2008

Here is a POC about using Lucene, via Compass, from PHP or Python (other 
languages will come later), with only XML configuration, object 
notation, and native use of scripting language.

http://blog.garambrogne.net/index.php?post/2008/03/11/Using-Compass-without-dirtying-its-hands-with-java

It's look like Solr, but it's different.
Solr
framework: Lucene
serialisation: XML
transport: HTTP via servlet.

Goniomotre
framework : Compass + Spring
serialisation: JSON
transport: Socket via Mina

Other difference, Solr is a mature project with admin pages, caching and 
production ready stuff.
Goniometre is a prototype for Compass fan, wich like XML, and coding 
with any language except Java.

Examples, test and code are available via svn.
