When you've got too many document, you can shard it.
If you're lucky enough, you can split your data in autonomous split,  
but you always can ask multiple index in one search.
You can even split with a modulo or something like that.

With your two index pattern, why don't you use a foreign stored key in  
your dynamic index?
