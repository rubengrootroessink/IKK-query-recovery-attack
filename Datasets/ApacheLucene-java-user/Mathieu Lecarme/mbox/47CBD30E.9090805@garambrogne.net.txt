SUBJECT: Re: Avoid stemming to get exact word in search results
DATE: 3 Mar 2008

There's no syntax to restore stemmed word. Stemming is done while 
reading the news, so the index never knows the complete word.

I submit a patch for that :
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1190

Be careful, rssbandit use .net lucene, not the java version.
