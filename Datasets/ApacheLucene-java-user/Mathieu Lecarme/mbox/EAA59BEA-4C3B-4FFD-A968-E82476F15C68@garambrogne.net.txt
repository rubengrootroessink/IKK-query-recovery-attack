with a ngram size of 3, "files" => fil, ile, les, and "philes" => phi,  
hil, ile, les
you restrict also the size of the word with -1, +1
when you fuzzy search "philes", you are looking for word of size 5, 6  
or 7, wich may contains its ngrams. Lucene query will send you, in  
sorted order, word with most ngrams in commons. You can clean sort  
order with a levenstein distance (to exclude anagram).
If you wont to match "ph" and "f", you have to compute with phonetic  
forms.
