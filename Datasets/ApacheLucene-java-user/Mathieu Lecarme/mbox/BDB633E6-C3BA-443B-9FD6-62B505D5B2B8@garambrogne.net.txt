Compass doesn't index database, but pojo mapped with an orm. Parent  
relation is nice handled.
When a pojo is persisted, compass catch the information and index/ 
remove it with lucene.
There is some troubles when you change something related to a pojo.  
Compass doesn't see that change. They were some works for that, just  
have some try to see if it's works, now.
