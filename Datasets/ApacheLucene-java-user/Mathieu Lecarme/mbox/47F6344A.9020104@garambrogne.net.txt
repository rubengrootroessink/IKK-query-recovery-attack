both. You've got two index, one for your data, one for your Term. The 
second (dictionnary, lexicon ...) uses one Document per Term, and n 
Field for informations like ngram or phonetic. When you search a near 
word, you build data from the word, build a request with this data, and 
sort result with levenstein distance. You've got an ordered list of 
suggestion.

First lucene select candidate, after you pick the best from this list. 
Levenstein distance is only apply is only apply on few words.
