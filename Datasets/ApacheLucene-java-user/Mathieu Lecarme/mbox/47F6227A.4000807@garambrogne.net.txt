Your query is a tree, with BooleanQuery as branch and other query as 
leaf. If you wont to transforma query in "tolerant query", you have to 
change Term query (the leaf), with a "OR"  branch with variant term as leaf.

To find variant of a term, you have to used a list of your Term and 
apply a filter to its to group them. Common filter for that are 
stemming, ngram+levenstein distance, phonetic ...
