SUBJECT: Re: Scaling up to several machines with Lucene
DATE: 28 Jun 2007

Server One handle website
Server Two is a light version of tomcat wich handle Lucene Search

In front, a lighttpd which use server two for /search, and server one
for  all others things

You can add lucene server with round robin in lighttpd with this scheme.

Careful with fault tolerance and index replication.
