Lucen syntax is more pretty.
With movie title indexed as "title", with LowerCaseFilter.


BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
bd.add(new TermQuery(new Term("title", "the lord")), Occur.SHOULD);
bd.add(new TermQuery(new Term("title", "lord of")), Occur.SHOULD);
bd.add(new TermQuery(new Term("title", "of rings")), Occur.SHOULD);
bd.add(new TermQuery(new Term("title", "rings return")), Occur.SHOULD);
bd.add(new TermQuery(new Term("title", "return of")), Occur.SHOULD);
bd.add(new TermQuery(new Term("title", "of king")), Occur.SHOULD);

most word matched, the better score you have.
You should use a thresold (number of common words/word size) or  
something like that to exclude to far title.
