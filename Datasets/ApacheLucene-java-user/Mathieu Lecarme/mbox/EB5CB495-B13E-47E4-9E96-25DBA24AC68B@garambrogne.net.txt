SUBJECT: Re: How to implement AJAX search~Lucene Search part?
DATE: 8 Jun 2007

have a look of opensearch.org specification, your self-completion  
will work with IE7 and Firefox 2.
JSON serialization is quicker than XML stuff.
Be careful to limit the number of responses.
A search in "test*" works very well in my project with ten thousands  
of documents.
Begin completion only when you have 3 letters or more, less gives you  
too many words.
