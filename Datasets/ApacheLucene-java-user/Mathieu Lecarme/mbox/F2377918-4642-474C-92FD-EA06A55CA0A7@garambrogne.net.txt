fuzzy are simply not indexed.
If you wont to search quickly with fuzzy search, you should index word  
and their ngrams, it's the "do you mean" pattern.

you first select used word wich share ngram with the query word, the  
distance is computed with levenstein, and you use this word as a  
synonym.
