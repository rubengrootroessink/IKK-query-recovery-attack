You sort only "collection", wich are 300.

first step, you search query with lucene
Map<Integer, Collection> collecs wich come from any persisted stuff.
Collection implement Sortable.
Set bags = new HashSet<Collection>();
iterate over hit
bags.add(collecs.get(hit.getTheIdOfTheCollection));

you've got a bag with at most 300 elements
you can sort it with strange rules.
