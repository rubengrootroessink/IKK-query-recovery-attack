some tools exist for finding duplicated parts in document.
You split document in phrase, and build ngram with word. If you wont  
complete phrase, work with all words, for a partial, work with 5  
words ngram, for example. ngram list is convert to hash, and hash is  
used as an indexed Field for the document. With this trick, you can  
use phrase as you use to do with word, without using too much space.

I'm not sure to be as clear as I want.
