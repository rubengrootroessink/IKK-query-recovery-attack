SUBJECT: Cleaning up the james filesystem ( i.e. /var/mail/spam)
DATE: 18 Nov 2006

I was tarring up a james installation, and there are an awful lot of 
files in the /var/mail/spam, the /var/mail/address-error, and some other 
folders.  Is this stuff that james deletes on a regular basis, or should 
I do a regular "pruning" of the different files that james stores?

Does anyone have any experience or thoughts on this?  I am thinking that 
I will write a couple of ant scripts and run them via cron to clean up 
this stuff.

Thanks.
