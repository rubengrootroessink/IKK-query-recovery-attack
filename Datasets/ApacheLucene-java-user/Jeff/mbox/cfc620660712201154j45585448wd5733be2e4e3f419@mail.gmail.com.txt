SUBJECT: Hit Count per Document
DATE: 20 Dec 2007

I don't care about score, but I do care about the # of times a query was hit
within a document? example:

the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
 the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
 the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
 the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
the slow brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

If I searched for "quick brown", is there a way I could see that it was hit
4 times within the document?

Thanks,
Jeff
