SUBJECT: replace values in index
DATE: 12 Jul 2007

I have documents with lots of text. Part of the text is in the following
format:

word1,word2,word3,word4,word5

I am currently using the StandardAnalyzer and everything is working great
with the other data, except I can't query for 'word3' as a ',' isn't a token
seperator. Is there an easy way to add ',' as a token seperator?

Thanks,

-Jeff
