SUBJECT: Lucene Query Field Info
DATE: 9 Jun 2009

I construct a boolean query to search a term in each of the field of
the index. Once I retrieve the hits, is it possible to retrieve which
field matched to the particular term.
For example:
I have fields A B C with data a b c.
A B C
a  b a

Then I search for A:a B:a C:a and get a hit.
Can I tell which field(s) the hit occured in?
I could do separate searches as per the field but that would take more
time and also upset my ranking.
