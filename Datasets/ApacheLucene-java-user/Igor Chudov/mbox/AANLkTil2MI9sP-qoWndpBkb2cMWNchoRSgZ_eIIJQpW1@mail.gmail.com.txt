SUBJECT: Best way to use Lucene from perl
DATE: 9 Jul 2010

I am extremely impressed with Lucene and would like to thank Naveen
and Otis for your kind help.

I am not really a Java person, I am a perl and C++ guy and my website
is done with mod_perl.

So, my obvious question is what perl implementation of lucene access
you would recommend.

It would seem that PLucene is an abandoned project, and I should
instead use Lucene module.

Am I on the right track with this?

Do people implement a Lucene server that they query from apache
mod_perl scripts, or do they instead just use Lucene access from many
webserver processes running in parallel?

Thanks a lot.
