Hello, lucene-user.

I have index with many documents, more than 40 Mil.
Each document has DateField (It is time stamp of document)

I need the most recent results only. I use single instance of IndexSearcher.
When I perform sorted search on this index:
      Sort sort = new Sort();
      sort.setSort( new SortField[] { new SortField ("modified", SortField.STRING, true) }
);
      Hits hits =
        searcher.search(QueryParser.parse("good", "content",
                                          StandardAnalyzer()), sort);

then search speed is not good.

Today I have tried search without "sort by modified", but with sort by
Relevance. Speed was much better!

I think that Sort by DateField is very slow. Maybe I do something
wrong about this kind of sorted search? Can you give me advices about
this?

Thanks.
                                          
Yura Smolsky.
