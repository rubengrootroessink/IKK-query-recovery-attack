SUBJECT: InderWriter.optimize()
DATE: 9 Dec 2004

Hello, lucene-user.

I used FSDirectory as storage for index. And I have used optimize()
method of IndexWriter to optimize index for faster access.

Now I use DbDirectory (Berkley DB) as storage. Does it make sense to
use optimize method on index stored in this storage?..

What does optimize do actually?
