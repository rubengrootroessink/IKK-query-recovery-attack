SUBJECT: Re[2]: ParallelMultiSearcher and docFreq
DATE: 15 Sep 2006

Hello, Ronald.

What I have found that nothing except createWeight uses that
docFreqs(Term[]) method...
Maybe I need to parallelize it... But I dont understand something.

When does Multisearcher.createWeight() is being called, b/c only this method
used docFreqs and this method creates HashMap of docFreqs of terms? Is
this method is being user for rewrite of query inside of
ParallelMultiSearher?

Also this method calls docFreqs of RemoteSearchables, I should be
receiving calls of docFreqs(Term[]) to the RemoteSearchable objects,
but I do not. Can somebody explain this?

And from which place am I receive those multiple calls of docFreq
method?

Thanks.

HRCLD> You might have to extend the ParallelMultiSearcher and create a threaded
