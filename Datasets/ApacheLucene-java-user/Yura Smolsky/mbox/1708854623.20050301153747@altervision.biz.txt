It is safe to share one instance between many threads and it should be
safe to drop old object to GC.

But I have discovered one strange fact. When you have indexSearcher on
big index, so IndexSearcher object takes a lot of memory (900Mb) and
when you create new IndexSearcher after deletion of all references to
old IndexSearcher then memory consumed my old IndexSearcher will not be
ever freed.
What can community answer on this strange fact?
