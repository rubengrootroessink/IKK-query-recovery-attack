I will try when PrefixFilter will be added in Lucene. b/c I have some
technical issues and I use PyLucene. But on my local index of 400 mb is
it not slower than usual :)

What is the "sorted list of the first "N""?

CH> At some point you just have to wonder if it's fast enough?

:)

CH> how long does a typically sorted query take for you right now?

it takes 0.2 up to 0.4. this is only searching without iterating over
hits and fetching docs.

CH> how many documents are in your index?

about 30 millions

CH> how many matches do you typically have?

it varies greatly. from 7k to 100k
