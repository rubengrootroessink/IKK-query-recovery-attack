SUBJECT: highlighter and phrase search
DATE: 10 Mar 2005

Hello, java-user.

I have two documents:
1. content:A V A B
2. content:A B C D
When I do search for content:"A B" (exact phrase search) and
StandardAnalyzer(),
when I use Highlighter I receive following highlighted results:

1. _A_ V _A B_
2. _A B_ C D

Actually "A" in the first result does not need to be highlighted b/c
requested keyword was "A B".

Is this a bug or I do not understand something?

Yura Smolsky.
