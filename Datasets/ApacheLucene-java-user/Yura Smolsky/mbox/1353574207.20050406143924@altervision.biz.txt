DATE: 6 Apr 2005

Hello, Erik.

I have very large index (200Gb) with big amount of documents.
I have field "author", which stores name and this fields is tokenized,
indexed, stored.

This field contains values of following examples:
"John"
"John Doe"
"Bill"
"Bill Gates"

I do not want to reindex all documents again. and I want to search by
this fields with exactly search. Like if I search "John" then it will
return documents with fields "author" containing phrase "John" only
and not "John Doe". Now it returns all combinations with word John and
I just want to have documents with the word "John" only.

Solution might not simple, but I can manage that. I cannot manage
reindexing all documents again. :)

Does it clear to you?
