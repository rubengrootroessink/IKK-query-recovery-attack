Hello, mark.

mh> 2) My app uses long queries, some of which include
mh> very common terms. Using the "MoreLikeThis" query to
mh> drop common terms drastically improved performance. If
mh> your "killer queries" are long ones you could spot
mh> them and service them with a MoreLikeThis or simply
mh> limit the number of allowed terms in the query string.

Can you please explain what is "MoreLikeThis" query in the Lucene?

Yura Smolsky.
