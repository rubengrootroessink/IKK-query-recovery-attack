SUBJECT: ParallelMultiSearcher and docFreq
DATE: 14 Sep 2006

Hello.

Here is the situation. I have ParallelMultiSearcher object
initializated with two or more RemoteSearchable's.

I run PrefixQuery search on some keyword field, say "link". When I run
search starting just with letter "w" (link:w*) then I should have like 5k
results.

As I know when I perform search on ParallelMultiSearcher query is
being rewritten at first. So my prefix search is being rewritten with
"link:wordlist.com link:web.com and so on about 2-3k of terms". Then as I
understand from debugging for each such term ParallelMultiSearcher performs docFreq
requests to RemoteSearchables (2-3k calls). So we have many requests
to docFreq method and these operations take like 95% of all search time.

I see that we have docFreqs method for RemoteSearchable, but it has
not being used.

Is there any way to get rid of those multiple calls of docFreq?

Maybe I am not correct, then please tell me whats wrong.

Thanks.
