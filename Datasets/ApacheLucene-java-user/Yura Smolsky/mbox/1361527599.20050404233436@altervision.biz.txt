Hello, java-user.

I have documents with tokenized, indexes and stored field. This field
contain one-two words usually. I need to be able to search exact
matches for two words.
For example search "John" should return documents with field
containing "John" only, not "John Doe" or "John Foo".

Any ideas?

Yura Smolsky.
