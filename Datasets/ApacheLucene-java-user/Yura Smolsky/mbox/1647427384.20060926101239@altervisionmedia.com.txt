Sure I do reuse IndexSearcher :) and second query is always faster
than the first one...

I am thinking should be this faster

query = QueryParser("text", StandardAnalyzer()).parse("good boy")
IndexSearcher.search(
  new ConstantScoreQuery(new QueryFilter(query)),
  sortByIntField)

than usual search

IndexSearcher.search(
  query,
  sortByIntField)

Is there anyway I could use filter to get needed results from the
query?
