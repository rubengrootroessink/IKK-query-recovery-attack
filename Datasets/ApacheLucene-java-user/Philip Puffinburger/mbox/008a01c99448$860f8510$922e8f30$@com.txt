Thanks for the suggestion.   We're going to go over all of this information/suggestions next
week to see what we want to do.

that was just a suggestion as a quick hack...

it still won't really fix the problem because some character + accent
combinations don't have composed forms.

even if you added entire combining diacritical marks block to the jflex
grammar, its still wrong... what needs to be supported is \p{Word_Break =
Extend} property, etc etc.
