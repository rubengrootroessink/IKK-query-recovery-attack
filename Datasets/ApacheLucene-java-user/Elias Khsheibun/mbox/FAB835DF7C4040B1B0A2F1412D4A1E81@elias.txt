What do you mean by a custom one - please explain. I must use a
PayloadTermQuery ?

And for the TermPositionPayloadTokenFilter there is a method that is not
used - incrementToken (only used in the main method) ... I didn't see in the
code the place that examines if the query term is at an even offset of the
document I can see it is only called from the main method - but how should
this work all together ?

Thank you.

I am not sure about that. Maybe custom one.

No, at index time [IndexWriter] you are going to use a new analyzer that
uses WhitespaceTokenizer  + TermPositionPayloadTokenFilter.

PayloadAnalyzer will be used at query time. [QueryParser]

You need to setSimilarity(new CustomSimilarity) of both indexer and
searcher.
