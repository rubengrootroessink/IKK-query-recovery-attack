When I write the following query:

"Computer AND Science" - the code that is in BooleanScorer2 is invoked, and
when I write "Computer OR Science" the code in BooleanScorer is invoked. How
can I make the OR (the conjunctive query) to use the BooleanScorer2 and not
BooleanScorer, which is the new implementation.


Elias.
