Hi,

I need to add a query operator '!' such that when it precedes a word or a
phrase in the query, that term will contribute twice its weight if it is
positioned in an even offset of the document. The position of a phrase is
determined by the offset of its first word. 

I guess it involves payloads...

Elias.
