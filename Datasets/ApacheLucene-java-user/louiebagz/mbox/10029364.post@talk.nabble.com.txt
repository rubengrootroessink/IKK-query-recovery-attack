SUBJECT: how to output particular field from a List in an XML File
DATE: 17 Apr 2007


Hello guys, 

This is a follow up email on my previous post
http://www.nabble.com/how-to-index-XML-elements-with-the-same-name-using-Lucene-tf3428085.html#a9555198.
I have successfully indexed XML elements with the same name. But when I
tried to search through my index, the output only displays the first XML
element in the list. I have uploaded the codes for your reference. 

Hoping for your kind attention on this. 

Louie
