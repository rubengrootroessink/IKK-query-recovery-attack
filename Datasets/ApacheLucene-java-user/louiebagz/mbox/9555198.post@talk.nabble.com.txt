hello guys, 

I need some help. I'm working on an XML file and trying to create a lucene
index for each element. My XML file have repeating elements with different
values. When I tried to run lucene, it can only index one of the elements.
Both files are attached for your reference. 

Hoping for your favorable response. 

Thank you!
