Thanks all for the useful comments.

It seems that there are even more options --

4/ One index, with a separate Lucene document for each (item,language) combination, with one
field that specifies the language
5/ One index, one Lucene document per item, with field names that include the language (e.g.
title_en, title_cn)

I quite like 4, because you can search with no language constraint, or with one as Paul suggests
below.  However, some "non language-specific" data might need to be repeated (e.g. dates),
unless we had an extra Lucene document for all that.  I wonder what the various pros and cons
in terms of index size and performance would be in each case?  I really don't have enough
knowledge of Lucene to have any idea...
