SUBJECT: State in IndexSearcher that is not in IndexReader?
DATE: 7 Nov 2006

Sorry for asking the obvious, but I just want to be sure: Is there any
state associated with IndexSearcher that is not in the underlying
IndexReader (if created with IndexReader as argument). Sharing and
reusing IndexReader would be just as good as reusing IndexSearcher,
performance-wise, wouldn't it?

Thanks, Claes
