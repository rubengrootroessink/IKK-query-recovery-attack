SUBJECT: Understanding how indexing works
DATE: 3 Jul 2003

Hi,

In my job, I have become the new maintainer of a search feature that 
uses Lucene. I am trying to understand how it works by examining the 
index it produces.

When I list index fields by opening an IndexReader, looping over 
documents, then looping over fields with Document.fields(), I see a 
number of fields. However, I don't see the fields that are searchable 
within this document.

If I do IndexReader.terms() directly and then Term.field() on each term, 
I see fields that no longer should exist since the documents containing 
them have been deleted. Is this like it should be?

How can I easily tell if a term is no longer searchable (or rather 
successfully found, when searching), apart from actually doing the 
search? Is there a way to list those terms?

Thanks,
Claes
