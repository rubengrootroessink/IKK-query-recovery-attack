Hello,

I am interested to hear how people handle locked indexes, for example 
when catching an IOException like below.

java.io.IOException: Lock obtain timed out:
Lock@/tmp/lucene-0b978f2c0aa12e8dcdbd5b0df491bfc4-write.lock
        at org.apache.lucene.store.Lock.obtain(Lock.java:58)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:223)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:213)

As far as I can tell, there is no good way to tell whether the lock is 
only temporary (working as it should), or if it was created by a process 
that later died, and therefore can not remove it. How can I detect the 
latter case, and how should I best handle it?

Thanks,
Claes
