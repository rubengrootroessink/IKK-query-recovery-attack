SUBJECT: search in all fields
DATE: 18 Jan 2007

Hi all:
     I study Lucene and I want build search on all the fields, I find
MultiFieldQueryParser can search on multiple fields, but we must specify
fields. maybe we can add a field named all_field that contain all the fields
when indexing, but it make the index file larger.
    so how to make search on all fields without specify any fields ?
Appreciate your help!
