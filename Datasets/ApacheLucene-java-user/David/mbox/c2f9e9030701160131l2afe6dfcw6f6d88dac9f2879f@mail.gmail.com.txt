SUBJECT: Re: How to support float type term in Lucene?
DATE: 16 Jan 2007

thanks, I use the port PyLucene, and I wonder if there is some utils in
Lucene that can convert floating point number to sortable string,
somebody tell me there should be such utils, but I can't find it in Lucene
document.

Appreciate your help!
