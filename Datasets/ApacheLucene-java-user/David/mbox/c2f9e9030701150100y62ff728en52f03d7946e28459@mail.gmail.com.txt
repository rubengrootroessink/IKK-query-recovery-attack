SUBJECT: Do frequent addition and deletion affect the search speed?
DATE: 15 Jan 2007

Hi all:
    I want use to Lucene to store GData format data, the user case is:
    1. The data is only stored in Lucene, Lucene is used for Store, Index
and Search.
    2. each data have different attributes, user can specify their own
attributes.
    3. addition and deletion operations are frequent,
    4. user can search on the attributes, range search should be supported.
    Is Lucene sortable for this case, do the addition and deletion affect
the search speed? when the index file become large, is there something
unstable?

Appreciate your help!
