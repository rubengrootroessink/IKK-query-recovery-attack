SUBJECT: can we add duplicated field in Lucene?
DATE: 10 Jan 2007

Hi all:
can we add duplicate field in Lucene like the following:

doc.add(new Field("author", "author1", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
doc.add(new Field("author", "author2", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));

How will Lucene act?

if I want add two authors to the index , how can I do?   except concat the
authors' string, because maybe I should support Range search  for datetime.

Appreciate your help!
