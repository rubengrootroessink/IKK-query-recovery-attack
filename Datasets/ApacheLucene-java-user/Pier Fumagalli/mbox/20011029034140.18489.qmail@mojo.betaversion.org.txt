SUBJECT: lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org list moved...
DATE: 29 Oct 2001

As you might have noticed, one-by-one, all mailing lists for
Jakarta.Apache.ORG have been moved off to a new server, to
split the load of all Apache Mailing Lists on two separate
machines.

What does it mean? In theory that mail are going to be processed
faster, and that we should not fall back into another backlog like
the one which affected us last week.

I am not directly subscribed to each one of these mailing lists,
so, if you have problems, you can simply report them to the owner
at <lucene-user-owner@jakarta.apache.org> to the
webmaster <webmaster@jakarta.apache.org>, or to me directly.

Thanks to Brian Behlendorf for his incredible help and support,
and to a bunch of people who helped out to make this happen.
Sorry for the quite huge amount of test messages I sent out
(especially this one: it's goint to all lists all together, and
it's intended to be also a load test) but I want to make sure that
everything is working correctly...

And now let's hope everything is right :) :) :)

    Pier (keeping his fingers crossed)
