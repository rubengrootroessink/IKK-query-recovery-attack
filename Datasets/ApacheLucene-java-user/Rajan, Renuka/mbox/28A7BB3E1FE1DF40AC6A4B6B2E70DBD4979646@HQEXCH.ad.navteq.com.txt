SUBJECT: Matching accented with non-accented characters
DATE: 25 Jul 2006

Hi All

 

I am trying to match accented characters with non-accented characters in French/Spanish and
other Western European languages.  The use case is that the users may type letters without
accents in error and we still want to be able to retrieve valid matches.  The one idea, albeit
na√Øve, is to normalize the data on the inbound side as well as the data in the database (prior
to full text indexing) and retrieve matches.  

 

For instance if the database contains a word like BE/BE/ (/ being the equivalent of aigu since
I don't have a French keyboard:-)) and the input is erroneously provided as BE/BE (last aigu
missing), we still want to be able retrieve BE/BE/ as a candidate match admittedly with an
error margin.  

 

Has anyone using Lucene successfully (ie in terms of decent performance AND validity of results)
to match non-accented characters with accented ones using some method?  Any method?  Anyone
have suggestions to improve the suggestion above?

 

Any input will be greatly appreciated! Merci beaucoup :-)
