SUBJECT: Performance problem with IndexWriter
DATE: 12 Jan 2008

Hello,

I have a strange problem: the very same call executes 10 times faster under 
Windows than under Linux: The line

writer.addDocument(doc)

takes (with the very same documents) < 1ms under Windows, but > 10ms under 
Linux. maxBufferedDocs = 10000, number of documents to index < 10000, 
flushing takes place only one time (after the last indexed doc), there is 
enough RAM. My Linux sys admin confirms that everybody seems normal on the 
Linux machine: process priority, RAM, ...

Has anybody encoutered this problem before?

Thanks for any hint.

Hans-Peter
