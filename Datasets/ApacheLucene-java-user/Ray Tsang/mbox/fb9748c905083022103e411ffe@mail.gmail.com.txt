I had similar requirements of "count" and "group by" on over 130mil
records, it's really a pain.  It's currently usable but not
satisfactory.

Currently it's grouping at run-time by iterating through ungrouped
items.  It collects matching documents into BitSet, so subsequent
queries can use BitSet to retrieve the results of original query. 
Moreover, it can mark off documents that are already being grouped
from the BitSet.

In a page that shows 10 records/page, it will only group 10 records at
a time. Consequently, there is no way to know the total number grouped
records in the beginning.

In addition, it feels like reading the field values from the document
in order to look for group-by results is most time consuming.

How does RDBMS do it?
