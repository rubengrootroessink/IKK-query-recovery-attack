SUBJECT: ANNOUNCE: Plucene
DATE: 3 Feb 2004


Plucene 1.0 has just been released to CPAN, and is available at
  http://search.cpan.org/dist/Plucene/

This is a port of Lucene to Perl, and should mirror the Java version
fairly closely.

More details on the rationale behind Plucene are available at
  http://www.kasei.com/archives/001039.html

Thank you to the Lucene team for a wonderful product. Hopefully Plucene
can help take that to a wider group of developers.

Tony
