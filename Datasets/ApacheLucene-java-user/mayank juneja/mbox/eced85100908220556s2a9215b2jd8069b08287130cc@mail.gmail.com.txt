SUBJECT: Incremental Indexing in PyLucene
DATE: 22 Aug 2009

Hi,

I am building a database of text files using PyLucene. I need to add new
text files to the index at regular intervals. Since I am a beginner, I do
not know how to build the index incremently. Can anyone guide me how to
accomplish the task ?

Any kind of help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Mayank Juneja
