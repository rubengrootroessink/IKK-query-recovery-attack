Hi,
#1 Yes. Look at the DateFilter implementation.
#2 Look at the source code for SimpleAnalyzer to see what are the stopwords.
I believe it removes more words when you index. I use StandardAnalyzer that
works better for me. If I remember right, searches for alphanumerics did not
work w/ Simple Analyzer. Also ,make sure to use the same kind of analyzer
for both indexing and searching. A wildcard does not work when used as the
first character in the word- for eg, *og for dog. Also, I believe wildcard
searches are case sensitive.

1)Does Lucine allow you to sort results by date?

2) How do you execute a wildcard search?  I have 
indexed four million documents using the SimpleAnalyzer.  When
I execute a wildcard search using the SimpleAnalyzer the results returned
are always 0.

Thanks,

Joel
