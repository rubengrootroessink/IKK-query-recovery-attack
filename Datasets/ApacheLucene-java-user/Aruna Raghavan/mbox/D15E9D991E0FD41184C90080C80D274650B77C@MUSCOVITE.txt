Hi All,
I just tried this again, seems to work fine. Not sure what I have done wrong
the first time.  Just a follow up.

Hi,
While adding documents using something like the following-
document.add(Field.Text("object number", m_strObjectNumber));
I used a string "object number" as you can see. I can not find the  values
for "object number" when I do a search. I am using a StandardAnalyzer.
Any idea why this is happening?
Thanks,
Aruna.
