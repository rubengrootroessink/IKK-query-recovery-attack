SUBJECT: closing and opening the IndexWriter
DATE: 10 Dec 2001


Hello All,
Is it necessary to close and reopen an IndexWriter in order to create/delete
Documents and do look ups? I am currently using a home made locking
mechanism to do lock() and unlock() for reads and writes. Are there any
problems with this approach? Thanks in advance for any help.
