SUBJECT: Limit on number of characters before wildcard?
DATE: 21 Dec 2001

Hi,
>From some testing that I have done it appears that there is a limit of 3
characters before the wild card for wildcard queries. In other words, if the
word is dogleash and I looking by using do* it returns wrong results
(usually only a asubset) where as if I use dog*, I get correct results.

Also, wildcard at the begining of the keyword does not seem to be supported.
(*ogleash)
Can some one confirm this? Is this documented anywhere?
