Subject: Querying multiple fields of a index


Hi,

Is it possible to query multiple fields of  a given index and get the result
based on this combined query.
i.e for example if  i want to serach for a word "lucene" in the title field
and the word "engine" in the summary filed and want the results based on
these words .

How can i achieve this ?

TIA

Regards
Harpreet
