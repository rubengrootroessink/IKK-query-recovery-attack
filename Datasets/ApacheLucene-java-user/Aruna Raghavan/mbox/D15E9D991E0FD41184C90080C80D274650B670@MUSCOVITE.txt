SUBJECT: Optimization and deletes
DATE: 28 Feb 2002

Hi,
I have noticed that unless I optimize the indexing while adding documents to
it, the deleted documents are not getting physically deleted right away
(even though they seemed to have been flagged as "deleted". The searcher
could not find them once they were deleted). If I decide not to optimize the
index, when would the deleted documents actually get deleted?
