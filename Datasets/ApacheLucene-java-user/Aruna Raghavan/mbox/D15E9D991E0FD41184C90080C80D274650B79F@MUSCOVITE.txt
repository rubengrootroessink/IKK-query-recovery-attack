Hi,
I worked around the problem by converting everything to lowercase in my code
prior to indexing into lucene and also prior to searching for a string.
Ofcourse, I also had to use pattern matching to change bool operators such
as ANDs and ORs to uppercase again because lucene expects those to be
uppercase.

What can I do to configure Lucene to make in case insensitive? 

Thanks,
Alan
