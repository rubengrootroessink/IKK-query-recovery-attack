Doug,
Thanks for your response.
I tried the nightly build from 2/11 (I think this also the latest) and
things look good. How long will it be before this build will become a
release build?

I cannot replicate the problem you are having.

Can you please submit a complete, self-contained, test case illustrating the
problem you are having with the write lock.

Please test this against the latest nightly build of Lucene, from:
  http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-lucene/nightly/

Thanks,

Doug
