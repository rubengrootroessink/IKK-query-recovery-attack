Hello All,
I tried doing a search for a phone number 1-954-612-1276. It worked fine. I
am using a StandardAnalyzer for both indexing and searching. From looking at
StandardTokenizer.jj and StandardAnalyzer, "-" is a valid character. So, how
is this differentiated from "-" that we use for exclusion such as
+(dog)-(cat) i.e, all dogs but no cats?
Thanks!
Aruna.
