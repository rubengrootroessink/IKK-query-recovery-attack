Hi,
I am using StandardAnalyzer - the problem was with wildcard queries being
case sensitive. Even with Standard Analyzer, you have to worry about case
sensitivity in this case. Thanks for the tip on example Analyzer, I will
take a peek.

Alan, Aruna:

The built-in solution is to use LowerCaseFilter in your Analyzer.  (The
SimpleAnalyzer, StopAnalyzer, and StandardAnalyzer classes already do
this; see the Lucene API docs to see which filters each uses.)  The FAQ
includes an example implementation of an Analyzer if you want to build
your own.
