Ype,
Thanks for the response. I think the reason my search worked was because
"object number" got indexed as "object" and the searcher searched for
"object" as well.

You would need to pose a query like this

object number:54321

However this is parsed by the standard analyzer  as a query looking
for the term 'object' in the default field and looking
for the term '54321' in the field named 'number'.

There are three workarounds:
- change your fieldname to eg. objectnumber, and query by:
  objectnumber:54321
- use 'object number' as the default field for searching.
- construct the query without using the standard analyzer.

I think the best solution would be to change the fieldname
into something shorter like 'onr' which allows for easy querying.


Regards,
Ype
