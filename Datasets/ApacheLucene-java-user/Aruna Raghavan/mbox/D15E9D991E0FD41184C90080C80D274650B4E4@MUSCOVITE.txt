SUBJECT: Basic clause with NOT
DATE: 21 Dec 2001

Hello,
In Lucene documentation, the query syntax is defined as follows:
Syntax:
Query  ::=  Clause  ( [ Conjunction ] Clause ) *

Where:
		Clause ::=  [ Modifier ] [ FieldName ':' ] BasicClause 
			Modifier    ::= '-' | '+' | '!' | 'NOT'
			BasicClause ::= ( Term | Phrase | | PrefixQuery '('
Query ')'
			PrefixQuery ::= Term '*'
			Term        ::= <a-word-or-token-to-match>
			Phrase      ::= '"' Term * '"'

		Conjunction ::= 'AND' | 'OR' | '||'

		-----------------------------

		If I try a search using  "NOT sometext" it does not work. Is
it not supported? I think I am following the syntax according to the
documentation. I am trying to get all documents that do not have a given
word.
		Thanks in advance for any help.
