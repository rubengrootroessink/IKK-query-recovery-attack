DATE: 27 Dec 2001


Hello again,
Prefix query in general means some thing like the following where the
operator is followed by the operands.
AND (a,b)
OR (a, AND (b,c))

If I apply this to the following definition, it still is not clear what it
will find-
AND (a,b) (Query)???

Just thought I would give more detail on what I am having trouble with.
Thx again!

		Hello,
		Does any one know what is  PrefixQuery '(' Query ')'? in the
definition of query syntax
Syntax:
Query  ::=  Clause  ( [ Conjunction ] Clause ) *

Where:
		Clause ::=  [ Modifier ] [ FieldName ':' ] BasicClause 
			Modifier    ::= '-' | '+' | '!' | 'NOT'
			BasicClause ::= ( Term | Phrase | | PrefixQuery '('
Query ')'
			PrefixQuery ::= Term '*'
			Term        ::= <a-word-or-token-to-match>
			Phrase      ::= '"' Term * '"'

		Conjunction ::= 'AND' | 'OR' | '||'

		-----------------------------


		It seems to imply the following
		(dog*)((cat) AND (bird))
		but I am not sure what this finds.
		Thanks once again for all the help!
