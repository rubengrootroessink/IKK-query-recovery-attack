SUBJECT: simple syntax question
DATE: 27 Dec 2001

Hello All,
I am confused about the meaning of the braces in the query syntax:
what does cat(dog) find?
what does cat(dog)* find?
Or is the following defines queries of the following kind?
(cat) AND (dog)  AND (bird) and so on. (i.e, one or more bool combinations)

I think it is the last. But I need someone to confirm this.

Syntax:
Query  ::=  Clause  ( [ Conjunction ] Clause ) *

Where:
		Clause ::=  [ Modifier ] [ FieldName ':' ] BasicClause 
			Modifier    ::= '-' | '+' | '!' | 'NOT'
			BasicClause ::= ( Term | Phrase | | PrefixQuery '('
Query ')'
			PrefixQuery ::= Term '*'
			Term        ::= <a-word-or-token-to-match>
			Phrase      ::= '"' Term * '"'

		Conjunction ::= 'AND' | 'OR' | '||'

		-----------------------------

Thanks once again for all the help!
