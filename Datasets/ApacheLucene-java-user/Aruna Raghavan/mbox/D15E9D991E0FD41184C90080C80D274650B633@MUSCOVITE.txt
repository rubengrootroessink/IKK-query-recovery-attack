Yes, + and - do work. In our UI, we try to validate the expression user
entered by using pattern matching. I was trying to simplify this by simply
using AND/OR and disallowing +/- (as it could be confusing to a user). I
guess now the question is what causing the AND to fail? Is it a bug?

I'm afraid not. Have you tried '+' as I've suggested?
