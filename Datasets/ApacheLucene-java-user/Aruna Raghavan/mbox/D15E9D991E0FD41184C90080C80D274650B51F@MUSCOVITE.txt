SUBJECT: RE: Limit on number of characters before wildcard?
DATE: 11 Jan 2002


Dave and Otis,
Thanks for your responses. 
I don't quite follow what Dave is saying. Do I need to construct these
WildCard or PrefixQueries myself?
Currently I am just using something like
Query query= QueryParser.parse("dogleash");
I also use Boolean Queries by using the following-
BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
bq.add(query);

Is dave suggesting that we detect the wildcard ourselves and create the
PrefixQuery??

First character asterisk (eg, *ogleash) is performed by PrefixQuery, which
executes much faster than WildcardQuery.
