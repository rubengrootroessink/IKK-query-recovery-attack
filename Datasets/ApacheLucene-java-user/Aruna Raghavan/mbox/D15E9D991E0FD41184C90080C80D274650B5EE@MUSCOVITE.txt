DATE: 14 Feb 2002


Suneetha,
I am also seeing this error with rc3 release. I have been using an older
version of lucene w/o any problems. I do provide a lock before I write to
the index so, it can't be because multiple threads are trying to write to it
at the same time...

Have you been able resolve this?

Hi,

As I understand it, it is made to allow multiple access to an index but only
one writer at a time.

It is created by IndexWriter on constructor and destroyed when the
indexWriter is closed.

regards,

Jerome
