Hi,
I am indexing as text field. Search for 05qzFebqz01, 05q* do not work. I am
using a StandardAnalyzer. Search for 05* works.
Searches on another word cq6r work fine.
 Any idea why this is happening?
Thanks!
Aruna.

Good thinking.  In my test, using a Text field, searches
for 1727a and 1727* both return a hit but if switch to
Keyword they don't.
