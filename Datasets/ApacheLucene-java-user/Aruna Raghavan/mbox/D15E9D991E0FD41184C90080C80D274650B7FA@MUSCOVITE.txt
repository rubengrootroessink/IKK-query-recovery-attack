I don't think it is a good approach to delete the write.lock file by hand.
It is there for a reason. You may want to dig into some of the older
dialogs/e-mails on this topic.

well suneetha,

   before I write to the index I check whether a write.lock file exists! If
it does I delete it before opening the index. It works fine
for me.

Hi,
The write.lock file won't be there if you close the index using a lock
mechanism. I use my own RWLock to access the index dir and unlock it after I
close the index. Basically, the access to the index is synchronized. I have
never had any problems with this approach.

Hi,
        I'm currently indexing allowing  multiple access , I find that a
write.lock file has got created.
I know this is to prevent  multiple writers, but now how do I
continue.??I  do not want to reindex as I work on a very large database
and it takes a real long time How do I remove this lock file ??

Thanx 4 ur help,
Suneetha.
