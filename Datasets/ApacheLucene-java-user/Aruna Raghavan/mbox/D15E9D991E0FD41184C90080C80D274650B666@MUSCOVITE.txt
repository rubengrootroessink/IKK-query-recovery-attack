>From my experience with wildcards,
1. They are case sensitive while the regular queries aren't.
2. Only one wild card is allowed in a word. If you are using this with a
bool query, you can use something like the following
(asas*) AND (fhg*fd). This is acceptable
3. There is a requirement of using atleast one character before wildcard in
a query.(*fhhd is not valid)
4. Special characters are not supported (? may be a special character)
Hope this helps!

Subject: Wildcard Searching


We're really struggling with trying to understand why the WildcardQuery
seems to strip out the question mark by replacing it with a space. We're
using the daily build, and a StandardAnalyzer. We've got the text "The Round
Window" in our index. If we search on "roun*" the Lucene QueryParser returns
a hit. When we search on "roun?", we don't get any hits. We don't even know
how to make heads or tails of the WildcardQuery or WildcardTermEnum classes.

Also, Lucene returns the parsed version of each of our searches. When we
search by rou*d, Lucene parses it as rou*d (which is what we would expect).
But when we search by rou?d, Lucene parses it as "rou d". It seems to wrap
the term in quotes and replace the question mark with a space. Any ideas? Or
can someone give us an idea of how to understand WildcardQuery or
WildcardTermEnum?
