SUBJECT: RE: how to decide when the index needs to be optimized ?
DATE: 11 Apr 2002

Hi,
I was using the following to do analysis on our document management system
that uses lucene-
opimization counter(how often optimize() should be called, this seems to
help to clean up the deletable files even if you are not interested in
speeding up the searches)
Merge factor - decides how often segments should be merged
Max Merge factor- upper limit on number of documents that can be merged
JVM heap size - determines how much heap should be given to the java process
that uses lucene (-Xmx520m)

If there are any others, I would like to know.
Aruna.

My understanding it that you don't even have to optimize the index,
unless you want your searches to be faster.
I don't think Lucene has any internal limitation to the number of files
that comprise an unoptimized index, so you'll hit the wall with Java or
OS first, but even that limit is pretty high.
You could just optimize every X documents or at the end of indexing.
