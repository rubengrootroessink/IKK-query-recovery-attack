Is there a limitation in Lucene when it comes to wildcard search ?
Is it a problem if we use less than 3 characters along with a
wildcard(*).
Gives me error if I try using 45* , *34 , *3 ..etc .
Too Many Clauses Error
Doesn't happen if '?' is used instead of '*'.
The intriguing thing is , that it is not consistent . 00* doesn't fail.
Am I missing something ?
