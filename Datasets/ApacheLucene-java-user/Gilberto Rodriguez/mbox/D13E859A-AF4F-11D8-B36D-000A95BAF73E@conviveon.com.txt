SUBJECT: Problem Indexing Large Document Field
DATE: 26 May 2004

I am trying to index a field in a Lucene document with about 90,000 
characters. The problem is that it only indexes part of the document. 
It seems to only index about 65,00 characters. So, if I search on terms 
that are at the beginning of the text, the search works, but it fails 
for terms that are at the end of the document.

Is there a limitation on how many characters can be stored in a 
document field? Any help would be appreciated, thanks....
