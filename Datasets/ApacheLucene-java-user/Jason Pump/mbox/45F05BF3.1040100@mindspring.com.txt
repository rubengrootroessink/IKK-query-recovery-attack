If you store a hash code of the word rather then the actual word you 
should be able to search for stuff but not be able to actually retrieve 
it; you can trade precision for "security" based on the number of bits 
in the hash code ( e.g. 32 or 64 bits). I'd think a 64 bit hash would be 
a reasonable midpoint.

hash64("dog") = 4312311231123121;

"body:4312311231123121" returns document with dog, but also any other 
document with a word that hashes to the same value.
