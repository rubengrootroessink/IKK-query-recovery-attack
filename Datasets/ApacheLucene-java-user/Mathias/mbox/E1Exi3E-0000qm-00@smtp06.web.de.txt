SUBJECT: Get name of field where term was found
DATE: 14 Jan 2006

Hello Everybody!

Do you know if it is possible to get the name of the field in which Lucene
found a term?
I know that you can get the content of all fields with the document id. But
I need to know in which field Lucene found my term, if I searched in several
fields.

I'm thankful for every kind of help!

Bye
Mathew
