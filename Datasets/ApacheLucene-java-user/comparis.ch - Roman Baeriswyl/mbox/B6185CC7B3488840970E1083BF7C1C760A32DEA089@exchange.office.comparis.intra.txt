Thanks for the answer. That does make sense.
It first gets thru all (not only those which could pass the filter) terms available and investigates
all terms which match any of the wildcard queries. And that could take quite some time if
I got leading wildcard queries.

Guess I'll try another approach then with "reverse" indexing the fields which can be searched
and then transform the leading wildcard queries to following wildcards by reversing them too.

The reason for this is that the filters and other boolean clauses are
applied during result collection. But wildcard query first needs to
investigate all terms that match and this is done before the results are
collected. And this step takes the time (especially before Lucene 4.0).

There is no way to change this.
