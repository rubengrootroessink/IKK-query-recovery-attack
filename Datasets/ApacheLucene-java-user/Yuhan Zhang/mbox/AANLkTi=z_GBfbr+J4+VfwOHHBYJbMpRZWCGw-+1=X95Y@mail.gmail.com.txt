SUBJECT: search on a field that is NOT_ANALYZED
DATE: 19 Jan 2011

Hi all,

I am trying to use
*IndexSearcher<http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_1/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/IndexSearcher.html#IndexSearcher%28org.apache.lucene.store.Directory%29>
* to retrieve a doc from an existing index by reading a field
that is NOT_ANALYZED. I am trying to use that field as a unique id to
retrieve a specific
document. The id will be a url. is this possible to do? which type of query
should I use?

Thank you.

Yuhan
