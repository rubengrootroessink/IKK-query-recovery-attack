SUBJECT: construct a field without analyzer?
DATE: 14 Feb 2011

Hi all,

I am trying to index documents by phrases (multiple words) in the text, and
want to get around the StandardAnalyzer for this field. (however, I will
still
use standardAnalyzer for the other fields in the same document).

so, how should I approach it? is there a way to construct a field by
directly
providing the terms without analyzer? (by tokenstream?) which class can
construct a set of keywords into a tokenstream?


Thank you.

Yuhan
