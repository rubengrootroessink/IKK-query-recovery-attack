SUBJECT: Re: tfIdf weights
DATE: 2 Feb 2009

hi,
i used lucene-2.4.0 to get tf-idf. i'm not sure if the newer versions have
direct methods to get tf-idfs as well.
this is lengthy but might help.

   // Get Term Enum that contains all the terms in the index using
FilterIndexReader
    TermEnum e = freader.terms();

  // find total number of docs
  int noOfDocs = freader.numDocs();

// Get TermDocs Enum
  TermDocs td = freader.termDocs();

    // seeking through all the terms
    while(e.next()){

      // get the term
      Term t = e.term();
      // only search the contents field
      Term term = new Term("contents",t.text());
      // Move to the <document, frequency>  pairs for term from the TermDocs
Enum containing the term t
      td.seek(term);


      // loop through each document containing the term.
      while(td.next())  {
        double weight = td.freq()*Math.log(noOfDocs/e.docFreq());
      // do something with the weight
      //......

     }
}

regards,
Dipesh
