yes its quite possible.
1.you need to create term which you need to search.
eg.
Term term = new Term("yourfield","yourword");

2. then create a TermDoc enum.
TermDocs provides an interface for enumerating <document, frequency> pairs
for a term.

TermDocs t = new
FilterIndexReader(IndexReader.open("youindex")).termDocs(term);

3.Iterate through each of the terms and count the occurrence.
int count = 0;
 while(td.next()){
                    count+=td.freq());
  }

Hope it helped,
