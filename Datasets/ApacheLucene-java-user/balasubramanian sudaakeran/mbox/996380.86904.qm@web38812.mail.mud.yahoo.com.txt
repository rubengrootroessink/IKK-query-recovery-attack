SUBJECT: Potential issue with DisjunctionMaxScorer
DATE: 31 May 2007

Hi,
I found the following piece of logic in DisjunctionMaxScorer.skipTo function which may have
a potential issue (marked in code as <<<<ISSUE>>>>).

    public boolean skipTo(int target) throws IOException {
        if (firstTime) {
          if (!more) return false;
          heapify();
          firstTime = false;
          return true;   // more would have been false if no subScorers had any docs
        <<<<ISSUE>>>> The issue is that we should not have his return
statement over here. It should continue on the rest of the logic. Otherwise firsttime the
skipping to target will not happen.
    
        }

        while (subScorers.size()>0 && ((Scorer)subScorers.get(0)).doc()<target)
{
            if (((Scorer)subScorers.get(0)).skipTo(target))
                heapAdjust(0);
            else
                heapRemoveRoot();
        }
        if ((subScorers.size()==0))
            return (more = false);
        return true;
    }

Please somebody confirm if this is an issue.

regards,
Sudaakeran B
