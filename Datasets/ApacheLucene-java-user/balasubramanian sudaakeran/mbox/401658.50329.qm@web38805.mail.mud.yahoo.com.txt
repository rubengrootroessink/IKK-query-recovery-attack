My guess that this can happen when your document matches more than one condition. For example
first:25 could match lang:java as well??

Subject: About sort questions


I search 'lisp' with lucene application  using the  following query string:
uid:5^3 OR uid:10^2 OR lang:lisp
I hope  result as following:

first:5               (which id is 5)
second:10          (which id is 10)
others:other results sort according to relevance.

it is always ok, but sometimes not, the second will display before the
first.
for example:
uid:90^3 OR uid:25^2 OR lang:java
first:25               (which id is 5)
second:90          (which id is 10)
others:other results sort according to relevance.

I hope search to  return results strictly according to my input order.
Anyone can understand me? thanks in advance.
Any point will be appreciate.
