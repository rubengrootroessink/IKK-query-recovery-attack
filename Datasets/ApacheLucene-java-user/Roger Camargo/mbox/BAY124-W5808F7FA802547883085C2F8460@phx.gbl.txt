SUBJECT: RE: How to model hierarchy info to be searched related to a document
DATE: 14 Jan 2008

Why am I afraid?
Building the index wouldn't be a problem. I guess.
Querying it would be more difficult.
 
Let's see.
 
Custom properties... defined by the user, there is no restriction, in quantity, and values.
> > Custom property name: Frequency> > Custom property value: Quarterly> >>
> Custom property name: Last update> > Custom property value: 2006-01-01
 
Cube1 has Frequency, Last Update
Cube2 has Suggestion, Frequency
Cube3 has Time Range, Original Source
...
...
 
In the index the document should have one field per CustomProperty
 
docid=0, cubename=cube1, Frequency=Quarterly, Last update=2006-01-01
docid=1, cubename=cube2, Suggestion="This cube should be used by the Account manager", Frequency="Monthly"
docid=2, cubename=cube3, Time Range="Since 1980 up to 2007", Original Source="Account subsystem"
....
....
 
Each custom property should be a Field, there is no control over which fields are created.
How the query should be constructed, at the query you specify which fields you should use.
There is a way to query all the fields.
 
Well it looks like it should work.
 
Is this how I should do it?
 
Add each Custom Property as a Field is the answer?
 
For the hierarchy info modeling, the answer is generating every combination of dimension and
levels?
 
Thanks for taggin me along with this.
