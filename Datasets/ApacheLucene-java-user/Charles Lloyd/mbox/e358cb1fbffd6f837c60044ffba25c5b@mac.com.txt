Our index has about 3 million documents and is about 11 Gig in size.  
It has become unwieldy to manage at that size so I have been working to 
reduce the size of our Stored data and it looks like we're going to get 
the index size down below 2 Gig.  The overall performance directly 
seems to correlate the to the size of the index.  Try to keep your 
Stored fields minimal as it would appear that the number of documents 
is far less an issue than the physical size of the index file.  At some 
point, we will probably start to split our index if it gets above 5 Gig 
again.  However, my initial tests with the MultiReader have been 
disappointing.  Hopefully, a faster MultiReader will be available by 
the time we cross that bridge.

Charles.
