DATE: 10 Sep 2003

  Hi all,

  I have ported the kstem stemmer to Java and incorporated it to Lucene. You can get the source
code (Kstem.jar) from the following website:

http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/

  Just click on "KStem Java Implementation" (you will need to register your e-mail, for free
of course, with the CIIR --Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval, UMass -- and get
an access code).


Content of Kstem.jar:

java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData1.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData2.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData3.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData4.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData5.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData6.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData7.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData8.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemFilter.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemmer.java

KStemData1.java, ..., KStemData8.java   Contain several lists of words used by Kstem
KStemmer.java      Implements the Kstem algorithm 
KStemFilter.java     Extends TokenFilter applying Kstem


To compile

unjar the file Kstem.jar to Lucene's "src" directory, and compile it there. 


What is Kstem?

  A stemmer designed by Bob Krovetz (for more information see http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/pubfiles/ir-35.pdf).
