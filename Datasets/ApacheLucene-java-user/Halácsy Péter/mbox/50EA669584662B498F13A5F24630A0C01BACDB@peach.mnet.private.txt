I don't but I would like to suggest that you should not analyze
(tokenize) host names. Sorry if you didn't want to do that, only it was
an example.

If you analyze host names with standard stuffes, abc.xxx.com and
abc-xxx.com are indexed with the same terms. I think the best way you
can do is doing three fields:
1. site (host) name: jakarta.apache.org
2 (maybe you don't need it) domain name: apache.org
2. url: jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html

host and site name fields are not tokenized (and you can use a hash
function to save space) but url field is tokenized

why? we are running a search engine (not lucene based ;) and we have
only tokenized url field; we can't search for documents from only
index.hu domain (Hungarian portal) because we get back a lot of
documents from such urls: www.something.com/locales/hu/index.html or
index_hu.html or www.hu.com/index

on google you can filter with site name
on northern light you can filter with words in url
