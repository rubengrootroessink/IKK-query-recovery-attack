SUBJECT: Re: UTF8 accents & umlauts filter?
DATE: 14 Sep 2006

Thanks Yonik & Ken for both answers; I think the explanations went a 
little over my head, but I think you understood what I was talking 
about! Basically, a better filter to remove all possible accents (& 
umlauts as a bonus, for completeness sake; I personally would have no 
use for it).

I think it's way more work and way more complicated than I initially 
thought it would be. Anyone feels able to do this?
