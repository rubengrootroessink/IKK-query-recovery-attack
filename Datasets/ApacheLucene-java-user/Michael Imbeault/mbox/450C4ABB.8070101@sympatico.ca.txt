SUBJECT: Better Highligther fragmenter?
DATE: 16 Sep 2006

I'm now using the excellent Hightlighter from within Solr and it works 
very well; except that the generated fragments sometimes begins with 
bad-looking characters (the "." of the end of the previous phrase, or a 
), /10, etc). The same is true for the fragments ends. I looked at both 
the dev and user lucene list in search for a better Fragmenter class, 
but it seems that there's none right now (just the simple and null 
fragmenters).

To me the 'simple' fragmenter is a bit too simple; anyone had success in 
implementing a more intelligent one? I have no java coding experience, 
sadly, so I don't know where to begin on this one. I don't think fancy 
phrase recognition is needed; just a better boundary algorithm (avoid 
beginning / ending fragments with bad looking characters) and the 
addition of "..." at the end and beginning of the fragment if 
fragmentation of a phrase took place.

Also, is it required that the highlighted field is 'stored'? I'm pretty 
sure it is, but just want confirmation.

Thanks,
