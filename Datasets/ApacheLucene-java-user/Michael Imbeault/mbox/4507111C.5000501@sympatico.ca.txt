SUBJECT: UTF8 accents & umlauts filter?
DATE: 12 Sep 2006

Right now Lucene has an accent filter (ISOLatin1AccentFilter) that 
remove accents on ISO-8859-1 text. What about a UTF8AccentFilter? Is it 
planned to add such a filter (which would be very useful, as 
ISOLatin1AccentFilter isn't able to remove some complex accents on some 
languages encoded in UTF8. I would paste examples but I'm not sure that 
they would display correctly).? I think I saw a post long ago on this 
mailing list about something like that, but it has never been released 
officially.

See

2001, first post about utf8 accents: 
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/648?search_string=accent;#648
2004, a good solution, but still incomplete : 
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/10792?search_string=accent;#10792
2006, best attempt yet, but sadly undelivered : 
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/32142?search_string=accent;#32142

I think Lucene would benefit from a complete UTF8 accents remover... 
right now the best solution I have is to process everything in PHP 
before indexing and at query time (and its a little slow).

Thanks,
