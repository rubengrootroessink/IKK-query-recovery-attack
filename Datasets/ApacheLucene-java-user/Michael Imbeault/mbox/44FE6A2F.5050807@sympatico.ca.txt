SUBJECT: Doc add limit, im experiencing it too
DATE: 6 Sep 2006

Old issue (see 
http://www.mail-archive.com/solr-user@lucene.apache.org/msg00651.html), 
but I'm experiencing the same exact thing on windows xp, latest tomcat. 
I noticed that the tomcat process gobbles memory (10 megs a second 
maybe) and then jams at 125 megs. Can't find a fix yet. I'm using a php 
interface and curl to post my xml, one document at a time, and commit 
every 100 document. Indexing 30000 docs, it hangs at maybe 5000. Anyone 
got an idea on this one? It would be helpful. I may try to switch to 
jetty tomorrow if nothing works :(
