SUBJECT: Find if words are in the same phrase?
DATE: 5 Oct 2006

Is it possible with Lucene to limit a proximity query to a phrase to 
determine if two words are in the same phrase? Along the same train of 
thoughts, is it possible to determine if two words in a same phrase are 
separated by a word, or a list of words? Like for example Virus (some 
other words) activate (some other words) cancer?

Thanks,
