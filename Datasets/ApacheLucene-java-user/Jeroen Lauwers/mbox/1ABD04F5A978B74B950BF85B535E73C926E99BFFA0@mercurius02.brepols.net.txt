Hi,

I was wondering if anyone could help me on this:

I want to search for:

1.       a set of words (eg. 10)

2.       only a couple of words may come in between (eg. 3) in the result document

3.       of the supplied set of (10) words, at least 8 must be present (or in other words:
2 of the supplied words can be missing)

I use the SpanNearQuery for (1.) and (2.), but it is the third part that's lacking.

Any ideas?

Jeroen
