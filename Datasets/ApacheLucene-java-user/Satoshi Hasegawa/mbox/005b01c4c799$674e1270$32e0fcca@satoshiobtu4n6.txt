SUBJECT: Query#rewrite Question
DATE: 11 Nov 2004

Hello,

Our program accepts input in the form of Lucene query syntax from the user, 
but we wish to perform additional tasks such as thesaurus expansion. So I 
want to manipulate the Query object that results from parsing.

My question is, is the result of the Query#rewrite method guaranteed to be 
either a TermQuery, a PhraseQuery, or a BooleanQuery, and if it is a 
BooleanQuery, do all the constituent clauses also reduce to one of the above 
three classes? If not, what if the original Query object was the one that 
was obtained from QueryParser#parse method? Can I assume the above in this 
restricted case?

I experimented with the current version, and the above seems to be positive 
in this version; I'm asking if this could change in the future. Thank you.
