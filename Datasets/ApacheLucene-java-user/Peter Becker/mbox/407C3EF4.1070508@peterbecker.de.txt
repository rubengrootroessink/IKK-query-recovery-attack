Hello,

we released Docco 0.3 along with two updates for its plugins.

Docco is a personal document retrieval tool based on Apache's Lucene 
indexing engine and Formal Concept Analysis. It allows you to create an 
index for files on your file system which you can then search for 
keywords. It can index plain text, HTML, XML and OpenOffice files and 
with the support of plugins others like PDF, DOC and XLS.

This new version of Docco features a number of small enhancements: the 
diagram layout can be changed, printing and graphic export options have 
been added and some plugins have been updated.

The new POI plugin should be able to index MS Word documents again (the 
old one broke with recent Java versions), the PDFbox plugin gets all the 
recent updates from the PDFbox project. Old plugins will still continue 
to work, though.

You can find the updated files here:
 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21448

Note that you can now also use the export plugins to add more graphic 
export options.

Enjoy!
  Peter
