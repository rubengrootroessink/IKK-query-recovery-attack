Hi Magnus,

thanks for the offer, but unfortunately I can't/don't want to make the 
assumption that I can easily access the documents to re-index them. And 
I don't think this approach would be feasible unless you can keep the 
documents in memory somehow.

Storing the other/non-inverted/normal/whatever index would be expensive 
for indexing, but querying should be a lot faster than having to 
re-index documents. That is in our situation preferable.
