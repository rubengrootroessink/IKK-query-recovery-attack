Not always, but quite often :-)

Because you might need to put quite some effort into getting it right? 
Because you might do something someone else already did better -- which 
is not really against the spirit of hackerism, but I have so many other 
things to hack where I think I can do better than most people. Inverted 
file indexes is not my particular domain.

That needs exposure. If some Lucene code is hidden in the Haystack 
project, it won't get enough exposure IMO.

One of the important things about OSS for me is resuse and 
collaboration. If you hack things again and again without trying to turn 
it into something reusable, I'd say you constantly create small 
proprietary forks based on open source code but you are not part of any 
OSS effort. That's of course my point of view on OSS, but then you asked 
for it :-)

As a user of Lucene I missed some features. Part of the OSS culture is 
for me to tell others about this and maybe to try to find solutions. 
Mark's code seems to be one, so I proposed to consider adding it into 
some spot with better exposure for testing. And I don't seem to be the 
only person with the need for these features. I think Lucene would be 
better if these features were easily available. If the Lucene team 
doesn't think so -- fair enough, it is their project. But asking me to 
stop requesting features in a (hopefully) sensible way is pretty much 
against the spirit of OSS and hacker culture as far as I understand it.

Does that answer your questions?
