DATE: 29 Jan 2004

Hi Sebastian,

there are not too many Lucene features used, and some rather orthogonal 
mixin of Formal Concept Analysis, but let me still advertise our little 
Docco tool:

  http://tockit.sourceforge.net/docco/index.html

It is based on Lucene, comes with a couple of indexing tools (including 
HTML) and is Open Source (BSD licence). Source can be found here:

  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=37081 (module name is "docco")

You can run Luke (http://www.getopt.org/luke/) on any index created by 
Docco to check out some more advanced features.

HTH,
   Peter
