Me, too! :-)

We are currently playing with the small Reuters collection (about 21.500 
news items from the 80s), but I don't know if I am allowed to distribute 
it and it is too small anyway -- many of the implications we find are 
based on 1 to 3 documents. I still have a collection of 5 CDs I 
downloaded from Google about 2 years ago, which I still haven't found 
the time to look at -- it probably will be one of the next things to do. 
I can see what their licence says about redistribution.

Another good source for collections is 
http://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html -- but I haven't found a 
good news corpus yet.

I am definitely interested in comparing some results on whatever 
collection we can find. I'll talk to our IR guys in the next days to see 
what they know about.
