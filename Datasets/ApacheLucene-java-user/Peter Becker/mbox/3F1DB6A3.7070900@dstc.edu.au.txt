Hello Oscar,

yes, you are right -- XML was introduced for 6.0. Sorry -- I confused 
the numbers.

The only reasonable way to go about this that I can see right now is 
going the option (2) I proposed -- things might have advanced with the 
UDK. It most likely won't be easy, but at least if running OpenOffice as 
application during indexing is an option you should be able to use its 
import filters.

I guess converting everything first via SO6/OOo is not an option. 
Otherwise you might want to look into File->Auto Pilot->Document 
conversion... of these applications.

HTH,
  Peter
