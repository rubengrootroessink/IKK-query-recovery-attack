Hi,

is there any way to get the keywords for certain fields in document 
easily? The situation is that I have small sets of documents coming back 
from queries and I want to compare those in terms of similarity. The 
questions are: what are the common terms within each set and what are 
the terms least common between the sets.

Performance is not much of an issue and the documents are still 
accessible, I just wonder which pieces of your code might be reusable 
for this task. After reading some code (e.g. 
DocumentWriter.invertDocument(..)) I am afraid that there is not much I 
could reuse easily, but I thought I better ask :-)

  Peter
