SUBJECT: Term frequency on result sets
DATE: 30 Jul 2003

Hi all,

I am interested in comparing different query result sets in term of term 
frequency. Questions I'd like to answer are:

- what are the N most common terms in a result set?
- how often does term X occur in a certain result set?

The second one is of course easy to do with a boolean query, but the 
first one is something I couldn't figure out yet. I had a look at how 
Luke does it on the document collection, but I can't see how this can be 
applied to a result set. Any hints for me?

Thanks,
  Peter
