Hi Alvaro,

there are some examples in our code here -- working with a slightly 
similar interface to the Ant task in the Lucene contributions.

  
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/source/org/tockit/docco/indexer/documenthandler/

The actual step of turning it into a Lucene Document happens here:

  
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/source/org/tockit/docco/indexer/DocumentProcessingFactory.java?rev=1.30&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

This code is still work in progress, but it does work -- we are running 
it on a few ten thousand documents from time to time. Both PDFBox and 
Multivalent fail to read some PDF documents in the collection, but so 
does Acrobat Reader. We still have to do a more formal test to see which 
one does a better job, at the moment we are still coding the core bits, 
then we test properly.

HTH,
    Peter
