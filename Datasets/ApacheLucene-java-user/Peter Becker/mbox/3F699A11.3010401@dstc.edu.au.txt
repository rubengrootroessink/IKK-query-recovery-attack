If I may plug our code again ;-) Docco (http://tockit.sf.net) contains a 
framework for document handlers, with implementations for plain text, 
html, xml and OpenOffice based on JDK 1.4 and plugins for PDFBox, POI 
and Multivalent. There is also a notion of file mappings (i.e. mapping 
from a match on a FileFilter to a handler) and we plan to add code to 
mixin external information like meta-data stores or EAs from advanced 
file systems. It is available on SF (within 
http://sf.net/projects/toscanaj) and is at the moment BSD-style 
licensed. We would be happy to contribute bits of that and thanks to the 
plugin architecture dependencies should be controllable. Admittably the 
plugin loader is still a hack, but it works.
