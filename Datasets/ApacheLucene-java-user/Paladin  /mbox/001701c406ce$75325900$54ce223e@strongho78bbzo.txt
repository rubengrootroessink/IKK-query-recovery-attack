Well usually the time of response are 5-10 sec max, it depends of the
queries (except for queries with a wildcard).
i put a time out of 30 seconds for all the queries.
queries with wildcard can fail because of java.lang.out.of.memories error
you can try yourself on the website of my compagny (but the website seems
down for the moment)
if you want the adress send me a mail out of the list please, i'll explain
you in details how to make your own test and how our software works
