SUBJECT: Boost value is always 1
DATE: 17 Feb 2011

I'm trying to set different boost values for different fields. Before adding
the document to the index every value is fine. But when I run a search in
the explanation every boost is 1 and the final score of the matches is not
affected by the boost values set. I set omitNorms to false and index to
ANALYZED. The only solution I found is setting store to YES. Do you have any
ideas?

Thanks in advance,
