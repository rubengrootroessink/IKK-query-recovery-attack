Thanks guys.
Just looking at the examples and I wonder if there is a means to directly
get the total number of hits. Or is it always necessary to search for a few
top docs, get the the total number of hits and then create a new collector
to get all the results?

TopDocCollector collector = new TopDocCollector(5);

searcher.search(query, collector);

int numTotalHits = collector.getTotalHits();

collector = new TopDocCollector(numTotalHits);

searcher.search(query, collector);

ScoreDoc[] hits = collector.topDocs().scoreDocs;

If the later is true, is the code above the best way to do this?

Cheers,

David
