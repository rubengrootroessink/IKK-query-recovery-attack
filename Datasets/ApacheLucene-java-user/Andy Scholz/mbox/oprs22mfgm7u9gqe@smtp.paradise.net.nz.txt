Hi Dan,

I'm not sure whats going on there, I've checked the moveNext & it seems OK. 
It seems that somehow the page got indexed twice, or two hits are being 
returned for some reason. I cant replicate get this tho so I'd aprreciate 
any more info you might be able to give me - e.g. if you comment out the 
setDocumentURL (so that only metadata is indexed) and change the query to 
to something like "title:jboss", does it sill return two hits. Also there 
are some unit tests in the ejindexXX_tests.zip file you might want to run - 
this has a bunch of tests that test the service both locally and remotely - 
these should(!) fail if there is a problem and hopefully give more 
indication as to what the problem might be.

Thanks for your feedback!

Regards,
Andy Scholz
