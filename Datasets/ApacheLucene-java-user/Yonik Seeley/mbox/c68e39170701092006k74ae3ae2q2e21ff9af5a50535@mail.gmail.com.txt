It's easiest/fastest in binary.  The IEEE floating point format if
interpreted as a signed integer is already very close to sorting
correctly.  If you already know how to index an integer, then do this:
 get the float bits as an int, and if the high bit is set, flip all
other bits.
That's how Solr does it:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/solr/trunk/src/java/org/apache/solr/util/NumberUtils.java?view=markup

  public static String float2sortableStr(float val) {
    int f = Float.floatToRawIntBits(val);
    if (f<0) f ^= 0x7fffffff;
    return int2sortableStr(f);
  }
