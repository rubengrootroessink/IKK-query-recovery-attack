For a single term, it's determined at index time and stored in the index.
TermDocs gives you a list of documents containing the term, and for
each document, the number of time the term appears (the freq).

Note: TermScorer calls the tf(int) version on Similarity rather than
the tf(float) version.

Hits normalizes to 1 based on the max score, if that max score is
greater than 1.
Scores across queries aren't really comparable though.

Pretty much.

Lucene doesn't currently do this "mixing", and it's not really clear
to me how it should be done.
