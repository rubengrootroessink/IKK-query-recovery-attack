Hi Martin,

Solr's WordDelimiterFilter can index West-Berlin as "West" | "Berlin"
| "WestBerlin".
It currently indexes "Berlin" after "West" and "WestBerlin" at the
same position as "Berlin", so prase matches like "West Berlin" will
still work.

It does this automatically, even if there isn't a "-" inbetween the
words, so "WestBerlin" in the document would be indexed the same as
"West-Berlin" by default.

I don't know if you would still need it after the WordDelimiterFilter,
but Solr's SynonymFilter handles multi-token synonyms and multiple
synonyms at the same position.

It's all open-source, so you can yank them out and use them for your
own uses, or try using Solr itself :-)
