Lucky you, it's already been solved :-)

Seriously though, I think you are making some incorrect assumptions
about how Lucene works.  Lucene does not retrieve all 50K documents...
but it does *score* those documents and only keeps track of the top
ones (by id), and then only retrieves the whole document for only
those you ask for.
