If you might have other random HTML markup as well as entities check out,
Solr's HTMLStrip* tokenizers:
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters

It's good if your input is dirty - if you don't know if it's HTML or
not, or if there are HTML fragments that would cause a normaly HTML
parser to choke.

If you actually have HTML documents, I would go with an HTML parser.
If you have *just* entities, there is probably a simpler approach.
