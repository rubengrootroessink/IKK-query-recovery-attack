SUBJECT: Re: scalability w/ number of fields
DATE: 5 Apr 2005

Optimize performance update (with tons of indexed fields):

We had a timing bug... ignore the hour I first reported.  Here are the
current numbers:

indexed_fields=6791  index_size=3.9GB  optimize_time=21min
indexed_fields=3216  index_size=2.0GB  optimize_time=9min
indexed_fields=2080  index_size=1.4GB  optimize_time=4min

It's a little apples-to-oranges since we simply removed some of the
fields to test a lower field count (and hence the index size also goes
down).
