an enumeration (TermEnum) but that involves iterating through the terms and couting them.
 I looking for something similar to numdocs() in the IndexReader class.

No there is not.
In 4.0-dev, with the new "flex" APIs, you can retrieve the number of
unique terms in a single segment (Terms.getUniqueTermCount()), but not
a whole index.
