Right... keep in mind concurrent updates too... it's pretty much
impossible for the user-level to avoid other calls to addDocument()
from going ahead since they can be in different threads.

Yeah, but other things might be usng up the descriptors... there is
probably an open searcher for searching, possibly another one warming
in the background,   plus whatever else is going on in the servlet
container.

Ryan, are you using stock solr, or embedded?  Anything that might
prevent old searchers from being closed (you chould check the log
files for #opens vs #closes)

Perhaps unreferenced files may not be deleted if an exception is
encountered first, or perhaps even the deleter is failing due to lack
of descriptors.

Is there a tool we could have ryan point at the segments file and get
a dump of the referenced segments?

That should not have been the case in Lucene 2.2 I think.
