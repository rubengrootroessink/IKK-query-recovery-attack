Hmmm, really?  I thought that fuzzy scoring should just rely on edit distance?
Oh wait, I think I see - it's because we can use a hard cutoff for the
number of expansions rather than an edit distance cutoff.  If we used
the latter, everything should be fine?

The fuzzy issue I would classify as "working as designed".  Either
that, or classify FuzzyQuery as broken.  A cuttoff based on number of
terms will yield strange results even on a single index.  Consider
this scenario: it's possible to add more docs to a single index and
have the same fuzzy query return fewer docs than it did before!
