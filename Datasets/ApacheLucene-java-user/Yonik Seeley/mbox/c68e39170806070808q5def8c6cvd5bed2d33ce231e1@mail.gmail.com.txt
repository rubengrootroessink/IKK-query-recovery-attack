OK, does this mean it's now relatively safe/lightweight now to hold
references to IndexCommit objects long term (across different
IndexWriter objects on the same Directory?)

I also notice that IndexCommit.equals() only compares the segment fine
name... should it compare version also?  If index files were deleted,
and a new IndexWriter was opened, one could end up with a different
index but the same segment file name.

 This strategy doesn't seem to work if the IndexWriter is closed and re-opened: you get all
new CommitPoint instances from the new Writer even if they refer to the same logical commit,
and furthermore holding onto IndexCommitPoint references across generations of IndexWriters
will cause significant memory pressure (an IndexCommitPoint is an instance of the *non-static*
inner class IndexFileDeleter$CommitPoint so it points to the IndexFileDeleter which points
to the DocumentsWriter which points to the Posting[] array.....so holding onto a commit point
effectively keeps the Posting[] array around)
