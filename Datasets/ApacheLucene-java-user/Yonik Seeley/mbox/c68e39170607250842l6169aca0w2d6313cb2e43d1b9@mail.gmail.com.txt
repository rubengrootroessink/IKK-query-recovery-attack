If you can't tolerate slop, this is a problem.

The only 100% solution that I could think of to this problem is to
re-index the entire stream (with a very large position gap inbetween)
for each variant.

"the x men story"
"the xmen story"

Problems:
1) combinatorial explosion very quickly (not practical at all)
2) messes up idfs pretty badly

Phrase slop is the easiest workaround, esp when you wanted slop anyway.

I considered that too... but it increases false matches, and it still
doesn't fix many phrase queries.

While "the xmen" and "xmen story" will now both match, "the xmen
story" will still fail to match.
