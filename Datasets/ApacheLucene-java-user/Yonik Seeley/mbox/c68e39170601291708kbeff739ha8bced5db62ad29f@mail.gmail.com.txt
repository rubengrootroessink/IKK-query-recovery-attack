Go back and look at my response to the message you quoted :-)
The short answer is yes, it will work on Intel.

Pretty much, but it's never that simple (and wasn't for 32 bit mode either)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EM64T#Differences_between_AMD64_and_EM64T

Now that they have both been out a while, compilers generally produce
code that work on both. Tricky things like JVMs and esp kernels needed
explicit support.

Support is a different issue.  It may work, but it may or may not be a
"supported" platform of the JVM vendor.
