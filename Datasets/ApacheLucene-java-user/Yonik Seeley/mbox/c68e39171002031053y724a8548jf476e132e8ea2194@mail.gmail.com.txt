It's not really possible.
Lucene must iterate over all of the hits before it knows for sure that
it has the top sorted by any criteria (other than docid).
A Collector is called for every hit as it happens, and thus one can't
specify a sort order (sorting itself is actually implemented with a
sorting Collector).
