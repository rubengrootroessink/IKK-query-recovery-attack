This is one optimization that Solr does.  From solrconfig.xml:

  <!-- An optimization that attempts to use a filter to satisfy a search.
         If the requested sort does not include score, then the filterCache
         will be checked for a filter matching the query. If found, the filter
         will be used as the source of document ids, and then the sort will be
         applied to that.  -->
    <useFilterForSortedQuery>true</useFilterForSortedQuery>
