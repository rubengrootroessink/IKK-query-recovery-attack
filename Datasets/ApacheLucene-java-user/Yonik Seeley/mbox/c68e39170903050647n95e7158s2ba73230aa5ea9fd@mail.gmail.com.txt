FROM: Yonik Seeley <yo...@apache.org>
SUBJECT: public apology for company spam
DATE: 5 Mar 2009

This morning, an apparently over-zealous marketing firm, on behalf of
the company I work for, sent out a marketing email to a large number
of subscribers of the Lucene email lists.  This was done without my
knowledge or approval, and I can assure you that I'll make all efforts
to prevent it from happening again.

Sincerest apologies,
-Yonik
