Yes, term document frequency (used for idf - inverse document
frequency) will be based on the whole index.

It's probably easier to use a Filter (which essentially does the same
thing at a lower level in the search API).

Use termDocs(Term) to look up the ids, add them to a BitSet, and make
a Filter with that.
You might want to check out CachingWrapperFilter or QueryFilter too.
