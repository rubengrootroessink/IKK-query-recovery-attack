You could do this with the current query parser by putting large
position increment gaps between paragraphs that is guaranteed to be
larger than the largest paragraph.  Then you could use a sloppy phrase
query
"word1 word2"~10000 for instance.

That would also score documents higher the closer together the words
appeared (which may or may not be desirable).
