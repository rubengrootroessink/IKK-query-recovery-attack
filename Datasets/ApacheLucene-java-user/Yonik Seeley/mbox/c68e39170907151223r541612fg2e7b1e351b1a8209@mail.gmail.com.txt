Could this perhaps have anything to do with the changes to DocIdSetIterator?
Glancing at the default implementation of advance makes me wince a bit:

 public int advance(int target) throws IOException {
    while (nextDoc() < target) {}
    return doc;
  }

IMO, this is a back-compatibility anti-pattern.  It would be better to
throw an exception then quietly slow down some of the users queries by
an order of magnitude.  Actually, I don't think I would count it as
back compatible because of that.

if I simplify Query by dropping one term with its expansions, it runs fine... or if I replace
any of these terms it works fine,We tried with higer freq. terms, lower... everything fine...
