You are modifying the documents from multiple threads?

My fault... I removed the synchronization on Document (changed from
Vector to ArrayList).  It was never guaranteed to be thread-safe for
modification, and almost never makes sense without external
synchronization anyway.

If you really need to modify a single document from multiple threads,
please synchronize.
That explains the first exception, but no the second.  I assume you
aren't still changing the document while it's being indexed?
It appears as if the original exception causes corruption.
