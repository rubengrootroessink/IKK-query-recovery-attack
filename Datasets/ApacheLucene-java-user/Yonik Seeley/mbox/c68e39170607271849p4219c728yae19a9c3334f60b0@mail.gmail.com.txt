For the default index distribution method from master to searcher,
yes, hard-links are currently needed.

The distribution mechanism is *very* loosely coupled with Solr though,
and one could come up with an alternate method.  Also, cygwin might
support hard links to files now (I tried it quickly and it seems to
work) so that might be a path forward on Windows.
