SolrCore.getSearcher() and registerSearcher() work together to do do warming.
If you want to try and rip that out of solr, remove any calls having
to do with autowarming (warming new caches from most-recently-used
items in old caches), and replace the static warming queries (defined
in an external configuration file to be run when warming) with your
own queries.

Or see if Solr will meet your needs as-is ;-)
