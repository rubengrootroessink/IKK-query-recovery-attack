Right.

Yes, every sorted query after the first will be pretty much the same
speed as queries sorted by relevancy.

Yes, Solr does this warming in the background.
You also need to close the old searcher after all searches on it have
completed (for a time, searches could be running on both the old and
new searchers concurrently).  This requires something like reference
counting.
