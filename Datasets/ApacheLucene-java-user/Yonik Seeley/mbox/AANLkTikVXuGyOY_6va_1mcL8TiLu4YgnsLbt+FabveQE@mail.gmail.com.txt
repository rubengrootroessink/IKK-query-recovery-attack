In the key dimensions of search relevancy and query-targeted results,
users have become accustomed to internet-search style facilities like
page-rank, user-driven feedback, auto-suggest and more. Even with the
power of Apache Lucene/Solr, building such features into your own
search application is easier said than done.


Now, with LucidWorks Enterprise, the search solution development
platform built on the Solr/Lucene open source technology, developing
killer search apps with these features and more is faster, simpler,
and more powerful than ever before!


Join Andrzej Bialecki, Lucene/Solr Committer and inventor of the Luke
index utility, for a hands-on technical workshop that details how
LucidWorks Enterprise puts powerful search and relevancy at your
fingertips -- at a fraction of the time and effort required to program
them yourself with native Apache Solr. Andrzej will discuss and
present how you can use LucidWorks Enterprise for:
* Click Scoring to automatically configure relevance for most popular results
* Simplified implementation of auto-complete and "did-you-mean" functionality
* Unsupervised feedback  to automatically provide relevance
improvement on every query
