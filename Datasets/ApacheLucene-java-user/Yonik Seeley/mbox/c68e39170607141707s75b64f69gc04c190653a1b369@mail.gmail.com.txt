Well, yes, I should have said "sometimes", when you don't need or want
length normalization.  The scenarios where you don't want/need length
normalization in full-text fields is typically with fields that are
restricted to being short (like title or name).  It's definitely
corpus dependent though.

The kind of "title" fields I was thinking of were definitely less than
100 tokens, so it amounts to the same thing (but my advice should have
been clearer).
