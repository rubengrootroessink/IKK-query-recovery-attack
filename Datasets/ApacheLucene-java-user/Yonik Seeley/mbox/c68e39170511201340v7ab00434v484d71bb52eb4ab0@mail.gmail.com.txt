SUBJECT: Re: High CPU utilization with sort
DATE: 20 Nov 2005

I haven't done measurements, but the first query with a sort on a
particular field will involve filling the field-cache and that can
take a while (especially for numeric fields).

If you haven't already, you should compare the query times of a
"warmed" searcher.  Sorted queries will still take longer, but I
haven't measured how much longer.
