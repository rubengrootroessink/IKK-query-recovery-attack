Yes, but Solr handles the mechanics of warming up a new searcher in
the background to avoid those lengthy first-time hits to the
FieldCache and norms, and it warms any configured caches based on
previous requests.

There is still the issue of data freshness... you don't want to open a
new searcher too often (less than once a minute probably).
