BooleanScorer changed to BooleanScorer2, which can be faster or slower
depending on the nature of the queries.  There has been some
performance work lately in the trunk... you could try the latest
nightly builds to see if it improves things for you.

You could also verify that it's only the BooleanScorer by trying to
use the old scorer with the new code via
BooleanQuery.setUseScorer14(true)
