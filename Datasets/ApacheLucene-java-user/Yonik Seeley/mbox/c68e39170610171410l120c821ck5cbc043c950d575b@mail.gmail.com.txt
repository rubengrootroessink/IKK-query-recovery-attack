Won't this consume memory??

It takes time, not memory.  TermEnum is like an iterator - it doesn't
keep everything it iterates over in memory.  The memory for filters
will be for the bitset (1 bit for every document in the index, so a 1M
doc index will take 125KB of mem per filter).

Both PrefixQuery and PrefixFilter need to use a TermEnum, the
difference is what they do with the resulting terms.
