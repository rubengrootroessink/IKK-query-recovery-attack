That doesn't sound right... MultiReader is more fundamental as it's needed
to read any multi-segment index.

Looking back at the history of IndexReader, it looks like there was a
class called SegmentsReader (note the plural).  I bet it was moved
to MultiReader and that is why the history is truncated.
