As far as documentation, TopDocsCollector  is really an expert-level class
and is public more due to it needing in Nutch than it being a necessary
part of the public API.

TopDocsCollector is just a hit collector, so look at the collect()
method... and replace 0.0f with your score threshold.  Be aware that
score thresholds don't work well in general since scores aren't really
comparable from one query to another.


  // javadoc inherited
  public void collect(int doc, float score) {
    if (score > 0.0f) {
      totalHits++;
      if (hq.size() < numHits || score >= minScore) {
        hq.insert(new ScoreDoc(doc, score));
        minScore = ((ScoreDoc)hq.top()).score; // maintain minScore
      }
    }
  }
