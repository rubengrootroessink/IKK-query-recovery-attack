Because it was a compound query with multiple parts to it.  It's one explanation
with multiple parts.

It's actually a literal "x".

For example, in my index, if I search for
solr search lucene when the default field is text, then I get the
following explain:

1.1132671 = sum of:
  0.27831677 = weight(text:solr in 84), product of:
    0.57735026 = queryWeight(text:solr), product of:
      3.85647 = idf(docFreq=4)
      0.14970951 = queryNorm
    0.48205876 = fieldWeight(text:solr in 84), product of:
      1.0 = tf(termFreq(text:solr)=1)
      3.85647 = idf(docFreq=4)
      0.125 = fieldNorm(field=text, doc=84)
  0.55663353 = weight(text:search in 84), product of:
    0.57735026 = queryWeight(text:search), product of:
      3.85647 = idf(docFreq=4)
      0.14970951 = queryNorm
    0.9641175 = fieldWeight(text:search in 84), product of:
      2.0 = tf(termFreq(text:search)=4)
      3.85647 = idf(docFreq=4)
      0.125 = fieldNorm(field=text, doc=84)
  0.27831677 = weight(text:lucen in 84), product of:
    0.57735026 = queryWeight(text:lucen), product of:
      3.85647 = idf(docFreq=4)
      0.14970951 = queryNorm
    0.48205876 = fieldWeight(text:lucen in 84), product of:
      1.0 = tf(termFreq(text:lucen)=1)
      3.85647 = idf(docFreq=4)
      0.125 = fieldNorm(field=text, doc=84)
