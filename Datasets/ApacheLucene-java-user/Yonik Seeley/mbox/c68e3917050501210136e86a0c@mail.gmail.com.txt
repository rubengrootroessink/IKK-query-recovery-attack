DATE: 2 May 2005

I can't say whats actually ready, but I am very interested in sparse
filter representations.  I'm working on a project that needs to
dynamic categorization of search results, and this requires caching
thousands of filters.

It does currently require Java 1.4, so I guess it needs to wait for Lucene 2.0?

And I'm not sure if I'm reading it correctly, but it looks like
BooleanScorer1 could be a replacement for both BooleanScorer and
BooleanScorer2.
