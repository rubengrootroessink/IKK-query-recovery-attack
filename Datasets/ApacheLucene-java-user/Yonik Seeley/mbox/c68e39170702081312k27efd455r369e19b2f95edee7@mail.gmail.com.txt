Yes, that's why the Solr version isn't an HTML parser and assumes a mixed bag
of HTML, javascript, comments, processing instructions, and non-escaped text.
It doesn't throw exceptions because there are no "correctness" assumptions.

If you *know* you have well formed HTML documents, then you definitely
should parse (and extract important entities out to separate fields)
before sending to Lucene/Solr .
