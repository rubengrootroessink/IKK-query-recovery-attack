*shrugs*, I didn't recall that phrase... but I'm not clear if you
disagree with what I'm saying, or if you just think that it's
inconsistent with the documentation.

I think of the Lucene QueryParser like SQL. SQL is text based and also
meant for human entered text - but for either very expert users, or
programmatically created queries.  You normally don't want to pass
text from a search box directly to an SQL database or to the Lucene
QueryParser.
