the optimization will be done automatically every 10 documents added to the index (and then

this way.


A flush (new segment created from the in-memory docs) will be done
every 10 documents by default, not an optimize.  This default will
change slightly in the next version of lucene to flush by amount of
memory used rather than number of documents buffered.

If you want an optimized index, call optimize() on the IndexWriter.
