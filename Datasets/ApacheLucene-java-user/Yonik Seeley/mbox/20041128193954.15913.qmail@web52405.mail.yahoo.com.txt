SUBJECT: IndexWriter.addIndexes efficiency
DATE: 28 Nov 2004

I'd like to use addIndexes(Directory[] dirs) to add
batches of documents to a main index.

My main problem is that the addIndexes()
implementation calls optimize() at the beginning and
the end.

Now, my main index will be ~25GB in size, so adding a
single document and then doing an optimize will mean
rewriting 25GB of files, right?  That sounds like it
is going to be too expensive to do often.

What I would really like is to be able to control more
explicitly when an optimize happens.  Could
addIndexes() be easily rewritten to just call
maybeMergeSegments()?
