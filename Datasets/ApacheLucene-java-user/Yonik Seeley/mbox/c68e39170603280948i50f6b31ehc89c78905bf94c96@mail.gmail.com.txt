I'd use Solr for highly structured data (documents with multiple
fields) and very configurable text analysis per-field. Think of it
more like a database, but designed for full-text search. We are
working on adding easy faceted browsing and indexing of SQL databases.

I'd use Nutch for web-search (a free google replacement): crawling
(discovering), indexing web pages, and automatically handling
different types of human readable documents like HTML, PDF, etc.

I don't have any experience with Red-piranha.

Example use cases as I see it:
To index a music web site with lots of articles: Nutch
To index a music collection (structured data like title, album,
author, year, genre, etc): Solr
