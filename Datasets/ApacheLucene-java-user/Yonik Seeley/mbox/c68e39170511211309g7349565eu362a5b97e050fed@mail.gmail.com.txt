I haven't seen it, but if someone were to set all position increments
to zero for a field, then yes it wouldn't work.  Checking length
(which counts tokens) would work though:

+ if (length>0) position+=analyzer.getPositionIncrementGap (fieldName)

It is either expand Field slightly, or expand Analyzer.

Sort of... one is adding a new data member, one is behavioral.

For your need (a global increment), isn't expanding analyzer actually easier?
analyser = new OldAnalyzer() {
  public int getPositionIncrementGap(String field) {
    return 1000;
  }
}
