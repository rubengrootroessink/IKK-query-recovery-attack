Bummer that you can't step backwards with a TermEnum... finding the
first term is cheap, but finding the last is expensive.

How feasible would it be to add a prev() to TermEnum?  Would it be
worth it?  It seems like it would be useful for numeric fields to be
able to quickly find the max as well as the min without filling the
fieldcache.
