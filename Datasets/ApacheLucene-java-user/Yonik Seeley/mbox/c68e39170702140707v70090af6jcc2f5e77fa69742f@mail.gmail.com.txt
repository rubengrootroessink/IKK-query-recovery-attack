A single update does not cause a "commit" to occur (closing writer/open reader).
The user can explicitly commit, or  Solr can be configured to "commit"
changes within a given time period (called autocommit).

There is a configuration option that limits the number of warming
searchers for performance and memory reasons.  If this limit is
exceeded because someone is calling "commit" rapidly, then the commit
call will fail and a new searcher will not be opened.
