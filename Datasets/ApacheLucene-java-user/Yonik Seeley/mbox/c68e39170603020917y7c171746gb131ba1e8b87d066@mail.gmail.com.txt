WordDelimiterFilter does this, but it's not in core lucene yet...
you'd have to get it from Solr.

If you set the indexing analyzer to generate and catenate word parts,
and set the query analyzer to only generate word parts, then
something indexed as "IndexWriter" would be matched by both
"indexwriter" or "writer" (or "index writer" for that matter, but that's
not necessary for what you are doing).
