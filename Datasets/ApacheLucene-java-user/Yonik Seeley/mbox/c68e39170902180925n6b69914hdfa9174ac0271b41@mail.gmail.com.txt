It's doable.
Searching performance won't suffer at all.
Retrieving stored fields (after a search) will suffer somewhat.
Indexing performance will suffer somewhat.

The main problem will be norms, which aren't sparse and take up one
byte per document per field in the index, unless you omit the norms.
