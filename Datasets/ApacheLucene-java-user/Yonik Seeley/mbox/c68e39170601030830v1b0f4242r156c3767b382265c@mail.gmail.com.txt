SUBJECT: Re: boosting results with a field from the index
DATE: 3 Jan 2006

Take a look at FunctionQuery
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-446

It can do relevancy+importance, but not relevancy*importance with the
provided classes.  It shouldn't be too hard to do the multiplication
though.

You could also boost the field or document at index time.  That gives
you what you want, but it's fixed at indexing time and can't be
changed per-query.

document. When I search the index I find the documents with the highest revelancy weighted
automatically by lucene. I'm just wondering if I can boost the results with the importance
field I already have stored in the index. As I result I expect the same search results just
weighted differently. Something like relevancy multiplied by importance.
