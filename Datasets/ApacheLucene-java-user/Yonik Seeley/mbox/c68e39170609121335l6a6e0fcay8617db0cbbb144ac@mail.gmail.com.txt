SUBJECT: Re: UTF8 accents & umlauts filter?
DATE: 12 Sep 2006

Thanks for the links Michael... this one does look interesting:
http://dev.alt.textdrive.com/browser/lu/LUStringBasicLatin.txt
The challenge would be to make it fast... perhaps a custom hash table,
or look into the cost of a perfect hash function.

Just to clear up some unicode/terminology issues:

There are latin1 characters (the actual glyphs) represented by unicode
code points 0->255
There is also a latin1 encoding for unicode (which can only represent
unicode code points 0->255)
UTF8 is another encoding for unicode characters (or code points), but
that's not really relevant to a filter.

So ISOLatin1AccentFilter removes accents from characters <= 255, and
it doesn't matter what the original encoding was (ascii, latin1, UTF8,
UTF16, etc)
