Pretty close, I think.  There is still the length normalization factor
that biases short fields over long.  That's calculated at index time,
and stored in the "norm" along with the boost (they are multiplied
together).

You can change the similarity during indexing, or you can completely
knock out norms via Field.setOmitNorms(true)
