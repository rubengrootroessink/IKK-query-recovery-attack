Currently, a deleted doc is removed when the segment containing it is
involved in a segment  merge.  A merge could be triggered on any
addDocument(), making it difficult to incrementally update anything.

If you set mergeFactor to a very high number, you could control when
merging occured at least (at the expense of generating many segments).
