It should be 50MB.  If you are measuring with an external tool, then
that tool is probably in error.

The norm array is byte[maxDoc()], so you save
(num_fields_with_norm_emited - 1)*maxDoc()

(the -1 compensating for the fake norm array).

The problem with this is that it's not backward compatible (getting
the norm array is a public API).
