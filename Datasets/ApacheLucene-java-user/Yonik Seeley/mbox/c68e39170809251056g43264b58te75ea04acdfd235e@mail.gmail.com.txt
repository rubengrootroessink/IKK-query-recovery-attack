Closer to the latter.  Lucene evaluates all clauses in parallel.  A
document id iterator is created for each term, and they are all
"skipped" to the highest id yet seen until all iterators are on the
same id, which yields a match.  So an AND query of a rare term and a
common term can be faster than the common term alone.

TermScorer and ConjunctionScorer are the classes you would want to look at.
