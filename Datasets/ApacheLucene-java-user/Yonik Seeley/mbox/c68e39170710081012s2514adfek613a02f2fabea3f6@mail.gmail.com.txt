If Solr will work for you, it has faceting built in.

q=foo&facet=on&facet.field=type

If not, and the number of unique values in the field is low, set
intersections can be much faster than counting hits (for a large
number of hits).

It depends highly on what you want to match... is kbk in one field and
pencil in the other field acceptable or not, etc?

Again, if you can use Solr, check out the dismax handler... it
constructs multi-field queries for you with different weights on the
fields.
