SUBJECT: lucene nightly build after 11/20
DATE: 20 Dec 2006

Anyone using a lucene nightly build dated later than 11/20 will want
to upgrade to the next (future) nightly build that will be dated 12/21

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-754

Keep in mind that nightly builds are developer builds and not always
stable (though we try our best) :-)
