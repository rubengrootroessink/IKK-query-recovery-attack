Correct, it doesn't.  It supports the lower level primitives like
TermEnum and TermDocs that searches use to run.  A term query is run
exactly the same way on a MultiReader as it is on a single segment
IndexReader.  In fact, if you open up an IndexReader on an index with
multiple segments, it constructs a MultiReader under-the-covers.
