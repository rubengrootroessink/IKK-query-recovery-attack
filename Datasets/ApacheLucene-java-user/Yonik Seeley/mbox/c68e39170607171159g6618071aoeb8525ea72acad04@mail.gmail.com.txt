For using it in Java code, there is the JavaDoc
http://incubator.apache.org/solr/docs/api/org/apache/solr/search/function/FunctionQuery.html

You would need to create your own ValueSource that would calculate the
distance between other ValueSources.

There is also a hack in SolrQueryParser that I never documented,
because it is a bit of a hack.  It can create FunctionQuerys for
built-in functions when it sees the magic field name _val_

So _val_:"myfield"  evaluates to the numeric value of myfield.
and you can do things like
_val_:"recip(rord(mydatefield),1000,1000,1)" to boost more recent
documents by a date field.
