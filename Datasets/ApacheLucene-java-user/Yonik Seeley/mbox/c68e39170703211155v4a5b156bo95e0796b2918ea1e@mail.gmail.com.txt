The size of the index should also grow sub-linearly.
I think some of what you are seeing is due to index compression.
As you add more and more documents, there are fewer new terms added to
the index.  If you searched for a term in most of the documents, you
should see linear scaling with number of documents.  But those are
cases when you want to separate out that component and cache it :-)
