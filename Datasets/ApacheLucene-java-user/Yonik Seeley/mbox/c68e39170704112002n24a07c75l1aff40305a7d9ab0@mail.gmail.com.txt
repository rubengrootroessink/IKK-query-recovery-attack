I normally hear surrogates in the context of UTF-16 after the code point space
became too large for UTF-16 to represent.  AFAIK it's more of an
encoding thing, not a code point thing... for example, you would never
see the surrogates if you encoded in UTF8 (although the surrogates are
still code points since they needed to be reserved).

But there do seem to be groups of code points that map to a single character:

UTF-16 surrogates are handled as of Java5.
