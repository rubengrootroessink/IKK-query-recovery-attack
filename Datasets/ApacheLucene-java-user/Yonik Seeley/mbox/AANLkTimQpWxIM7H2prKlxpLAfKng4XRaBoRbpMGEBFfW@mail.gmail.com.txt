we are developing. Is Lucene able to create a document from a given JSON file and index it?
Is Lucene able to provide a JSON output response from a query made to an index? Does the Tika
package provide this?

No, and no.
XML, JSON, etc, are out of scope for lucene, which is a core search library.
Tika extracts text from documents like Word and PDF.

even though it does provide a search response in JSON format.

Solr is embeddable as well, so you can directly index/search.  But why
can't you run a separate server?
