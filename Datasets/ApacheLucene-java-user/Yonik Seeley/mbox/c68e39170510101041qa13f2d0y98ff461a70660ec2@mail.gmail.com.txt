You can use the FieldCache to access the values of multiple fields (the same
source default sorting uses).

Alternately, if you want to generate a score based on a function of multiple
fields rather than doing an absolute sort, you can use FunctionQuery:

Separate fields is more flexible (unless you never want to sort or query on
them independently). The performance would depend somewhat on what function
you are calculating.
