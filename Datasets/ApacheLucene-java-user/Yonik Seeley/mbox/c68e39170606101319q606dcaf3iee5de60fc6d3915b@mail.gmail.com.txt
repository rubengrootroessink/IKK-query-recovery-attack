A can tell you a little bit about ours... on one CNET faceted browsing
implementation using Solr, the number of facets to check per request
average somewhere between 100 and 200 (the total number of unique
facets is much larger though).  The median request time is 3ms (and I
don't think the majority of that time is calculating set
intersections).

We actually don't have the LRUCaches set large enough to achieve a
100% hit rate, but performance is still fine.

Yes, DocSets can be memory intensive.  A BitSet is only used when the
number of results gets larger than a threshold... below that, a
HashDocSet is used that is O(n) rather than O(maxDoc).  So the memory
footprint also depends on the cardinality of the sets.

GBs of index size, or actually billions of documents.  It's the number
of documents that matters in this case.

I just checked in a replacement for BitSet that takes intersection
counts much faster.

about a 500 milli response time average for full faceting (with result sets from a few thousand

How many documents was that with, and how many facets per document?

I certainly am interested in more memory efficient faceted browsing,
and have been meaning to try some alternatives.  So far, we've had
good results using cached DocSets though.
