But it's not.  Linux is caching the whole file, and
there really isn't any disk activity at all.  Most of
the threads are blocked on InputStream.refill, not
waiting for the disk, but waiting for their turn into
the synchronized block to read from the disk (which is
why I asked about cacheing above that level).

CPU is a constant 50% on a dual CPU system (meaning
100% of 1 cpu).
