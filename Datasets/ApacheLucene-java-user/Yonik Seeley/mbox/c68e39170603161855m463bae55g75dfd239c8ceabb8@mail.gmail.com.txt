ConstantScoreQuery can wrap any Filter and gives a constant score for
every document that matches the filter.

ConstantScoreRangeQuery rewrites to a ConstantScoreQuery with a
RangeFilter inside.
ConstantScoreRangeQuery isn't strictly required... you could construct
a ConstantScoreQuery with a RangeFilter yourself.
