Nope - embeddable as in running in the same JVM as your application.

Running as a separate server can be on the same host and be very
quick.  Was it too slow when you tried it?
It's a common misconception that HTTP is slow... it's really just a
TCP socket (which can be reused with persistent connections) with some
standardized headers.  Solr also has a binary protocol that works just
fine over HTTP, so it's really not more overhead than doing something
like talking to a database.

But the right solution probably depends on the details of your
specific usecases - if you elaborate on them, people may be able to
provide more specific recommendations.
