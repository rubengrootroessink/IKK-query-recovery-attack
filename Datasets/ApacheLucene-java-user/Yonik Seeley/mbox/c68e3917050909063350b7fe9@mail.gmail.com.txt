SUBJECT: Re: IndexReader delete doc! delete terms?
DATE: 9 Sep 2005

Nope. The IndexReader simply sets a bit in a separate bitvector that marks 
the doc as deleted. All info associated with the document are removed after 
an IndexWriter merges the segment containing that doc with another (optimize 
will merge all segments and hence remove remnants of all deleted docs).
