Because it's a decent default?  It was also the only choice when Solr
was first created.  I don't see a compelling reason to change that.

Solr fits about the same place a database does in many applications...
it's certainly not meant for users to query directly.  There's
normally a web application that handles interaction with the user and
creates/submits queries to Solr.
