SUBJECT: Re: "Starts with" query?
DATE: 5 Jan 2006

Off the top of my head:
1) also index the field untokenized and use a straight prefix query
2) index a magic token at the start of the title and include that in a
phrase query:
   "_START_ the quick"
3) use a SpanFirst query (but you have to make the Java Query object yourself)
