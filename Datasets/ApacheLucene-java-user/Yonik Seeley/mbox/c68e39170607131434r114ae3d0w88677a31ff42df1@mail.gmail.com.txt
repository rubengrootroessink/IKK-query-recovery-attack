I've never used HTMLParser, but if you have malformed., incomplete, or
optional HTML that would otherwise choke an HTML parser, you could use
Solr's HTMLStripping:

http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters#head-031d5d370010955fdcc529d208395cd556f4a73e

It's pretty stand-alone, so it should be trivial to rip it out of Solr
and re-use it in your Lucene project.
