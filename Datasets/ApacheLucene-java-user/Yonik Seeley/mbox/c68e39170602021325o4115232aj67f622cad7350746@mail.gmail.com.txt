Right.  I meant only for adding a lot of documents.  After a lot of
adds, then you could set the mergefactor back down to a reasonable
level and optimize the index.

will this tell me that a index is merging?

Yes, the commit lock will be locked when merging is going on, but you
will get some false positives because the lock is used for other
purposes.  That may still fit your need though.
