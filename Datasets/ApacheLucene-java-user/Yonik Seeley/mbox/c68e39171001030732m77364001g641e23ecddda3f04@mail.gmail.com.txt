Perhaps this is just a huge index, and not enough of it can be cached in RAM.
Adding additional clauses to a boolean query incrementally destroys locality.

104GB of index and 4GB of RAM means you're going to be hitting the
disk constantly.  You need more hardware - if you're requirements are
low (low query volume, high query latency of a few seconds OK) then
you can probably get away with a single box... just either get  a SSD
or get more RAM (like 32G or more).

If you want higher query volumes or consistent sub-second search,
you're going to have to go distributed.
Roll your own or look at Solr.
