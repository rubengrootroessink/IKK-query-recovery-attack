Search results, or only actual Hits objects?
For Hits, perhaps the 4 methods on Searcher that return Hits.

But IMO, callbacks and decorators shouldn't be spread all over
Lucene... it's easy cache Hits at a higher layer... create a
CachingSearcher or something.  You need to write code to use lucene
for your specific application anyway.
