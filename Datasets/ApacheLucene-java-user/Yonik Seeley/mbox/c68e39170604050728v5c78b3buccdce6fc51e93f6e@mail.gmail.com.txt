Terms are stored and iterated in sorted order, so no sorting needs to be done.
It's still the case that all the terms for that field need to be
iterated over though.

Another approach might be to store term vectors and retrieve the term
only from documents matching a particular query.  It might be slower
per query, but wouldn't have the overhead of populating the int[]
