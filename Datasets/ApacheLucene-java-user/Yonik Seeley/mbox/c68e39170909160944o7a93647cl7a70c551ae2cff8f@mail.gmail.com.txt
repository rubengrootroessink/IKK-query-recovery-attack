I think we know that 2.9 will not be faster for everyone:
  - Per-segment searching and the new comparatores are a general win,
but will be slower for some people.
  - Query parsing and small document indexing will be somewhat slower
due to the new token APIs (the workarounds for back compatibility) if
token streams aren't reused.

I don't see any indication of any bugs in Lucene in this thread either.
