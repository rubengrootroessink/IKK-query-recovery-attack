I got an error in firefox too.
I added the following example (commented out for now):
    <field name="features">Outside the BMP:êåà codepoint=10308, a
circle with an x inside. UTF8=f0908c88 UTF16=d800 df08</field>

I can verify it got into Solr OK by querying with python format (which
escapes everything outside the ascii range for each 16 bit char):
http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=BMP&wt=python&indent=true

[...]
          u'Outside the BMP:\ud800\udf08 codepoint=10308, a circle
with an x inside. UTF8=f0908c88 UTF16=d800 df08']}]

But firefox complains on XML output, and any other output like JSON it
looks mangled.
My bet is Jetty's UTF8 encoding for the response also doesn't handle
the full range.
