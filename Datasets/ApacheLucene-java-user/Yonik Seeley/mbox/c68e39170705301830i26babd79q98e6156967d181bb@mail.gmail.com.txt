Yes, a custom query handler is a better way to go than EmbeddedSolr if
you are looking to implement custom query logic (thousands of
sub-requests for a single app-level request), while keeping the
benefits of a stand-alone server with the HTTP interfaces.

The standard and dismax request handlers use the exact same mechanism
as a custom request handler would.  See the StandardRequestHander and
start from there.
