DATE: 5 Nov 2005

Lucene 1.2 is before my time, but check if the functions are
implemented the same as the current version (they probably are).

Scores are not naturally <= 1, but for most search methods (including
all that return Hits) they are normalized to be between 1 and 0 if the
highest score is greater than 1.
