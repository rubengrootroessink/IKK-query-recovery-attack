Deleted documents are removed on segment merges (for documents marked
as deleted in those segments).

Yes.

Due to the nature of an inverted index, it's impossible w/o going over
the complete index looking for all references to that docid.

*but*, that happens anyway during segment merges, so it should be
possible at that time to index a new document in the place of the old.
 At this point, I'm not sure if the complexity involved is worth it to
be in Lucene core, but I'll keep an open mind.
