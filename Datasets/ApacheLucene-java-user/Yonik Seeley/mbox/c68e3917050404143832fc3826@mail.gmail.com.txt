SUBJECT: scalability w/ number of fields
DATE: 4 Apr 2005

Oops, sorry.  First went to dev by accident.

I know Lucene is very scalable in many ways, but how about number of fieldnames?

We have an index using around 6000 unique fieldnames,
450,000 documents, and a total index size of 4GB.   It's very
sparse... documents don't have that many fields, but the number of
different fieldtypes is huge.

An optimize of this index took about an hour (mergefactor 10, compound index)
This is on enterprise hardware (fast SCSI raid, 6GB RAM, dual 2.8GHz Xeon).
The JVM was Java5 with 2.5GB heap.

This seems very long... anyone have any insights?
We'll be running more tests to see if decreasing the number of fields
has an impact.
