Hmmm, you're right.

http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/LuceneFAQ
states "
  What is the order of fields returned by Document.fields()?
  Fields are returned in the same order they were added to the document.
 "

Multiple values for a single field name should always be returned in
the same order,
but should we (continue to) make the guarantee about fields of
different names?  Is anyone relying on that?
