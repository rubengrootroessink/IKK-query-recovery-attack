JavaCC is a very fast parser for a large document... the issue is
small fields and JavaCC's use of an exception for flow control at the
end of a value.  As JVMs have advanced, exception-as-control-flow as
gotten comparably slower.

Does JFlex have a jar associated with it?  It's GPL (although you can
freely use the files it generates under any license), so if there were
other non-generated files required, we wouldn't be able to incorporate
them.
