Solr handles incremental updating:
  - overwriting documents that already exist in the collection
  - graceful migration from old IndexSearchers to new IndexSearchers
so that the changes are visible

Solr does not yet handle automatically grabbing stuff from a
database... you need to write something that grabs the changes and
then sends those changes to Solr (via XML over HTTP-POST)
