The following are loaded on-demand and cached:
- term index
- norms, per-field
- FieldCache for sorting or ValueSourceQuery
- CachingWrapperFilter

Also, "warming" an IndexReader can even refer to getting the operating
system to cache frequently used parts of the index files by running
some queries.
