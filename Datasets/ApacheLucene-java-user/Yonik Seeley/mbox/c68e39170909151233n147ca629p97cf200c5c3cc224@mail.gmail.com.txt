Remember to disable CPU frequency scaling when benchmarking... some
things with IO cause the freq to drop, and when it's CPU bound again
it takes a while for Linux to scale up the freq again.

For example, on my ubuntu box, ChannelFile went from 100MB/sec to
388MB/sec.  This effect probably won't be uniform across
implementations either.
