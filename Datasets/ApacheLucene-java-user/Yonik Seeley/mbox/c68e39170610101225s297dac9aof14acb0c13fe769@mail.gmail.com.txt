In my testing from some time ago, this wasn't the case.  non-compound
indexes were faster to search too.

If you get too many open files,
 - configure your OS to increase the number of open files
 - increase maxBufferedDocs to increase the size of the smallest
segments and thus decrease the total number of segments
 - decrease the merge factor some to further reduce the number of
files (this will slow indexing some, but speed up searching on
non-optimized indicies).
