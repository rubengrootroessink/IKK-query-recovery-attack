That won't quite work... add() after delete() can change document ids
because it can cause a segment merge which removes deleted docs.

That you could still sort-of do.  Even though docids can change, they
won't be reordered with respect to eachother.  So if you index in date
order, you can do a lookup on each endpoint and know that all the ids
between are in the range.
