But the zero boost was an index-time boost, and the queryNorm takes
into account query-time boosts and idfs.  You might get closer to what
you expect with a query time boost of 0.0f

The other thing affecting the score is the coord factor - the fact
that fewer of the optional terms matched (1/2) lowers the score.  The
coordination factor can be disabled on any BooleanQuery.

If you do both of the above, I *think* you would get the same scores
for this specific example.
