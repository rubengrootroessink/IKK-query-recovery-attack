I guess that would be whenever an IndexReader that had new deletions
is closed, or an IndexWriter that changed the segments file?

An app using Lucene still needs to coordinate all the activity
surrounding IndexReaders and IndexWriters, including explicit closure,
so the app will know anyway when the index has changed, right?
(unless you are talking about adding the callbacks to IndexModifier)

There are other tricky issues involved as well... would the listeners
be called in a synchronized context or not...  It really depends what
you use the listeners for.  Solr uses listeners to snapshot an index
for distribution, and hence it needs to be synchronized (no other
index modifications allowed while the callback is in progress).  Other
listeners can be  long running and asynchronous.
