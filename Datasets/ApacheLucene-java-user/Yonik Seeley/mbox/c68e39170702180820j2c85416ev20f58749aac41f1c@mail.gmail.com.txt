SUBJECT: Lucene 2.1.0 release available
DATE: 18 Feb 2007

Release 2.1.0 of Lucene is now available!

Many new features, optimizations, and bug fixes have been added since 2.0,
including lazy field loading, simple deletes via IndexWriter, and lockless
readers/commits.

The detailed change log is at:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/tags/lucene_2_1_0/CHANGES.txt

Lucene 2.1 includes index format changes that are not readable
by older versions of Lucene.  Lucene 2.1 can both read and update
older Lucene indexes.  Adding to an index with an older format
will cause it to be converted to the newer format.

Binary and source distributions are available at
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/
