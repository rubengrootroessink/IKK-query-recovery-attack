SUBJECT: Solr, the Lucene based Search Server
DATE: 1 Mar 2006

Solr is a new open-source search server that's based on Lucene, and
has XML/HTTP interfaces for updating and querying, declarative
specification of analyzers and field types via a schema, extensive
caching, replication, and a web admin interface.

It's already in production use at CNET, and has recently been accepted
into the Apache Incubator.

For more information, see Solr's home page at
   http://incubator.apache.org/solr/
and the wiki at
   http://wiki.apache.org/solr/
