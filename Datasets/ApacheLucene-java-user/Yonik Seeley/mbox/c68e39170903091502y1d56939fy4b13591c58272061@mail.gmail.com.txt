I dunno... coupling functionality to restrictions seems like it starts
to erode some of Lucene's famous flexibility.

Consider changing the type of a field from an int to a long... a
reasonably smart app or user could delete and re-index documents with
that field (it could be a small subset).  Or even keep track of what
documents had an int field vs a long field (via filters or something).
