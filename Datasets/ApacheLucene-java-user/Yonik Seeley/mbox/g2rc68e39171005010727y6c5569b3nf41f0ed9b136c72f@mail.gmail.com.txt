Values are not interned, but in a single field cache entry (String[])
the same String object is used for all docs with that same value.

But... I think StringIndex is more commonly used in both Lucene and
Solr than String[] (sorting, faceting, etc) so double check that it's
not StringIndex you should be looking at.
