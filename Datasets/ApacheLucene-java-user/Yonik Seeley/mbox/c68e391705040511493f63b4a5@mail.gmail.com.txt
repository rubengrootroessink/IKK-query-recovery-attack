SUBJECT: QueryParser: open ended range queries
DATE: 5 Apr 2005

Was there any later thread on the QueryParser supporting open ended
range queries after this:
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg07973.html

Just curious.  I plan on overriding the current getRangeQuery() anyway
since it currently doesn't run the endpoints through the analyzer.
