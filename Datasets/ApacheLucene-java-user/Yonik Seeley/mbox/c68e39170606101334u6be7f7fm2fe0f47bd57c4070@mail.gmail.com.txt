Interesting... how many documents are in your collection?
It would prob be nice to make the HashDocSet cutt-off dynamic rather than fixed.
Are you using Solr, or just some of it's code?

I checked in the OpenBitSet changes today.  I imagine this will lower
the optimal max HashDocSet size for performance a little.  You might
not see much performance improvement if most of the intersections
involved a HashDocSet... the OpenBitSet improvements only kick in with
bitset<->bitset intersection counts.
