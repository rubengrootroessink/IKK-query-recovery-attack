Well, if I search for blue kangaroo, the coord is nice to get
documents with "blue" and "kangaroo" to score higher than documents
with just one term.  And among documents with just one term, the idf
factor will make "kangaroo" rank above "blue", which is generally
desired.

I have seen complaints about the default similarity though, where the
coord factor does not give enough of a boost in relation to the idf of
some of the individual terms.
