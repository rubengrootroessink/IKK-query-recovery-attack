This won't fully work.  You still need to delete the
original out of the lucene index to avoid it showing
up in searches.

Example:
myfile v1:  "I want a cat"
myfile v2:  "I want a dog"

If you change "cat" to "dog" in myfile, and then do a
search for "cat", you will *only* get v1 and hence the
sort on version doesn't help.
