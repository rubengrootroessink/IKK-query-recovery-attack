Yes.  The highest docId will always be the last document added, and
docIds are never re-arranged with respect to each other.

So if you do an addDocument(), it will have an id of maxDoc()-1
*But* beware of renumbering caused by squeezing out of deleted docs on
segment merges, as I mentioned in the last message.
