Do you want to search for the unstemmed term, or just be able to retrieve it?

When you retrieve a document, you get the un-analyzed original fields.

If you want to index both the stemmend and unstemmed terms, the
easiest way is to add the field twice (the second time using a
different field name) and use different analyzers for the different
fields.
