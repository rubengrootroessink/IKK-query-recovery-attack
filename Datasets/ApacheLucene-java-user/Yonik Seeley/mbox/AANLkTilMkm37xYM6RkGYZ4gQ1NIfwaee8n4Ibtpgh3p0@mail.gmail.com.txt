Solr has a function range query that can filter out any values outside
of the given range.

And of course, a function query can consist of a normal relevancy
query... so here is a lucene query of "text:solr" with a lower bound
of 0 exclusive:

http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q={!frange l=0
incl=false}query($qq)&qq=text:solr
