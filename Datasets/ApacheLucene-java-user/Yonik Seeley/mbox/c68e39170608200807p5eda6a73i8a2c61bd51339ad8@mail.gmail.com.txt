If you specify the type of sort you want, this shouldn't happen.
Letting Lucene guess the type (AUTO) shouldn't be done in a production
environment IMO.

Thinking about it though, I'm not sure why we need an exception thrown
in the case where there are no fields... that means all docs are equal
and we can simply select a string sort.

This made me thing of another failure mode for AUTO sorting (besides
guessing wrong or not having documents with that field)... a different
type could be guessed for different subsearchers.
