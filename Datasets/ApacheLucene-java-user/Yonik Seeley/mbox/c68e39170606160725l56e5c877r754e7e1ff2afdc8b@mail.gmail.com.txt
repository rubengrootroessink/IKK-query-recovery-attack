Interesting question... I assume this is so you can do something like
retrieve the top terms for a field and have it more readable by an
end-user?

I don't think there is a way built into Lucene, but you could get
mostly there by keeping a reverse mapping yourself.  Run a dictionary
of common words through the stemmer and keep track of what word
generated the stemmed word.
