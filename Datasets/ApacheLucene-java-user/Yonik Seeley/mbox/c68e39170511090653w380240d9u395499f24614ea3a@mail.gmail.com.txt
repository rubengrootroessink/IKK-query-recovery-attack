SUBJECT: Re: RangeQuery over many indexed documents seems to be buggy
DATE: 9 Nov 2005

The limited number of terms in a range query should hopefully be
addressed before Lucene 1.9 comes out.

I'd give you a reference to the bug, but JIRA seems like it's
currently down.  search for ConstantScoreRangeQuery if interested.
