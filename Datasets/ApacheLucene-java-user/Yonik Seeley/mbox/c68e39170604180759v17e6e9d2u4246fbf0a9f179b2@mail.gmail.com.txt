I think he means a different analyzer for search than is used for
indexing.  It can make sense in certain cases.

Solr has a WordDelimiterFilter that handles hyphen (and many other)
cases like this.
It can make wi-fi match a query of wifi or "wi fi" or "WiFi".  Solr
also allows easy specification of different analyzers for index vs
query time.
