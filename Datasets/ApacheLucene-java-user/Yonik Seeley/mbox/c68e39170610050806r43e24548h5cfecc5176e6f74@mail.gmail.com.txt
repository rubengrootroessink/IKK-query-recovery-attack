that sort sees them as Integers and discards the last four numbers since an integer isn't
large enough. I tried using SortField.STRING instead but then constantrangequery breaks (date:[200501010101
TO 200601010101] returns 0 hits).

Using SortField.STRING should work, both with sorting and range
queries via RangeFilter or ConstantScoreRangeQuery.
