TermDocs should also always return documents in ascending order for a
single term (that's how they are stored internally).

The scorers, and a general agreement.  The older BooleanScorer did
some document re-arrangement, but still relied on every other Scorer
delivered documents in-order.
The new BooleanScorer2 (default since 1.9) delivers docs in order.
Going in document order makes the whole process of matching/scoring
efficient.
