Definitely.  Solr uses Java5, so it would need to be backported.

People may also be interested in the SynonymFilter Solr uses, as it
can handle multi-word synonyms.  I kept that one at a Java 1.4
language level with the intent on contributing it to Lucene.
See the bottom of
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters for an
example synonym config file.
