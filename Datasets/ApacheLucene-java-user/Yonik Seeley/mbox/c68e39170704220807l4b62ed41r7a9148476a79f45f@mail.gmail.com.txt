Two issues with that:
1) You never *gain* information by normalizing in this manner.  If
non-normalized scores aren't directly comparable, then neither will
normalized scores be.
2) To normalize by dividing by the max score, you need to know the max
score.  As hits are being collected in the HitCollector, the max score
is not yet known.
