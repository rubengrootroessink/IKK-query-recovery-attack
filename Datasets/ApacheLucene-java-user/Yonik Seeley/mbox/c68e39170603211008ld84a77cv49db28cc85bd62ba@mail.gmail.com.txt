A MultiSearcher can search over Searchables, which can be remote, etc.
A MultiReader is for local indicies.  When you open an IndexReader or
IndexSearcher on a single index with multiple segments, MultiReader is
actually used under the covers.  You can also instantiate a
MultiReader with multiple IndexReaders.

An IndexSearcher with a MultiReader (when you can use it) should be
faster and more efficient than a MultiSearcher across multiple
IndexSearchers.
