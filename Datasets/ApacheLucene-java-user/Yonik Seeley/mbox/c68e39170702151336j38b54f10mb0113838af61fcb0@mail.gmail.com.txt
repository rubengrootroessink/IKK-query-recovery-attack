Interfaces vs abstract classes again :-)
Users sometimes like interfaces better because they can essentially do
multiple-inheritance, but providers (like us) should prefer abstract
classes
because it allows us to add new methods and provide backward compatible
implementations.

IndexReader.hasNorms(), Analyzer.getPositionIncrementGap(), etc, have
all been possible to add in a back-compatible manner becuase they were
based on classes and not interfaces.
