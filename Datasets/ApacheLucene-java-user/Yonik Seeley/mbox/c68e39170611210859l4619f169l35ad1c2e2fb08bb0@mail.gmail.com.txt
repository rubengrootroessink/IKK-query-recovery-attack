The original BooleanScorer was a bucket-based scorer that could
deliver docs out of order and thus restricted how it could be used.
It also had a limitation of 32 required or prohibited clauses (because
of an int bitmask).

BooleanScorer2 removes these limitations, and uses skipTo() where
applicable on sub-scorers.
