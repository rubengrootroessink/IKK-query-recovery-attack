Looks like interesting stuff Mark, but why did you make everything so
configurable (syntax-wise)?  IMO, there is a lot of value to
standards, and doing things like changing the precedence of operators
isn't necessarily a good thing :-)

Did you ever get a chance to look at Paul's surround language? (I've
never had the chance to dive into it myself)

The QueryParser does this instead of TokenFilters?
Is it based on static configuration?
