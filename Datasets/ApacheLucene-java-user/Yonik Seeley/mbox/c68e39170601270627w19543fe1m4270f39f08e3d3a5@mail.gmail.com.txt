Very much so... fdiv commonly takes 20 to 40 clock cycles, depending
on precision.  fmul commonly takes 3 clock cycles.   Same thing holds
with integer multiplication and division.

If one doesn't want normalized scores, they should use the expert
level search routines that return TopDocs or TopFieldDocs.
