This boosts apple 3 times in relation to the other query clauses.  If
there are no other query clauses, it's a bit meaningless.

Lucene does some "weighting" of the query that causes this to happen.

class Query { [...]
  /** Expert: Constructs and initializes a Weight for a top-level query. */
  public Weight weight(Searcher searcher)
    throws IOException {
    Query query = searcher.rewrite(this);
    Weight weight = query.createWeight(searcher);
    float sum = weight.sumOfSquaredWeights();
    float norm = getSimilarity(searcher).queryNorm(sum);
    weight.normalize(norm);
    return weight;
  }

Are you simply curious about this, or is it causing you a problem somehow?
