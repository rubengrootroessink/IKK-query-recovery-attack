That still wouldn't solve two JVMs (or even two webapps) trying to
grab the same lock and getting an exception, correct?

It seems like it's possible to immediately get an IOException while
opening an IndexReader or IndexWriter w/o the wait/retry logic kicking
in.  So perhaps IOException should be caught by obtain() and false
returned (i.e. treated as a failure to aquire)?
