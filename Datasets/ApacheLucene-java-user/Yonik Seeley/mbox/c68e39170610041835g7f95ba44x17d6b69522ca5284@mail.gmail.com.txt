Hi Tom,
The query you want is
name:[A TO C] name:[G TO K]
(each clause being SHOULD, or put another way, an implicit "OR" in between.

The problem may be how you analyze the name field... is it tokenized at all?
If so, you might be matching on first, last, and middle names, and the
combination of everything may match most of your documents.
