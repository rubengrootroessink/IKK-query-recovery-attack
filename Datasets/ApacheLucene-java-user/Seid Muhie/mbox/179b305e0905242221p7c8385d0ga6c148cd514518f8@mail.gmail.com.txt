SUBJECT: Re: How to extract 15/20 words around the matched query after getting	results from lucene searcher?
DATE: 25 May 2009

for my thesis work (Question Answering) I used to retrieve first the
document and then play with java to extract the needed answer.
for your case what you will do is first locate the positions of the
query terms in the document (in this case it might be distributed
throughout the document - hence difficult to get the 15/20 words) then
count something10 words forward and backward and extract the match.
this is the way I handle my problem. Hope there might be different I
dea too
