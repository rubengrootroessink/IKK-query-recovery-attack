Hi,

If you store only IDs in Lucene, you won't be able to search using
> keywords (text).


Let me explain better. Suppose I have an index field called categories which 
contains a list of ids for each post. For example - 1 2 45 198. Now I can 
search on the contents field but restricted to all posts under a particular 
category by using -

"content:java and category:45 or 198". 

Note - Not exact syntax but I hope you get the picture. Anything wrong with 
this approach?

That way you get PG+Lucene in a single package.

That would be a killer combo. 

But what I would like to know is if anybody on this list has used tsearch2 
but later moved on to lucene because of reasons of speed, search 
flexibility, etc.

Thanks,

Deepak
