SUBJECT: Index design question
DATE: 6 Aug 2005

Hi list,

Let me describe my issue taking a simpler model. Lets say I were to build a 
blog which allows each post to have multiple keywords. I want to provide a 
search over the posts but restricted to a subset of the keywords (say - 
python, windows, etc.). How can I structure the index in this case. I had 
though of 2 fields, one a list of keyword ids and the other for post 
contents. (The reason why I go for keyword ids is because the keyword is a 
foreign key whose string could be changed independent of the post). What do 
you think?

Also, from a design orientation for the use case I described above, would it 
be better to go for something like tsearch2 (I use postgres) in this case 
because keyword searching is just one way of searching in my app. The data 
could be searched across many other fields which are being done by sql's. 
Does it really help in using something like lucene because I am worried 
about the burden of maintaing the 2 data repositories (db and lucene index) 
in sync. I am asking this because if I go for tsearch2 the data is in only 1 
place and also updates, deletes to the data are handled for free by the db 
for me.

Does anybody have any suggestion?

Regards,
 
Deepak
