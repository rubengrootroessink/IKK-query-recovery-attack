Hi Folks,
 
I have the following problem:
We have a very large list of special words or phrases that should match if
they occur in a document. The idea was to fill the index with all these
phrases and use the document as the query. Then we expect a 100% match for
phrases that occur "exact" in the documents, for others the score should be
less than 1.
 
Example: 
 
Querydocument: 
 von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a large multimeric glycoprotein synthesized
exclusively by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes (1). 
 
 
Index contains the following phrases:
 
(1) von Willebrand
(2) glycoprotein
(3) endothelial glycoprotein
(4) multimeric megakaryocytes
 
 
So the result should be:
(1) Score: 1
(2) Score: 1
(3) Score: less than 1
(4) Score: less than 1
 
Is there any way of doing this with lucene?
 
Thanks and best whishes,
Sven
