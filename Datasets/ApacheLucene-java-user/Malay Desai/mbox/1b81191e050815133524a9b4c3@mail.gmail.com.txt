SUBJECT: coord factor and MultiFieldSearch

Hi,

I have a question on the way coord factors affects multi-field searches. It 
looks like the sum of individual field hit scores is multiplied by a coord 
factor of (x/y) where x = no. of fields matched and y = total fields. This 
seems to penalize some results, where we get a very good quality hits just 
in one field (say in the heading field) compared to less important matches 
in multiple fields. I understand that I can tune field boosts but even with 
that this coord factor seems to play a role. Can anyone explain how this is 
supposed to work and also how overriding the coord in the similarity would 
affect other things?

Thanks.
