Hello,
 
I 've a problem with data i try to index with lucene. I browse a
directory and index text from different types of files throw parsers.
 
For text files, data could be in different languages so different
encoding. If data are in Turkish for exemple, all special characters and
accents are not recognized in my lucene index. Is there a way to resolve
problem? How do I work with the encoding ?
 
Thanks for your help

A.
