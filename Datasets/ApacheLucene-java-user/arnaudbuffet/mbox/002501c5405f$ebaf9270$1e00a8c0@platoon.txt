Hello,
 
Today I need few explanations about the possibilities of lucene in order
to implement development on an application.
 
First, I have to index different things; documents files and bdd tables
to make a search on all theses elements. Is it possible? How can I index
both elements? For the search, I have to use a MultiSearcher ?
 
Then I want to have different score for my results. For exemple, if the
user keyword is found in a specific bdd field I want this results appear
before others. How can I do "ponderation" on different fields and
documents for the results ?
 
About the keywords written by a user, how can I filter them? Maybe some
are not useful for the search and other like "AND" can combine results
search? 
 
Then, I have right permission on documents, is there a way with lucene
to introduction these permissions for the search ? if I do not have
permission, results are filtered ?
 
Thanks for your answers,
 
Regards
 
Arnaud
