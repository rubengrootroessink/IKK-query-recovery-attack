Hi ;
 
I recently upgrade Lucene into a java application to current release
2.0. 
 
As all know the way to write indexed data change with notion of
Field.Store and Field.Index into the lucene document.
 
Every thing I read seems confused . 
 
Is anyone help me quickly with better option to use to index data for
searching into by Query ? (With better size & performance optimization
too):
 
- Data like internal serial number, id of document witch are not used by
search: new Field(ID, "102154", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED) ?
 
- Data like attribute to document like author, year of publication witch
are not use for search: new Field(author, "Prat", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.NO)?
 
- Data like keywords or title witch are used by search Query: new
Field(KEYWORS, "book", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED)?
 
- Date like date witch are used by search Query with Range Filter: new
Field(DATE, "book", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED)?
 
- Data like comments or description witch are not used by the search: ?
new Field(ID, "102154", Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.NO)
 
 
ths for all
