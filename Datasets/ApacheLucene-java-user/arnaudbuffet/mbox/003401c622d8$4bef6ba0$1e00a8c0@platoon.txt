DATE: 27 Jan 2006

Hello and thanks for your answer.

I do not find the ISOLatin1AccentFilter class in my lucene jar, but I find one on google attach
to this mail, could you tell me if it is the good one?

I do not see anything in this class which can help me. This program will replace some accent
characters but my problem is:

if I try to index a text file encoded in Western 1252 for exemple with the Turkish text "düzenlediğimiz
kampanyamıza" the lucene index will contain re encoded data with &#0;&#17;k&#0;&#0;
....

Thanks & regards

A.

I've been looking at a similar problem recently. There's 
org.apache.lucene.analysis.ISOLatin1AccentFilter on the svn trunk which 
may be quite close to what you want. I have a perl script here that I 
used to generate downgrading table for a C program. I can let you have 
the perl script as is, but if there's enough interest(*) I'll use it to 
generate, say, CompoundAsciiFilter since it converts compound characters 
like á, æ, ﬃ (ffi-ligature, in case it doesn't display) to a, ae and 
ffi. It's actually built from 
http://www.unicode.org/Public/4.1.0/ucd/UnicodeData.txt so it winds up 
having nearly 1200 entries. An earlier version converted all compound 
characters to their constient parts, but this version just converts 
characters that are made up entirely of ASCII and modifiers.

(*) Any interest, actually. Might be enough for me to be interested.
