I believe there's a MatchAllDocsQuery class from Lucene 1.9 onwards. You
can run this query to get all documents.

If you are not using 1.9, to my knowledge, you would have to add a
redundant field that would true for all documents and query on that
field. Something like Field.Keyword("AllDocsTrue", "true") and add this
to your doc. You can run the query AllDocsTrue:true to get all your
docs.

Subject: Get All Entries



Hello Everyone,

I have 6000 Entries in my Lucene DB and if I search for entries with
"00*"
in the Number-Field it works fine. But additional I must have alle
entries
no matter which number they have. A Term like "*" doesn't work. How can
I
get all entries?
The code of my search is:
			IndexSearcher is = new IndexSearcher( INDEX_DIR
);

			QueryParser parser = new QueryParser( "number",
analyzer);
			Query query = parser.parse("00*");
			
			Hits hits = is.search( query, new Sort("number")
);

Thanks for your help

Stefan H
