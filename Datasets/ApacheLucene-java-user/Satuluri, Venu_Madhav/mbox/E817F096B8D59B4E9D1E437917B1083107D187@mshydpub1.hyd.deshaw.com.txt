SUBJECT: Keeping RAMDirectory and filesystem index in sync
DATE: 13 Mar 2006

Hi,

Is there an elegant way to keep RAMDirectory and my file-system based
index in sync? I have a java class that is periodically started up by
crond that checks for modified documents and then reindexes them onto
the filesystem. However, for searching I want to use RAMDirectory (for
the performance benefits). The process that searches is alive all the
time (its in the backend of a webapp), and is different from the process
that indexes. 

Thanks,
Venu
