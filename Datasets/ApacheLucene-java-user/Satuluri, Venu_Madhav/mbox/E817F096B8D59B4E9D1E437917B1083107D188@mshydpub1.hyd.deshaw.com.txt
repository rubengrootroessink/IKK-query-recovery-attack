Thanks, Jens. Seems like this would be pretty complicated. 

It seems the best way would be not have a separate daemon for indexing modifiied documents,
but just have the reindexing part in the backend itself (it would know when any documents
were modifiied), but since it would involve some code/design change, I thought I should first
find out if there was any way I could lessen the work.

You could somehow (HTTP, Database flag, some messaging system) ping your 
backend from your Indexing process, once it's finished. 
The Searching process then would have to re-open it's RAMDirectory. 

Or you check the version of the fs-based index from time to time, to see
when it has changed. Using IndexReader.getCurrentVersion (path_to_index)
this shouldn't be too expensive. But there's the risk that you re-open
your RAMDirectory in the middle of an index update, since the version 
changes on every single modification done to the index.

I don't know of any more elegant ways.
