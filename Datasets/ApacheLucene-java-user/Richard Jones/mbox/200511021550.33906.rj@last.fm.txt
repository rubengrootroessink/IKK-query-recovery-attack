SUBJECT: Re: Creating document fields by providing termvector directly (bypassing the analyzing/tokenizing stage)
DATE: 2 Nov 2005

Hi Erik
Our lucene-powered music search went live this week, so your search should 
work now: http://www.last.fm/explore/search.php?q=Michael+Hedges
Before we discovered lucene our search sucked *really* badly ;)

Adding multiple fields like this is similar to what i'm doing now (i am using 
whitespace analyzer), although it may remove some of the work, i'd still have 
to add in the extra steps of building strings instead of handing over a 
termvector durectly.

I guess i need to delve into the lucene code see what's going on.

Cheers,
RJ
