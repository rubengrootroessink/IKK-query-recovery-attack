We used to do this, but there is a lot of overhead involved in 
updating/deleting/inserting all those rows / db indexes More wasted cycles 
and disk activity than we see with lucene. Even ignoring the fancy ACID stuff 
with MyISAM (no ref. integrity) it's still slower.

Furthermore, with lucene i can query "artists:1" and it returns what lucene 
deems to be the "best" matches for artist 1 (radiohead). This is far easier 
that with an SQL database, because the person whose listen counter for 
radiohead is highest isnt necessarily the "biggest fan". it depends on the 
size of the profile.  This gets even more complicated when trying to find the 
"best" fan of a combination of a few artists. Lucene is more useful for this 
than a database query.
