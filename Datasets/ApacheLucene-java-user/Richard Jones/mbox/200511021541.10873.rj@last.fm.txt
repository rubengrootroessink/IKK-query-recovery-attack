Hi, thanks for the feedback.
The data i'm dealing with is stored over a few mysql dbs on different 
machines, horizontally partitioned so each user is assigned to a single db. 
The queries i'm doing can be done in SQL in parallel over all machines then 
combined, which i've tested - it's unacceptably slow :(

There is rather a lot of data; each profile can contain in excess of 1000 
artists, and there are almost 1million profiles created. I'm only adding the 
top N artists for each user to a lucene index, which is fast and still yields 
good results (even with just the top 100 artists each).

I think this could be done reasonably well with SQL in a DBMS like Oracle RAC 
or something like mysql cluster.. sadly the former doesnt scale financially, 
and the latter requires everything to be held in RAM .. which is why i'm 
using lucene.

Regards,
RJ
