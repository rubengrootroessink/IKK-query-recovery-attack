Hi,
I am having 1,00,000 documents in a index but in near future it will be 3 million and more.
 I am somewhat concerned about  the searhing process with this much number of document.  I
am giving order on some fields of documents. Could anybody tell be the expected result from
lucene engine with 3 million results and order/sorted on 4 column. 

Thanks,
Manoj
