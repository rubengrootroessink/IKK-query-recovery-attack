SUBJECT: controlled indexing with Lucene
DATE: 28 Nov 2008

Hi, 
I'm going to index some documents only with known phrases. Let me describe:  
Suppose that I have a controlled vocabulary of phrases (A list of some candidate phrases).
I intend to
index ONLY these phrases within my documents and have a retrieval model
(for example simple VS-TF.IDF) that each index item is a predefined
phrase.  
Could anyone tell me how to do it with Lucene?   
Greatly appreciate any comment or answer.
Kind regards.
