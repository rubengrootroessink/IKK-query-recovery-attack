SUBJECT: I don't find MultipleTermPositions in svn
DATE: 27 Jun 2010

This is dumb, I know, but I don't find a MultipleTermPositions.java file under org.apache.lucene.index
in the svn trunk.  Will someone on the list have mercy on me and tell me what obvious thing
I'm missing?  I know it's there somewhere.
