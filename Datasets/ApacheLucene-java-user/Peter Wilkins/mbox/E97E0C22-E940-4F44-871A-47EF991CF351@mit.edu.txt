SUBJECT: example of processing tokens from query results?
DATE: 29 Jun 2010

Can someone point me to a code example that demonstrates processing tokens from a query result?
 I want to iterate over TermPositions but can't find my way to an object that instantiates
that interface.  

Thank you for the assistance,
Peter
