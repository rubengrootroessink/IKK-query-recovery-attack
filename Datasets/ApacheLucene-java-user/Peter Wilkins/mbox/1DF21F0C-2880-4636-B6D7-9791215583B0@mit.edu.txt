SUBJECT: example of processing terms in query results?
DATE: 29 Jun 2010

Can someone point me to a code example that demonstrates processing terms from a query result?
 I want to extract payloads from the terms that are selected by the query.  I'm having difficulty
getting to an object in the query result that implements getPayload().

Thank you for the assistance,
Peter
