SUBJECT: Indexing with Lucene & Crash Recovery
DATE: 2 Oct 2003

Hi,

I'm working on a framework using 
Lucene for information retrieval. 

The Framework will be  deployed on 
multiple hosts in a production 
environment. I plan to implement a
crash recovery feature. 

I'd like to know if an index can be 
corrupted during the different index
writing operations ( adding a document, 
delete a document , merging segments, 
merging index ). 

I think index could be corrupted by a 
system crash ( in some case corrupted, 
in some case ok ) but i want to be sure. 

If anyone has worked on 
rollback/commit/recovery with lucene, i'd 
like to know which strategy he choosed. 

thanks for your help,
