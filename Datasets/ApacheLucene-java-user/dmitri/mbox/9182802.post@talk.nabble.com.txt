SUBJECT: ParallelSearcher in multi-node environment
DATE: 27 Feb 2007


Hi,

I want to execute parallel search over several machines. But
ParallelSearcher doesn't look perfect. It creates threads and spawns many
requests to the underlying Searchables (over a network) for a single search.
Is there a decent implementation of the parallel search over remote indexes
somewhere?

----------------------
Thank you
  Dmitri
