Mike, thanks for reply.

Can you please elaborate a little bit more on " If you don't need norms
(don't boost, lengths don't vary much or you
don't care to have field length impact scoring) you can omit norms"?

When do you expect the handling of nested document will be applicable?

Cheng

30 fields is fine, but if they are all indexed you should watch out
for memory usage.  Ie, norms require 1 byte per doc per indexed field.
 If you don't need norms (don't boost, lengths don't vary much or you
don't care to have field length impact scoring) you can omit norms.

The relationship b/w Group and Subgroup is not something Lucene can do
today -- all docs are "independent" in a Lucene index.

So.. you can either "denormalize", meaning duplicate all Group fields
onto each subgroup, or you can check out
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2454 which I think adds
exactly what you need.  It's not yet committed, but we are finally
starting to make progress towards that, eg
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3112
