SUBJECT: how to search multiple fields
DATE: 25 May 2011

Hi,

 

Quite a few Lucene examples on lines shows how to insert multiple fields
into a Document and how to query the indexed file with certain fields and
queried text. I would like to know:

 

1.       How to do a cross-field search?

2.       How to specify some key fields as well as some less important
fields?

3.       How many fields would cause performance issue?

 

Thanks!
