Makes sense. Thanks

This is the code, right?
http://java.codefetch.com/example/in/LuceneInAction/src/lia/indexing/FSversusRAMDirectoryTest.java

The test is problematic as the same two tests run sequentially.

If you change 
  long ramTiming = timeIndexWriter(ramDir);
  long fsTiming = timeIndexWriter(fsDir);
to
  long fsTiming = timeIndexWriter(fsDir);
  long ramTiming = timeIndexWriter(ramDir); 
my guess is that RAMDirectory will be faster. For a better
comparison, perform each test in separate runs (make a test
class just for RAMDirectory and one just for FSDirectory,
then run them one at a time, each in its own JVM).

One big problem when comparing RAMDirectory to file-access
is caching. What you measure with a test might not be what
you see in production, as the production index might be
large compared to RAM available for file caching.
