I did run it on a 64bit win7 and use Lucene 3.0.3. The result that FSD outperforms RAM in this
case seems to be consistent as I ran a bunch of tests.

My wild guess is that FSD can leverage the MMapDirectory advantage as well as the three tuning
parameters. Just a thought.

Hi,

It depends on the Lucene version, so if the test uses latest Lucene on a
64bit OS, it may use MMapDirectory internally (returned on
FSDirectors.open()) - then its comparing the same with the same - reading
from ram memory :-)

Maybe the difference is also caused by not warming hotspot's compiler. Those
times are only ok, if you repeat the same code path quite often and only use
the recent results and not the ones from the first iterations 8AS Java's
hotspot is still optimizing).

We did not got any information about how these numbers were measured.
