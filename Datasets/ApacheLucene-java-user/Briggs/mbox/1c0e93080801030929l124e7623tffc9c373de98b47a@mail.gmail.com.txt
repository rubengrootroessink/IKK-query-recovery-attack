I'll give a quick opinion, and remember that is all it is.

Without more information of the types of documents your are storing, I
would say you are definitely going in the wrong direction.  In my
opinion, an index should describe the common attributes of all the
documents it contains.  You should not be designing an index with a
field commonality between documents of, in your case ~10%;  it should
be 100%.

Perhaps you should be creating multiple indexes that describe the
different types of documents (and I mean document in a lucene sense)?
Or perhaps you are being to fine grained within the content of your
fields?

But, from the sound of it, you have extremely disparate data that you
are trying to cram into a single index.  Like trying to index a car, a
lemon and a thought within the same index. I really don't like
bringing relational database comparisons in but this does sound like
you need to normalize that index and create some 'sub-indexes'.  Null
values, imho, are not good for an index.
