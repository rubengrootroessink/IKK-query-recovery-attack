SUBJECT: Modify index on database update
DATE: 3 Aug 2006

Hi,
   
  My application database can be updated outside the application also. Whenever there is a
change in database by some other source, I want to update my index.
   
  Is there any way to do so?
   
  I am using Java and the database is DB2. I saw the DB2 UDF. But I have to put the jar inside
the DB2 installation directory. I dont know how to communicate with my application/update
index.
   
  Any help would be appreciated.
   
  Thanks,
  -Vasu
