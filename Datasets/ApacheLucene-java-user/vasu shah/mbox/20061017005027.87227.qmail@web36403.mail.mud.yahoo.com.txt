SUBJECT: PrefixFilter and WildcardQuery
DATE: 17 Oct 2006

Hi,

I have have multiple fields that I need to search on. All these fields need to support wildcard
search. I am ANDing these search fields using BooleanQuery. There is no need for score in
my search.

How do I implement these. I have seen PrefixFilter and it sounds promising. But then how do
I implement search for multiple fields (AND)  and using PrefixFilter. I could not find any
discussion related to these.

Any help would be highly appreciated.

Thanks,
-Vasu
