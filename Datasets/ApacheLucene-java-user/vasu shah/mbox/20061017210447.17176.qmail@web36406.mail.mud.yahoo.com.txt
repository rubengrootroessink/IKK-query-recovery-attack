SUBJECT: PrefixFilter Memory Consumption
DATE: 17 Oct 2006

Hi,
   
  Can anyone please tell as to what is the difference between PrefixFilter and WildcardQuery
as far as memory is concerned? 
   
  I saw the code of PrefixFilter and it gets TermEnum for all the terms in the index. Won't
this consume memory??
   
  I started using PrefixFilter, ConstantScoreQuery instead of WildcardQuery to avoid OOM exception.
I am using ChainedFilters to do boolean logic for the filters.
   
  Thanks again for all the help.
