Thanks Mike. Your explanation was really helpful. 
   
  I would use the IndexModifier class till the new IndexWriter class comes up.
   
  Thanks once again.

This is exactly why IndexModifier was created (so you wouldn't have to 
worry about the details of closing/opening IndexReader/IndexWriter). 
There is also additional locking under the hood of those two classes 
that is abstracting away concurrency details so you don't have to worry 
about them.

Definitely. This is indeed one of the common sources of confusion about 
Lucene: the fact that you have to carefully open/close these two classes 
to do common operations is odd; the fact that you need an IndexReader to 
do deletes is "unexpected" (one would expect IndexWriter to do that).

There is work underway to enable IndexWriter to [efficiently] handle 
deletes -- there's been alot of lively discussion on lucene-dev & 
several iterations on possible patches -- see here:

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-565

But this is very much "in process" now. I don't know of anything else 
in the nightly builds (since 2.0) that address these issues yet.
