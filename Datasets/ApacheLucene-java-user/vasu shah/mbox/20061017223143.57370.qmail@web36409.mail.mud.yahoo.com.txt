SUBJECT: Re: PrefixFilter Memory Consumption
DATE: 17 Oct 2006

Thanks for the explanation. 

I am using ChainedFilter and it is taking some more time than using just one Filter.

I read somewhere on the lucene forums that the speed can be increased for Filters if we have
a large bitset and then work on it. Is it possible and if yes, how? I would like to know the
technique.

Thanks once again.

Won't this consume memory??

It takes time, not memory.  TermEnum is like an iterator - it doesn't
keep everything it iterates over in memory.  The memory for filters
will be for the bitset (1 bit for every document in the index, so a 1M
doc index will take 125KB of mem per filter).

Both PrefixQuery and PrefixFilter need to use a TermEnum, the
difference is what they do with the resulting terms.
