SUBJECT: Indexmodifier optimize
DATE: 24 Aug 2006

Hi,
  I added one record to the index and did flush(), optimize() and close() in that order.
  I had one index file _twca.cfs. After the inserting the document and doing optimization,
I have two index files _twca.cfs and _twcf.cfs (both approx. same size) and deletable file
having entry for _twca.cfs.
   
  Can anyone help me what could be the problem.
   
  Thanks,
  -Vasu
