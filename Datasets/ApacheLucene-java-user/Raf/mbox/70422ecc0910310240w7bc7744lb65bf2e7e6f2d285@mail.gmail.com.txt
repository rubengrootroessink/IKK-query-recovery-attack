If you search "A B" (with quotes) it is correct, but if you search only A B
(without quotes) it is not correct, because, by default the query parser
creates "OR" queries.
So searching   A B  you will find all documents that contains A or B, while
searching only A or only B you will normally find less documents!
If you want to search all documents that contains A and B, you should write
the query as +A +B (or change the default operator for query parser from OR
to AND).
