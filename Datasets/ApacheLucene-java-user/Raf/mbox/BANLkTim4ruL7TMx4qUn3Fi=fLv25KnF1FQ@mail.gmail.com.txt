You can always "create" your query by hand, using the various Query objects.

For example:
   BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
   bq.add(new TermQuery(new Term("account", myAccount)), Occur.MUST);
   bq.add(new TermQuery(new Term("strategy", myStrategy)), Occur.MUST);
   bq.add(new TermQuery(new Term("account", myAccount)), Occur.MUST);
   bq.add(new TermRangeQuery("date", minDate, maxDate, false, false),
Occur.MUST);
and so on.
