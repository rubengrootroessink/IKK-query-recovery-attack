SUBJECT: One problem of using the lucene
DATE: 16 Jan 2006

Hi,

I got a problem of using the lucene.

I write a SynonymFilter which can add synonyms from the WordNet. Meanwhile,
i used the SnowballFilter for term stemming. However, i got a problem when
combining the two fiters.

For instance, i got 17 documents containing the Term "support"  and  the
following is the SynonymAnalyzer i wrote.

/**
*
*/
 public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader){


        TokenStream result = new StandardTokenizer(reader);
        result = new StandardFilter(result);
        result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);
        if (stopword != null){
          result = new StopFilter(result, stopword);
        }

        result = new SnowballFilter(result, "Lovins");

       result = new SynonymFilter(result, engine);

        return result;
    }

If i only used the SnowballFilter, i can find the "support" in the 17
documents. However, after adding the SynonymFilter, the "support" can only
be found in 10 documents. It seems the term "support" cannot be found in the
left 7 documents. I dont know what's wrong with it.
