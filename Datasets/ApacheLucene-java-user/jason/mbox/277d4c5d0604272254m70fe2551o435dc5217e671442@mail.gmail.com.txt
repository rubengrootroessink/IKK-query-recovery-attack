SUBJECT: for the similarity measure
DATE: 28 Apr 2006

Hi,

After reading the code, I found the similarity measure in Lucene is not the
same as the cosine coefficient measure commonly used. I dont know it is
correct. And I wonder whether i can use the cosine coefficient measure in
lucene or maybe the Dice's coefficient, Jaccard's coefficient and overlap
coefficient measure.
