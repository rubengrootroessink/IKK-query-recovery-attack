SUBJECT: To understand the queryNorm and fieldNorm
DATE: 6 Feb 2006

Hi,

I have a problem of understanding the queryNorm and fieldNorm.

The following is an example. I try to follow what said in the Javadoc
"Computes the normalization value for a query given the sum of the squared
weights of each of the query terms". But the result is different.

ID:0 C:/PDF2Text/SearchEngine/File/SIG/sigkdd/p374-zhang.pdf|initial rank: 0
0.31900567 = sum of:
  0.03968133 = weight(contents:associ in 920), product of:
    0.60161763 = queryWeight(contents:associ), product of:
      1.326625 = idf(docFreq=830)
      0.45349488 = queryNorm
    0.065957725 = fieldWeight(contents:associ in 920), product of:
      4.2426405 = tf(termFreq(contents:associ)=18)
      1.326625 = idf(docFreq=830)
      0.01171875 = fieldNorm(field=contents, doc=920)
  0.27932435 = weight(contents:rule in 920), product of:
    0.7987842 = queryWeight(contents:rule), product of:
      1.7613963 = idf(docFreq=537)
      0.45349488 = queryNorm
    0.34968686 = fieldWeight(contents:rule in 920), product of:
      16.941074 = tf(termFreq(contents:rule)=287)
      1.7613963 = idf(docFreq=537)
      0.01171875 = fieldNorm(field=contents, doc=920)
