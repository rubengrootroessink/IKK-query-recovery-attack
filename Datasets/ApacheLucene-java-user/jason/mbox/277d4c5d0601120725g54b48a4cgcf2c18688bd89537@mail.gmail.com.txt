hiï¼Œ

i am trying to use the Lucene WordNet program for my application. However, i
got some problems.

When i incorporate these files,  Syns2Index.java, SynLookup.java, and
SynExpand.java, I find some variables are not defined.

For instance, in Syns2Index. java,

        writer.setMergeFactor( writer.getMergeFactor() * 2);  // the
writer.getMergeFactor() is not found in the lucene package.


        writer.setMaxBufferedDocs( writer.getMaxBufferedDocs() * 2); // the
writer.getMaxBufferedDocs() is not found.

also,
   i do not find the definition of the Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED in the Field.java.

how can i handler this problem?

regards
Xing
