hi Erik,

thx for your reply.

I think the Kowari is a system for searching information in the RDF files.
It is only for finding information in the meta data files. However, i think
one problem of the Semantic Web is that, if we have a document and its RDF
annotate, how do we retrieve the documents? Right now, we can use keyword
based method to find relevant documents to user's query and use some kinds
of technologies for finding metadata files. But can we combine the two
processes and how can we combine them?

regards
Jiang Xing
