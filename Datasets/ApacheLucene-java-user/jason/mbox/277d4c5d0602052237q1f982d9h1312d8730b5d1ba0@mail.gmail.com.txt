DATE: 6 Feb 2006

Hi,

I try to read the source code of the lucene. But i only find in the
TermScorer.java where the tf/idf measure is really implemented. I guess that
whether the Queryparser class will convert each word into a termquery first.
Then, queries such as the the Booleanquery are built.

The source code of the Queryparser.java is hard to read.
....

regards
jiang xing
