SUBJECT: Add a module to the lucene
DATE: 15 Mar 2006

 Hi,

Can we add a module to lucene so that we are able to use our own similarity
measure to calculate the similarity between documents and queries? As lucene
has defined its own measure, we can do few with it.

Considering the documents and queries represented as the vectors, we only
need one class to read the vectors and use our own defined measure to
calculate their similarity.

How do you think of it?

regards
jason
