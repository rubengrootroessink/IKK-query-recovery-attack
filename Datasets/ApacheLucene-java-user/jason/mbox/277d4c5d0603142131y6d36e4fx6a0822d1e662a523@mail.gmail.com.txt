SUBJECT: Add more module to the lucene
DATE: 15 Mar 2006

Hi,

Can we add more module to the lucene so that we can easily use our own
measures to calculate similarity between documents and queries? I have read
some codes of the original lucene, i dont think it is easy to change the
similarity measure used. But i think we can build a module which can read
the vectors of documents from the index structure. Then, we can use our own
similarity measures.


FYI.

Regards

jason.
