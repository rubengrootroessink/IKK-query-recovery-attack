SUBJECT: Use the lucene for searching in the Semantic Web.
DATE: 17 Jan 2006

Hi friends,

How do you think use the lucene for searching in the Semantic Web? I am
trying using the lucene for searching documents with ontological annotation.
But i do not get a better model to combine the keywords information and the
ontological information.
