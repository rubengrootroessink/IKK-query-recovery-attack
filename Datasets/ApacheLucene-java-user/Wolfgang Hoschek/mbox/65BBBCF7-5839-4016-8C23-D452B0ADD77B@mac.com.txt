Thanks for the reminder, I've now added support for per field boost  
to the SVN trunk of MemoryIndex. This comes in the form of the new  
method

	public void addField(String fieldName, TokenStream stream, float boost)

To get it to compile against the latest stable release (2.0.0) you'll  
need to simply remove the following method:

	public Document document(int n, FieldSelector fieldSelector)

(The FieldSelector interface has nothing to do with boosting, and was  
added after 2.0.0. shipped.)

Wolfgang.
