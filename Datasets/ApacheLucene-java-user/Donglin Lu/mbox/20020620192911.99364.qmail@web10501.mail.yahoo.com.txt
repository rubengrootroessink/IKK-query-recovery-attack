SUBJECT: help: build lucene demos with ant
DATE: 20 Jun 2002

Hi,

I am trying to build lucene with ants. Now I have
downloaded the lucene source code and successfully
build the code with Ant. But there is only one file
lucene-1.2-rc6-dev.jar in the bin directory. 

In the binary distribution of Lucene 1.2 RC5, I find
another file: lucene-demos-1.2-RC5.jar. I don't find
any build.xml file to build the demos. How can I build
the demos with ant?

Need your help. Thanks.

Alex
