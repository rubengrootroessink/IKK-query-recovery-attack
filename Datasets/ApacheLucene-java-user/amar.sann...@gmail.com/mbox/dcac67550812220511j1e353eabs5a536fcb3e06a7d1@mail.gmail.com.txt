Hi,

I have problem with lucene search, I am quite new to this. Can some body
help or just push me to who can please.

Problem what I am facing we need search for object whose attribute "chain"
contaning null, but lucene does not help indexing the null values..

how can I achieve this, or please guide me the alternative way of doing
this.

Thanks in advance.
