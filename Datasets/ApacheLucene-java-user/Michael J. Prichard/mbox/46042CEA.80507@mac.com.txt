DATE: 23 Mar 2007

Hello All,

We allow our users to search through our index with a simple textfield.  
The search phrase has "content" as its default value.  This allows them 
to search quickly through content but then when they type "to:blah AND 
from:foo AND content:boogie" it will know to parse,etc.

What I want to do it expand it so when they type a phrase in the 
textfield it will search select all at once and still be smart enough to 
recognize a lucene query.

For example,  say we have these fields:

to
from
content
subject

When I type "michael contract negotiation" it will look through all 
these fields and return hits.

Then it should be able to recognize more advance searches like:

to:michael AND content:foo

and not go through all fields....

Am I making sense?  Is this a good way to provide search?  How would I 
do this?

Thanks,
Michael
