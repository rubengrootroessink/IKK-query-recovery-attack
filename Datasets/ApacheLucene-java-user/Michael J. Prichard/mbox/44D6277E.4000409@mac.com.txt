SUBJECT: Search w/o looking at synonyms?
DATE: 6 Aug 2006

Howdy,

I created some indexes that use a SynonymAnalyzer and now I want to be 
able to offer a choice as to search the synonyms or not.  If I search 
now it will find all docs since the analyzer created tokens in the same 
position.  How do I tell my IndexSearcher to not look at those tokens 
within certain fields?

Thanks,
Michael
