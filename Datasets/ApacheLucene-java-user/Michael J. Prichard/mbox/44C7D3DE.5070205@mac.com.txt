I am using a StandardAnalyzer which (i think) keeps the email intact.   
I think the most I need to do is a PrefixQuery.  Will that work w/ 
UN_TOKENIZED?

Now, say I do want to search on parts...I guess my analyzer would have 
to break the email apart as follows:

michael@foo.com  -->  [michael] [foo] [com] 

??
