SUBJECT: Indexing large sets of documents?
DATE: 27 Jul 2006

I built an indexer that runs through email and its attachments, rips out 
content and what not and then creates a Document and adds it to an 
index.  It works w/ no problem.  The issue is that it takes around 3-5 
seconds per email and I have seen up to 10-15 seconds for email w/ 
attachments.  I need to index 750k emails and at those times it will 
take FOREVER!  I am trying to find places to cut a second or two here or 
there but are there any suggestions as to what I can do?  Should I look 
into parallelizing indexing?  Help?!

Thanks,
Michael
