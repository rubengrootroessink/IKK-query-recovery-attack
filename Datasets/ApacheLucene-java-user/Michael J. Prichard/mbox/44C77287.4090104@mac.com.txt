DATE: 26 Jul 2006

I am working on indexing emails and have stored the data as 
milliseconds.  I was thinking of using a filter w/ my search that would 
only return the email in that data range.  I am currently indexing as 
follows:

doc.add(new Field("date", (String) itemContent.get("date").toString(), 
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));

does this look like a good approach to you all?

Thanks,
Michael
