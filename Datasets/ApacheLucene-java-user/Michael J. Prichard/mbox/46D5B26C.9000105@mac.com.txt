SUBJECT: Large Index Architecture
DATE: 29 Aug 2007

Hello All,

I want to hear from those out there that have large (i.e. 50 GB+) 
indexes on how they have designed their architecture.  I currently have 
an index for email that is 10 GB and growing.  Right now there are no 
issues with it but I am about to get into an even bigger use for the 
software which will surely require access to much larger indexes.  
Should I begin to break off indexes into separate chunks and then search 
across them as needed?

For example, maybe break it out by "Month_Year Or "Day_Month_Year"?  
Ideas and experienced practices welcome!

Thanks,
Michael
