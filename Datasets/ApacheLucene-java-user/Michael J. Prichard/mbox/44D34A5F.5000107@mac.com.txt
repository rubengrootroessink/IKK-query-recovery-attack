Oh boy, how embarrassing for me.  I have never used any unit tests...I 
know I know...don't freak out people :)  I pretty much just started 
really coding in Java.  So, is there anyone out there who has time to 
help me add these to the code?  I would appreciate it and, on the plus 
side, the code will be better tested for the community.

Thanks!
Michael
