SUBJECT: Filters or BooleanQuery
DATE: 31 Jul 2006

This is more of a design question.  I have a ton of email that is 
indexed.  I need to search based on a date range so I use a RangeQuery 
added to a BooleanQuery to search.  This works.  Now I need to include 
another clause that will narrow the result even more.  AND on top of 
that I will need some security applied to the search that will not show 
email to those that it does not belong to.

I could easily go through and add query's but I have a feeling I should 
use a filter somewhere.  What are the best practices when deciding what 
to do?

Thanks,
Michael
