DATE: 18 Jul 2006

That is really cool.  But I am looking for something that I could save 
and then recreate.  I am thinking of building an XML representation such as:

<if arg1="CONTENT" expr="EQ" arg2="aliens">
<then>
   <action type="email" >
       <to value="foo@bar.com" />
       <from value="bar@foo.com" />
       <cc value="foo@bar.com" />
       <message value="blah" />
    </action>
<then>
</if>

or something similar.  I just want to see if anyone has done something 
like this before....

even up to the point of saving searches....do you just save the query?

Thanks,
Michael
