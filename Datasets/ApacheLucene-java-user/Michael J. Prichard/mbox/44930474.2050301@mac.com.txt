SUBJECT: indexing emails
DATE: 16 Jun 2006

I am working on indexing emails and want to have a "to" field.  I am 
currently putting all the emails on one line seperated w/ spaces...example:

michael@foo.bar john@boo.com jane@bar.com

Then i index that with a StandardAnalyzer as follows:

doc.add(new Field("to", (String) itemContent.get("to"), Field.Store.YES, 
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));

Question is...is this the best way to do it?  I want to be able to 
search for michael@foo.bar and pick out just those Documents, etc.

Thanks,
Michael
