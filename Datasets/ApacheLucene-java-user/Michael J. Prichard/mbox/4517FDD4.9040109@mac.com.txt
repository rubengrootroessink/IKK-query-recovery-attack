SUBJECT: "Greater than" equivalent?
DATE: 25 Sep 2006

I have a filtering process that checks my index for various things.  I 
have an "itemid" field in this index and I keep track of the last itemid 
I search up to.  I was wondering if there was an equivalent to doing a 
search with a "greater than" clause?  Sort of like:

to:blah@blah.com AND subject:happy AND itemid: >125688
