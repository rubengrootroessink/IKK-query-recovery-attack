Hey there Teresa.

Short answer: Not directly.

Long answer:  Lucene is a set of libraries built for indexing text and 
then searching those indexes.  Not sure what you mean by indexing a 
database per se.  You could write some code to get the records you want 
from the database and then index those.  For example, if you have a ton 
of articles stored in a database you could grab those articles, pull the 
text, index and then use the lucene index for searches.  Once you found 
something you wanted you could go back to the database for additional 
information.

Hope this helps.
