SUBJECT: Re: indexing emails --> mutliple "to" emails, setting position same
DATE: 18 Jun 2006

So I have emails with multiple recipients (of course, this is very 
common).  I currently put them all on the same string seperated by space 
and then tokenize them with Standard Analyzer.  I was looking into 
SynonymAnalyzers and see that you can drop multiple tokens with the same 
position.  Would this be a better approach to the indexing design 
mentioned above?

Thanks,
Michael
