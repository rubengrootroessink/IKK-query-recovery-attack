DATE: 21 Sep 2007

One index is around 3,000,000 items.  I think around 10 fields.  I store 
some and don't others.  I index email content and attachment content.  I 
store some smaller fields and not the content fields.  That current 
index is around 10GB but that is nothing that is about to come down the 
pike.  Maybe looking at indexes 10x that.

Thoughts?
