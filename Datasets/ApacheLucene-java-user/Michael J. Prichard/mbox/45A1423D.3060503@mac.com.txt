SUBJECT: When to use HitCollector?
DATE: 7 Jan 2007

I have an index which has email and their attachments indexed.  This is 
ok but the issue I am having it when I am trying to filter the 
searches.  For example I can search the content of the email and the 
document (i.e. the attachment) and return the right results.  Basically, 
if it is a document I check the DB to see its parent and determine the 
email to display.  The problem comes in when I try to use to, from 
and/or cc in my searches.  It will only return emails since we did not 
index those fields along with the attachments.  Ideally we would reindex 
and add those but I need a temporary fix until we can do that.  SO...I 
tried a few various things including a basic search and then filtering 
on my own but that seriously slowed our interface since I had to check 
each result, etc.  SO...I broke the query into two...search the docs and 
emails seperately and only check the documents on return.  That is ok.

I was wondering...would HitCollector be something i should use.  
Basically have the searcher check documents to make sure they are ok to 
go (i.e. to, from. etc is correct)? 

Make sense?

Thanks!
Michael
