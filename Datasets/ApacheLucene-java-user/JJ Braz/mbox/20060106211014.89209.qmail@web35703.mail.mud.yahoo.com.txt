SUBJECT: Re: Directory Permissions from Tomcat
DATE: 6 Jan 2006

Follow up: One thing I though I could is to modify the "String usage" line on the IndexHTML
file: 
   
    Currently the line reads: 
   
  String usage = "IndexHTML [-create] [-index <index>] <root_directory>";
   
  I want to modify it to:
   
  String usage = "IndexHTML [-create] [-index <index>] c:\sourcedir";
   
  will this allow Tomcat to read that directory and index the documents in that directory?
Will I need to Ant rebuild the IndexHTML and associated classes? 
  Are my questions relevant to the user mailing list or should I post these on the developer
list? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, J

  After succesfully running the Lucene Demo I'm now trying to customize 
it on a Win XP machine. Using the IndexHTML file I want to create my 
own index, but I'm getting an "Access Denied" error. The files which I 
want to include in the index are in c:\sourcedir and I want the index to 
be created in c:\tomcat\webapps\myidx. I'm using the following 
command.:

C:\tomcat\webapps>java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -
index myidx ..

I'm getting the following error:
Access is denied.

I tried to modify the catalina.policy file by adding the following: 

grant { 
permission java.io.FilePermission "/","read"; 
}; 

This didn't solve my problem. Any idea on how I can set the 
permissions so that the index files can be sourced from and created to the 
directories of my choice? Many thanks
