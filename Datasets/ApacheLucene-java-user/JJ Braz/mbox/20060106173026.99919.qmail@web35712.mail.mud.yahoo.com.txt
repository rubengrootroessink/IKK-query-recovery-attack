SUBJECT: Directory Permissions from Tomcat
DATE: 6 Jan 2006

After succesfully running the Lucene Demo I'm now trying to customize 
it on a Win XP machine. Using the IndexHTML file I want to create my 
own index, but I'm getting an "Access Denied" error. The files which I 
want to include in the index are in c:\sourcedir and I want the index to 
be created in c:\tomcat\webapps\myidx. I'm using the following 
command.:
   
  C:\tomcat\webapps>java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -
index myidx <c:\sourcedir> ..

  I'm getting the following error:
  Access is denied.
   
  I tried to modify the catalina.policy file by adding the following: 
   
  grant { 
permission java.io.FilePermission "/","read"; 
}; 
   
  This didn't solve my problem. Any idea on how I can set the 
permissions so that the index files can be sourced from and created to the 
directories of my choice? Many thanks
