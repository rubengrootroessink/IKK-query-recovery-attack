Oh bliss, Oh joy.. This is exactly what I'm looking for... I'll plunge 
in to it and let you know!

But for the other issue on 'store lucene' vs 'store db'. Does anyone can 
provide me with some field experience on size?
The system I'm developing will provide searching through some 2000 
pdf's, say some 200 pages each. I feed the plain text into Lucene on a 
Field.UnStored bases. I also store this plain text in the database for 
the sole purpose of presenting a context snippet.

If I were to use the Highlighter with a Field.Text, I will not use the 
database plain part altogether. But still I'm a little worried about 
speed/space issues. Or am I just seeing bears-on-the-road (Dutch saying, 
in plain English: making a fuzz about nothing)..
