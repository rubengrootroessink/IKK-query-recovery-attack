Otis,

Problem is though that I'm a little reluctant storing the data 
Field.Text instead of Field.UnStored, because of the shear size of the 
documents and the multitude I would like to index (say some 100paged * 
2k documents).  But than again, it's size versus 
go-back-in-the-db-and-do-your-thing. Can anyone comfort me on these 
figures?

Furthermore, you are saying that the highlighter takes care of the 
corresponding field/words for me and pull up a context snippet? Ouch, 
why haven't I stumpled upon the sandbox....

thanks,
M
