DATE: 2 Nov 2001

I was getting the same error under Windows 2000.  It has something to do
with FileHandles being openned. When we were doing a few searches at the
same time, the file handles went as hight as 2000.  At around 2100, we
started to get this error.  I have searched some documentation, and all the
docs I have found says that number of file handles in Windows is limited by
memory.  Well, I have a 512MB of memory in this machine plus 700MB swap
space, so I cannot be running out of memory.

To make the long story short, I don't know what is causing this problem or
how to fix it.

Subject: Indexing problem


Hi

Since upgrading to 1.2  we've started getting the following error when
creating an index in a directory with a large amount of files. Previous
versions of Lucene were quite happy to index this directory.

Any thoughts as to the cause?
