i want to classify sentences stored as strings to a bunch of keywords related
to a certain category. 

so i will have 10 strings which will be a sentence long. and i will want to
compare each string to a set of 30 keywords stored somewhere, and then
compare with another set of 30 keywords, so on. 

i want to rank each string based on the number of times it matches a set of
keywords. so basically i want to categorize each sentence. 

is this possible with lucene, or would any other approach be more efficient. 

will this process take long? in terms of speed of program. 

and what tools would i need? 

any help would be great. 

thanks.
