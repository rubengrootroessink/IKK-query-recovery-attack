DATE: 4 Jun 2004

We conducted a test on our search for 500 requests
given in 27 seconds. We noticed that in the first 5
seconds, the results were coming in 100 to 500 ms. But
as the queue size kept increasing, the response time
of the search increased drastically to approx 80-100
seconds. 

Please find enclosed jvmdump.txt which contains a dump
of our search program after about 20 seconds of
starting the program.

Also enclosed is the file queries.txt which contains
few sample search queries.

Please note that this is done on a sample of 400,000
documents (450MB) on P4 having 1GB RAM.

Kindly let us know if this helps to identify the cause
of slow response.
