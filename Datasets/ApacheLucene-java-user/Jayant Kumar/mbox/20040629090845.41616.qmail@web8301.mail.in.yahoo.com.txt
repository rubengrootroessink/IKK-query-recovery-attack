SUBJECT: Is there any way to Collect all the searched documents at once?
DATE: 29 Jun 2004

Hi!!

Is there any way to fetch the fields of the searched
documents at once rather than looping through the
found documents one by one....because it consumes lots
of time and time increases by magnitude if the no. of
documents found are more.

This is how I am fetching the found documents ..

count=1500000 (no. of documents found) 

for(int i=0 ; i < count;i++ )
                        {
                                Document doc =
hits.doc(i);
                                fields[i] =
Long.parseLong(doc.get("FIELD"));
                        }

This takes around 2.5 minutes  for fetching 1500000
records which is unacceptable.

Regards
Karan
