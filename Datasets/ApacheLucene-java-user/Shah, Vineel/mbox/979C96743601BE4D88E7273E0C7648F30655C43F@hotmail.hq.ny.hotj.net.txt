SUBJECT: Alternate Boolean Query Parser?
DATE: 28 Mar 2003

One of my clients is asking for an old-style boolean query search on my keywords fields. A
string might look like this:

	"oracle admin*" and java and oracle and ("8.1.6" or "8.1.7") and ("solaris" or "unix" or
"linux")

There would probably be need for nested parenthesis, although I can't think of an example.
Is there a parser I can plug into lucene to make this happen? It doesn't seem like the normal
QueryParser class would like this string, or would it? Any ideas or comments would be appreciated.
Making my own
grammar and parser class is too expensive a proposition.
