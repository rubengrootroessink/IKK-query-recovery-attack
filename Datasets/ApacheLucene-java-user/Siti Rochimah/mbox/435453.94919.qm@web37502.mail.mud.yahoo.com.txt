SUBJECT: Re: query API for program-generated query (please help..)
DATE: 3 Aug 2008

Yes, it could be, I'm sure, I have tried...
But, I don't want to input anything from the command line.
I am using Jswing GUI in my program so inputting from command line will 'disturb' the program
'look-and-feel'....
I just want to read text file content as a query and passing it through the parser.. but it
always failed.

Or... is there other any techniques that I can implement...???
