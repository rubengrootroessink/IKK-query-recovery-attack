SUBJECT: query API for program-generated query (please help..)
DATE: 1 Aug 2008

Hi,

I'm a new user for Lucene.

I would like to make search-engine program with program-generated query rather than user-input
query. If anyone knows how to make a query API for this purpose, please share the code...
Thanks.
