SUBJECT: Re: query API for program-generated query (please help..)
DATE: 3 Aug 2008

yes, I have...
but, as far as I know.. to make a boolean query, we also have to make it by inputting a boolean
expressions from the command line. 

All I want to do is making the query from textual file. I read file content, placing it in
a string variable and passing it to the parser. 
But, in my experience, this variable is always detected as a null variable by the parser,
even if the variable is containing some texts (can be displayed by system.out.printf().

This is messages that I have found from Lucene documentations:

"Although Lucene provides the ability to create your own queries through its API, it also
provides a rich query language through the Query Parser, a lexer which interprets a string
into a Lucene Query using JavaCC.
...
Before choosing to use the provided Query Parser, please consider the following:
1. If you are programmatically generating a query string and then parsing it with the query
parser then you should seriously consider building your queries directly with the query API.
In other words, the query parser is designed for human-entered text, not for program-generated
text."


That's why I am searching for this kind of API...
