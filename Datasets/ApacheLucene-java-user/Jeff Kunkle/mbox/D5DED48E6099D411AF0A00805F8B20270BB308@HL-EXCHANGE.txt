SUBJECT: Industry Use of Lucene?
DATE: 6 Dec 2001

Does anyone know of any companies or agencies using Lucene for their
products/projects?  I am attempting to make a marketing pitch for Lucene to
my manager and I know one of the first questions will be, "Who else is using
it?"  I know Lucene is a very powerful, fast, and flexible full-text search
engine but my manager will need a little more coercing.  Any help on this
topic is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Jeff
