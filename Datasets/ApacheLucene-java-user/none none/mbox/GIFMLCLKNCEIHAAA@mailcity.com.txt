SUBJECT: Re: Using Boost factor in queries
DATE: 19 Jul 2002

you can build a query for each clause:
Query q_name = QueryParser.parse("("+qry+")^5","field_name",analyzer);
....
then add all the clause to a BooleanQuery:

BooleanQuery main = new BooleanQuery();
main.add(q_name, true, false);

true mean required, false mean prohibited:this is an and condition.

bye.
