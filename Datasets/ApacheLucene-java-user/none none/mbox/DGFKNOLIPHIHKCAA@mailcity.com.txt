hi,
i assume that you are using the one from: http://www.i2a.com/websearch/
and you are using and know a Tomcat.

In this case you should edit properly the websearch.xml (/WEB-INF/conf) file.
Both www.violet-arcana.com and /bot.jsp are there.
The reason why you cannot spide the 1st is because the url doesn't exists! try to visit the
url and see what happens.
COULD BE a Tomcat misconfiguration, try to replace the url in the folloow file  "/i2a/examples/websearch/bot.jsp"
and change the link for each file to "http://localhost:8080/websearch/i2a/examples/websearch/files/[file].jsp"

but you can just put:
<scope>http://www.yourwebtospide.com/</scope>

and try a search.
Hope helps.
bye
