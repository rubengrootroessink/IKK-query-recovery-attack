Hi,

Does Lucene allow Document with more than one Field of the same name but different values?
I'm wondering about this because I'm trying to implement hierarchical search as suggested
by
the FAQ, i.e. /dir1/dir2/dir3.  But that seems to work only for one folder assignment for
each
Document, I need to support multiple folder assignment to a Document.

Thanks
