SUBJECT: Re: Design Problem: Searching large set of protected documents
DATE: 3 Apr 2007

Michael,
as usual its never so easy! Some users can see almost all documents, and
some other users can see very few.

I did find an interesting document that describes the problem (but offers
no solutions :-() http://www.ideaeng.com/pub/entsrch/v3n4/article01.html.

This article talks about early and late binding of security information.
Early binding is faster, but harder to implement. And of course, I
implemented the easier one.

I'm going to see what the computational and storage cost will be if I
precalculate this info.
Ciao,

My knee-jerk reaction is to suggest a simpler document security model,
but I'm guessing that that option isn't available to you.

In your example the security attributes of a document are far more
discriminating than the query terms.  If that relationship is indicative
of most of your users and most of the documents, the users and documents
aren't updated much, and you have a lot of searching to do,
precalculation (results into an additional document field) seems the way
to go.  It might even turn out that, if you start from a presumption of
calculating every user--document security attribute, you come up with an
algorithm that is much more efficient than a one-off,
can-this-user-see-this-document type of algorithm.

Precalculation isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Often, it's quite
beneficial -- for example, the indexing process itself is a pretty
substantial precalculation step!

If this seems unwieldy or impractical for some reason, perhaps you could
post more attributes of your situation, such as user and data update and
addition frequency, query attributes and frequency, and so on.
