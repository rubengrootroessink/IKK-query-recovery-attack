Aad,
Are you trying to check the spelling of English words by Dutch children? 
Then, Phonetix or any of these other solutions may not be perfect.
>From my little knowledge of Dutch, a "g" is some sort of velar fricative 
(pronounced at the back of throat). And "ch" in english is also a velar 
fricative.
You have to hope that the soundex/metaphone rules are broad enough to be 
used by both languages.

Interesting little problem. No J2EE libraries to call, just static String 
convertToSoundex(String word) to implement. Ah if only I could do more of 
that sort of coding.
Ciao,
Jonathan O'Connor

Hey Aad, I believe 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/contributions.html has a link to 
Phonetix (
http://www.companywebstore.de/tangentum/mirror/en/products/phonetix/index.html
), an LGPL-licensed lib for phonetic algorithms like Soundex, Metaphone 
and DoubleMetaphone. There are Lucene adapters.

As to the suitability of the algorithms, I haven't taken a look at the 
Phonetix implementation, but if 
http://spottedtiger.tripod.com/D_Language/D_DoubleMetaPhone.html is 
anything to go by (do a search for "dutch"), then it should meet your 
needs, or at least won't be difficult to customize. 

Is that what you're looking for?
