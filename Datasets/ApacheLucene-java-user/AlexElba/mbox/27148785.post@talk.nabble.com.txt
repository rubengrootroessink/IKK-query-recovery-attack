Hello,

I am currently using lucene 2.4 and have document with 3 fields

id  
name 
rank

and have query and filter when I am trying to use rang filter on rank I am
not getting any result back

RangeFilter rangeFilter = new RangeFilter("rank", "3", "10", true, true);

I have documents which are in this interval 


Any suggestion what am I doing wrong?
