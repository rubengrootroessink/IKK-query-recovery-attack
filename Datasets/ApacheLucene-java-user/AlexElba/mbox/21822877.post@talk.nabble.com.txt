SUBJECT: TopDocCollector vs Hits: TopDocCollector slowing....
DATE: 4 Feb 2009


Hello,

I was using lucene 2.3.2 with hits and switch to lucene 2.4.0 and now I am
using TopDocCollector.

I have two queries which are running against the same index.
One query is returning 80bytes information other one is returning 2000bytes

With old Hits the query which was returning smaller data was faster which
has bigger data was slower.
After I change to TopDocCollector both big and small once returning same
time. 

Searcher is exactly the same and queries are the same only difference is in
one place I was using Hits in other TopDocCollector 

Who has any idea why, and how can I fix this?
