Hello,

I change filter to follow
  RangeFilter rangeFilter = new RangeFilter(
                       "rank", NumberTools
                                .longToString(rating), NumberTools
                                .longToString(10), true, true);

and change index to store rank the same way... But still not seeing :( any
results
