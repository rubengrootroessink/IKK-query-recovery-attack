SUBJECT: Lucene SnowBall unexpected behavior for some terms
DATE: 10 Apr 2009


Hello,
I was working with lucene snowball 2.3.2 and I switch to 2.4.0. 
After switch I came by to some case where lucene doesn't do lemmatization
correctly. So far I found only one case spa - spas. spas are not getting
lemmatize at all...
BTW I saw the same behavior on solr 1.3


Anybody have any idea why?
