Hi,

My search application is returning hits ordered by the default relevance. I
migrated my application from lucene 1.3 to lucene 2.0. I observed that the
documents are returned with a different order. I tested in using the new
Scorer (BooleanScorer2) and in using the old scorer class (BooleanScorer)
but that didn't fix the problem. 

Did someone observe this problem in his application ?

Thanks so much. 

Florent.
