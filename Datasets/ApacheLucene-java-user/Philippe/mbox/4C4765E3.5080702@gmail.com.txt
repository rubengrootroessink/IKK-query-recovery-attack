SUBJECT: Different ranking results
DATE: 21 Jul 2010

Hi,

I just performed two queries which, in my opinion, should lead to the 
same document rankings. However, the document ranking differ between 
these two queries. For better understanding I prepared  minimal examples 
for both queries. In my understanding both queries perform the same 
task. Namely search for "lucene" in two different fields.

Maybe someone can explain me my misunderstanding?


String[] fields = {"TITLE", "BOOK"};
MultiFieldQueryParser parser = new 
MultiFieldQueryParser(Version.LUCENE_29, fields, new 
StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_29));

1.)
Query q = parser.parse("lucene");

2.)
Query q = parser.parse(TITLE:lucene OR BOOK:lucene);

Regards,
     philippe
