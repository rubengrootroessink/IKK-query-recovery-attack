SUBJECT: Fast way to get all Terms in a matching query
DATE: 26 Jul 2010

Hi,

I'm looking for an efficient way to query lucene multiple times. All 
queries are an extension of the very first query with only one term. 
(E.g. "Title:Lucene"
      -> "Title:Lucene Title:Apache"
      -> "Title:Lucene Title:Manning"
     ....

My current solution uses "CachingWrapperFilter" wrapped around a 
"QueryWrapperFilter". However, I wanted to know if anybody is aware of a 
faster solution?

Regards,
     Philippe
