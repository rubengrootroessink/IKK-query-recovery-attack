SUBJECT: Re: Sort by the number of matching fields
DATE: 21 Jan 2010

Hi Ian,

you are probably right that doc2 will be ranked higher as it contains 
both id-fields. However, I am sure that this is not always the case in 
the default TF/IDF-ranking scheme.

As you mentioned in the second part, I could add a new field holding the 
number of matching fields. The Problem is that the list  of relevant ids 
is often changing...

Regards,
    Philippe
