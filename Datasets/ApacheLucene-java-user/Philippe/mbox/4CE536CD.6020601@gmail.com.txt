SUBJECT: Custom similarity calculation ignoring  fieldnorm
DATE: 18 Nov 2010

Dear Lucene group,

I wrote my own Scorer by extending Similarity.  The scorer works quite 
well, but I would like to ignore the fieldnorm value. Is this somehow 
possible during search time? Or do I have to add a field indexed with 
no_norm?

Best,
     Philippe
