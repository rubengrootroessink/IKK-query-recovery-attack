SUBJECT: Rank results only on some fields
DATE: 31 Jul 2010

Hi,

I want to rank my results only on parts of my query.  E.g my query is 
"TITLE:Lucene AND AUTHOR:Manning". After this query standard lucene 
ranking for both fields take place.

However, is it possible to query the index using the full query and rank 
results only according to the "TITLE"-Field?

Regards,
     Philippe
