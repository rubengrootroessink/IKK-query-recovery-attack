SUBJECT: Get all terms of a specific field
DATE: 27 Jul 2010

Hi,

what would be the fastest way to get all terms for all documents 
matching a specific query?

Sofar I:

1.) Query the index
2.) Retrieve all scoreDocs
3.) Iterate the scoreDocs and retrieve all terms using the getValues 
method and a customised "FieldSelector"

However, retrieving and iterating the scoredocs is quite costly.  So is 
there a better/faster way to perform this?

Cheers,
     Philippe
