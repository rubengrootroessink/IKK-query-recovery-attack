SUBJECT: custom similarity based on tf but greater than 1.0
DATE: 18 Jan 2007


Hi all.
I am trying to make some experiments in an algorithm that scores results by
counting how many words of the query submited are in a document.

For example if i enter the query 

A B D A

The similarities I want to get for the documents follows:

A A C F D (2-found A and D)
A B D S S A (3 - found A, B and D)
D D D (1 - only found D)

I built a Similarity that actually sets everything's price as 1.0f except tf

The tf functions returns 1.0f if freq>0 and 0.0f else.

I think that this change does count what I want, but when it comes to show
the score, all are normalized. So, the greater similarity is equal to 1.0f
and the others are lower than 1.0f

How can I "deactivate" the score normalization?

Thank you!

I want to
