I thought I understood phrases and slop until one of my coworkers
brought by the following example

For a document that contains
"quick brown fox"

"quick brown fox"~0
"quick fox brown"~2
"fox quick brown"~3

all match.

I would have expected "fox quick brown" to require a 4 instead of a 3,
two to transpose brown and fox, two to transpose quick and fox.  Why
is this only 3?
