SUBJECT: Searching with a score cutoff
DATE: 4 Jun 2007

Currently our application implements a score cutoff by iterating through the
hits and then stopping once it reaches a hit whose score is below our
threshold.  We'd like to optimize this (and avoid looking at the entire hits
when we don't need to) by having the score cutoff applied when the hits are
gathered.  The only way I can see of doing this is by over-riding
Similarity, which seems like an incredibly complex procedure.  What am I
missing?
