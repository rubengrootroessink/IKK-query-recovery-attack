SUBJECT: Query to return all documents in the index
DATE: 5 Oct 2005

Hi,
In my project we've been using the Searcher.search(query, filter, sort)
method to gather results. But as it turns out, sometimes we just want all of
the documents that match with the filter, sorted by the sort field. Does
anyone know a query that returns all the documents in the index, so that i
could use that in this case?

thanks,
andy g
