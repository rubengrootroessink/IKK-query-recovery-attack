Yes some time it creates lock file in tomcat.
But nowadays i am not able to index even after deleting the lock files.
I checked tomcat's temp folder and java.io.tmpdir , nothing is there.

Even if I am not closing the index it should index after deleting the lock
files , (Correct me if I am wrong) 

I read on net about changing io lock to nio lock in lock.java file.
Has any body implemented and deployed it successfully?

Thanks in advance

Do you keep open IndexReader, IndexWriter or IndexSearcher? Try closing them
suring shutdown
