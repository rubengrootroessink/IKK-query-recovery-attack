SUBJECT: Lucene removing some words while searching
DATE: 27 Dec 2005

 

Hi erik and other gurus,

 

I have some doubts over double quote queries (as it is)

Suppose I search lucene user forum it should give correct continuous
occurrence of full text , 

 

But if I search for when they occur lucene is searching for when occur
also.

I think lucene is treating they  as stopword and removing it from the
search string.

But If I use double quotes it should not happen.

 

Thanks in advance,

~ Manish Chowdhary
