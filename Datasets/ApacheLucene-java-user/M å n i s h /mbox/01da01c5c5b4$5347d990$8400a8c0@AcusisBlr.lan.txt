SUBJECT: Commit lock timeout exception
DATE: 30 Sep 2005

 

 Hi Erik and other gurus,

 

 I am using lucene 1.4.3 with tomcat, and before some time I

 Started facing write lock problem,

 

 I cleared the temp folder of tomcat and there is nothing in my

 java.io.tmdir folder  but still I am getting write lock.

 

 My system is deployed on dual CPU Linux box,

 

 Thanks in advance
