SUBJECT: Getting index lock while indexing
DATE: 29 Sep 2005


Hi,
I am having trouble indexing files sometimes,
My application is deployed in tomcat and some times when I try to stop and
restart indexing I am getting index lock exception.
Lucene is creating one lock file in temp folder of tomcat , If I delete that
folder it starts working again.

Can any body help.
