SUBJECT: Lucene lock with new io
DATE: 30 Sep 2005

 

Hi All,

Lucene write-lock is making my life difficult,

Some times there is no lock file in temp folder but still the tomcat log
says write lock exception and 

Clearing the lock files is not helping me any more,

 

I saw in mail-archive that increasing lock time out property in lock.java
file or converting that 

lock into new io lock will help, 

 

Any body got better suggestion,

 

Thanks in advance,

~Manish Chowdhary
