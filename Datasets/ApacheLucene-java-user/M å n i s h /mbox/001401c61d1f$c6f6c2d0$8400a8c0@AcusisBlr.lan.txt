Lucene is aimed for ~10M document indexes on single CPU,
Anyway I tried till 20 GB and believe me lucene holds pretty good.

hey,
   
  is there a max amount of data (in gigabytes) where lucene's performance
starts to deteriorate
   
  i tested with about 2 giga on two instances (2 ram dirs using the
parallelmultisearcher) and performance was great,
   
  however i think i will need to support about 10-15 times as much data
(approx. 20-30 giga) will lucene hold up?
   
  thanks in advance,
