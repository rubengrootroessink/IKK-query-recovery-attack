SUBJECT: Problems in standard Analyzer
DATE: 26 Sep 2005


Hi Mark and other Gurus,

I am indexing one value as a key field (rtf & txt indexing) , value is like
12345 or 123-09-34 or it can be like MN12345.
Problem is if the value is like 12345 or 123-23-98 , Standard Analyzer is
able to search it, but if the value is like MN12345 search will not return
any results, and more over if I search for MN12345 through WhiteSpace
Analyzer I am getting the results.

Can any body help?
