SUBJECT: Re: recovering payload from fields
DATE: 5 Mar 2010

What I'd ideally like to do is to take SpanQuery, loop over the PayloadSpans
returned from SpanQuery.getPayloadSpans() and store all PayloadSpans for a
given document in a Map by their doc id.

Then later after deciding in memory which documents I need, load the Payload
data for just those PayloadSpans pulled out of my Map.

But it seems I can't do this as loading Payload data is only done through
the PayloadSpans iterator so must iterate through the entire collection to
get to my PaylaodSpan.  Is there not a way to just save a PayloadSpan and
loads it's payload data later as needed?

thanks,
