SUBJECT: Re: SpanQuery for Terms at same position
DATE: 23 Nov 2009

Tested it out.  It doesn't work.  A slop of zero indicates no words between
the provided terms.  E.g. my query of "plan" "_n" returns entries like
"contingency "plan".

My work around for this problem is to use a PhraseQuery, where you can
explicitly set Terms to occur at the same location, t orecover the desired
document ids. Then, because I need the payload data for each match, I create
a SpanTermQuery for all the individual terms used, use a modified version
PayloadSpanUtil to recover only the PayloadSpans for each query from the
document ids collected above and then find the intersection of all these
sets making sure to factor in where the each span starts (the end will just
be one ordinal value after) within each document to ensure they're at the
same position.

Definitely more work than it needs to be I think.  Still looking for another
way.
