SUBJECT: minimum range for SpanQueries
DATE: 21 Dec 2009

Is there are way to implement a minimum range for a SpanQuery or combination
thereof?

For example, using:

"The boy said hello to the boy"

I'd like to use a SpanNearQuery consisting of the terms "The" and "boy" that
returns one span including the entire sentence but not a span for the first
two words.
Thus, I'd like to specify a minimum range of at least 1 and a maximum of
say, 5 here.

I note that using a SpanNotQuery consisting of two SpanNearQueries with the
same terms and these above ranges does not work as the desired longer
SpanResult will include the shorter one and get weeded out.

thanks -
