SUBJECT: TermPositions with custom Tokenizer
DATE: 1 Oct 2009

Hello,

I have created a custom Tokenizer and am trying to set and extract my own
positions for each Token using:

reusableToken.reinit(word.getWord(),tokenStart,tokenEnd);

later when querying my index using a SpanTermQuery the start() and end()
tags don't correspond to these values but seem to correspond to the order
the token was tokenized during the indexing process, e.g.

start: 5
end: 6

for a given token.  I realize that the these values come from TermPositions
but how can I effectively get my custom toke nstart and end offsets into
TermPositions for recovery?

thanks -

C>T>
