SUBJECT: Using KeywordAnalyzer with stop word filter
DATE: 8 Jul 2007

Hello,

I want to parse my query string as follows:

* filter out stop words (from GermanAnalyzer)
* ignore every string field:foo
* search words exactly as written (key_word not "key word") on a certain
field

Example (using english words):
Querystring: how cool is a crazyanalyzer -test -baz:foo bar
Resulting query: field:cool field:crazyanalyzer -field:test field:bar

Is there a way to stack Analyzers together and use them for query
parsing? How would I do this?

Regards, Kai
