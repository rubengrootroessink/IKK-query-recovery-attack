SUBJECT: How to realize Sql LIKE?
DATE: 4 May 2006


Hi All,

I m new to Lucene,

Just wondering if there is a way to realize sql 'Like' function in Lucene as
following:

Select * from user_table where username like '%abc%'

I have checked with wildCardQuery, but it can not start with a '%'.
What about RegexQuery?  How to use it?

Thank you very much for any input,

-J
