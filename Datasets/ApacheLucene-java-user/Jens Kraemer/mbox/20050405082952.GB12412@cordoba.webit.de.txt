I usually have a service class wrapping all access to the lucene index,
which has a queue where my Servlets or Actions put the documents to be
updated or added in.  There is a single instance of this class for the
whole web app, and a thread regularly waking up and processing the
elements of the queue.

Note the queue has to be threadsafe or has to be synchronized
externally. 

Since there is only one instance of this service class, it is the only
one who will ever write to the index (if the same index is not used by
other applications).

During re-indexing the thread regularly processing the queue will
be paused. After re-indexing it is started again, processing all pending 
changes from the queue. The re-indexing itself takes place in another
thread, which is started by quartz in my case.


hope this helps you somehow,

Jens
