I would first add the new document version and delete the old one only
if that succeeds. When the deletion of the old version fails, just try
to delete the just inserted new version.

having some primary key like field identifying a document (equal in both
versions) one would first find out the lucene document id of the old
version by querying for this key field, then insert the new version,
then delete the old version using the document id from step 1.

If the deletion of the old version fails, and the deletion (the
'rollback') of the just inserted new version fails too, I suppose
something is wrong with the index anyway, so the two versions now
existing in the index might not be your biggest problem.
