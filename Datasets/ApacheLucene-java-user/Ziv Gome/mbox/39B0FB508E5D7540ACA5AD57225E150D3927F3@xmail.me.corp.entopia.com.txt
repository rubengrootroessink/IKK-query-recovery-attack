You are free to take a look at the thread about synonym query from mars,
initiated by Andrew Schetinin and myself. This code (suggestion) tries
to handle synonym as a query expansion, rather than injection at
indexing time, while fix the problems a simple expansion creates (mainly
results of IDF).

BTW, for reply please use ziv.gome_gmail_com (replace "_" where
appropriate)

Hi,

What is the best way to implement the following?

Document 1 contains the following text:
  "THE CZECH REPUBLIC ORGANIZATION"

Document 2 contains the following text:
  "THE CZE ORGANISATION"

Synonym rules:
  (1) CZECH REPUBLIC --> CZE
  (2) CZE --> CZECH REPUBLIC
  (3) ORGANIZATION --> ORG, ORGANISATION

All of the following phrase searches must match BOTH documents:
  "CZECH REPUBLIC ORGANIZATION"
  "CZECH REPUBLIC ORGANISATION"
  "CZECH REPUBLIC ORG"
  "CZE ORGANIZATION"
  "CZE ORGANISATION"
  "CZE ORG"

I don't think the SynonymAnalyzer described in LIA would work because
some of my "synonyms" contain multiple words.  Thank you.
