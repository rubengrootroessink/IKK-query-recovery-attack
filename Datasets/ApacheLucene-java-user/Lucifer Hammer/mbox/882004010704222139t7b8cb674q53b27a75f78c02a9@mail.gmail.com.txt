SUBJECT: Re: Backwards index format compatibility of future versions?
DATE: 23 Apr 2007

Thanks for that pointer!  That link lead me to this link:
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BackwardsCompatibility  - Which makes it
sound like I can only expect backwards compatibility within the current
major version.

When/if Lucene hits V3.0, it doesn't sound like there's a commitment for it
to be able to read 2.X indexes. Right?  How about Lucene 4.0, will that be
able to read indexes in the 2.0 format?  (Yes, I know there's a migration
path, however, that's not our goal - we'd like to keep our current
2.0archives in
2.0 format, and know that we can read/search them from future versions of
Lucene.

Thanks

Lucifer
