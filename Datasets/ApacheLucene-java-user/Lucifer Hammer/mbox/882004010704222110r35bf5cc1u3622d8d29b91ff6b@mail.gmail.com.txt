SUBJECT: Backwards index format compatibility of future versions?
DATE: 23 Apr 2007

Hi,

Is there a goal for lucene to always be able to read indexes written by
older versions of Lucene?  For instance, I noticed that I could read 2.0 and
1.9 indexes with a 2.1 Lucene jar.  (I also noticed that if I add a document
to one of those older indexes, then they'll be rewritten in 2.1 format.)
Should/can we expect that all future versions of Lucene will be able to read
older indexes?

The reason I ask: we have some 2.0 indexes written onto "Write once" media.
We would like to be able to keep those indexes, and not have to convert them
to a newer format.   (We don't plan to ever have to write to those indexes
again.)

Thanks!

Lucifer
