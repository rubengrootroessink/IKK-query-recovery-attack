We keep our indexed archives on write-once media.  If we're forced to move
our indexes up to a newer format, then we'd have to rewrite all our
archives...

One solution would be to load the 2.0-jar from a secondary

I don't know how that would work...  (Could we run a parallel multisearcher
across indexes with different formats, some of which have been accessed via
a secondary classloader?)
