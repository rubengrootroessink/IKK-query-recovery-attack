SUBJECT: Problem with addDocument returning java.lang.NullPointerException
DATE: 19 Sep 2002

Hello:

I am building a Lucene application and I am getting a NullPointerException
when calling addDocument.  Invoking the toString method on my Document jst
before the addDocument call gives:

Document<Text<contents:java.io.BufferedReader@5>
Keyword<modified:0d4nk0hs0> Text<title:Millionaires Last Hope For
Telematics> Text<path:\PDFDirectory\2002\Millionaires Last Hope For
Telematics.pdf>>

Which seems to be ok.  Commenting out individual fields seems to make no
difference.  Any suggestions of what I could be doing wrong would be
appreciated.
