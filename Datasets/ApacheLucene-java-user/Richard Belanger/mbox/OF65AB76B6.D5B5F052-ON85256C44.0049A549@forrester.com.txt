DATE: 30 Sep 2002


Hi:

Thanks for the note.  The code is actually taken from two different methods
hence the different variable names for the Hits object.  Does anyone have
more detailed doc on MultiFieldQuery?  I can always start browsing the
source but that usually takes a little time...

Hello,

Heh, I jsut returned from Cambridge to NYC.
I don't have time to look through the old code that I wrote, which used
MultiFieldQueryParser class, but the class does work as described in
its API.  The problem might be elsewhere.
The code in the original email also looks like it's not the real code
(hits vs. resultSet).  But it looks correct otherwise, as far as I can
tell.
