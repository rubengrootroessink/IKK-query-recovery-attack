Hi Terry:

Thanks for your response.  After some more debugging work I found a problem
with the way I was creating my IndexWriter.

Richard,

You need to provide a bit more info before anyone (or, more specifically,
I)
will be able to assist you.  I infer from what you've said that your source
documents are PDF?  What sort of Document class are you using?  If you
aren't checking for null fields, the sort of behavior you're describing is
inevitable.

Regards,

Terry
