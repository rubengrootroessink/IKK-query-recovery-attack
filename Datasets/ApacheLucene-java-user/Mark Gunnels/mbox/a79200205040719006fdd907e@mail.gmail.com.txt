SUBJECT: list all terms in a field
DATE: 8 Apr 2005

Is there a simple way to list all terms in a field?
The only approach that I see is to use the IndexReader.terms()  method
and then iterate over all the results and build my list by manually
filtering. This seems inefficient and there must be a better way that
my newbie eyes don't see.
