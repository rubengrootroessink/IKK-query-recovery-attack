DATE: 6 Mar 2009

Right, I should have included these data in my orig. message (sorry): 

WinXP, R2.4 

I do have permissions and the files are definitely part of the index being removed; nothing
outside of (my code that uses) Lucene would have a handle on these files.

At some earlier time this was working just fine, using java.io.File.delete(). Now however,
some of the files get deleted (segments*) whereas others fail (no Exn is thrown, just java.io.File.delete()
returns false: _0.cfs, _0.cfx). I've tried closing the IndexReader (no IndexWriter exists
at shutdown), but that makes no diff.
