Oh, probably more user-error on my part -- I tried to post "Bunch of newbie queries", and
after getting some kind of "that failed" reply, went through several hoops to register, at
the end of which I somehow assumed "OK, now my message will get posted." (Sort of like those
web-logins, where after you register, then you are redirected back to the page to which you
were originally headed.) 

Here's the first of those "newbie queries", not yet answered (the second is effectively answered,
and the third was basically a plea for some version of a "how to do really really really simple
things with Lucene" guide, since the one at the website is (cough) just way beyond where I
am, so far. Once I have learned a little more, I'll re-post a more informed version of that.

the "anonymous" SVN (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/)
does not work for me (I am using Eclipse 3.3, and have the subversion plug-in, v.
1.2.4, and have successfully checked out code using SVN from other repositories).
Apparently here I need a user-id and pwd -- what is that or where do I get one?

do this, but would still like to know.)

Allowing for the explanation below ("preserving history"), it seems like there may not be
a way to do what I had hoped for. Here's an example: I poke around, looking for 2.2; I get
to here: 
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_2_0/releases.html

OK, cool, now I click on ==>> Both binary and source releases are available for download
from the Apache Mirrors

And find myself on the "mirror-selection" page; ok, fine, I just take the default, and ...


I get to the *current* download page: 
http://www.ip97.com/apache.org/lucene/java/
(at the chosen mirror). 

So, my expectation was that "a link called 'download' on a page clearly labeled 'version nnn'
will take me to download version nnn (not version 'current')".  

Maybe the closest one could get is to rephrase (from now on) the sentence/link above, to read
something like this: 

==>> Both binary and source releases, for the <bold>current</bold> version,
are available for download from the Apache Mirrors

(That way, the sentence-and-link will always be correct.)

My use-case is pretty simple, and I'd be surprised if it were unique/rare: I am working with
someone else's code, developed on 2.2, and they are not available to migrate to 2.3; so if
I want to have their code run correctly, and to be able to debug into Lucene, I need to get
2.2-source-and-binary. (And no, having me migrate their code to 2.3 is not really an option
-- I have no cycles, or Lucene-expertise, to do that.) So I really truly need an old version.


Anyway, I have it now. 

thanks,
Paul
