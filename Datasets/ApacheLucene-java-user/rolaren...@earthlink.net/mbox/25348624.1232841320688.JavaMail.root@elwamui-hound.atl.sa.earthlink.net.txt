Hey Mike --

OK, so the way I was trying could never work, I guess? No surprise really that the TokenStream
cannot be re-accessed. I just had no clue what else to try ...

OK, didn't see that coming, but glad it did -- I have tried that, and indeed I can get the
TermFreqVector for the Field in which I am interested, and it contains the same sort of data
as were once in the TokenStream, all fine. 

Now I notice (from googling) that I can also downcast TermFreqVector to TermPositionVector,
which contains the offsets (which I will need). 

So -- under what conditions would that cast fail? 

thanks,
Paul
