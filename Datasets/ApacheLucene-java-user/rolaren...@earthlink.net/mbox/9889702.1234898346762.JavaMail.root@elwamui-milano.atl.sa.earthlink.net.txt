SUBJECT: newbie seeking explanation of semantics of "Field" class

R2.4 

I have been looking through the soon-to-be-superseded (by its 2nd ed.) book "Lucene In Action"
(hope it's ok on this newsgroup to say I like that book); also at these two tutorials: http://darksleep.com/lucene/
and http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=461633&seqNum=3 and also at the Lucene
online docco (http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/index.html) the last of which has nothing
on the topic at all! I've also tried to search http://www.nabble.com/Lucene---Java-Users-f45.html
-- but there are almost 10,000 docs there on "Field." so that is too much data. 

The book is consistent with the two tutorials, but all three seem to be out of date (and the
design less clear) compared to the code: http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/index.html


I have copied some code and it is working for me, but I am a little uncertain how to decide
what value of Field.Index and Field.Store to choose in order to get the behavior I'd like.
If I read the javadocs, and decide to ignore all the "expert" items, it looks like this: 

Field.Store.NO = I'll never see that data again; I wonder why I'd do this? 

Field.Store.YES = good, the data will be stored 

Field.Store.COMPRESS = even better, stored and compressed; why would anyone do anything else?


========

Field.Index.NO = I cannot search that data, but if I need its value for a given document (e.g.,
to decorate a result), I can retrieve it (use-case: maybe, the date the document was created
-- but why not just make that searchable? I am having a hard time thinking of an actually
useful piece of data that could go here and would not want to be one of ANALYZED or NOT_ANALYZED)


Field.Index.ANALYZED = the normal value, I would guess, except in the special case of stuff
not searchable but used to decorate results (Field.Index.NO)

Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED = I can search for this value, but it won't get analyzed, so it is
searched for as the very same value I put in (the docco suggests product numbers: any other
interesting use-cases anyone can suggest?) 

========= 

thanks in advance for helping me get clearer on this!
