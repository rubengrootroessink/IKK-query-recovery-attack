SUBJECT: Re: deletion of index-files fails
DATE: 6 Mar 2009

I did just now double/triple-check: the IndexWriter is definitely closed. 

However (cough), I did have a bogus call to IndexReader.incRef() ... once I removed that,
the call to IndexReader.close() actually worked and then the deletion did so too. Thanks;
sorry to trouble you.
