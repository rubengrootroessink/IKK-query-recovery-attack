OK, after googling around for a while, I found this: 

http://wooga.drbacchus.com/lucene-and-documentation (alas, I agree) 

and then eventually I realized that the download web-page directory has a link to the "archive"
where all the old stuff is (probably this is common and obvious, but I kept missing it) --
every link that purports to take me to an old version takes me to http://apache.oc1.mirrors.redwire.net/lucene/java/
-- it would help a lot (and would be easy to do, no?) if all the links to old stuff went to
http://apache.oc1.mirrors.redwire.net/lucene/java/archive/ instead. (Not necessarily that
particular mirror, of course.)
