SUBJECT: deletion of index-files fails
DATE: 6 Mar 2009

So, I have a (small) Lucene index, all fine; I use it a bit, and then (on app shutdown) want
to delete its files and the containing directory (the index is intended as a temp object).
At some earlier time this was working just fine, using java.io.File.delete(). Now however,
some of the files get deleted (segments*) whereas others fail (no Exn is thrown, just java.io.File.delete()
returns false: _0.cfs, _0.cfx). I've tried closing the IndexReader (no IndexWriter exists
at shutdown), but that makes no diff. 

Any ideas? 

thanks
Paul
