OK, cool. 

I see in the javadocs for TermPositionVector that it "not necessarily contains both positions
and offsets, but at least one of these arrays exists"; does it work like this, I think: 

TermVector.WITH_OFFSETS => TermVectorOffsetInfo[] always exists (so far, works for me)

TermVector.WITH_POSITIONS => positions int[] always exists
TermVector.WITH_POSITIONS_OFFSETS => both arrays always exist 

Right? And I guess the reason for using TermVector.WITH_POSITIONS => positions int[] is
that it has a smaller memory footprint? 

thanks,
Paul
