SUBJECT: search that span over consecutive documents
DATE: 8 Jul 2005

Hello everyone,

 

My application must index a lot of books that are stored in xml files.

Each xml file represents a page of the book and this way each page becomes a
lucene Document.

Each page is organized in different sections and finally each section
contains lines.

 

What I need to do is give the user the possibility to search for a phrase
that starts at the 

and of a page and continues on the next page. The span should have some
limits, let's say,  

6 words on each page.

 

Does any one experienced this kind of search? Please share you knowledge if
you did.

Thank you very much,

 

Daniel
