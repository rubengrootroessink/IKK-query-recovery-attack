SUBJECT: How to make a search log
DATE: 13 Oct 2010

Hi, how would you make Lucene leave a search log of
who searched what, when, etc (i.e. cookie, query, timestamp, etc)?
Is there a built-in Lucene function that allows me to do this,
Or is Lucene doing it already by default and I just can't find it?
