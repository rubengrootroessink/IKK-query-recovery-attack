Sorry I must be drunk 8-)... I accedenly sent the mail.... Here it comes
again:

Hi everyone!!

I've saw you discussion about multiple searches in Lucene and I think Kelvin
Tan
work was nice.. But I have a problem with it, how do a do a subquery on
multiple fields??

If I send in the "testa+testb" as a query the result turns out:
(realName:"testa testb") (keywords:"testa testb")

But I want:

(realName:"testb+testa") (keywords:"testb+testa")

Is it possible, and if so how???
