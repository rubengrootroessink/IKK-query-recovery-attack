SUBJECT: Re: If you could have one feature in Lucene...
DATE: 25 Feb 2010

I think it speaks to the maturity of the project ...  Lucene has  
solved some of the easier problems in the problem space and the ones  
that remain are ... difficult.

I recently introduced Lucene/Nutch to a group of ~10 relatively  
capable Java developers.  While they find it easy to use, they are  
also learning that search/info. retrieval is a deceptively  
challenging field.  From their "fresh" perspective, "this stuff  
[Lucene/Nutch] really works well once you get it going, but you  
really have to know what you are doing if you want to get the most  
from it".

Building on Erik Hatcher's "try-it-out" mantra, it might be  
interesting to see if contributions go up if we publicize specific  
test cases to demonstrate/resolve the problems.
