SUBJECT: Re: Link map over results? or term freq
DATE: 16 Oct 2008

I think I understand what you're describing as a "link map" to be a  
"tag cloud" where each tag is a "frequent" or "strong" term.

We did something like this as an experiment (without Lucene):
http://www.cognocys.com/prospector/news.html

If you're talking about something similar, then I think you can use  
Lucene's TFVs only to get at the frequency data in the context of the  
Documents (not the results).  I'm no expert, but I say this because  
I've only ever seen TermFrequencyVectors being discussed in the  
context of an IndexReader, not in the context of Hits or TopDocs.
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/index/ 
class-use/TermFreqVector.html

The other thing, though, is that TF may not be sufficient to  
determine what to use for each tag/link.  For example, given a set of  
Results, R, would you like to use:
1.  the top N most frequent terms for each Document in R?
2.  the top M most frequent terms that are common to all/many  
Documents in R?
3.  the top O most frequent terms that are common in results built  
using the highlighter?
...

To a certain extent, this is a clustering problem:-- given some set  
of Documents, R, which just happen to be the results of some search,  
represent R using a tag cloud/link map of terms that best represent R.

Have you looked at carrot2?  I haven't seen the tag cloud  
visualization there, but you may find some ideas for clustering/ 
document-set representation there:

Good luck!
