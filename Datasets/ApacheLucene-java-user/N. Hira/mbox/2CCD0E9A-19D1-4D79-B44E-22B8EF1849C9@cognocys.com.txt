At Jostens, we have been using Solr on our corporate site for just under a year now.  We pick
up log data every night and summarize using a combination of grep/sed/awk and gnuplot.

The key metrics we use (for now):
1.  Query Response time average during the day (ten minute intervals)
2.  Queries run during the day (ten minute intervals)
3.  Top N queries during the day that resulted in too many/too few hits
4.  Top N queries during the day that resulted in a reasonable number of hits
5.  Top N queries for a given period (say 30 days)

What we would like to do next is to look at correlations between search terms and results
viewed to improve our content, but that requires result tracking.  The other thing that would
be extremely useful would be something that helps us get to synonyms.

Hope this helps.
