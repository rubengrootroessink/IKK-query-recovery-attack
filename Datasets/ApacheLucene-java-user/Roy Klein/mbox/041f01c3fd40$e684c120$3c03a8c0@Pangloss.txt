SUBJECT: RE: Indexing multiple instances of the same field for each document
DATE: 27 Feb 2004

If one adds multiple terms to a single fieldname two ways:

    1) Adding a single field with all the content 
    2) Adding that same field several times, each time with a different
term.

E.g.
   doc1.add(Field.indexed("field","the");
   doc1.add(Field.indexed("field","quick");
   doc1.add(Field.indexed("field","brown");
   doc1.add(Field.indexed("field","fox");
   doc1.add(Field.indexed("field","jumped");
   writer.addDocument(doc1);
Vs.
   doc2.add(Field.indexed("field","the quick brown fox jumped");
   writer.addDocument(doc2);


Is there a difference in query performance when I query on fields that
have been added multiple times vs fields which were added with the
entire field contents at once?

Also FYI, I found that phrase queries don't work against a field that's
been added multiple times. If I query the phrase "brown fox", against
the two example docs above, only the second matches.

Are you using QueryParser?  Try using a TermQuery("product", "PROD_A") 
when indexing as a Keyword and see what you get.  If that finds it, 
then you are suffering from analysis paralysis.  QueryParser, Keyword 
fields, and analyzers are a very "interesting" combination.
