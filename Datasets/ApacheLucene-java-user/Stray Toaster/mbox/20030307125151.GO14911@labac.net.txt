Hi there.

Consider the following examples that I do while searching:

fun    -> 19 results
fun () -> 0 results
fun "" -> ParseException


Help! I really don't want to get ParseException thrown.
(I am using Lucene version 1.2.)

Anyone any ideas? (I am adverse to saying this is a bug, but rather that
I am doing something silly. As I run this on a (private) site, I don't
want my users spotting anything silly. Where users is currently defined
as me!)
