SUBJECT: File Handle Resource Usage
DATE: 22 Jan 2003


Hi,

I have been using Lucene in a production enviroment now for about a year,
using version 1.1.    I  had moved across to the 1.2 release, but as the
result of this the number of file handles that were needed increased
dramatically.

A quick look at some trace from the OS indicated that when the Index was
opened, all the files in the directory were opened.   I suspect that this
is done to improve performance for various searches etc.

Does anyone have any suggestions as a way around. I am already aware of the
obvious things:

Increasing the No Available to the Program.
Reducing the no of files created ( mergeFactor etc)
Optimising the index more often.

Andrew
