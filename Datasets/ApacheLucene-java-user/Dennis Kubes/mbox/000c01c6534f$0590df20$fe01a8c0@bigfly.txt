SUBJECT: Date Field Indexing
DATE: 29 Mar 2006

Looking at the Lucene In Action book it shows indexing Date fields with
something like this:

 

Field.Keyword("datefield", new Date());

 

I know that the APIs have changed for Field and I see that there are no
longer date constructors. So just confirming that we should use the
DateTools class and store dates as text to index?
