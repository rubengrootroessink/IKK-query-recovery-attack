DATE: 22 Dec 2007

When we started we had 5 machines that were 800mghz and maybe 512M to 1G 
  of ram.  It was enough to get started and start testing things 
although I wouldn't recommend that setup because looking back I don't 
think it was enough.  And of course we started getting OutOfMemory 
errors pretty quickly as our data grew.

Remember that in search the serving is the hardware intensive part.  For 
getting your hands dirty and processing the data, the hardware you 
propose should be more than sufficient.  Amazon's EC2, especially the 
large and extra-large instances would also work very well for this and 
give you the opportunity to grow your serving computer if/when needed.
