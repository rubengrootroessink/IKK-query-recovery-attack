SUBJECT: Function Query, Required Clauses, and Matching
DATE: 25 Oct 2010

A curiosity.  Some of the documentation for function queries says they 
match every document in the index.  When running a query that has 
boolean required clauses and an optional ValueSourceQuery or function 
query is the function query still matched against every document in the 
index or is it only on those documents that match required clauses?
