According to the Lucene In Action book you can convert from one compound to
multi-file and vice versa by setting the setCompoundFile method to true or
false.  But in running this myself I found that while I can convert from
multi-file to compound, it doesn't convert back.  Here is the code that I
used.

    try {
      System.setProperty("org.apache.lucene.lockDir",
"lock-directory-path-here");
      String idxDir = "index-directory-path-here";
      IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(idxDir, new StandardAnalyzer(),
false);
      writer.setUseCompoundFile(false);
      writer.optimize();
      writer.close();
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
      // TODO Auto-generated catch block
      e.printStackTrace();
    }

Hello,
  I am using lucene for storing details of my students. I have used
  SetUseCompoundFile(True) and optimised the indexes. Now I am not able to
convert them back to their original form
  Thanks in advance
