I will definatelly check it out tommorow.

I also forgot to mention that I am not interested in the hits themselves, only whether or
not there was a hit.  Is there something I can use that's optimized for this scenario, or
should I look into rewriting the search method of the indexarsearcher?  Currently I just check
hits.size().

Which is very, very cool. I wound up using it for hit counting and it
works like a charm....
