Can you use multiple threads/machines to index the data into separate indexes, and then combine
them?

Hello!

 

I have to index 37million documents retrieved from the database.

 

I was trying to do by loading intervals of 10000 records but it is too slow.

 

Anybody could sugest a better way to get all the data indexed in a
reasonable time?

 

Thanks
