SUBJECT: nested Documents?
DATE: 5 Feb 2003

hello

my lucene Documents have 2 Fields: an id and a content Field.
when i create a new Document to add to the index i would like
to be able to make the new Document inherit the content of an
other Document which is already in the index. the content Field
is not Stored, but Tokenized and Indexed.

i need to index documents which sometimes contain other
documents which are already indexed. for example i have a
document A which has the content "some simple text" and a
document B which has the content "more complicated" plus
all of the content of document A. if i search for "simple" i want
to get A and B as results of the search. document A is already
in the index and i want to add document B to the index. is there
a way to tel the lucene indexer that the content Field of the
document B dosn't only contain the string "more complicated"
but also all the content of document A?

Thanks
