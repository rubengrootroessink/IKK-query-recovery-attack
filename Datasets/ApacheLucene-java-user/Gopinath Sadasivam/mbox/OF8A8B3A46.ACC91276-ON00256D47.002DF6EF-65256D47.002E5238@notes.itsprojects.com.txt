Hello all,

                I am using lucene to search  jsp pages.  I am able to list
the jsp urls.   But I need to capture the context
           along  which the search string occurs. For example if I am
searching for a string "java", I also need to capture
           the context  "java is used for......blah blah!!! " in which the
search string occurred.

                If anyone could suggest any means to capture the context,
that will be a lot helpful to me.

                Thanks in advance.

with warm regards,
Gopinath Sadasivam
