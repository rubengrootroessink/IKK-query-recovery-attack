SUBJECT: case sensitivity confusion
DATE: 4 Feb 2003

G'day One and all,

I'm have some problems getting lucene to do case-insensitive searches.  I
have looked through the list archives and found that using the
standardAnalyser should do the trick, however I'm already using this
analyser on both the indexer and searching and still no case-insensitive
searchs are performed.  If I type a query in lowercase it finds the
documents, however if I add case then no results are found.

What am I doing wrong?

regards,

Stephen...
