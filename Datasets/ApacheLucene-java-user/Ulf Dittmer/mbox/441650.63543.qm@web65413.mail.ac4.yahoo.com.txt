This sounds odd. Why would restricting it to a single
core improve performance? The point of using multiple
cores (and multiple threads) is to improve performance
isn't it? I'd leave thread scheduling decisions to the
JVM. Plus, I don't think there is anything in Java to
facilitate this (short of using JNI).

Are you talking about indexing or searching? You may
be able to use multiple parallel threads to improve
indexing performance. I don't think Lucene uses
multi-threading for searching; not unless you have
multiple indices, anyway.
