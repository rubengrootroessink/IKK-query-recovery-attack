SUBJECT: Re: differences in deleting docs using IndexWriter and IndexModifier?
DATE: 18 Apr 2008

Thanks for the explanation.

You're right, IndexReader reports the correct number
of documents.

That might be a worthwhile addition to the
IndexModifier javadocs -
that the IndexWriter method of the same name is not a
drop-in replacement.

Of course, that's moot if docCount gets deprecated
anyway.
