The javaCC - developers from sun started up their own company called metamata
(and took jacaCC with them)  which was sold not so long ago to web gain.

I'm using javacc for two years now, without founding any bug. It is very fast and
very stable and very easy to use. It's a little bit like Donald Knuth tex:
Nothing to improve. So, althought it looks like a dead product, it is still doing
its job perfectly.
(hint: i'm _not_ from web gain)

And: I can still find it in the WebGain-Products list !?
