Mucho thanks. I will look into these.
For more info, I have roughly 30000 documents now, and about 350,000 terms
When I do my queries I use the StandardAnalyzer with a whole slew of stop
words.
So, not sure if that might still be messing me up or not.
In the end, I may have to go with the prebuilt search indexes, which is no
fun.

I may just have to step through the lucene code to see if it is creating
large arrays somewhere that it doesn't need to, or could just cache. Not
sure. 

Will let you know more as I work on it tonight.
