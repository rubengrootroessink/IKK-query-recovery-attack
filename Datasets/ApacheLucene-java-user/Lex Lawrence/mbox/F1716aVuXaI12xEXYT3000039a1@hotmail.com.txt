SUBJECT: Retrieving Field info from an index
DATE: 20 Mar 2002

Greetings-

I am interested in getting information about the available Fields in an 
index.  Once I get hold of a Field object, it can provide everything I need, 
but I'm having trouble getting all of them.  I can use Document.fields() to 
get the "stored" Fields from an arbitrary document in the index.  But... how 
can I get other Fields that may have been indexed and not stored?

Thanks much!
-Lex
