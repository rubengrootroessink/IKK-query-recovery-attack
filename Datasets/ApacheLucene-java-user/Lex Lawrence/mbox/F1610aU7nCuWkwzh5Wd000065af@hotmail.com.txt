SUBJECT: Merging (adding) indices
DATE: 23 May 2002

Hello-
I am using org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[] dirs) 
to merge several indices into one.  The resulting index appears to work 
fine, but afterward the original indices seem to have been completely 
emptied.

I can deal with that, but I just wanted to check: Is this method supposed to 
alter the indices in the 'dirs' parameter?  It's not mentioned in the 
javadoc.

Thanks- Lex
