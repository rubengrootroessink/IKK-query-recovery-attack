Yes, I tried... and at first thought it was all working.  If you create a 
document and then access its fields immediately, it gives you everything.  
But if you store the document in an index, read it from the index, and then 
try to access the fields, you don't get them all.  Of the five standard 
Field types (Keyword, UnIndexed, Unstored, Text(String,String), 
Text(String,Reader)) two are missing (Unstored and Text(String,Reader)).  
See the attached test case, "FieldTest.java".

Thanks- Lex
