Your application works very well, congrats! May I ask how the input is
looking? How are the terms selected, how do you model phrases? Do you
handle titles different from the short summaries?

What I am doing is: I remove stopwords, stem terms using snowballs
default english stemmer, and then already build feature vectors for the
selected terms. I don't have information about phrases in there, yet.
I ask, because the descriptions of your clusters are very nice. How are
they done? (I know you are using SVD to do it, and I am too, but I am
only having single terms, and you have nicely formulated phrases.)

Cheers
Daniel
