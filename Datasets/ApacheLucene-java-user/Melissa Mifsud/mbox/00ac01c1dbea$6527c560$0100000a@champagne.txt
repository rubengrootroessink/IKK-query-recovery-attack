SUBJECT: Document Scoring
DATE: 4 Apr 2002

Hi,

I've been going throught the source code, attempting to find the exact point in time where
the score for each document is calculated and the methods that do this.

I've ended up very confused! Methods such as IndexReader.docFreq(Tem t) which are then used
by Query.scorer(...) are declared abstract and I can't seem to find which classes implement
them.

If the developer is supposed to implement them, how come the demo hasn't?

Can anyone shed some light here?

Melissa
