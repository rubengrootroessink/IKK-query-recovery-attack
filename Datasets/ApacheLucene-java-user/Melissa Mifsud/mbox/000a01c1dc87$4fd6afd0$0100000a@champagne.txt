SUBJECT: Boolean Queries
DATE: 5 Apr 2002

I've been experimenting with boolean queries to find out their real meaning.

If you want to submit a query and would like the returned hits to be documents in which ALL
the query terms appear, is it necessary to construct a boolean query adding a clause for each
term in the query: booleanQuery.add(term, true, false) ?

After some experiments, it seems that the Query returned by the QueryParser given a String
of query terms, is really a query that will return documents with ANY of the query terms.
Can anyone tell me for sure?

Thanks,
Melissa
