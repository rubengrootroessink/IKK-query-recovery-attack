SUBJECT: What type of indexer is Lucene? Question reworded.
DATE: 7 Mar 2002

Hi again!

I should really reword my question as follows:

On which criteria are relevant documents chosen given a particular query

and

once retrieved, how are these documents ranked?

The techniques by which this is done will then determine what type of IR model Lucene implements.

Thanks again!

Melissa
