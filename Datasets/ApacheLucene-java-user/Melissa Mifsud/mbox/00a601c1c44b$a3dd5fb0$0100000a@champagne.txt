SUBJECT: What type of indexer is Lucene?
DATE: 5 Mar 2002

Hi!

Can anyone tell me what kind of indexer Lucene is? Statistical, Probabilistic, Boolean, Extended
Boolean?

I can't seem to find the answer in any documentation or article and it's really important
that I know the type before I use Lucene in for application!

Thanks!

Melissa
