This document is by no means complete, but it might get you started.  My
approach was to execute some code and look at the files using a hex editor.
Then I began looking for the file extensions in code and trying to decipher
them.  I have had time to get very far and some of my initial assumptions
might be incorrect.  But once again, it might get you started.

Good luck,

Mark Tucker

Hi,

They're not encrypted. I can't help you with that but I remember seeing
previous messages regarding their contents. You might want
to take a look at the archives
(http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org/) or, better yet,
the source code ;-)

Regards,

--Daniel
