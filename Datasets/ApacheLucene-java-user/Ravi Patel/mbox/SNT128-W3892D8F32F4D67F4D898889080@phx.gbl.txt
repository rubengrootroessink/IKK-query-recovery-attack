SUBJECT: Indexing and Searching fields that have unique values
DATE: 22 Apr 2010


 

Using Lucene.Net

 

I've built an index of documents.

 

The documents also have a unique identifier (my identifier, not the lucene index's id).

The unique identifers are also a sort order of new-ness (higher id values are newer)

 

string my_id ="1234"

doc.Add(new Field("id", my_id, Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));

 

Searching for a particular id, or range searches are incredibly slow

 

 

TermQuery query = new TermQuery(new Term("id", "1234"));

searcher.Search(query)

 

 

Any tips on how to speed up such an search?

 

I'm also doing RangeSearches on lower / upper ids, and those are slow too
