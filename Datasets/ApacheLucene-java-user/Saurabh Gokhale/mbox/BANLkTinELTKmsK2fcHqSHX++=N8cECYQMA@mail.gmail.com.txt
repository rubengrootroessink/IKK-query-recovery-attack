SUBJECT: Query on using Payload with MoreLikeThis class
DATE: 10 May 2011

Hi,

In the Lucene 2.9.4 project, there is a requirement to boost some of the
keywords in the document using payload.

Now while searching, is there a way I can boost the MoreLikeThis result
using the index time payload values?

Or can I merge MoreLikeThis output and PayloadTermQuery output somehow to
get the final percentage output?
