Thanks for the prompt reply.
I have to bunch the results [only the count] on the basis of value of one of the FIELDS.
lets say FILED-3 and with in it FILED-4.

It is very much similar to using "group by"

What can be the options of doing this? And which is the best way to do it?


Thanks in anticipation,
Regards,
kapilChhabra
