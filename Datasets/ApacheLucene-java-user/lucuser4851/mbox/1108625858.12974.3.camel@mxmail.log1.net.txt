SUBJECT: Using the highlighter from the sandbox with a prefix query.
DATE: 17 Feb 2005

Dear All,
 We have been using the highlighter from the lucene sandbox, which works
very nicely most of the time. However when we try and use it with a
prefix query (which is what you get having parsed a wild-card query), it
doesn't return any highlighted sections. Has anyone else experienced
this problem, or found a way around it?

Thanks a lot for your suggestions!!
