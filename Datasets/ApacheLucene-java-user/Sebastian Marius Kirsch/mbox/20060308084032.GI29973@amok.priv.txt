Thanks, Chris, glad you agree that it doesn't work as you expect it to
work. I will try your suggestions and send in a JUnit test. May take a
while though, as I'm just leaving for CeBIT.

Oh, FWIW, I'm using Lucene 1.9.1 and the Solr nightly build from
2006-03-07 for the FunctionQuery implementation.

Regards, Sebastian
