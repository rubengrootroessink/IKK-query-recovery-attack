I came across that question too recently; it seems to be a rather
under-researched topic in the literature. I used multiplication in the
end, because it's simple, it produces reasonable results, it's not
tunable, and it's invariant to normalization. (Don't make a model with
tunable parameters if you don't know how to tune them ...)

The most helpful paper I came across was this:

http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec13/papers/microsoft-cambridge.web.hard.pdf

It's about combining PageRank with a relevance score, but it contains
a good description of how they arrived at their scoring formula. They
use a linear combination of the two measures and transform them to
have a roughly similar distribution. They then tuned the parameters
using a test corpus (which may be difficult/impossible for your
application.) Their system was one of the best at TREC-13.
