SUBJECT: Default searching across all fields?
DATE: 10 Jan 2006


Is there a way to make the default search to go across all fields?

For example, suppose I have two fields "title" & "content", and we have
the following:

String queryText = "dogs cats";
QueryParser qParser = ...;

Query query = qParser.parse(queryText);  // uses DFLT field.

But what if you want the query to go across ALL fields?

(I'm hoping there is an easier approach than expanding the query across
all fields and do a Boolean OR.)

thanks in advance,
Todd
