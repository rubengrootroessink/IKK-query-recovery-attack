SUBJECT: going from Document -> IndexReader's docid
DATE: 9 Nov 2005


If I have a Document object (doc), and I also have an IndexReader open,
how can I find out IndexReader's docid corresponding to (doc)?

IndexReader has a map from docid -> Document, but I don't see the reverse.

thanks in advance,
Todd
