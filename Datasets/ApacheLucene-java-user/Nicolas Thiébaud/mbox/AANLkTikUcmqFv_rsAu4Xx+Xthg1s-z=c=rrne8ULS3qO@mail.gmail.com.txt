SUBJECT: Attributes and scoring
DATE: 29 Nov 2010

Hi everybody,

I'm a bit confused and didn't find a clearly stated answer in the
documentation.

While analyzing text, Token filters can add data, or custom data to token by
the means of Attributes (ex: TypeAttribute, OffsetAttribute, etc..). This
information is available to the following filters, but my question is, what
makes it to the index ? Do these attributes affect the scoring ?

My understanding is that scoring is only based on *tf-idf* criterion with *
coord(q,d) *(for which I didn't find documentation) and* normalization*. How
is term proximity influencing search results for example ?

Thanks for your help, any reading material is appreciated.

Nicolas.
