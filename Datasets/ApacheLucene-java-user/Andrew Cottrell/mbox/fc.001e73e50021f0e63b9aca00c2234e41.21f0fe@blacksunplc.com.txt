Two back-slashes is correct, the first being the Java escape character.

Should the path passed to IndexSearcher have a trailing back-slash?

i.e. 

public class Search {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try{
      String indexPath = "d:\\org\\", queryString = "parag";
      Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexPath);
