I understand...because I've experienced it.  I think the answer is to
'parallelize' the docFreq process...and or try to make use of the
docFreq(Terms[]).  By passing an Array of Terms, you can avoid the 'call
per Term' per remote and just make a single docFreq call per remote.

You might have to extend the ParallelMultiSearcher and create a threaded
docFreq method.

Hello, Yura.

Does anyone understand my email? Maybe my English is too bad...

Thanks.

YS> Here is the situation. I have ParallelMultiSearcher object
YS> initializated with two or more RemoteSearchable's.

YS> I run PrefixQuery search on some keyword field, say "link". When I
run
YS> search starting just with letter "w" (link:w*) then I should have
like 5k
YS> results.

YS> As I know when I perform search on ParallelMultiSearcher query is
YS> being rewritten at first. So my prefix search is being rewritten
with
YS> "link:wordlist.com link:web.com and so on about 2-3k of terms". Then
as I
YS> understand from debugging for each such term
YS> ParallelMultiSearcher performs docFreq
YS> requests to RemoteSearchables (2-3k calls). So we have many requests
YS> to docFreq method and these operations take like 95% of all search
time.

YS> I see that we have docFreqs method for RemoteSearchable, but it has
YS> not being used.

YS> Is there any way to get rid of those multiple calls of docFreq?
