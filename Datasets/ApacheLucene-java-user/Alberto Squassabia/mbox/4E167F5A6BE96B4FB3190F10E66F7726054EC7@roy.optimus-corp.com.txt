same:

(1) large document spaces (millions);
(2) searches at intersection of AND with one side of the AND sporting
only a few matches, and the other side sporting large match sets.

different:

(3) greater variety of data types

ConjunctionScorer is already used in 1.4 for boolean queries with only
required clauses.

The ConjunctionScorer in 1.4 will do this optimization in the case of a
query with only required clauses.
In what way is your problem similar? The development version has
"similar" facilities for required/optional and required/excluded
queries.
