SUBJECT: Question: Lucene MoreLikeThis score values all the same:
DATE: 25 Aug 2008

As a test, I tried to compare a few documents on various topics (a few on
linux, and another on the U.S. constitution) to a source document on linux
using a query formed by MoreLikeThis.

1. Looking at the hits, they have the same score. I'd expect them to be
different, based on their relevance to the source document. Any ideas?
2. I can't figure out how the search picks up the article on the US
constitution as similar. Any hints? I can tweak the search a bit to limit
this by increasing the min. term frequency via setMinTermFreq() but given
that the interesting terms are so vastly different, I wouldn't have thought
this necessary.

This is my output. I can paste my source code in too if needed.

Thanks
