SUBJECT: Scoring depending on terms combination
DATE: 9 Nov 2006

How can I manipulate the score depending on the combination of query 
terms containing in the result document? Not a single term is important. 
That could be boosted. Important is the combination of terms.

The user searches for the terms A, B, C and D.
Of-course, the document containing all terms has the highest score. The 
document containing just the terms B and C has a higher score than the 
document containing the terms A and B.

A+B+C+D > B+C > A+B

I know the boosting combinations at query time.

Has anybody an idea how to do this?

Thanks. SÃ¶ren
