I understand that sentence:
"The natural solution is to correlate a term's matching value with its 
collection frequency."
exactly in that way, to combine coordination level matching with IDF.

The score for a document is the sum of the term weights w(tf, idf) for 
each containing term. So you have already the combination of 
coordination level matching with IDF. Now it is possible that your query 
requests three terms A, B and C. Two of them (A and B) are quite often 
in the collection one (C) is very rare. It could be possible that 
documents are matching just C have a higher score than documents 
containing A and B. To avoid this you can give the coordination a higher 
influence by multiplying the sum of term weights with the coordination 
as additional factor.
