SUBJECT: Re: Store a document-like map
DATE: 6 Dec 2006

If there would be a boost factor for a single keyword (term) at index 
time I would index a class as a document with the keys as keywords and 
values as boost factor. Unfortunately you can just boost documents and 
fields at index time. Single terms can only be boosted at search time 
(TermQuery.setBoost). So I would store the classes in Lucene, in a 
database or just in a file and index the documents with Lucene. For 
classification I would iterate the classes and do searches over the 
documents for each class. The queries are “SHOULD” BooleanQueries of 
TermQueries for each key of the class boosted by its value. The score of 
a matching document is the similarity to the class (to the query build 
from the class). I’m not sure using the normalized score of Hits or the 
raw score of a HitCollector.

in Lucene, and how I can compare a Document to a class.
