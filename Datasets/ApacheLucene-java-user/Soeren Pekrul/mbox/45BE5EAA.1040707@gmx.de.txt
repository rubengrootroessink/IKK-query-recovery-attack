Simple speaking, the score depends of the query, the matched document 
and the index. The influence of the index is represented by the idf 
(inverse document frequency).

Look at:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html

If you would like to get a score independent of the index you should 
override the idf function by sup-classing the Similarity class 
(DefaultSimilarity) and return always 1.

The score is not one (0.3764683). If it should to be one you can 
normalize the score.

I hope it helps.
