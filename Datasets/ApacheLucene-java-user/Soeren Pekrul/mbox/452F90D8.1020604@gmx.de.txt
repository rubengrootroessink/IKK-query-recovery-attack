Hello Antony,

I have a similar problem. My collection contains mainly German 
documents, but some in English and few in French, Spain and Latin. I 
know that each language has its own stemming rules.

Language detection is not my domain. But I can imagine it could be 
possible to detect the language of a document by statistics methods like 
character based n-grams. "Ä", "ö", "ü", "ß" are quite often used in 
German words, “th” could indicate English and so on. It is probably more 
complex. Matching stop words of a language in a document could be 
another or additional way. How ever, let’s say I can detect the language 
of a document. Than I would use an analyzer or stemmer in the language 
of the document.

Now I see two other problems. Quite often you will find mainly English 
terms in non English documents. You will use for these terms the wrong 
analyzer. Another problem is the query. You should use the same analyzer 
for indexing the documents and parsing the queries. The query is usually 
to short for statistical methods, and you will find stop words in a 
query not so often.

So I decide for my task to use one analyzer for all documents and the 
queries. I use the stemmer of the most probably language of my 
documents. That is not perfect but should be OK.
