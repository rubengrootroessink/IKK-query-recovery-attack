The original user query was a Boolean query:
+(A B) +(C D)

It is possible that this query is to restrict. So I would like to give 
the user to the hits matching his original query additional hits.

My first idea was sub classing TopDocCollector and overriding the 
collect function. In this function I wanted to ask for terms of the 
current document, calculate the score and call the collect function of 
the base class with the new score as argument. I afraid it takes to much 
time.

Boolean queries for each interesting combination with a corresponding 
boost value should be faster.

Thank you, Hoss.
