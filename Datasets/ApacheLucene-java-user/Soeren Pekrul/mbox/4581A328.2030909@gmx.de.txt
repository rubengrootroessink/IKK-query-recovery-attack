I have a quite small collection with 14,960 documents and 29,828 unique 
terms. If I remember right it took a few minutes on a normal laptop 
computer to iterate the terms and documents. I stored the matrix in mySQL:

CREATE TABLE term_document_matrix (
	term VARCHAR( 32 ) NOT NULL ,
	document INT NOT NULL ,
	weight DOUBLE NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
	PRIMARY KEY (term, document)
);

You can see it is not a real matrix just a normal table in the 
relational model. I stored the weights greater than 0 only, so I have 
much less entries than 14,960 x 29,828 = 446,226,880 (in my case 159,407).

I don’t know any API to extract the matrix from the index file directly.
