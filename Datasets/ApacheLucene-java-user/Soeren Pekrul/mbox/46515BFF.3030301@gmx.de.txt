Hello Peter,

for my understanding "+(A B) C D E" means at least one of the terms "A" 
or "B" must be contained and the terms "C", "D", and "E" are optional. 
The following documents d are hits:
d(A, B)
d(A)
d(B)
d(A, C)
...
Documents without "A" and "B" are not a hit.

To have both terms "A" and "B" in a document the query should be: "(+A 
+B) C D E" or "+A +B C D E".
