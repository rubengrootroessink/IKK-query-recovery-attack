Hello Mario,

I had a similar problem a few weeks ago (thread "How to get Term Weights 
(document term matrix)?", 2006-11-02, 
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/41726).

I think there is no simple function creating a document term matrix or 
accessing it. I extracted the matrix from my index and stored the matrix 
in a database.

To create the matrix I iterated the terms and the documents for each term:
TermEnum terms=IndexReader.terms();
while(terms.next()) {
     TermDocs docs=IndexReader.termDocs(terms.term());
     while(docs.next()) {
         //store the term, the document and the weight
         //document frequency: indexreader.docFreq(term)
         //term frequency: termdoc.freq()
     }
}

SÃ¶ren
