Hello Van,

it looks like splitting of compound words. This topic was discussed in 
the thread "Analysis/tokenization of compound words" 
(http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/40164?do=post_view_threaded).

The main idea is as follow:
You have a corpus (lexicon/dictionary). You want to split a word. Build 
letter wise two part words and search them in the corpus. If you can 
find them you can split your word at these parts. You can do that 
recursively finding all sub-parts. This method searches the smallest 
possible words. [1]
If you have a corpus without compound words you can have a better 
quality by searching the largest possible words by searching the word 
first and then splitting it if you couldn’t find it. Do this recursively 
as well. [2]

Warning: The results are usually not linguistically correct. How ever, 
the quality should be good enough for searching.
