SUBJECT: Maybe a stupid question?
DATE: 10 Jul 2003

Hello, i would like to know if it was possible to introduce more than once
value for a field in a document.
I think that is must be possible, but i don't know how to make it.

Thanks for answering and knocking on my head if i had stupid questions ;-)
