SUBJECT: Number range search through Query subclass
DATE: 14 Feb 2003

Hi,
 
I am writing an application that constructs Lucene searches from XML queries. Each item from
the XML is represented by a Query of the corresponding type. I have a problem when I try to
search for number ranges, since RangeQuery compares strings, not numbers, so 15 < 155 <
20. What I need is a subclass of Query that evaluates numbers correctly. I have tried subclassing
RangeQuery, MultiTermQuery or Query directly, but each time I have run into problems with
inheritance and access rights to various methods or inner classes.
 
Does anyone know of a solution to this problem? If there is none, the only way I can think
of would be indexing numbers as something like "#15#". But it's not a very elegant solution
when all I need is a slight variation of one existing class.
 
Thanks for any help you can offer,
 
Volker
