SUBJECT: Wildcard and Fuzzy queries in GermanAnalyzer
DATE: 24 Feb 2003

Hi,

I have noticed that FuzzyQueries and WildcardQueries don't do stemming.
Since all terms in the index are in stemmed forms, this causes some
problems:

"Etagenwohnung" gets stemmed to "nwohnung". So a search for
"Etagenwohnung will find "Etagenwohnung" and "nwohnung".

Fuzzy search for "Etagenwohnung~" finds neither of those, but it will
find "Nebenwohnung".

Wildcard search for "Etagenw?hnung" also finds neither of the two
documents, while "nwoh*" finds "Etagenwohnung", which is also not what a
user would expect.

It seems that stemming has a fundamental problem with these kinds of
tolerant searches. Does anyone know how to resolve these issues? Do you
plan to tackle this problem in a future release of Lucene?

Volker
