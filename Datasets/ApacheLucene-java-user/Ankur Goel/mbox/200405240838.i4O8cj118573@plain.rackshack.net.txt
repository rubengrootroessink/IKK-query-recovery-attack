Thanks once again. I also had found help from textmining org for word and
now I am able to extract text both in English and Japanese and am able to do
Lucene search also on them. But the problem is still for excel files. I
tried to use POI apis but I am able to convert my input into
DocumentInputStream only which worked well for English when I did a Lucene
search but not for Japanese. So now I am stuck again :(. Trying to find a
way out :) ...

Regards,
Ankur

hi,
  i used a library  texmining.org for extracting word docs using Apache POI
. Its fairly simpe API . so converted into some.txt with UTF16 encoding
before indexing .

 it should work. Let me update abt ur progress..



 org.textmining.text.extraction.WordExtractor extractor = new
      org.textmining.text.extraction.WordExtractor();
      String s = extractor.extractText(new FileInputStream(fileToindex));
      String encoding="UTF-16LE";
      OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(
          new File(
          "some.txt")),encoding);
          out.write(s);
          out.close();


regards
