SUBJECT: multivalue fields
DATE: 11 May 2004

How can I construct a document that has multiple values for one field (ex: locale en_US, de_DE,
etc).  I've been concatonating the values into one string and storing them in one field, but
I think this affects the search rankings (more text to search produces lower score).  is it
possible to append the seperate values to the same field without concatonating them together?
