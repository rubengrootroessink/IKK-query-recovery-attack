SUBJECT: field indexed but not stored
DATE: 24 Jun 2004

I'm using lucene-1.4-rc3 and trying to optimize the size of our index and decrease search times.
 our index has several fields that we need to search and sort by, but only one field that
we actually retrieve from the hits document.  I tried creating all fields as unstored, except
for the one I need, except now all searches fail (0 results).  Is this the correct way to
do this or did I misunderstand the documentation?
