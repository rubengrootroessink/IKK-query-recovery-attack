SUBJECT: documentation fix for website
DATE: 20 May 2004

Is this the right place to submit a problem with the website documentation?  http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/systemproperties.html
lists mergeFactor twice with different property names.  the second occurance should be updated
to lockDir (the underlying href link is correct).
