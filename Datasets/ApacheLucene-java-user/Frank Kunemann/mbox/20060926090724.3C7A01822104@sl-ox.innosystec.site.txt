SUBJECT: How to tell if IndexSearcher/IndexReader was closed?
DATE: 26 Sep 2006

Hi all,

after I delete some entries from the index, I close the IndexSearcher to
ensure that the changes are done.
But after this I couldn't figure out a way to tell if the searcher is closed
or not.
Any ideas?


Regards
Frank
