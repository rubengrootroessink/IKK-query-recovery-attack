SUBJECT: Which field  has a hit?
DATE: 22 Mar 2006

Hi again,

is there a way to receive the fields of a document that have a hit?
My problem is that in my case a lucene document consists of many different
files that belong together. Each of the files has an own content field, but
I don't store the content to keep the index as small as possible.
Therefore when using highlighting I have to go through each file till a
given number of fragments are highlighted or no more content fields (and
therefore files) are available. This would be much faster if I knew in which
field the hits were and how many.


Cheers,

Frank
