SUBJECT: Parse multiple fields using Queryparser
DATE: 18 Oct 2010

I have many fields in my document and want to parse my query including each
of them

QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(Version.LUCENE_29, "Field2",new
StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_29));

Should I create multiple parsers in this case or is there any other way
round?
