SUBJECT: spaces in the field name
DATE: 23 Jun 2011

 I have a situation where the field name consists of spaces.
So a query like
*short text: value*

doesn't return any results as the query structure internally would be
*defaultField:short
text:value*
*
*
*Any work around for including spaces in your field name?*
