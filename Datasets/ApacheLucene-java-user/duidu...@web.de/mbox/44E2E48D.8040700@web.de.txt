SUBJECT: Re: Quotes dependent StopWords removal
DATE: 16 Aug 2006

Hello Sameer,

what about this:

- during indexing, use the StandardAnalyzer without stopwords
- during the search, use 2 different Analyzers - one with and one without stopwords. Thereyby,
you look first whether the user
  has typed in quotes inside her query String.
  # If so, look whether there are stopwords between the quotes
    * in the case there is a stopword between quotes, use the Analyzer without stopwords
    * in the case there is no stopword between quotes, use the one with stopwords
  # If not, use the one with stopwords anyway

...the lack on this approach is that when a user mix up stopwords queries with and without
quotes, you can not decide such easily-
maybe there a solution can be to modify the analyzer stopword lists on the fly...then the
last problem left is when the user types
a specific stopword twice - with and without quotes..so maybe you can live in this situation
to use the Analyzer without stopwords -
depending on your scenario, it could be a good compromise...or search n times - but this wouldn't
straight forward also ;)

way to do this apart from extending / modifying the QueryParser. In some sense, it is similar
to the issue discussed in:
