SUBJECT: searched terms frequency question
DATE: 16 Dec 2008

Hi

Each document found in a Lucene index contains scoring information 
however it doesn't provide (in the same easy way as scoring) an 
information about a number of occurrences of searched terms in its contents.
Using Lucene API I can check each searched term against its frequecies 
in each found document but I want to be sure that there is no better way 
to get information about frequences of searched terms in (each) found 
document.

Regards
John S.
