SUBJECT: TooManyClauses and maxClauseCount question
DATE: 20 Jan 2010

Hi
  I'am getting TooManyClauses exception while performing wildcard query. 
I'am thinking about changing max clause count limit 
(BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount() method). My question referes to memory 
consumption in case of increasing maxClauseCount parameter.
  Does Lucene do it in a smart way (allocates bigger buffer only when it 
is neccesary) or allocates constant (increased) amount of memory for 
every wildcard query ?  

Regards
JS.
