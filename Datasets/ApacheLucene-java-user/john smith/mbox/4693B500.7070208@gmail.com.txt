SUBJECT: document field indexing
DATE: 10 Jul 2007

Hi
 Lets say we have a single lucene document that has two text fields: 
field1 and field2.
 Data kept in field1 is a long string that changes rarely. It takes some 
time to index it.
 Data kept in field2 is a short string and changes often.
 
 Is it possible to update (reindex) document field2 without reindexing 
the whole document  ?
 
Regards
John
