Hi John,

You're right there. Most possibly the frequencies in that list are based on
a volume of the Los Angeles Times, that's one of the standard
CLEF-Collections. The Glasgow Herald is the second standard collection, here
"Scotland" and "scottish" are among the most frequent terms :-)

Maybe the "officials" come from sports articles --> LA --> LA Lakers?!

Cheers,
René
