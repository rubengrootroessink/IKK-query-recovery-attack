SUBJECT: Re: MultiFieldQueryParser seems broken...  Fix attached.

Hi Bill,

-----
But even if it didn't, the second
problem is that the query formed would be

   +(title:cutting title:lucene) +(author:cutting author:lucene)

That is, if the word "Lucene" was in both the author field and the
title field, the match would fit.  This clearly isn't what the
searcher intended.
-----
AFA my understanding of the query syntax goes, this would be interpreted
as (A OR B) AND (C OR D) which would produce the same set as 
(A OR C) AND (B OR D) == +(title:cutting author:cutting) +(title:lucene
author:lucene). But it would only be true for this special case with 2 terms
and 2 fields.

I reckon there has been a discussion (and solution :-) on how to achieve the
functionality you've been
after:

http://issues.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgId=1798116

I'm not sure if this would be the same though.

Best regards,
René
