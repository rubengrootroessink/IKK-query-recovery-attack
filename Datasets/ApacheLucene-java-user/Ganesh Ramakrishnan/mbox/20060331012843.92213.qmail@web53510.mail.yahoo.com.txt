SUBJECT: Implemented subclasses of Similarity class in Lucene
DATE: 31 Mar 2006

Hi

Is anyone aware of subclasses of the Similarity class in Lucene? Two subclasses are: DefaultSimilarity
and  SimilarityDelegator . Are any other implemented subclasses of Similarity, developed by
anyone else available on the web?  For example, Language Model based similarity, or Okapi-BM
similarity or different TFIDF weighing scehemes for similarity.
  
  If so, can you point me to them?
  
  Thanks and regards,
  Ganesh.
