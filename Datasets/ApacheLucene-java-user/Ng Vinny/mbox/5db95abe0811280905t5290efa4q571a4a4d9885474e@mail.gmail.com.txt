SUBJECT: PhraseQuery and non-letter characters
DATE: 28 Nov 2008

Hi,

I'm having an issue with PhraseQuery in which a query for the phrase
"information technology" has among of its matches the strings "information,
technology" and "information. Technology",  which should not be considered
as matches.
Both StopAnalyzer  StandardAnalyzer removes non-letter character at index
time.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.
