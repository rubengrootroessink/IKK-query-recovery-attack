SUBJECT: problem with details given by Explanation object
DATE: 27 Nov 2007

Hi all,

I am having a problem with Lucene 2.2.0 with regard to the contents of the
Explanation objects after a PhraseQuery search. I indexed two documents doc1
and doc2 and then issue an OR Boolean query consisting of two PhraseQuery
pq1 and pq2.

Apparently, the details of the Explanation object for doc1 show that pq1 has
positive tf value even though it doesn't appear in doc1. The tf value is
exactly the same as that of the tf value for pq1 in doc2 (pq1 does appear in
doc2).

The code is attached (the sample pdf files cannot be attached due to size
restriction on the list).

Please help to shed some light on this.

Thank you very much
