SUBJECT: RE: How to obtain raw scores?
DATE: 19 Nov 2008

hi

Is there any documentation that says that scores obtained from
TopDocs.scoredocs[i].score
are comparable across queries. I am having this problem myself so I would
really appreciate if anyone has some pointers to this.

At [1], it seems like they are not. Is there any solution to enable this
comparison?

thank you.

Please ignore this question.
I've noticed it was answered in
another thread just before
I posted my question.

Answer: use TopDocs.scoredocs[i].score
