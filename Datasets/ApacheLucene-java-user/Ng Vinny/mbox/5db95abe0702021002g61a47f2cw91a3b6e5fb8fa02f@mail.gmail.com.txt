SUBJECT: how to store and reuse query
DATE: 2 Feb 2007

Dear List,

After processing some text, I have constructed a Boolean query , e.g.
"title:Lucene author:Otis", and I would like to store the query to reuse
when the same piece of text is issued (to avoid re-processing of the same
text).

I thought of storing the string resulted from Query.toString() method, but
there is no constructor of Query to build a new Query from the string I
retrieve from the datastore.

Please shed some light on this.

Thanks a lot.
