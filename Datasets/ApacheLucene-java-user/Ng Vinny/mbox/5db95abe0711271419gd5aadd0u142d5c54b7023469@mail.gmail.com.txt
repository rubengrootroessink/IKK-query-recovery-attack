SUBJECT: Re: problem with details given by Explanation object
DATE: 27 Nov 2007

Hi Erick,

I indexed only files in pdf format so I cannot put them inline here in
email. I did use Luke and put the same query into it and the same thing
happened.

Is there any chance i can send the two pdf files that cause the error to you
to see if the error can be reproduced?

Best,
Ng
