SUBJECT: Re: how to use DuplicateFilter to get unique documents based on a  fieldName
DATE: 5 Mar 2010


Hi Ian,

Thanks for your reply. We had actually done what you had suggested first,
and it wasn't working, so I was hoping for some sample code. But then we
found out that the field name on which we wanted the duplicate filter to be
applied was not actually indexed while adding it into the document. ie
Field.Index was set to NO. We changed this, repopulated the documents and
the filtering works now.

We have about 3 million records in the database and documents little more
than that, and we wouldn't want to do the deduping at indexing time, because
one book ( one isbn ) can be available under 2 or more categories( like
fiction, comics & novels, science etc)
