SUBJECT: how to use DuplicateFilter to get unique documents based on a fieldName
DATE: 4 Mar 2010


Hi there, Could someone help me with the usage of DuplicateFilters. Here is
my problem

I have created a search index on book Id , title ,and author from a database
of books which fall under various categories. Some books fall under more
than one category. Now, when i issue a search, I get back 'X' books matching
the search criteria, some of which are repeated, because that books are in
different documents and its the expected behaviour. 

I use the  TopFieldDocCollector . getTotalHits() to get the total count. But
this includes the repeats as mentioned above. This count is not the actual
count, Hence when I issue a search on title or author i want to get a unique
count / list of books. How do I use DuplicateFilter to acheive this. 

Please help

Regards
Anish
