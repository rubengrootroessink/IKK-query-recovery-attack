my experiences:
1 caching if source document doesn't update frequntly.
2 caching first 100 results only. when read above 100 results, lucene search twice and make
a 200 results buffer, reach again lucene search again ,make 400 results buffer.

http://search.163.com use lucene as category search and news search. handle 10 querys/sec
with 2 pIII(1G linux)
