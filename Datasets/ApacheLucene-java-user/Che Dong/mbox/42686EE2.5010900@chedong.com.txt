SUBJECT: Re: sorting on "dates" a little fuzzy...
DATE: 22 Apr 2005

Just like Google said: full text search service is not traditional 
database application. Lucene is not a database too: if you wanna sort on 
some fields, you'd better pre-sort it before it indexed: like date. then 
get results by doc id.

For lucene you can only sort results in top hits. if you sort 400k 
result hits by date: you lost the speed of Lucene.


Thanks
