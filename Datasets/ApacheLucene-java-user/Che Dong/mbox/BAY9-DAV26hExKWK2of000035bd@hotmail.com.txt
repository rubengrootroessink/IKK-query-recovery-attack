I think Tranditional Chinese use in HK and TW is supported for CJK Charactor is indentified
with charactor block of: CJK_UNIFIED_IDEOGRAPHS

I'm no linguist, so the short answer is, I'm not sure about Taiwanese. If they share the same
character sets and a bigram indexing approach makes sense for that language (read the links
in the CJKTokenizer source), then it would probably work.

For Latin-1 languages, it will tokenize (It is setup to deal with mixed language documents
where some of the text might be Chinese and some might be English) but it will be far less
efficient than the standard tokenizer supplied with the Lucene core. But you should run your
own tests to see if that would be livable.

Eric,

Does this tokenizer also support Taiwanese & European languages (Latin-1)?

Regards,
Avnish

This archived message has the CJKTokenizer code attached (there are some links in the code
to material that describes the tokenization strategy).

http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-dev@jakarta.apach
e.org&msgId=330905

You have to write your own analyzer that uses this tokenizer. See http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/01/15/lucene.html
for some details on how to write an analyzer.

here is one you could use:
package my.package;

import org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.StopFilter;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenStream;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.cjk.CJKTokenizer;
import java.io.Reader;

public class CJKAnalyzer extends Analyzer {
    
    public CJKAnalyzer() {
    }
    
    /**
     * Creates a TokenStream which tokenizes all the text in the provided Reader.
     *
     * @return  A TokenStream built from a CJKTokenizer
     */
    public TokenStream tokenStream( String fieldName, Reader reader )
    {
        TokenStream result = new CJKTokenizer( reader );
result = new StopFilter(result, new String[] {""}); // CJKTokenizer emitts a "" sometimes,
haven't been able to figure it out, so this is a workaround
        return result;
    }
}

Lastly, you have to package those things up and use them along with the core lucene code.

CC'ing this to Lucene User so everyone can benefit from these answers. Maybe a faq on indexing
CJK languages would be a good thing to add. The existing one (http://lucene.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/faq/faqmanager.cgi?file=chapter.index
ing&toc=faq#q28) is somewhat light on details (so is this answer, but it is a bit more
direct about dealing with CJK) and http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=1011118 is useful
to be aware of too.

Good luck,
Eric

Hi Eric,

I read the description of the bug (#18933) reported by you on the apache site. I had a question
related to this defect. In the description you have mentioned that CJK support should be included
in the core build. Is there any other way we can enable the CJK support in the lucene search
engine? Would be grateful to you if you could let me know of any such method of enabling CJK
support in the serach engine.

Eagerly waiting for your reply.

Thanks & Regards,
Avnish Midha
