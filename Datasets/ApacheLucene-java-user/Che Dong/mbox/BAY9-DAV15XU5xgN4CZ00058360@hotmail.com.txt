but for CJK there is no space for word segment in nature. so the Bigram Co-occurrences will
be the better way for  Word Discrimination. 
For example: term C1C2 if segment into C1 and C2 the results will contains C2C1... but in
Chinese, the word C1C2 and C2C1 maybe in different meaning.
compare to the the sigram base tokenizer implement in StandardTokenizer the bigram based token
will return MUCH better results.

According to my feed back on CJKTokenizer: 
for CJK users, the bigram based CJKTokenzier was strongly recommended for better results.
