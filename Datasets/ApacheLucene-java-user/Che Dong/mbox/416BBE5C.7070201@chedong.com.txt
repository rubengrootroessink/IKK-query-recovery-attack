DATE: 12 Oct 2004

CJKAnalyser not support single byte-stream, front end interface and 
backend indexing process need to transform source into double byte 
charactor-stream properly before search/index.

Please tell me know the output of
http://www.chedong.com/tech/HelloUnicode.java
with javac -encoding=gb2312 and javac -encoding=iso-8859-1
