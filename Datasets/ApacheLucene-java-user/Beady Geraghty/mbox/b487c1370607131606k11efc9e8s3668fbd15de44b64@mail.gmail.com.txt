SUBJECT: file format of index
DATE: 13 Jul 2006

As I understand from earlier answers to my question that
one can create an index on machine A,
and use  it   (search and merge with other indices) on Machine B.

I was reading the file format today.
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/fileformats.html

The index has Byte UInt32 UInt64 in most places, making it byte order
indepdent in these places.

However  a few spots has long and int.
For example in the Compound Files section, there is a
DataOffset-->Long

and in term Vectors, there is a
TVXVersion --> Int

Is this an oversight in the documentation or is the document correct, and
does this indicate that there will be problem using an index on a big Endian
machine which is created on a small Endian machine.

If both machines have the same Endian maybe the usage of Index created
elsewhere is still fine ?

I am starting to create quite a bit of code with the assumption that porting
and merging index is okay anywhere.    I would appreciate some more
input as to whether these fields mattered or not and whether the
documentation
is correct.

Thank you in advance.
