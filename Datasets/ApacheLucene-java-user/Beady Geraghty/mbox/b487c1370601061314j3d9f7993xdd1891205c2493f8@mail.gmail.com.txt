SUBJECT: Re: need some advice/help with negative query.
DATE: 6 Jan 2006

I thought along the line of dummy:all as well, but for some reason,
I chose bitset.  I am not sure if it matters which route to go.

My situation is that for now, I have say 10000 documents,
but, maybe I incease that by 100 time or more.  I would guess that
half of the documents qualifies, and half don't.

It appears that everyone  suggests that I take  MatchAllDocsQuery
from the trunk. Is this the choice regardless of the number of
documents I have ?

Thanks,
