SUBJECT: Re: merge index from different platform
DATE: 27 Jun 2006

Thank you for the response.

I wasn't very clear in my original note. I just want to make sure that I
can merge indexes created  from differerent platforms/different OSes without
problem.  So I understand from the respond that this can be done.

Thanks
