Hi Owen,

This can easily be done! Simply install tomcat on port 8080 and create a 
jk2 or proxy that points to tomcat. then all requests for jsps can be 
send to tomcat. The search engine can even be placed on a separate 
server. If you give me some details on your server, i will create a 
proxy script for your apache!

regards,

Maurits
