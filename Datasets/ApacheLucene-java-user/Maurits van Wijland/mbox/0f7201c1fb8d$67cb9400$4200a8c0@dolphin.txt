Well, the main keyword here is freeware...now that's a big NO! But, next
best thing...there is this
dutch company named "carp technologies" (and no, I don't work for them...:)
that has a
summarization tool (also written in Java).

So, the URL is: http://www.carp-technologies.nl/en/home.html

There is a 'free' personal edition...

so, have fun
