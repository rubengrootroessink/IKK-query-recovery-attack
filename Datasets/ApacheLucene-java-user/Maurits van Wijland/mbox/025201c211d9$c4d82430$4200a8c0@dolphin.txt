Hi William and all,

We should clearly look at the snowball initiative. There a re a dozen
Western European stemmers that could easily be included with Lucene. By
adding a language identification mechanism (based on frequency of stop words
for instance), we can build a generic analyser that will use the correct
language specific analyser.

So, william, have a look at Snowball at sourceforge, this has a Portugues
stemmer.

regards,

maurits.
