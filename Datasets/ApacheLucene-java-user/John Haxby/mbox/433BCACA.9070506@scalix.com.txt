What verison of Linux are you using?

On Fedora Core 4 (and probably other Fedora's and RHEL)  LANG=el_GR sets 
the character set to ISO 8859-7, eg (on my various machines):

    $ LANG=en_GR date | iconv -f iso88597
    Πεμ Σεπ 29 11:59:19 BST 2005
    $ LANG=el_GR.utf8 date
    Πεμ Σεπ 29 12:01:40 BST 2005

(Everything in FC4 is UTF-8 so it displays right and it seems that the 
Greek for "Sep" is "Sep" -- no surprises there I guess.)

In your case, replacing "date" with whatever the command is that you use 
to generate the indexes should do the right thing.
