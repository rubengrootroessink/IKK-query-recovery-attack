Oh rats. Thunderbird ate the indenting. The two examples should be:

multipart/alternative
	text/plain
	multipart/related
		text/html
		image/gif
		image/gif
	application/msword

and

multipart/related
	text/html
	image/gif
	application/msword

the indenting indicates nesting. A message isn't just a bodypart 
followed by attachments, it has structure like a file system. Something 
which escapes most mail readers. Sigh.
