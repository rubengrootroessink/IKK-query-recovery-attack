You have a file system NFS mounted on this machine, but the machine 
hosting the real file system has no knowledge of your mount.  This often 
happens after the host machine has had a reboot.

Solution: unmount (and possibly re-mount) the failing NFS file system.   
If you're not sure which one it is, try looking at a file on each NFS 
file system with, say, "cat" or "wc" and see if you get a stale NFS 
handle error.   You may need "umount -f" to unmount the failing file 
system.   Sometimes, very occasioanlly, you'll have to resort to a reboot.
