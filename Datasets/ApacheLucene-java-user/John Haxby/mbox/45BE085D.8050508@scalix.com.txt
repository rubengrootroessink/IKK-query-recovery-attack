SUBJECT: Slightly off-topic: using openoffice for conversions
DATE: 29 Jan 2007

Hello All,

In LIA, Erik and Otis mention using the openoffice.org API for 
converting from various formats to something that can be used for indexing.

Does anyone have any examples of doing this that they'd be willing to share?
