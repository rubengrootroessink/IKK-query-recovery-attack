SUBJECT: Lucene in Action hits desk in UK
DATE: 26 Jan 2005


My copy of Lucene in Action has finally hit my desk in the UK.  
Hopefully the dispatch time quoted by amazon.co.uk will now start to 
drop to something more sensible.

It's been interesting watching the price changes.  When I ordered my 
copy back in November, I paid £19.38 for it.  At around the time of 
publication, the price went up to £35.99, the list price.   It's 
currently priced at £25.19, 30% off list price.
