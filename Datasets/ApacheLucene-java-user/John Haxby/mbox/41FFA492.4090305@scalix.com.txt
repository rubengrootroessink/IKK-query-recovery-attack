I slightly misled you: it wasn't Lucene that I was using at the time and 
in that system the distinction between IndexReader and IndexWriter 
didn't exist.   I'm just getting to grips with Lucene really but it 
would seem to be possible to use a similar scheme, especially if you 
batch up your documents for indexing: as they come in, check the md5 
checksum against what's already known and what's already queued and then 
when the time comes to process the queue you know what you've got needs 
to be indexed.
