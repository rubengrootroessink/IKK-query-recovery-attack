The reason for this is that when you reply to a message you get an 
"in-reply-to" header that refers to the message-id of the original 
header; you may also get a "references" header that performs a similar 
function for other message in the thread.   I haven't come across a mail 
client  that drops the in-reply-to when you change the subject.

If you want to find out exactly what your particular mail client does; 
reply to a message of your own and then look at the message source or 
the original message headers (what you're looking for depends on the 
client, sometimes it's obvious, sometimes its hidden in message properties.)
