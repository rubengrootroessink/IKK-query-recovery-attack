javamail.   Not sure how you get hold of the messages from Outlook 
Express, but getting hold of the MIME message in most Unix-based message 
stores is relatively easy.   You might, however, prefer to go down the 
POP or IMAP route for getting hold of the messages to index -- either 
way, javamail is your friend.
