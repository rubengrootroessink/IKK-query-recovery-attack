They're not identical.   The first one is 2006-09-30 22:00:00 UTC and 
the second 2006-10-01 13:00:00 UTC.

I ran across the problem with DateTools not using UTC when I tried to 
use an index created in California from the UK: I was looking for 
documents with a particular date stamp but I found documents with a date 
stamp from the wrong day.  Even more interesting and bizarre things 
happen around the change from daylight savings time to normal time.
