Hmm.  I'm not sure how valuable that is.   For English "los" and 
"angeles" are ranked 99 and 101 respectively and "officials" comes in at 
125.   Obviously I'm guessing, but those middle ranking words have come 
from a slightly skewed source -- newspapers in a fixed interval 
perhaps.  (I don't think "Los Angeles" makes it into every day parlance 
in the UK, and "officials" suggests that we're obsessed with beauracracy 
:-))
