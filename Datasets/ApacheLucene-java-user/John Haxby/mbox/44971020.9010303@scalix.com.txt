Yes.   And it's definitely worth your while to study not only javamail 
but the MIME RFCs (RFC2047 deals with headers, a nearby one deals with 
the main MIME format, I forget the number) and RFC2822 for the base mail 
format -- understanding the structure of a mail message is more than 
half the battle to knowing how to index it.
