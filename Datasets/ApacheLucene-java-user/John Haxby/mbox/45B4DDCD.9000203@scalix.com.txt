Are you implying that the process memory shrinks, that memory is 
returned to the kernel? I didn't read the page you referenced that way.

I know that if I allocate memory by memory mapping anonymous regions 
with Linux/Unix I can give it back, but is that the technique that JVMs use?

It's not generally a problem though. Provided you have a compacting 
garbage collector (and the Sun Java GC is one) then the unused memory 
will just get paged out. It may be a different story on windows and it's 
certainly a different story on an embedded platform, but releasing 
memory to the kernel under Linux is not generally necessary or desirable.
