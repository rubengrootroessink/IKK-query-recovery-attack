That deals with a user's access rights changing but it doesn't deal with 
the access rights if individual files changing, unless you re-index a 
file when its access rights change.   I don't know about NT, but 
Linux/Unix permissions on files change helluva a lot more often than a 
user's access rights change.

Although slower than relying entirely on Lucene, I would be inclined to 
filter out results for which the user has no access.   Unless I've 
missed  something in recent JDK versions, I don't think that there is 
anything in Java to do this and you'd have to wrap a small library using 
JNI or similar to do this check.
