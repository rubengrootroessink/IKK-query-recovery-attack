naïve, is to normalize the data on the inbound side as well as the data in the database (prior
to full text indexing) and retrieve matches.

Look back through the archives a bit for  ISOLatin1AccentFilter.  It 
almost does the job and works reasonably well for western european  
characters.    You'll also find a posting of mine that presents a 
somewhat more complete filter based on the unicode decompositions.   If 
you can't find it I'll dig out the stuff I wrote and re-post it (and 
then maybe some kind soul will add it alongside ISOLatin1AccentFilter).

Eric Jain's comment about "ä" being converted to "a" instead of "ae" is 
a fair one, but it probably doesn't much matter.  Although I have seen 
"Müller" written as both "Muller" and "Mueller" so you're not going to 
be able to please everyone all the time without injecting synonyms and 
being very clever.   And if you're that clever you might catch both 
"encyclopedia" and "encyclopædia" -- the latter converted to 
"encyclopaedia" which isn't the same as "encyclopëdia"!
