We did this by naming the flags and storing them in a single field.  So 
if we have three flags called, oh, alice, bob and clive and we wanted to 
indicate alice and clive were set and bob clear then we store "alice", 
"unbob" and "clive" in the "flags" field.

That seems to be quite efficient -- I can now search for any combination 
of flags (or bits) set or unset and I can add new flags at will.
