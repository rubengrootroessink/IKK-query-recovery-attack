SUBJECT: RE: Checking for duplicates inside index
DATE: 23 May 2006

Any chance I could get my hands on code to "de-dup". I have a current
method I think is quite sub-optimal, as I am searching the index for a
dup on every insert.... Not a very good method I think...

Or any other suggestions on good ways to prevent duplicates? I am
indexing with a field that has a unique ID, so it should be fairly
straightforward...

Thanks.
