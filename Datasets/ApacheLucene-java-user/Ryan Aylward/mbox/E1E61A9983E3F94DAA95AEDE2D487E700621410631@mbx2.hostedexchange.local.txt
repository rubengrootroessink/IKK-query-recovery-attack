This is great. Is there a target of when 4.0 will be released?

in Lucene's trunk, Similarity can now be controlled on a per-field
basis, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2236

The only exceptions are things like coord() which apply to e.g.
BooleanQuery (which might span multiple fields) and remain top-level
in the new SimilarityProvider.
