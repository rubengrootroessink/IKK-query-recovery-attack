Thanks very much for the response, Erick.

I think one of my co-workers tried to use it and seemed to think it
didn't meet our needs but I'll give it a shot.

In the meantime, I'm curious to see if anyone else has modified
BooleanQuery to modify how calculates the score. Is the only way to do
that to make a copy of the classes?

I haven't a clue about the package protected thing, but
you may not need to go there. This sounds a lot like
DisjunctionMaxQuery, have you looked at it?
