Have you tried to add the -DdisableLuceneLocks=true flag to the RUNJAVA
command of catalina.sh? I had to add it to run servlets accessing lucene,
but
I'm not sure what my problem was.

Lines 219-227 of my catalina.sh (running jakarta tomcat 5.0.16 under linux):

  else
    "$_RUNJAVA" $JAVA_OPTS $CATALINA_OPTS \
      -Djava.endorsed.dirs="$JAVA_ENDORSED_DIRS" -classpath "$CLASSPATH" \
      -Dcatalina.base="$CATALINA_BASE" \
      -Dcatalina.home="$CATALINA_HOME" \
      -Djava.io.tmpdir="$CATALINA_TMPDIR" \
      -DdisableLuceneLocks=true \
      org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap "$@" start \
      >> "$CATALINA_BASE"/logs/catalina.out 2>&1 &
