SUBJECT: Lucene Javadoc Exception - cause?
DATE: 2 Feb 2007

Hi,

I was implementing some calls to Lucene, though was
curious if there was 
some documentation I was missing that indicated why a
method throws an 
exception.

Example, IndexReader - deleteDocuments() - what is the
root cause as to 
why it throws IOException?

I'm trying to utilize this info to determine my
exception handling 
strategy for all my Lucene API calls (should I fail,
retry, ignore, etc)

Thanks,
Josh
