SUBJECT: SpellChecker Index - remove words?
DATE: 11 Jan 2007

Hi All,

The spellchecker api is very nice to use, and I can
easily add words to 
the index. However, because the words I am adding are
from another index 
that is user generated per se (meaning it may have
spelling errors), how 
can I safely remove words from the spell checker
index? If I know the 
exactly the word I would like to remove?

Thanks,
Josh
