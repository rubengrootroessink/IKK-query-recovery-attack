Hi,

I have a problem which I'd like to understand - and perhaps it is also 
possible to solve it ;-).

I built an index using Lucene with the GermanAnalyzer. Now I have the 
following phenomenon:

- when searching for "bahn" the result contains hardly any "bergbahn"

I am aware that the Lucene Query-Api supports wildcards, but as far as I 
know I cannot add a * in front of a query-term.

Do you have any suggestions how I could find "bergbahn" with the query 
"bahn"? (this applies to other compound words as well).

With regards
Tino
