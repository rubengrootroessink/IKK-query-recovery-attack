Thanks!

Yes.  Thanks for pointing these out.  These are big incompatible changes
that I forgot to mention.  

Other changes since 1.01b include:
  - ant-only build -- no more makefiles
  - addition of lock files--now fully thread & process safe
  - addition of German stemmer
  - MultiSearcher now supports low-level search API
  - added RangeQuery, for term-range searching
  - Analyzers can choose tokenizer based on field name
  - misc bug fixes.

I need to work up detailed release notes for the final 1.2 release.

Let's see, some short term tasks for the 1.2 release:
  - get source code back into releases
  - clean up example code
  - write release notes

Some mid-term tasks:
  - add contributed Chinese analyzers
  - add Hits.SetOrdering() support
  - add some term highlighting support

Longer term tasks:
  - add JDBC-based Directory
  - optimize simple conjunctive queries
  - optionally store document vectors in index

Have I missed your favorite?
