Hi,

If you say you want the first hit, do you mean any hit or the one
that's usually first in Hits? The latter is the one with the highest
score, so interrupting the search won't help you, since you don't know
when the highest score is reached before examining all documents.

I agree that bailing out of the HitCollector is a bad idea, because
the only way to achieve this is to throw an exception. Probably Lucene
finishes searching, creates the Hits object and cooks a meal long
before the VM is able to build the stack trace and execute your catch
clause ;)
