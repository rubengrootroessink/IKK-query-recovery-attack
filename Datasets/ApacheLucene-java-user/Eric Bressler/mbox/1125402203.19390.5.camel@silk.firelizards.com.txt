SUBJECT: RE: Corrupted indexes
DATE: 30 Aug 2005

I was going to send out the answer to this problem this morning. I found
it around 2am last night.  I was mistaken that I had corrupt the
indexes.  The real problem was that I had forgotten the constructor I
was using for the index reader an had it like 

writer = new IndexWriter(indexlocation, new StandardAnalyzer(), true);

instead of 

if ( !IndexReader.indexExists(indexlocation)) {
       writer = new IndexWriter(indexlocation, new StandardAnalyzer(),
true);
}				
else
	writer = new IndexWriter(indexlocation, new StandardAnalyzer(), false);


So I was basically always making a new index.  Really a beginner mistake
but I had written that portion so long ago I didn't look.
