SUBJECT: lock file in tomcat
DATE: 1 Oct 2005

Hello,

Based on what criteria is the lock file name created? 
I have a multiple applications deployed on the same
instance of tomcat, each one of them has its own documents,
and lucene index. is write lock also unique to each of the
applications?
If you have multiple instances of tomcat on the same box,
sharing the same documents directory, and the same Lucene
index, do they have separate lock files?
What if each one of the instances needs to modify the index
at the same time?

Thank you,
DarekC.
