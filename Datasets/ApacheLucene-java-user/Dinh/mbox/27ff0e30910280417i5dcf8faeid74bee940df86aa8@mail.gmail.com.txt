Hi Anshum,

this
while?

The answer is yes. I have tried to keep a singleton instance of
IndexSearcher open across web requests.

Regarding to your advice, I have tried to re-open the IndexReader that is
associated with that IndexSearcher

    public void deleteById(String id) throws IOException {
        IndexWriter writer = IndexWriterFactory.factory();

        try {
            writer.deleteDocuments(new Term(Configuration.Field.ID,
String.valueOf(id)));
            writer.commit();
            IndexSearcherFactory.reload();
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            // CHECK ignore this. Can happen if index has not been built yet
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }

Here is how IndexSearcherFactory#reload is defined

    public static void reload() throws CorruptIndexException, IOException {

        Set<Map.Entry<String, IndexReader>> set = readers.entrySet();
        for (Map.Entry<String, IndexReader> entry : set) {
            readers.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue().reopen(true));
        }
    }

However, it does not work either.

Is there any way to debug this situation?

Thanks,

Dinh
