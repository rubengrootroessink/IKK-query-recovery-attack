SUBJECT: Can I omit ShingleFilter's filler tokens
DATE: 11 May 2011

Hi,

Can I remove the filler token _ from the n-gram-tokens that are generated by
a ShingleFilter?

I'm using a chain of filters: ClassicFilter, StopFilter, LowerCaseFilter,
and ShingleFilter to create phrase n-grams.  The ShingleFilter inserts
FILLER_TOKENs in place of the stopwords, but I don't want them.

How can I omit the filler tokens?

thanks
Bill
