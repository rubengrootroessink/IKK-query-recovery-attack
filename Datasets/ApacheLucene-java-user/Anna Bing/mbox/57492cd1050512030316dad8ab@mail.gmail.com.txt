SUBJECT: Search Theory Book

Firstly the Lucene in Action Book is great.  It really helped me with
implementing search for a project.

Sorry if this is the wrong forum but as you are all search people.  I
wondered if you could recommend any good books about search
theory/algorithms (readable if that is possible in an algorithm book).
 Is there a key text like GOF book with Design Patterns?
