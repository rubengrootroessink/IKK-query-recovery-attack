SUBJECT: AW: OutOfMemoryError using IndexWriter
DATE: 25 Jun 2009

Hi,

I'm afraid my test setup and code this is far too big.
What I use lucene for is fairly simple. I have a database with about 150 tables, I iterate
all tables and create for each row a String representation similar to a toString method containing
all database data. This string is then fed together with the primary key to lucene. Full-text
search of my db is then possible. Each document in Lucene represents a row in the database.

I tried calling setMaxBufferedDeleteTerms  with 100MB heap size to no avail, but calling commit
every 10000 documents does help. I assume a commit is similar to creating a new IndexWriter.

HTH,

Stefan

Can you post your test code?  If you can make it a standalone test,
then I can repro and dig down faster.

Can you try calling IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDeleteTerms (eg, 1000)
and see if that prevents the OOM?
