Hi,

Or that my test db is smaller than the production db which is indeed the case.

That sounds promising to me, how does a delete happen, we are talking of complete new re-indexing,
no deletes at all should be happening. Are you saying that I remove docs from the index ?

A fair amount is created by my app - I histogram without indexing shows about 10MB chars created
by my App:
class [C 	132399 	9457148,
though a few more could be created during indexing.

Please explain those buffered deletes in a few more details.

Thanks,

Stefan
