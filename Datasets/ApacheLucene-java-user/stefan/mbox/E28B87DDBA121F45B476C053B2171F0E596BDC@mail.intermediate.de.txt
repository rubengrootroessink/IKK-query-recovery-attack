DATE: 24 Jun 2009


Hi,

does Lucene keep the complete index in memory ?
As stated before the result index is 50MB, this would correlate with the memory footprint
required by Lucene as seen in my app:
jvm 120MB - 50MB(Lucene) - 50MB(my App) = something left
jvm 100MB - 50MB(Lucene) - 50MB(my App) = OOError

though some hint, whether this is the case, from the programming side would be appreciated
...

Stefan

When the segments are merged, but not optimized. It happened at 1.8GB to our program, and
now we develop and test in Win32 but run the code on Linux, which seems to be handling atleast
upto 3GB of index. 

In fact, if the index size if beyond 1.8GB even, Luke throws Java Heap Error, if I try to
open.

Please post your results/views.


Sincerely,
Sithu

Hi,

I do use Win32.

What do you mean by "the index file before
optimizations crosses your jvm memory usage settings (if say 512MB)" ?

Could you please further explain this ?

Stefan

 Hi Stefan,

Are you using Windows 32 bit? If so, sometimes, if the index file before
optimizations crosses your jvm memory usage settings (if say 512MB),
there is a possibility of this happening. 

Increase JVM memory settings if that is the case. 


Sincerely,
Sithu D Sudarsan

Subject: OutOfMemoryError using IndexWriter

Hi,

I am using Lucene 2.4.1 to index a database with less than a million
records. The resulting index is about 50MB in size.
I keep getting an OutOfMemory Error if I re-use the same IndexWriter to
index the complete database. This is though 
recommended in the performance hints.
What I now do is, every 10000 Objects I close the index (and every 50
close actions optimize it) and create a new
IndexWriter to continue. This process works fine, but to me seems hardly
the recommended way to go.
I've been using jhat/jmap as well as Netbeans profiler and am fairly
sure that this is a problem related to Lucene.

Any Ideas - or post this to Jira ? Jira has quite a few OutOfMemory
postings but they all seem closed in Version 2.4.1.

Thanks,

Stefan
