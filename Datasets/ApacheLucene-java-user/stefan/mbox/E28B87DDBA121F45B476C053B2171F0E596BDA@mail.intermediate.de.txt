DATE: 24 Jun 2009


Hi,

I do use Win32.

What do you mean by "the index file before
optimizations crosses your jvm memory usage settings (if say 512MB)" ?

Could you please further explain this ?

Stefan

 Hi Stefan,

Are you using Windows 32 bit? If so, sometimes, if the index file before
optimizations crosses your jvm memory usage settings (if say 512MB),
there is a possibility of this happening. 

Increase JVM memory settings if that is the case. 


Sincerely,
Sithu D Sudarsan

Subject: OutOfMemoryError using IndexWriter

Hi,

I am using Lucene 2.4.1 to index a database with less than a million
records. The resulting index is about 50MB in size.
I keep getting an OutOfMemory Error if I re-use the same IndexWriter to
index the complete database. This is though 
recommended in the performance hints.
What I now do is, every 10000 Objects I close the index (and every 50
close actions optimize it) and create a new
IndexWriter to continue. This process works fine, but to me seems hardly
the recommended way to go.
I've been using jhat/jmap as well as Netbeans profiler and am fairly
sure that this is a problem related to Lucene.

Any Ideas - or post this to Jira ? Jira has quite a few OutOfMemory
postings but they all seem closed in Version 2.4.1.

Thanks,

Stefan
