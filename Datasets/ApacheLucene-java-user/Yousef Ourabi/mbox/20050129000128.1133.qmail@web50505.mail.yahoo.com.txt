SUBJECT: Re-Indexing a moving target???
DATE: 29 Jan 2005

Hey,
We are using lucene to index a moderatly changing
database, and I have a couple of questions on a
performance strategy.

1) Should we just have one index writer open unil the
system comes down...or create a new index writer each
time we re-index our data-set.

2) Does anyone have anythoughts...multi-threading and
segments instead of one index?

Thanks for your time and help.
Best,
Yousef
