Hey,
Thanks for everyone's reply to my last post, I have
some quesiton. I imported the PorterStemmer and when I
did the following

PorterStemmer ps = new PorterStemmer();
string r1 = ps.stem("elephant");
r1 is 'eleph'

also buying stems to bui, is this normal? Am I doing
something wrong.

I am calling reset inbetween function calls.

Thanks,
Yousef
