DATE: 5 Nov 2004

Hey,
On the site It says Lucence Uses Levenshtein distance
algorithm for fuzzy matching, where is this in the
source code? Also I would like to use the porter
stemming algorithm for somethign else, Are there any
documents on the Lucence implementation of Porter
Stemmer.

Best,
Yousef
