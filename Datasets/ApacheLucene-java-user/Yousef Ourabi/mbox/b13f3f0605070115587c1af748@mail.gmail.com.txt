SUBJECT: Getting all terms from Index
DATE: 1 Jul 2005

Hello all,
I am getting odd results, documents without the keyword I search for
are being returned. I want to get all the indexed (searchable) inside
the index, then create queries for those words with explaining
(explaination object) set to see what matches to what and why?

Thanks in advance,
Yousef
