SUBJECT: PhraseQuery Incompatible format version
DATE: 5 Jul 2005

Hey All:
Quick Question about the following error I am getting when I use a
string tokenizer to parse the query string. The query I pass to is
Great Expections / Great Expectations, both are two tokens however?

phraseQuery.add(new Term("content", tok.nextToken()));
IOException caught SearchByTerm: Incompatible format version: 2
expected 1 or less

Any thoughts?
