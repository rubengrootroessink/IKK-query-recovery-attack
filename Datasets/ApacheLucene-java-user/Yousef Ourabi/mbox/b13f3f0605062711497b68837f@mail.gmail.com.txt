SUBJECT: Indexing Forums (Document & Field Paradigm)
DATE: 27 Jun 2005

Hello:
Thanks for all the help so far it has been fantastic. I have a
question on the document and field paradigm, this works great for
flat-files, like a word document, or web-page but what about nested
forums (ala slashdot) where in theory a specifc chat thread is nested
or is nested inside another chat thread.  Is there a way to nest
lucene documents. IE Top level post in forum is one document, and any
branches off the main thred are nested inside that top level one? OR
is there a better mapping of lucene's paradigms to a slashdot like
forums paradigm?

Thanks for any help.

Best,
Yousef
