SUBJECT: Junit Tests for Indexer / Searcher
DATE: 21 Jun 2005

Hey All:
So Obviously the lucene dev-team uses unit tests when building the
api, but what are people's experiences with using unit tests to test
that indexing is working, that searching is working. Are there
pre-developed test-suits for such things, so that I can make a change
to a some search parameter, run the test-suite and be certain that
lucene works?

I greatly appreciate any help.

Best,
Yousef
