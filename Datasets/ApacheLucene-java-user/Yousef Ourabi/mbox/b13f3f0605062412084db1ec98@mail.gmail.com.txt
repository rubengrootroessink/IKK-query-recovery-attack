Hello:
Is there any way to force the document id inside the lucene index, if
I have my own internal numbering scheme, it would be nice to have that
reflected inside the lucene index...anyway?

IF not is the document ID created on creation or on addition to the
index? And is there a way to retrieve it before it is added to the
index?

Thanks,
Yousef
