Hi,

what can i do with files which are deleted from the document directory?
How can i delete them from the index, if i start an update?

Currently i start a search in the index for existing documents and delete
them, when they have changed! After that session i add all the documents,
which are not in the index by searching in the index.

So it could not work thatway because i can not search for a file, witch
does't exists!!! And the reading of the index with the indexreader take so
much time!!! so? you have an idea?

Bye
