Hi,

i have a problem with the indexing.
It concerns the following... i index documents in one directory.
In this directory there are many other directories with documents... etc.
Above 1000 directories! And i have one Index directory.

So i get the Exception: Exception in thread "main"
java.io.FileNotFoundException: \\??\??\Index\_w.fnm (System can not find
file.)

And it doesn't matter which index structure i use (the mutifile or the
compound index) i get this exception if i want to search in the index,
Luke also show the same exception!

Funny is that it works when i delimit the number of directories which sould
be indexed lesser than 1000!!!!

What can i do!?
