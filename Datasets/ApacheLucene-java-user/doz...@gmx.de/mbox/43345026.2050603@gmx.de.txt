SUBJECT: thinking about the pronunciation of lucene
DATE: 23 Sep 2005

Hi,

today we talk about the pronunciation of Lucene.
So... i'm from Germany.
And the pronunciation of Lucene we use here is like it would be a Frensh 
word.
That means we don't pronounce the "e" in the end of the word.
Like the name "lucy" with the add of the "n".

Is this the wrong way to pronounce it?
How should we do it? :)

Bye Derya
