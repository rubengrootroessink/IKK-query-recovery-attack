I have two strings -
String1 contains multiple words  &
String2 contains just 1 word

I need to search my index to find hits where String1 and String2 occur 
within a distance "slop = d" of each other. Order is important. Also, 
ideally I would like to do a fuzzy search on String1. Is there some way 
to do this without having to chop string1 into multiple terms and adding 
them to a SpanQuery[]?

Thanks for the help.
