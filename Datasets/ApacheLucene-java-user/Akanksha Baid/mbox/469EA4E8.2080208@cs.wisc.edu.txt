I am using Lucene 2.1.0 and want to use MoreLikeThis for querying 
documents. I understand that the jar file for the same is in contrib. I 
have the contrib folder extracted, but am not sure what to do from this 
point on. What jar file am I looking for and where should  put it. I am 
using Eclipse.

If someone could please point me to some directions for the same , that 
would be a big help.
Thanks.
