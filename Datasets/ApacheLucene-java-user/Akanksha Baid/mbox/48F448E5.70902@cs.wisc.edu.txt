I have indexed multiple documents - each of them have 3 fields ( id, tag 
, text). Is there an easy way to determine the set of tags for a given 
query without iterating through all the hits?
For example if I have 100 documents in my index and my set of tag = {A, 
B, C}. Query Q on the text field returns 15 docs with tag A , 10 with 
tag B and none with tag C (total of 25 hits). Is there a way to 
determine that the set of tags for query Q = {A, B} without iterating 
through all 25 hits.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
Akanksha
