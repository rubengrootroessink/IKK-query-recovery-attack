SUBJECT: how to score in lucene
DATE: 20 Nov 2009

hi,
    I have a problem with scoring a document in lucene. I know there
are some factors such as docNum,boost,idf,docFreq,lengthNorm and so
on. And I also know how to count docNum,docFreq,idf, but I really have
no idea about counting the lengNorm . thx.
