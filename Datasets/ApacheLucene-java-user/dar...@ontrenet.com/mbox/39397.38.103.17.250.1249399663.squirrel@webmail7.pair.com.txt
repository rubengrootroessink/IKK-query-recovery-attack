Just catching this thread, but if I understand what is being asked I can
share how I do multi-word phrase matching. If that's not what's wanted,
pardons!

Ok, I load an entire dictionary into a lucene index, phrases and all.

When I'm scanning some text, I do lookups in this dictionary index using
one word at a time with the word _at the beginning_ of the indexed field
only. This returns all words/phrases beginning with the word I searched
for.

I then scan the rest of the input text and compare it to the longest
matching phrase in my lucene results. That then becomes a meaningful
token.

Input text:
"The President of the United States lives in the White House"

Tokens:
"The"
"President of the United States"
"lives"
"in"
"the"
"White House"

Term: "President"
Result:
"President of a Company"
"President"
"President of the United States"

Take the longest match.

HTH,
Darren
