SUBJECT: Re: multi-term synonym expansion
DATE: 6 Jul 2010


How does the synonym filter work internally? I configured it with a very
large synonym file (90,000 lines) running Solr in glassfish and it started
fine, but when I queried, it hung and ran out of memory. The file wasn' big
enough to exhaust the heap....I never was able to get it to run smoothly.
