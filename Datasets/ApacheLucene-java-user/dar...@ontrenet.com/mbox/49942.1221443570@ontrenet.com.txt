SUBJECT: Re: SpanQuery problem
DATE: 15 Sep 2008

Yes, return the document, but the problem is with SpanNearQuery it does not return the documents
I expect.
Sorry I did not explain it well. Consider 2 documents each with "word" fields.

Document 1

word: blue bird
word: blue car

Document 2

word: sky blue
word: sea blue

I want to search for 'blue' and ONLY return Document 1 as I already know
that the term 'blue' MUST appear at the front of the field word:

SpanNearQuery with slop of 0 or 1 won't do this if Document 1 has other fields
like this.

Document 1 - IS NOT FOUND WITH SPAN NEAR 0 or 1

word: some blue
word: another blue
word: blue bird
word: blue car

Expanding the Span slop to 3 will find Document 1 above this line, however
I thought the slop meant within the field terms. It seems to refer to the list of fields rather
than terms. This is unexpected behavior to me. But I'm no lucene expert.

Thanks for any thoughts.

Darren
