I am using *Lucene* 2.3.1 and JCC 1.6 to create an *index* of my
python-based application(for searching).Everything is working fine.After
some time(3 hours later) i found my python memory consumptions is grown to
high when i started the applcaition(indexing) the  python consumption is 40
mb , after 3 hours the python consumption shows 140mb . *The *performance of
Indexing become poor and memory leaks.

please help me to solve the problem.

Thanks
