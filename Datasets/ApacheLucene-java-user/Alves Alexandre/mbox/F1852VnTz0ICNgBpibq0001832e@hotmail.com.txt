SUBJECT: Problem with score()
DATE: 9 Sep 2002

Hi,
I use Lucene RC5 for indexing and searching words into HTML document.
I would like to improve my result's page with giving the number of the word 
in the text like "3 words find / 4 words search" and highligth it.
For the number of the words, I try to use the Interface TermDocs with the 
method freq() but it always return zero.
For the highligthing, I know there is a contribution in the Lucene website 
but I don't how I can use it.

Anybody can help me ?
Regards
