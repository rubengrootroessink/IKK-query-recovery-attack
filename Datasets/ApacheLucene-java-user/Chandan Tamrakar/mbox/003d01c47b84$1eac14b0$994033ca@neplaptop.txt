Dear all,
  I have been using lucene index for a while , currently i have "indexes" on
a single machine  . But the volume of files are increasing and i want to
seperate
  indexes on differnt machines accoding to categories  , Does lucene support
distributed indexing ? I am  confused what will be   the best approach ?

thanks in advance
