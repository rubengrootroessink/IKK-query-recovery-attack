What if we are using addindexes(Ram Directory) method ? it calls optimize
function inside the function itself ?

Any solution to this ?

I think it is worth your time to do some benchmarking. I think 
mergeFactor is not very helpful in the end...if you set it high, you'll 
index faster but then your searches will be slower prompting you to 
optimize...after which you'll find that you paid all your gains back. 
Test things out for yourself, but I'd recommend a low merge factor and 
then you can forget about the hassle of optimizing. Amortize, amortize...
