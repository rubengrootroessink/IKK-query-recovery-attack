DATE: 19 Mar 2004

How do I index a HTM document which may have any encoding like
EUC,SJIS,Western European or UTF 8. Can  I parse and extract the html into
string and than convert into Text file in UNICODE ?
Is this an appropiate way  to index HTML files ? Can anyone suggest me a
simple parser other than a parser found in demo of lucene ?

Also how do i find the "encoding " of files ? Whenever there are ANSI text
files containing japanese characters i am not able to convert into UTF-16
lucene is indexing properly when I convert into SJIS

thnks
