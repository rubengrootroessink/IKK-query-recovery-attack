SUBJECT: drawback addindexes method
DATE: 3 May 2007

 

I found that IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[]) always calls optimize
method twice 
I am indexing a documents in batches , i.e I call this method when X no. of
documents are buffered in RAM
Using RAMDirectory . So as the index size grows , optimize method will only
increase by indexing time
 
Can these lines be commented out and call the optimize method only at the
end of indexing process?
 
Your thoughts please
 
Thanks
Chandan
