SUBJECT: indexing multiple pages and proximity search
DATE: 18 Apr 2008

Hi,

 

I have a document and each page of this document is extracted into single
text files 

 

For ex, document abc.doc have abc_page1.txt , abc_page2.txt ...
abc_pageN.txt  , is it possible to index them and still retain the 

Lucene proximity search because technically it is a single document

 

 

Thanks

chandan
