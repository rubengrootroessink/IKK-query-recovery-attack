SUBJECT: Indexing japanese PDF documents
DATE: 22 Mar 2004

I am using latest PDFbox library for parsing . I can parse a english
documents successfully but when I parse a document containing english and
japanese I do not get as I expected .

Have anyone tried using PDFBox library for parsing a japanese documents ? Or
do i need to use other parser like xPDF ,Jpedal ?

Thanks in advace
Chandan
