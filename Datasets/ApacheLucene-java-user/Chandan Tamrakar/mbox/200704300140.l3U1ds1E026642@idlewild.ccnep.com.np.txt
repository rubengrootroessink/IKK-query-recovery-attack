Thanks Erik , so FSDirectory seems better option than RAMDirectory ? Also I
think O.S can cache files  in which case FSDirectory may not be bad , your
thoughts ?

As I understand it, FSDirectory *is* RAMdirectory, at least until
it flushes. There have been several discussions of this,
search the mail archive for things like MergeFactor, MaxBufferedDocs
and the like. You'll find quite a bit of information about how these
parameters interact.

Particularly, see the thread titled

"MergeFactor and MaxBufferedDocs value should ...?"

I suspect, that if you're explicitly creating RAMDirectories and
merging them that your code is more complex than it needs
to be to no good purpose (of course, I've been wrong before,
once or twice at least <G>).

If you really require parallel indexing, you might try running
FSDirectory based processes on several machines, then merging
the resulting indexes as a final step. How you tell each of these
processes which documents to index I leave as an exercise for
the reader.....

Best
