SUBJECT: CJK Analyzer indexing japanese word document
DATE: 16 Mar 2004


I am using a CJKAnalyzer from apache sandbox , I have set the java
file.encoding setting to SJIS
and  i am able to index and search the japanese html page . I can see the
index dumps as i expected , However when i index a word document containing
japanese characters it is not indexing as expected . Do I need to change
anything with CJKTokenizer and CJKAnalyzer classes?
I have been able to index a word document with StandardAnalyzers.

thanks in advace
chandan
