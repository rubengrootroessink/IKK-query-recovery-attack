I just used StandardAnalyzer and code is as following:

=====================================================
      Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
      BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
      String line = in.readLine();

      if (line.length() == -1)
        return;

      Query query = QueryParser.parse(line, "contents", analyzer);
      Hits hits = searcher.search(query);
      Highlighter highlighter =new Highlighter(new QueryScorer(query));
========================================================

Part of the fulltext result is:

principles, such as joint... of the RNP. However, poor representation of
community interests on the joint management committee... of a joint management
committee and the improvement of infrastructure in the area. The key differences
......
========================================================
Of course the result is far more than this.

The paper itself looks normal to me. It makes me confused why this is happening.

Thanks for your help,
Ying
