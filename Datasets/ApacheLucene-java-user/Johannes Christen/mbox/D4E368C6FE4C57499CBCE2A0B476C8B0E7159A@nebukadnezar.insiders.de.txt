SUBJECT: AW: retrieve all docs efficiently - just one field
DATE: 13 Jun 2008



There might be quite a lot of users in different groups, but more important the user access
rights might change and keeping them up to date in the index would be a real challenge.

But thanks for the LUCENE-879 tip. I will look into that next week.

How many users usually have access to any given document? Can't you  
just index them with the document?

LUCENE-879 is a proof of concept that shows how you can enforce the  
Lucene document numbers if you really want to go that way.
