they probably create a list of similar results by doing some sort of 
data mining on the search criteria that people use in succession, so for 
example someone, or they have a list of searches that are too general (a 
search for the word kid is at best stupid) but you can't call your users 
stupid so you try to guess what they're searching for based on other 
searches conducted  (kid rock, kid games, star wars kid, karate kid ) 
that contain the initial search string "kid". You can use fuzzy search 
in Lucene, but that won't do that really, the short answer is DIY 
depending on your needs.
