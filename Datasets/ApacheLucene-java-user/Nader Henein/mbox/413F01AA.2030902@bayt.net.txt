SUBJECT: Re: Moving from a single server to a cluster
DATE: 8 Sep 2004

Hey Ben,

We've been using a distributed environment with three servers and three 
separate indecies for the past 2 years since the first stable Lucene 
release and it has been great, recently and for the past two months I've 
been working on a redesign for our Lucene App and I've shared my 
findings and plans with Otis, Doug and Erik, they pointed out a few 
faults in my logic which you will probably come across soon enough that 
mainly have to do with keeping you updates atomic (not too hard) and 
your deletes atomic (a little more tricky), give me a few days and I'll 
send you both the early document and the newer version that deals 
squarely with Lucene in a distributed environment with high volume index.

Regards.

Nader Henein
