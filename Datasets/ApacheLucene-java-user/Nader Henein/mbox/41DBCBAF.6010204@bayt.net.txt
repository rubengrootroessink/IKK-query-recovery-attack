Hibernate + Lucene,

Use Hibernate to read from your DB, this will pull out the data you need 
in nice and clean objects, and then loop through your object collection 
and create Lucene documents, you can add Quartz to the equation and have 
this process run scheduled on chunks of your data till it's all been 
indexed and then continue on with incremental updates / deletes.
