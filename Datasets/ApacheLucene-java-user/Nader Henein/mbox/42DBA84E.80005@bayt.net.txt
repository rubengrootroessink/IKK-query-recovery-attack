Sounds like straight forward string manipulation, just (a) tokenize your string into a collection,
and then (b) manipulate the collection to reach your desired stream, then (c) join it back
into a string. Oh and once again Erik is spelled consistently with a 'k' not a 'c', you got
the first one right then, everything went to hell :-)
