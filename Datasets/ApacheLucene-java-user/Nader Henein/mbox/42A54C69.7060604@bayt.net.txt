IMHO, Issues that you need to consider

    * Atomicity of updates and deletes if you are using multiple indexes
      on multiple machines (the case if your cluster is over a wide network)
    * Scheduled indecies to core data comparison and sanitization
      (intensive)

This all depends on what the volume of change is on your index and 
whether you'll be using a Memory resident index or an FS index.

This should start the ball rolling, we've been using Lucene successfully 
on a distributed cluster for a while now, and as long as you're aware of 
some basic NDS limitations/constraints you should be fine.

Hope this helps
