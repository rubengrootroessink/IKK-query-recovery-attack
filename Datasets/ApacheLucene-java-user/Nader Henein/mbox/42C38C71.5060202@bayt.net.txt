I am as interested in the answer to the first question as you, so we'll 
have to wait on an answer from one of the senior guys, I imagine in a 
perfect world both indecies should be the same if the same data is fed 
in assuming no errors occurred during indexing.

As for the second question, if you as merely comparing if the documents 
exist/ or not from one index to the next, you could compare one index to 
the other taking on as your primary using range queries to retrieve 
collections of IDs and then using the Java collection API to do Union 
and Difference comparisons, at least that's how I did it, or 
alternatively you could compare both indecies to the persistent core / 
or set of files that you created the index from in the first place.

Hope this helps
