SUBJECT: Re: How to efficiently get # of search results, per attribute
DATE: 13 Nov 2004

It depends on how many results they're looking through, here are two 
scenarios I see:

1] If you don't have that many records you can fetch all the results and 
then do a post parsing step the determine totals

2] If you have a lot of entries in each category and you're worried 
about fetching thousands of records every time, you can just have 
seperate indecies per category and search them in in parallel (not 
Lucene Parallel Search) and you can get up to 100 hits for each one 
(efficiency) but you'll also have the total from the search to display.

Either way you can boost up speed using RamDirectory if you need more 
speed from the search, but whichever approach you choose I would 
recommend that you sit down and do some number crunching to figure out 
which way to go.


Hope this helps
