You would have to write a little application to read from oracle and 
write Lucene documents to the index and then a little more code to 
search your newly created index. Lucene will function externally from 
Oracle, you can also add a few triggers to oracle to tag new records as 
"dirty" or pending indexing, so when the indexer runs it can pick those 
up. This all depends on how complex your application is and how complex 
do you see it getting.
