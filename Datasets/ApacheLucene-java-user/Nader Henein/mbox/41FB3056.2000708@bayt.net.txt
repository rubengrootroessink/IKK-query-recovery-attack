We'll need a little more detail to help you, what are the sizes of your 
updates and how often are they updated.

1) No just re-open the index writer every time to re-index, according to 
you it's moderately changing index, just keep a flag on the rows and 
batch indexing every so often.
2) It all comes down to your needs, more detail would help us help you.
