I realize I've already asked you this question, but do you need 100% 
real time, because you could run batch them every 2 minutes, and 
concerning Parallel search, unless you really need it, it's overkill in 
this case, a communal index will serve you well and will be much easier 
to maintain. You have to way requirement vs. complexity/ debug time.
