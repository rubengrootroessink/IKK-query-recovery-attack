It comes down to your searching needs, do you need to have your 
documents searcheable by these fields or do you need a general search of 
the whole document, your decisions will impact the size of the index and 
the speed of indexing and searching so give it due thought, start from 
your GUI requirement and design the index that responds to your user 
needs best.
