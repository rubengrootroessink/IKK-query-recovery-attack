SUBJECT: Re: Opinions: Using Lucene as a thin database
DATE: 14 Dec 2004

How big do you expect it to get and how often do you expect to update 
it, we've been using Lucene for about 1 M records (19 fields each) with 
incremental updates every 10 minutes, the performance during updates 
wasn't wonderful, so it took some seriously intense code to sort that 
out, as you mentioned, it comes down to why you need the Thin DB for, 
Lucene is a wonderful search engine, but if I were looking at a fast and 
dirty relational DB, MySQL wins hands down, put them both together and 
you've really got something.

My 2 cents
