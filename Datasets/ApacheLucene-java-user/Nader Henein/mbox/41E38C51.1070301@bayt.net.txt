 From the text on the Lucene Jakarta Site : 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html


Lucene provides the relevance level of matching documents based on the 
terms found. To boost a term use the caret, "^", symbol with a boost 
factor (a number) at the end of the term you are searching. The higher 
the boost factor, the more relevant the term will be.

    Boosting allows you to control the relevance of a document by
    boosting its term. For example, if you are searching for

    		
    	

jakarta apache

    	
    		

    and you want the term "jakarta" to be more relevant boost it using
    the ^ symbol along with the boost factor next to the term. You would
    type:

    		
    	

jakarta^4 apache

    	
    		

    This will make documents with the term jakarta appear more relevant.
    You can also boost Phrase Terms as in the example:

    		
    	

"jakarta apache"^4 "jakarta lucene"

    	
    		

    By default, the boost factor is 1. Although the boost factor must be
    positive, it can be less than 1 (e.g. 0.2)
