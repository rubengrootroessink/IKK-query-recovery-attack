Hi,

I could able to create create the index . However, when i am trying to
search, i am hitting 0.

Environment : Windows
DB : Oracle 
-> I have created a directory called : c://dbindex. I am seeing the indexes
are created.
My sql Query fetches just one row 
select id, CSC_SITE_ID, ADDRESS1,CITY, STATE from WIPS_ADDRESSES where
csc_site_id = 41813612;

Result :
41813612	BUIDING 2166 12TH LGGETTE	FORT LEWIS	WA

-> I have created another directory called c://qa//a.query where I have an
entry called
FORT LEWIS
Also, tried with 41813612
I am not hitting any result.

Please let me know what is going wrong.

Please explain more on this syntax :
