Congratulations on the move! The new site looks up and smooth. I know
it's a lot of work to do this stuff, thanks to all the Apache folks
behind the scenes who made it happen. The software collection at
Jakarta just gets better and better.

As near as I can see, the two major changes for 1.2-rc1 are:
  switch to org.apache.lucene package names.
  Apache license instead of LGPL.

Sometime when someone has a chance, I'd love to hear a bit about what
plans there are for Lucene development.
