Erick,
     Thanks for the advice.  I will take a look at
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper to see if I want to take this on.  For my
case, I have to use mexed case for a couple of fields since case
really does matter for them (ie apple is not the same as Apple), and I
actually don't want users to find the document if they enter the
"wrong" case (ie a search for Apple should not return docs containing
apple).
