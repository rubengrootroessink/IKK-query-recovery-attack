SUBJECT: Re: Indexing source code files
DATE: 29 Feb 2008

There is an opensource project, OpenGrok, that uses Lucene for indexing and
searching source code:

http://opensolaris.org/os/project/opengrok/

It has Analyzers for different type of source files.  It does link source
code to requirements but you can
take a look at the source code to see how it does the indexing.
