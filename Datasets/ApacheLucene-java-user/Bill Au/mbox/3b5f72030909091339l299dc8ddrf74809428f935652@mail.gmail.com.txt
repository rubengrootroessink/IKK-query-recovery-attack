SUBJECT: support for PayloadTermQuery in MoreLikeThis
DATE: 9 Sep 2009

Has anyone done anything regarding the support of PayloadTermQuery in
MoreLikeThis?

I took a quick look at the code and it seems to be simply a matter of
swapping TermQuery with PayloadTermQuery.  I guess a generic solution would
be to add a enable method to enable PayloadTermQuery, keeping TermQuery as
the default for backwards compatibility.  The call signature of the same
enable method would also include the PayloadFunction to use for the
PayloadTermQuery.

Any comments/thoughts?

Bill
