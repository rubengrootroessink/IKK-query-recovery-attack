thanks for your reply, eric.

so i am right that its not possible to change the boost without 
reindexing all files? thats not good... or is it ok only to change the 
boosts an optimize the index to take changes effecting the index?

if not, will i be able to boost those fields in the searcher?

thanks, bastian

The boost is not thrown away, but rather combined with the length 
normalization factor during indexing.  So while your actual boost value 
is not stored directly in the index, it is taken into consideration for 
scoring appropriately.
