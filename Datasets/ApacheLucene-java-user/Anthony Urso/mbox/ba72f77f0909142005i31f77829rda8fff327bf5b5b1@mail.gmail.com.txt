SUBJECT: Re: Field with reader limitation arbitrary
DATE: 15 Sep 2009

It's best to file a feature request on the Lucene issue tracker if you
are interested in seeing this implemented.

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE

Just cut and paste your description and attach a patch and/or tests if
you have them.

Cheers,
Anthony
