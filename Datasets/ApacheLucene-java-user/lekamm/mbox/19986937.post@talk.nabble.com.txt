Is specific about Php, but can be easily use try to solve the same problem
in Java.

I had the same problem as "Christophe from paris", and changing the query to
it's html encoded equivalent makes my search queries work.

So Perhaps, Chris could try to html encode it's queries that contains accent
and see if more results are returned.

And sorry if it is php only solution.
