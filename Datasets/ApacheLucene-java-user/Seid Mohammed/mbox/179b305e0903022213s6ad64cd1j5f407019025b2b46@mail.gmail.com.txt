SUBJECT: How to index Named Entities
DATE: 3 Mar 2009

I want to index document conents in two ways, one just a simple
content, and the other as named entity.
the senario is like this.
if i have this document "the source of Nile is Ethiopia"
then I want to index "source" as a normal content, "Nile" as river
name, and "Ethiopia" as Country name. so that later if ask a question
"where is the source of Nile", it should retrieve Ethiopia as an
Answer.

Note: I will have List of River names, Country names,... so that
during indexing I will compare every word of a document with my lists.

thanks a lot
