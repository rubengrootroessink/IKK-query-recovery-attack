SUBJECT: I can't make index for .jsp files with IndexHtml!
DATE: 5 Dec 2004

Hail everyone,

I am Benson, and this is the first time I raise question via Lucene Users List.

I got a problem: Everytime I try to make an index with IndexHtml for a
directory under Tomcat webapps which includes .html and .jsp files, it
only scans for .html files, but not .jsp files. However, it works
while I make index with IndexFiles.

My command under DOS is as following:
java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index /opt/lucene/index
../SampleDirectory
(where 'SampleDirectory' is the name of my target directory)

Thank you!

Benson Fang
