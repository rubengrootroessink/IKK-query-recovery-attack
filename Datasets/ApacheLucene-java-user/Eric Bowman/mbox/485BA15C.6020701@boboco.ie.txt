It is perhaps heresy on this mailing list, but GridGain makes this kind 
of thing really easy.  Obviously you could roll your own with Hadoop as 
well.

In this case you would simply have multiple indexes, each deployed to a 
different grid node, and a load balancing SPI that sent requests to the 
right grid node or nodes.

Eric
