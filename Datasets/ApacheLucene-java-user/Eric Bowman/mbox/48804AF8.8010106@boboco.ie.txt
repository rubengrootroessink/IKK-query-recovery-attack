One thing I have trouble understanding is how scoring works in this 
case.  Does Lucene really "just work", or are there special things we 
have to do to make sure that the scores are coherent so we can actually 
decide which was the best match?  What kind of constraints are there 
when breaking up the index into parts to make sure scoring remains coherent?

Thanks,
Eric
