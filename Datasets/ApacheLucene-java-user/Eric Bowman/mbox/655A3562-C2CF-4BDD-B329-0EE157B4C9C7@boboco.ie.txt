Hi,

We're looking for a senior, experienced Lucene engineer to work on a high performance location
search platform for a Dutch company in Amsterdam. This is not a contract role, sorry.

Please email me if this might be interesting to you.  (I'm not a recruiter; I'm involved in
the project...)

Thanks,
Eric Bowman
