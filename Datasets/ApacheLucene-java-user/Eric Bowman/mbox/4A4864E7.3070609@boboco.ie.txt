There is no single answer -- this is always application specific.

Without knowing anything about what you are doing:

1. disk i/o is probably the most critical.  Go SSD or even RAM disk if
you can, if performance is absolutely critical
2. Sometimes CPU can become an issue, but 8 cores is probably enough
unless you are doing especially cpu-bound searches.

Unless you are doing something with hard performance requirements, or
really quite unusual, buying "good" kit is probably good enough, and you
won't really know for sure until you measure.  Lucene is a general
enough tool that there isn't a terribly universal answer to this.  We
were a bit surprised to end up cpu-bound instead of disk i/o-bound, for
instance, but we ended up taking an unusual path.  YMMV.
