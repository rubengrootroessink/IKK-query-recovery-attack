Hi Steve,

Thanks for the quick reply and implementing support for URL
tokenization. Another newbie question about applying this patch.

I have the Lucene 3.0.2 source and I downloaded the patch and tried to apply
it:

lucene-3.0.2> patch -p0 < LUCENE-2167.patch

Comes back with the error message:

....(output truncated)
can't find file to patch at input line 13106
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
The text leading up to this was:


After looking at the line, it looks like it's trying to find
modules/analysis/common/build.xml -- which is not part of the official 3.0.2
src release. And thinking about it, may be I need to use the latest source
(or a nightly build). But, I couldn't figure how to get that. The hudson
link for nightly builds on the apache-lucene site seems to be broke. Or may
be I have a different problem.

I'd appreciate any help.

Thanks,
Sudha
