SUBJECT: IndexReader.open crashes JVM
DATE: 15 Dec 2005

Hello, I have a 6GB index consisting of about 4M documents, each with 2 
fields. The index built fine and then I optimized it. Whenever I try to open 
the index, though, the jvm crashes saying it has run out of heap space. Even 
when I increase the heap size it just runs longer and then crashes. With a 
heap of 512M, it ran for about 2 minutes and then crashed.

Anyone have clues as to what could cause this? Also, does it usually take 
this long to open an index?

Im using lucene1.4.3 on a XP machine with jdk1.5. Any help is appreciated.
