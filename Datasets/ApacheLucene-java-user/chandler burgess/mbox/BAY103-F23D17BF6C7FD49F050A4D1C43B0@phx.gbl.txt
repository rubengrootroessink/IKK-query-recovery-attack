There isn't much to the code. The first line of main() literally just calls 
IndexReader.open() and it never gets past that line. Nothing fancy. I have 
one app that built the index, and this one just searches it. Do you think it 
could the fact that I optimized it?

If you really insist on seeing the code I can post it, but its really 
straightforward. Thanks
