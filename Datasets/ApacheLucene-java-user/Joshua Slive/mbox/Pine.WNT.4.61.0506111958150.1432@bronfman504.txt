Ughhh... Looks like another caching problem.

A shift- or ctrl-refresh should get you the right thing.  You know if you 
have the right page if your userid appears in the upper-right.

It seems like technically moin needs to send Vary: cookie, but this would
completely destroy our ability to cache.

What we want is for anything with a Cookie: header to totally bypass the 
cache.  I don't know of any way to configure that.
