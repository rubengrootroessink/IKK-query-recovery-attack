I've added the Vary: Cookie header.  I believe that even with the 
current naive Vary handling, this should work ok in mod_cache, since it 
won't store any of the logged-in pages due to the Cache-Control headers.
So the non-cookie version should hang around in the cache.

Anyway, I hope this makes things much less confusing for people trying 
to edit the pages.

Joshua.
