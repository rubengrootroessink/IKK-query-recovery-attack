I'm interested in such a distributed architecture too.

What I have got in mind is some kind of lucene index cluster where you
have got several machines having subindexes in memory. So if you have
got a a searchquery the machines should perfom fast because the index
is in memory and no hard disk access is performed.

Is there anything like this available?
