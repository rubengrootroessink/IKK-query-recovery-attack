I'm aware of the fact that using multiple filters will result in
performance problems. One point is that QueryFilters can be reused to
benefit from its caching.

BooleanQueries seem to do no caching except when using
CachingWrappingFilter. But I don't think that will help me in my
project as I won't create similar Filters that often. I will see how
it performs with 3gb indexed docs ;-)

ChainedFilter is interesting, but I noticed that I can *add* more than
one Term to BooleanQueries and combine them with BooleanClause.Occur.
That would be sufficient for the moment...



Regarding ChainedFilter ... I can't find any API on the web!


Thanks a lot!
