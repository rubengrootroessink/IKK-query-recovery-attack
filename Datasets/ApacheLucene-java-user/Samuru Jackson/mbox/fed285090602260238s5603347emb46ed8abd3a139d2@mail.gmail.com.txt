SUBJECT: Filter Field.Keyword possible?
DATE: 26 Feb 2006

Hi to all!

I added some documents to my index repository this way:

Document document = new Document();
document.add(Field.Keyword("id", id));
document.add(Field.Keyword("type", type));
document.add(Field.Text("content", content));


Is it possible to search only within a specific Field.Keyword? For example I
want to search only the contents that have got a Keyword *type*="webpages".

Is there a way to create such a filter?

Samuru
