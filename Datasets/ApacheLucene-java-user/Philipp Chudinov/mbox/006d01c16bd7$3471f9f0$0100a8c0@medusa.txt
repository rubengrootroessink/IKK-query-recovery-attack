Additional question: in QueryParser.jj beginning at strings #258-259 there
is a unicode symbol range ("\u0080"-"\uFFFE"). I understand that Lucene can
search an index with unicode symbols in this range, right? So, question.
Russian (Cyrillic) symbols in unicode table are in this range: u\0401 -
u\04F9 (I took this from Character Map app at system tools on W2K). Does
cyrillic range feets original QP.jj range?
