Hi!
Should I use document.setBoot() only when searching, or I can set it while
indexing? The idea is that some documents can have higher priority then
others, so it would be great if I could set boost according to document
priority when adding document to the index, so it always have more relevance
then the same with lower priority?

Phil.
