I just think that if You can make ONE part of the system
hardware-failure-safe you really do not need all this - its sounds like a
very expensive setup and you might be able to configure a one server system
to be as-hardware-failure-safe if you used all the mony on this one
computer. Raid 5, dual power and so on... (all very expensive :-) )

Im no expert on HA-systems, but http://linux-ha.org/ is a very good staring
point for looking at FS and stuff.

JMS. If you set up a publish/subscribe system you could publish the
insert/delete/update command and be SURE that if you can deliver the
published message ALL the subscribers will eventual get the message and act
upon it - even messages that are "delivered" during one webservers
downperiod. And this scales if you add more than two servers. If you
implement this using http requests, YOU need to handle storing messages
during downperiods - recovery, and if you move to a 3-server setup insted of
a 2-server setup...
