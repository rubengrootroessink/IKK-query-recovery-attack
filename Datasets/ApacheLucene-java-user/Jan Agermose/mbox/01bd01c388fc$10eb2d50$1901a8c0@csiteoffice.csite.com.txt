I can only offer you a copy of mine until the binaries are online again...
But a someone should look into getting the binaries online again or making
it a bit more clear where they are if indeed they are online? I also can not
locate them (1.3rc that is)

Let me know if you want a copy of mine (if no one can make an official
binary available)
