I have just downloaded DBDirectory, changed what was needed to make it run
with Firebird and tried using it. I'm sorry to say, writing the index is so
slow as to make it useless. I have not done anything to find the problem -
and I don't think I will find the time for it... :-( Could be the BLOB
handling in the driver? Every 10 addDocument it stalls and
writer.optimize(); is really bad...

And as for changes needed to run this on interbase (I can post the source if
needed) - a column cannot be named "length", int(XX) needs to be changed,
the code for getting the lock reads "insert into XXX set name = ?,
directory_name=?" but needs to be "insert into XXX (name, dir_name) values
(?,?)" of cause.
