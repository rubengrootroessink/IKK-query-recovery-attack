DATE: 31 Oct 2007

Hi there!

Currently I am looking for an expert developer/consultant who can assist
my development team with an implementation of Lucene for an exciting and
innovative project in Amsterdam, Holland.

This is for a scalable, robust and high-performing web-based system
running in an Java EE environment based on the Spring framework.

Ideally, if qualified you should be able to start immediately. If you
are interested, please send me your details.

Kind regards,
Kiffin
