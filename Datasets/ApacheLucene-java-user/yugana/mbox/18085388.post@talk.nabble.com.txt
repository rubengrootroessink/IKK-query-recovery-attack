SUBJECT: Indexing the spider content
DATE: 24 Jun 2008


Hi All,

I am new to Lucene Search. Can you let me know if it is possible to index
the "Verity Spider" content. If possible please let me know how to create a
index form it and search on it. Also share some code snippets on how to
proceed on indexing and searching. I donot have much time to go throught the
Lucene API. Your help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Yug
