SUBJECT: How to search on the indexed content
DATE: 24 Jun 2008


Hi All,

I have created an index file and indexing the content retrieved from a
database. How can I search on this content? When indexed 3 files namely
_0.cfs, segments.gen and segments_k are created. Need help on this.

Thanks,
Yugana
