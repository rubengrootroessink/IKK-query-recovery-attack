Hi all,
I didn't know whether to add this to the thread asking about TREC indexing or start a new
one.
Anyway, has anyone attempted to index/search the Reuters collection which consists of SGML?
Mine seems to run through the process okay but alas I'm left with nothing in the index when
I check with Luke or my own Search Engine.
Anyone got any hints (apart from don't do it)?
cheers,
MC
