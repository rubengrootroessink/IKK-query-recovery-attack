Hi experts,
I'm currently indexing the New INEX collection using lucene and pondering this question.
When searching how do I retrieve the score based on a section or paragraph etc, and not the
document score, when the documents are indexed in multi-fields (XML).
Can anyone point me in the correct direction?
Thanks,
Malcolm
