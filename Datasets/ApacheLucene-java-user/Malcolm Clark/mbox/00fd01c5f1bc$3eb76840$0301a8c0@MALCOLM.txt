Hi,
I am not that experienced with Java and am attempting to implement the commit method for the
IndexReader for the application I'm developing.
I am trying to extend the IndexReader class but it wont let me! Should I extend something
else as I can't see anything in the api to suggest using?

My class is this:

public abstract class commitDelete extends IndexReader {
 
 protected final void commitIndex() {
 try{
    super.commit();
 }(IOException e){}
   }
 }

Incidentally if I close the index does this commit anyway?
Please help as I'm stumped.
thanks in advance,
Malcolm Clark
