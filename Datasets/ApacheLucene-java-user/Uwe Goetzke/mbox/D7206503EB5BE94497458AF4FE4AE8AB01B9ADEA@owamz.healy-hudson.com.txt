SUBJECT: AW: Relevancy Practices
DATE: 3 May 2010

Regarding Part3: 
Data quality
For our search domain (catalog products) we face very often the problem that the search data
is full of acronyms and abbreviations like:
cable,nym-j,pvc,3x2.5mm²
or
dvd-/cd-/usb-carradio,4x50W,divx,bl

We solved this by a combination of normalization for better data quality (or less variations)
and some tolerant sloppy phrase search where the search token needs only to partly match an
indexed token.
We use here a dictionary lookup approach into the indexed tokens of some fields and expand
the users query with a well weighted set of search terms.

It took us some iterations to get this right and fast enough to search in several million
products.
The next step on our list are facets.

Hi Grant,

You're welcome to use any of my slides (Dave's got them), with attribution
of course.

BUT....

Have you considered a section something like "why the hell do you think
Relevancy tweaking is gonna save you!?!?"

Basically that, as a corpus grows exponentially, so do results list sizes,
so ALL relevancy tweaks will eventually fail.  And FACETS (or other
navigators) are the answer.  I've got slides on that as well.

Of course relevancy matters.... but it's only ONE of perhaps a three pronged
approach:
1: Organic Relevancy and top query suggetions
2: Results list Navigators, the best the system can support, and
3: Data quality (spidering, METADATA quality, source weighting, etc)
