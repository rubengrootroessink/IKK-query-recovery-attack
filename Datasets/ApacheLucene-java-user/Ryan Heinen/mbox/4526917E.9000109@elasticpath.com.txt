SUBJECT: Force a query to match at least two clauses
DATE: 6 Oct 2006

Hello,

If I want make sure that only documents that contain at least two of the 
N TermQueries A, B, C, and D (N=4) are considered matches, what is the 
best way to approach this? I know I can expand it out into several 
boolean clauses like so:

(+A +B) (+A +C) (+A +D) (+B +C) (+B +D) (+C +D)

But unfortunately that doesn't really scale well as N increases. Also a 
solution where the minimum number of clauses to match is variable would 
be ideal.

Does anyone know of a way to accomplish this?

Thanks,

Ryan
