I don't Know if anyone could help me with this issue:
   
  for the requirements of the application i'm doing i need to store the terms (i.e the words)
inverted, i mean, for example i need the word "horse" to be stored as "esroh" because in my
application i need to find all the words in the index  that end in an specific suffix. 
   
  Can anyone send me an idea for doing it?
  I thought in inverting the files before indexing it but it would increase the time complexity
of the program.
