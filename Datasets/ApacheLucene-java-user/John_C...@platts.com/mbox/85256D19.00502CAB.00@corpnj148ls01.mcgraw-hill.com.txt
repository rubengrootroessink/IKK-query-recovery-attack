SUBJECT: Re: Searching Date Fields
DATE: 1 May 2003




Instead of using a DateFilter for queries, I have had very good luck in simply
using the internal representation of the dates in a range search.  For example:

     issue_date:[0debn3bk0 TO 0df]

Can anyone explain the advantages/disadvantages of doing date queries
in such a way over using a DateFilter?

thanks,
-John

Use dateToString(Date date) one way and stringToTime(String s) the other.
You can check the validity of your Date object by printing it out using
its toString() method. It's normal to see something like 0debn3bk0, its
the internal representation of the date.

For searches, use the DateFilter.
