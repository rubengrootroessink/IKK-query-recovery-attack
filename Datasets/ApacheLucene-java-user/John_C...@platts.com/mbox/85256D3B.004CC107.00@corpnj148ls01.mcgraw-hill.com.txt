SUBJECT: commercial websites powered by Lucene?
DATE: 4 Jun 2003



Hello All,

I've been trying to find examples of large commercial websites that
use Lucene to power their search.  Having such examples would
make Lucene an easy sell to management

Does anyone know of any good examples?  The bigger the better, and
the more the better.

TIA,
-John
