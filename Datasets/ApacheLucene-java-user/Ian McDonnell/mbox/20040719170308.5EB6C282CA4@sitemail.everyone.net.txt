SUBJECT: Using Lucenes Indexer to Index to a MYSQL DB
DATE: 19 Jul 2004

Currently, i just have a jsp form that submits details to a db. I'm designing a web server
application and was wondering if there was a way in which i could integrate lucenes indexer
into the jsp form.

I can post the source if that helps.

Ian
