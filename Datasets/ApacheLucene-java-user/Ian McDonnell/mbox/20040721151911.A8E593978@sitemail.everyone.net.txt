SUBJECT: Re: Extracting Lucene onto Tomcat
DATE: 21 Jul 2004

No sorry i didnt mean that i was trying to extract the jars at all. 

I meant the extraction of the original lucene source bundle. I have been developing in java
for going on 5 years now, but am relatively new to Web Apps. I have some experience in TomCat
from days as an undergrad and do understand that perhaps the questions i'm asking wernt exactly
tech questions relating to Lucene, but rather Tomcat related enquiries. I think the reason
i was struggling was that i havn't been able to locate the lucene war files as they dont seem
to have come as part of the latest source drops.

Thx for the advice and hopefully you can help me out when i'm further into the development
process.

There is no need to extract Lucene's JAR file.

Your questions indicate that you have some Tomcat and Java web 
application learning to do and this forum is not the most appropriate 
place to ask.  Lucene includes a web application demo that you could 
try deploying by following the steps here:  
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/demo3.html

Just drop luceneweb.jar into CATALINA_HOME/webapps, restart Tomcat and 
try hitting http://localhost:8080/luceneweb and pressing the search 
button - you will get an error unless you've followed all the steps, 
but you should not get a class cast exception and Lucene will be 
working properly (now follow the steps to build an index and configure 
the pointer to it).
