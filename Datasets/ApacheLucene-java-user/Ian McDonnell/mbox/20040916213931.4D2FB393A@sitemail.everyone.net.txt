Was there any more articles liek this written. I found them extremely useful for getting an
in depth understanding of how Lucenes indexing system worked. Is there a corresponding set
for Lucenes search functionality. 

The recommendations from other Lucene users were useful, but didn't go to the same detail
as these 2 articles(which is what i'm looking for!)

Does anybody know of any other docs that go into detail on the functionality of Lucenes search?

Thx for the advice peeps.
