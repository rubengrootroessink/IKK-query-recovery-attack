SUBJECT: Problem with IndexFiles.java
DATE: 5 Jul 2004

When i try to run this program in JBuilder, it gives me the error message

"Usage: java class org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles <root_directory>"

Obviously this means that args==0. I'm unsure on how to change this to ensure that it creates
a directory called Index.

again any help would be great, cos i'm a total novice with lucene and am struggling slightly
with getting the hang of it.

Thx
