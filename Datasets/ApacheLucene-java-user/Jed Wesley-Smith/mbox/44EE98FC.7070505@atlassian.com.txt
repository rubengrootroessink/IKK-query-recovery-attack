SUBJECT: Upgrade from 1.4.3 to 1.9.1. Any problems with using existing index files?
DATE: 25 Aug 2006

Hello all,

We are upgrading from Lucene 1.4.3 to 1.9.1, and have many customers 
with large existing index files. In our testing we have reused large 
indexes created in 1.4.3 in 1.9.1 without incident. We have looked 
through the changelog and the code and can't see any reason there should 
be any problems doing so.

So, we're just wondering, has anyone had any problems, or is there 
anything we need to look out for?

-- 
cheers,
- jed.
