SUBJECT: Possible exceptions using IndexReader & IndexWriter
DATE: 18 Sep 2006

all,

We're just wondering if anyone has seen any exceptions when using the 
IndexWriter.addDocument(...) or IndexReader.deleteDocuments(Term term) 
methods apart from catastrophic IOExceptions (disk full/failed etc.).

Is it possible for instance that we may be able to create a document 
that causes an exception when written? It doesn't seem to be possible, 
and we've never seen it happen, but we just to check with everyone  to 
see if anyone knows of such things.

cheers,
- jed.
