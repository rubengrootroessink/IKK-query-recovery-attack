SUBJECT: ways to minimize index size?
DATE: 14 Mar 2007

Hi,

I want to make my index as small as possible. I noticed about
field.setOmitNorms(true), I read in the list the diff is 1 byte per
field per doc, not huge but hey...is the only effect the score being
different? I hardly mind about the score so that would be ok.

And can I add to an index without norms when it has previous doc with norms?

Any other way to minimize size of index? Most of my fields but one are
Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.TOKENIZED and Field.TermVector.NO, one is
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED and Field.TermVector.NO. I
tried compressing that one and size is reduced around 1% (it's a small
field), but I guess compression means worse performance so I am not
sure about applying that.

thanks
