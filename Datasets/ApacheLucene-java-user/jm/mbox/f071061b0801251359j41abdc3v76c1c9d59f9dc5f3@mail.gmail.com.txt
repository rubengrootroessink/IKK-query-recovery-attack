SUBJECT: Re: OutOfMemoryError on small search in large, simple index
DATE: 25 Jan 2008

I am very interested indeed, do I understand correctly that the tweak
you made reduces the memory when searching if you have many docs in
the index?? I am omitting norms too.

If that is the case, can someone point me to what is hte required
change that should be done? I understand from Yoniks comment that this
could not make it to the core no?

thanks
javier
