SUBJECT: trying to resolve error: after flush: fdx size mismatch
DATE: 14 Apr 2010

Hi,

I am trying to chase an issue in our code and it is being quite
difficult. We have seen two instances (see below) where we get the
same error. I have been trying to reproduce but it has been impossible
so far.I have several threads, some might be creating indices and
adding documents, others closing indices etc.  In the list this
message appear several times, in some cases it was a lucene bug (not
my case, I dont have millions of docs here) and in other it seems bad
multithreading. I have verified my multithreaded code for the 5th time
and all seems well synchronized.

So I am asking if somebody can give me any hint, maybe the fact that
the first number is always a 1 means something??  I suspect the issue
is when a new index is just created maybe.

My env is vista, jdk1.6, lucene 2.9.1
thanks in advance.
