SUBJECT: Re: NPE in RAMDirectory after upgrade to 2.1
DATE: 26 Feb 2007

Mike,

You were right. As I have many indexes I keep a cache of the
IndexWriters, and in some specific case (that cannot happen in my dev
env) I was closing them without removing them from the cache. Somehow
it was working before 2.1, and upgrading made the error clear.

thanks
javi
