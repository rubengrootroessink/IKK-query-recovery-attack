SUBJECT: SnapshotDeletionPolicy usage
DATE: 5 Feb 2008

Hi guys,

I want to make use of the possibylity of hot backups in 2.3. If i
understand correctly, the only thing i need to do is to open the
writers with SnapshotDeletionPolicy, is that correct?

SnapshotDeletionPolicy dp = new SnapshotDeletionPolicy(new
KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy());
final IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, true, new
StandardAnalyzer(), dp);

And what would be the trade off of using this policy versus the
default (performance wise)? I have frenquently updating indexes (up to
tens every second) that i close periodically, and much less freqent
readers.

thanks
javi
