SUBJECT: 2.1 lock file name
DATE: 20 Feb 2007

Hi,

I updated my code to use 2.1 (IndexWriter deleting docs etc), and when
using native locks I still get a lock like this:
lucene-2361bf484af61abc81e6e7f412ad43af-n-write.lock
and when using SimpleFSLockFactory:
lucene-2361bf484af61abc81e6e7f412ad43af-write.lock

>From the changes.txt:
9. LUCENE-771: The default location of the write lock is now the
    index directory, and is named simply "write.lock" (without a big
    digest prefix).

Not a big deal, just wondering if changes.txt is wrong or it refers to
some other lock file.

thanks for the 2.1 release to all,
javi
