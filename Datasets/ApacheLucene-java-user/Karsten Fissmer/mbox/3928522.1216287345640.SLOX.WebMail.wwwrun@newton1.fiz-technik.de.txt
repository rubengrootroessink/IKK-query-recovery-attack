hi Mohsen,

IndexReader is thread-save so you don't need a cache.

Opening and closing an IndexReader takes some time. But I don't now if this is measurable.
So if you know that you don't want to change a index, let the IndexReader open.
(somebody disagree with me?)

If you want to use your main memory you can switch from FSDirectory to RamDirectory.
This will boost your performance for sure.

Best regards
  Karsten
