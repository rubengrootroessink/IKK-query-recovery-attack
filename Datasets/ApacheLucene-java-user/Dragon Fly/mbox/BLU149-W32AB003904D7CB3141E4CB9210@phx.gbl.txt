SUBJECT: Read all the data from an index
DATE: 30 Oct 2008

Hi,

I have an old index that was built a few months ago.  The data that I used to build the index
has been deleted from the database.  I'd like to read all the data from the old index to build
a new index.  Which Lucene API calls should I use to read all the data from the old index?
Thank you in advance for your help.
