SUBJECT: Boolean query ...
DATE: 19 Mar 2009


Let's say I have 3 fields in a document (Type, FirstName, and LastName).  For example:

    Document 0
    ----------
    Type: Public
    FirstName: John
    LastName: Deere

If I execute the following boolean query, document 0 is returned.

    Type:Public OR FirstName:Candy OR LastName:Deere

How do I find out (programatically) that the Type and the LastName fields (but not the FirstName
field) are the reason that document 0 is returned.  Thank you.
