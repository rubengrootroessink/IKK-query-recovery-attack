SUBJECT: Closing index searchers ...
DATE: 29 Nov 2007


Hi,

My application needs to close/open the index searcher periodically so that newly added documents
are visible.  Is there a way to determine if there are any pending searches running against
an index searcher or do I have to do my own reference counting? Thank you.
