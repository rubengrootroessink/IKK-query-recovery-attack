I was able to get a list of all the values for the Id field and another list of all the values
for the Phone field using TermEnum (i.e. two independent lists).  However, what I really wanted
was:
 
- Get the first Id
- Get the Phone associated with the first Id.
- Get the second Id
- Get the Phone associated with the second Id.
...
...
 
I want to do something like:
 
    List<Info> infoList = new ArrayList<Info> ();
    foreach (Document doc in LuceneIndex)
    {
       String id = doc.get ("Id");
       String phone = doc.get ("Phone");
       infoList.add (new Info (id, phone));
    }
 
Thank you.
