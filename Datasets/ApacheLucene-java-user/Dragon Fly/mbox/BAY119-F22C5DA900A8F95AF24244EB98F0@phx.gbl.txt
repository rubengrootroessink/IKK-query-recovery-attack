Hi,

I have an index that contains 3 fields: Book Id, Book Title, and Related 
Book Ids.
For example:

=====

Book Id		Book Title	Related Book Ids

A0001		Title 1		A0003, A0004
A0002		Title 2
A0003		Title 3		A0001, A0002
A0004		Title 4
....
....

=====

Note that the related book id field can be empty.  My application allows
the users to search for a book title and optionally return the related
books.  For example:

(Book Title = "Title 3") and (Return Related Books = false)
This should return the Lucene document for A0003 only and can be implemented 
easily.

(Book Title = "Title 3") and (Return Related Books = true)
This should return the Lucene documents for A0003, A0001, and A0002.  What 
is
a good way to implement this? Thank you.
