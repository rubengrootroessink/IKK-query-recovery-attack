Hi,

What is the most efficient way to do pagination in Lucene? I have always done the following
because this "flavor" of the search call allows me to specify the top N hits (e.g. 1000) and
a Sort object:

    TopFieldDocs topFieldDocs = searcher.search(query, null, 1000, SORT_BY_DATE);

Is it the best way? Thank you.
