SUBJECT: Loading an index into memory
DATE: 23 Jul 2009


Hi,

I have a question regarding RAMDirectory.  I have a 5 GB index on disk and it is opened like
the following:

  searcher = new IndexSearcher (new RAMDirectory (indexDirectory));

Approximately how much memory is needed to load the index? 5GB of memory or 10GB because of
Unicode? Does the entire index get loaded into memory or only parts of it? Thank you.
