Hi,

The search results of my Lucene application are always sorted 
alphabetically.
Therefore, score and relevance are not needed.  With that said, is there
anything that I can "disable" to:

(a) Improve the search performance
(b) Reduce the size of the index
(c) Shorten the indexing time

Thank you.
