My index gets rebuilt every night so I probably can afford
to construct the filters right after the index is rebuilt.  How
do I check each document (for empty fields) though? Would
I use an IndexReader to loop through the documents? If so,
which method(s) in the IndexReader class should I use?
termDocs()??? Thank you.
