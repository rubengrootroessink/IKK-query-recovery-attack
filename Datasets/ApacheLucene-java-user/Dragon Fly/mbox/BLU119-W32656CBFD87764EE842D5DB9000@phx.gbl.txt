SUBJECT: Field values ...
DATE: 20 Mar 2008

What's the easiest way to extract the values of 2 fields from each document in the index. 
For example, each document has 5 fields:
    Id     Name     Address     Phone     Preference
I'd like to extract the values for the Id and Phone fields for each document in the index.
 Thank you.
