My understanding is that an optimized index gives the best search performance.  I can change
my configuration to optimize the index every 24 hours.  However, I still would like to know
if there is a way to speed up optimization by tweaking parameters like the merge factor.

the "active" index and new documents get added to the "inactive" copy.  The two indexes get
swapped every 4 hours (so that new documents are visible to the end user).  Optimization is
done before the inactive copy is made active.

 I'm happy with the search/indexing performance.   However, my index gets fully optimized
every 4 hours and the time it takes to fully optimize the index is longer than I like.  Is
there anything that I can do to speed up the optimization? I don't fully understand the different
parameters (e.g. merge factor).  If I decrease the merge factor, would it make the indexing
slower (which I'm OK with) but the optimization faster? Thank you.
