SUBJECT: Numeric range search: wrong results [SEC=PERSONAL]
DATE: 27 Jul 2011

Hello,

I have created a self-contained test to show that Lucene returns wrong results when a simple
index with some date numeric fields is searched.
Could someone try to replicate this problem and confirm if it is a bug.
I attach readme.txt with the description of the problem and all necessary files.

Regards

Slav Boleslawski
