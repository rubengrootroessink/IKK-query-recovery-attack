SUBJECT: How to do Multiple-Cluster Query?
DATE: 1 Apr 2011

Hi, dear experts:

Assume that a tuple is composed of <<A1, B1, C1>,<A2,B2,C2>,...,<AN,BN,CN>,
Value>.
IF AK is stored in Field A, BK is stored in Field B, CK is stored in Field C (1<=K<=N),
so there are N A fields,N B fields and N C fields. 
The question is if I want to query whith the condition of <a,b,c>, how can i get the
exact value correspoding to <a,b,c>.

longing for your helps

 
Thanks in advance.
