Thanks, Otis.

The reason is that some of our customers definitely use NFS and it is
hard to convince all of the hundreds of customers not to use NFS. So
naturally, the correct thing for us to do is to just support it since we
already have file locking mechanism that works on NFS.

Hi Chunhe,

There are no NFS-specific plans.  Out of personal curiosity - why go for
NFS and not NAS?

Subject: lucene NFS support

Hi,

 

Does anyone know whether Lucene plans to support NFS in later
release(2.0)? We are planning to integrate Lucene into our products and
cluster support is definitely needed. We want to check whether NFS
support is in the plan or not before implementing a new file locking
ourselves with it.

 

Thanks.

Chunhe
