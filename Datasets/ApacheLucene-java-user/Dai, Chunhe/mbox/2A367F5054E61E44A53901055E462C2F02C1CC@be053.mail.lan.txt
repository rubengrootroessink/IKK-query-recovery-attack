SUBJECT: lucene NFS support
DATE: 23 Mar 2006

Hi,

 

Does anyone know whether Lucene plans to support NFS in later
release(2.0)? We are planning to integrate Lucene into our products and
cluster support is definitely needed. We want to check whether NFS
support is in the plan or not before implementing a new file locking
ourselves with it.

 

Thanks.

Chunhe
