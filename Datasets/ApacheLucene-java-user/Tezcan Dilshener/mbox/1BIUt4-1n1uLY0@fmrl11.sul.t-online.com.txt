SUBJECT: Fuzzy search problem
DATE: 27 Apr 2004

Hi all,
 
I have indexed a list of entries using the StandardAnalyzer and now when I
want to perform a fuzzy search over this list,
I am getting no hits when I enter multiple words as the search criteria.
 
However, it works really good and fast, when I search for single words.
 
Can you please give me some advice on how to resolve this hurdle?
Here is an example of what I am doing
 
Index has the following entries
ARAP TURK BANKASI A.S.
ARAB TURKISH BANK

And the search criteria is ARAB TURK BANK 

Hits found is 0 


However if I search for a single word (ARAB or ARAP) than it finds entries.

 
 

Best regards, mit freundlichen Gruessen
