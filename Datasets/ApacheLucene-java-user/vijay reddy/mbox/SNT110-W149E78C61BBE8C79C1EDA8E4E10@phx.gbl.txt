                Hi ,




I am planning to use Apache lucense in one of my projects, I want to 
index files based on the file properties (I wonâ€™t be indexing the data) 
and I want lucense to query the index so that I can quickly find list of
 files to based on the properties .




E.g: give me all the files with access time greater than 10/10/2005 
and access time less than 10/04/2010 and file created by james.




Can i use Lucene  for these kind of projects ?




does Lucense supprot queries like above ?
