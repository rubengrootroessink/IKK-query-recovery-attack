I have seen some interesting work done on storing DNA sequence as a set of common patterns
with unique sequence between them. If one uses an analyzer to break sequence into its set
of patterns and unique sequence then Lucene could be used to search for exact pattern matches.
I know of only one sequence search tool that was based on this approach. I don't know if it
ever left the lab and made it into the mainstream. If I have time I will explore this a bit.
