SUBJECT: RE: String similarity search vs. typcial IR application...
DATE: 6 Jun 2003

The method I mention was based on using lempel-ziv (I expect my spelling is way off on this)
algorithms used in lz compression. It relied only on exact matches of short stretches of DNA
separated by non-matching sequence. The idea was to find stretches of sequence that had patterns
in common, then generate the original sequences back and display alignments. I never paid
any attention to its match scores since they seemed pretty arbitrary. The focus on this work
was in looking for common repeats in human sequence to assist in masking them prior to doing
analysis. I have lost touch with the original author of this but I am digging to see if I
can extract the papers from my "filing system". I will post them shortly (I hope!).
