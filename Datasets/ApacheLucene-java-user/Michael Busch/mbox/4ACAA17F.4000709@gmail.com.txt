There was a big difference before too: reopen() in 2.4.x only loads 
internal data structures from new segments, like the terms dictionary 
and norms. The performance improvements were significant already (see 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-743?focusedCommentId=12532585&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12532585).

Now in 2.9 this also works for field caches.
