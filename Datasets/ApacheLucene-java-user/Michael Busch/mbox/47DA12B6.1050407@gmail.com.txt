SUBJECT: Re: Build Lucene maven artifacts
DATE: 14 Mar 2008

Hi Patrick,

I noticed that we do not package the *.pom.template files in the source 
release files. That's why it is not possible to build the maven 
artifacts using official releases.

I'll open a JIRA issue and make sure that we will ship 2.3.2 with the 
template files. In the meantime, you can download the *.pom.template 
files from trunk in the svn repository. No changes were made to these 
files since 2.3.1 was released.

Sorry about the inconvenience!

-Michael
