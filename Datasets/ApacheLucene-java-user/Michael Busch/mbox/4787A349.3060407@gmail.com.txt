SUBJECT: Lucene 2.3 RC2 available for testing
DATE: 11 Jan 2008

Hi Lucene Users,

good news: we are planning to release Lucene 2.3 in about ten days from
now! Lucene 2.3 will have significant performance improvements and
various other new features. (see
http://people.apache.org/~buschmi/staging_area/lucene_2_3/CHANGES.txt
for a full list of new features and API changes)

I uploaded a release candidate yesterday to
http://people.apache.org/~buschmi/staging_area/lucene_2_3/rc2/ which we
are currently testing extensively.

We would like to ask everyone to help testing the release candidate. Our
goal is it to make the final Lucene 2.3 release as stable as possible!

On behalf of the Lucene Team,
-Michael
