Leandro,

check out the static method of IndexReader: unlock(Directory). Link: 
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#unlock(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory)

You can use that method to forcibly unlock a particular index directory. 
Furthermore you can use the method boolean isLocked(Directory) to check 
whether an index is actually locked.
