OK, then Yonik might be right about the multi-level skiplists code which
is new in 2.2. I'd love to see the performance numbers of the same index
built with 2.3, if possible? You could simply migrate it to 2.3 by using
IndexWriter.addIndexes().

In my performance tests (LUCENE-866) I measured an average performance
gain of 20% for AND queries. Of course, if you run 2.3 against an index
built with 2.1, then the more complex multi-level skiplist code gets
executed on the simpler 2.1 data structures. However, I don't think the
slowdown should be that big (13%). I'll look into the code tomorrow
(have to go to bed now, it's 3am), maybe I can find something out.
