SUBJECT: [ANNOUNCE] Lucene Java 2.3.0 release available
DATE: 25 Jan 2008

Release 2.3.0 of Lucene Java is now available!

Many new features, optimizations, and bug fixes have been added since
2.2, including:

  * significantly improved indexing performance
  * segment merging in background threads
  * refreshable IndexReaders
  * faster StandardAnalyzer and improved Token API
  * TermVectorMapper to customize how term vectors are loaded
  * live backups (without pausing indexing) with SnapshotDeletionPolicy
  * CheckIndex tool to test & recover a corrupt index
  * pluggable MergePolicy & MergeScheduler
  * "partial" optimize(int maxNumSegments) method
  * New contrib module for working with Wikipedia content

The detailed change log is at:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/tags/lucene_2_3_0/CHANGES.txt

Lucene 2.3 includes index format changes that are not readable by older
versions of Lucene.  Lucene 2.3 can both read and update older Lucene
indexes.  Adding to an index with an older format will cause it to be
converted to the newer format.

Binary and source distributions are available at
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/

Lucene artifacts are also available in the Maven2 repository at
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/lucene/
