SUBJECT: Lucene 2.2.0 release available
DATE: 19 Jun 2007

Release 2.2.0 of Lucene is now available!

Many new features, optimizations, and bug fixes have been added since 2.1,
including "point-in-time" searching, payloads, function queries and new 
APIs for pre-analyzed fields.

The detailed change log is at:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/tags/lucene_2_2_0/CHANGES.txt

Lucene 2.2 includes index format changes that are not readable
by older versions of Lucene.  Lucene 2.2 can both read and update
older Lucene indexes.  Adding to an index with an older format
will cause it to be converted to the newer format.

Binary and source distributions are available at
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/

Lucene artifacts are also available in the Maven2 repository at
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/lucene/
