SUBJECT: Re: Scoring for all the documents in the index relative to a query
DATE: 19 Nov 2007

Hi Sonia,

I agree with Erick here. Negative scores don't make sense and Lucene
never computes scores for documents that don't match a query.

E. g. if your query is: "term1 OR term2", then every document that
contains term1 or term2 or both will have a score greater than 0. But if
two docs don't contain either of the two terms, why should one of them
have a lower score than the other one? Both would have 0.

with their score. From what I understood by reading some documentation, Lucene internally
assigns scores to all the documents in the index according to their similarity to the query,
but when returning the hits, all the scores that are less than 0 are rounded to 0 and only
the documents with the score > 0 are returned as hits. But what I would like to get is
the list before this intermediate processing, so the list of all the documents with their
raw score. I am trying to compare Lucene with LSI and for the comparison I want to do, I need
the entire list of documents. Is there a way that I can get that with Lucene?
