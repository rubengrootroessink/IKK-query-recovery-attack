chances are you are not using the API correctly and following the concurrency rules (described

and deleting documents is best done in batches (e.g. run your deletions first, close IndexReader
that did deletions (could be the same one that is used for searching), open IndexWriter, add
documents, close writer, re-open IndexSearcher/Reader for searching so your changes are visible).

Hi,

check out this nice patch, it could be useful for your use case:

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-565
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/35317

It provides better performance when you have a big number of 
update/delete operations.

Michael
