SUBJECT: Lucene 2.3 RC3 available for testing
DATE: 14 Jan 2008

Hi all,

I just uploaded Lucene 2.3 RC3 to:
http://people.apache.org/~buschmi/staging_area/lucene_2_3/

RC3 fixes a problem in the indexer that could cause it to hang after a
disk full exception occurred. (see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1130 for details).

Please switch to RC3 and keep testing!
-Michael
