SUBJECT: Indexing in pieces?
DATE: 31 Aug 2007

I have been fine with my database (discussion forum) to lucene.  I am taking 
the simplest approach, eg; I have a discussion forum which are just text 
messages, I take those out of the databse and then index the content.

I am having troubling because I have hundreds of thousands of messages and it 
takes a while, eating my server cpu.  I was thinking I would just index say a 
portion of the database.  For example, index records 1-100 and then 101-200.  
Can I just index to that index directory without deleting the existing index 
segment files that are already there?  Or is it more complicated than that.
