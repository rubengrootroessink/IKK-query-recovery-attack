SUBJECT: Lucene or nutch for indexing web documents
DATE: 27 Nov 2007

I was considering not using nutch for indexing web documents.  I was thinking
either extracting the full HTML document or through the use of some kind of
web scraper html parser utility extracting only the text content from a web
page and then indexing that.

I know it is strange, but I feel I have more control on what gets indexed if I
use just Lucene.  Eg, I can add more fields and also I guarantee I will be
able to search what gets indexed.

Is this a bad approach or should I just use nutch?
