Yea, there isnt much documentation out there on how to do this.  But, ideally 
it is pretty simple.  Your goal is to index the content from your database 
into the Lucene.  That is pretty much it.  So, just look at the Document 
creation code.

Also, to other lucene developers; I actually had to index the 'ID' field.  I 
kept getting null if I didnt index it?

This is what I have done with MySQL, which should work for Oracle (jdbc).

On updating the index.  For me, it is just as easy for me to delete the 
entire index (eg, delete the entire directory) and re-index the database 
again.  It takes more processing as opposed to a 'real' update but is simpler 
development-wise.
