SUBJECT: problem with A cap circum followed by space(Â )
DATE: 8 Jun 2009


Hi, 

I have a problem when i enumerate wildcard in a index then i get two terms
'the'.
Actually what was the cause was one was 'the' and another was 'the ' i.e.
'the' followed by Â followed by space. 

What is this Â followed by space and why is this being treated as a single
character? How am i going to search for the documents that contains this
special character case.

Thanks in advance
