SUBJECT: How to get the frequency of indexed words ?
DATE: 14 Jan 2011

Greetings,

Is there an easy way to figure out the frequency of words in an index ? 
I'd like to get, say, the 1000 most often indexed words in order to 
create an auto-completion cache for my application.

Thanks in advance,


Matthieu Huin
