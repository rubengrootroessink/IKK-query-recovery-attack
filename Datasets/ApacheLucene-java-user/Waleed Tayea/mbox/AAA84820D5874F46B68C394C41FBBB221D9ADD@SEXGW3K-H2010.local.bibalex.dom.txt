I'm working on Arabic text, so the example might not be understandable.
What I mean is that with the morphologial analysis the tokens are
reduced to their lexems. And those lexems are the terms that are stored
in the index. So when I perform an extact search and get a result, I
will not be able to know wheather the original text exactly matches my
query or not.

Thanks.
Waleed,

Could you please provide an example of some sample text, the terms  
that are emitted by the analyzer, and a query you'd like to work?
