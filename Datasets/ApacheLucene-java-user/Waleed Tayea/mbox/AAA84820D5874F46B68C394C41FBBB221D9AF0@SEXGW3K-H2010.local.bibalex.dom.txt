Dear All.

I'm using the QueryParser to parse and return a query of a search string
of a single word. But the analyzer I uses emits another morphological
tokens from that single word. How can I prevent the QueryParser of
considering the search query as a PhraseQuery with the terms of that
single word search string and the other morphological tokens. I just
want to make it return a BooleanQuery with Boolean clauses of all
tokens, each one with its own as a TermQuery.

 

Thanks.
