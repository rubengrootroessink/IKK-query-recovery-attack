Hi Victor

Thanks.

In the past I have used the Inso OutsideIn filters and found them very good;
however I'd like to come up with a pure Java solution, so if there is a Java
equivalent to the Inso filters I be grateful for any details.  Failing that,
I thought that I'd go for individual parsers initially using the file
extensions to select the correct parser but in the future adding a file type
recogniser for files without extensions.  Hence my request for anyone
knowing of good parsers particularly for the most common formats.

That being said, has anyone come across a Powerpoint parser?

Pete
