DATE: 17 Sep 2003

Might want two demos, one for Unix environments and one for Windows.

Most users will want a fast start that they can copy and adapt.  So quick
targets would be:

filesystems - html / text / pdf / office documents for windows.
xml - fairly simple example maybe against news items.
database - again simple maybe a pseudo employee database.
website - accessable from the filesystem.
website - that requires crawling.

Show hit markup.
