DATE: 10 Sep 2004

Hi all

Reading the thread with interest, there is another way I've come across out
of memory errors when indexing large batches of documents.

If you have your heap space settings too high, then you get swapping (which
impacts performance) plus you never reach the trigger for garbage
collection, hence you don't garbage collect and hence you run out of memory.

Can you check whether or not your garbage collection is being triggered?

Anomalously therefore if this is the case, by reducing the heap space you
can improve performance get rid of the out of memory errors.

Cheers
Pete Lewis
