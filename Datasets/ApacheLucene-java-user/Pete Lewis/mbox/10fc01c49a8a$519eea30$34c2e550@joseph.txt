Hi George

There are lots of problems with Port stemmers, not great for English but get
worse for other languages.

If you look at:

http://snowball.tartarus.org/demo.php

You'll see the Snowball demo - this is basically another instance of Porter.

If you enter "print" and "printer" and submit then the results will be
"print" and "printer" - hence showing the the Porter stemmed versions are
the same as the originals.  Therefore they are both distinct terms in their
own right and searches on one will not hit the other.

Cheers

Pete Lewis
