Hi Sanyi

Could you try XP on your desktop - that would take some variables out.  The
problem is that you are comparing OS, as well as filesystems, as well as
different hardware configs.

Also, unless you take your hyperthreading off, with just one index you are
searching with just one half of the CPU - so your desktop is actually using
a 1.5GHz CPU for the search.  So, taking account of this its not too
surprising that they are searching at comparable speeds.....

HTH
Pete
