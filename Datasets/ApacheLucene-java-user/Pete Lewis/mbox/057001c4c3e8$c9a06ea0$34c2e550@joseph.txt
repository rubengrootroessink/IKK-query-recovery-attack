Hi Yousef

You are not doing anything wrong - its just how the Porter stemmer works!

The problem with Porter is that it tries to do everything in a purely algorithmic way - which
doesn't cater for irregular conjugations etc.

Don't worry too much though, as long as you do the same stemming on the query string as you
did while indexing - you should be able to find what you are looking for but can have some
issues with trailing wildcards.....

If you want a better stemmer, look for something that has a dictionary as well as algorithmic
rules - a quick one that is readily available is Kstem which while not perfect I think is
quite a bit better than Porter.

You can get the source code (Kstem.jar) from the floowing website:

For more info on Kstem see the paper by its designer Bob Krovetz at:

Cheers

Pete
