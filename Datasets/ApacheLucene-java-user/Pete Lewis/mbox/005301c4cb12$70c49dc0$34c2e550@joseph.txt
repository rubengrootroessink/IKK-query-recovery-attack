Hi Venkat

If you want to go against just html pages (maybe with Dublin core tags) then
Swich-E isn't too bad, but it wont be as portable as Lucene plus it doesn't
seem to be as nearly as active on the development side as Lucene (so you'll
get less support in the event of problems).  Swish seems easy to install &
index against just html pages.

If you want something a bit more capable, or if you are going against
structured text files / databases / etc then choose Lucene everytime.

Performance, you'll find that Java Lucene will compare well with C / Perl
Swish, and for your volumes there shouldn't be any problems with Lucene.

Cheers

Pete
