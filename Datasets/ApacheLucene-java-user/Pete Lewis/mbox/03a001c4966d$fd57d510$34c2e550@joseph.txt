Hi Aad

Use the stemmed result as what you index, but then also remember to stem the
query terms as well - you need to do the same on the way out as on the way
in.

We don't use MySpell but we do use our own stemmer in this way, as there are
many examples where Snowball falls down like:

caught -> caught instead of catch
buses -> buse instead of bus

and Snowball gets worse for none-English languages like Dutch....

Cheers
Pete
