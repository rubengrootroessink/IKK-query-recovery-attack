SUBJECT: Reading out term frequencies document-wise.
DATE: 17 Apr 2003

Hello all,

after creating a Lucene index, for some applications it's useful to access
term frequencies.

Is there any solution to read out term frequencies in an efficient way,
something like a IndexReader.docTerms(int docId)? This completely subverts
the reverse-index paradigm but is useful, for instance to create a
term-document matrix in sparse format (Harwell Boeing, say).

A more general question. Is there any current activity to create term-vector
support for Lucene? Maybe it's possible to do a joint activity.

Thanks,

gregor
