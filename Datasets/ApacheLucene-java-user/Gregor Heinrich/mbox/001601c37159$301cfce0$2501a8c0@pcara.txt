Hi all,

this is partly connected to Docco's new filters. Is there anyone interested
in a Powerpoint filter? This format seems to have been kept incredibly
obscure by out big friends in Redmond. I did only find a shareware tool
called CZ-PPT2TXT, but open source would i.m.h.o. be a bit more usable in
our community...

Cheers,

Gregor
