SUBJECT: Multiple fields identical terms.
DATE: 30 Jul 2003

Hi everyone,

my index has a title and an abstract field, both inverted and tokenized.

I would like to have unique term texts in my term enumeration. That is,
across all fields there should be no duplicate term text.

An easy solution would be to only use one field.

But does someone know an alternative way with multiple fields?

Best regards,

Gregor
