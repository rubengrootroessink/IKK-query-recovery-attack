Hi Terry,

the suggestion of Haystack's Lucene was a hint to give you an additional
alternative to reach your goal.

Depending on the definition of your notion "similar document", this solution
does or does not make sense. My definition of similar document (and term) is
maybe more general than yours: It supports rather generic similarity metrics
and needs to cover cosine similarity according to vector-space model (VSM;
can be achieved using unmodified Lucene code), semantic similarity according
to a generative model like latent semantic indexing or Bayesian approaches
etc. and even semantic similarity according to a taxonomy. If you want such
a flexibility (like I do for my research), you should consider this approach
because you can relatively easily work on the forward document vectors.

If all you need is vanilla VSM cosine similarity, you are probably best off
with the suggestion that was sent in this list, to submit the document
content in the query and throw it through the same Analyzer that was used to
create the index, thus finding best matches using Lucene's standard matching
scheme.

Good luck,

Gregor

Hi Peter,

I took a look at Mark's thesis and briefly at some of his code.  It appears
to me that what he's done with the so-called forward indexing is to (a)
include a unique id with each document (allowing retrieval by id rather than
by a standard query), and to (b) include a frequency map class with each
document (allowing easier retrieval of term frequency information).

Now I may be missing something very obvious, but it seems to me that both of
these functions can be done rather easily with the standard (unmodified)
version of Lucene.  Moreover, I don't understand how use of these functions
will facilitate retrieval of documents that are "similar" to a selected
document, as outlined in my original question on this topic.

Could you (or anyone else, of course) perhaps elaborate just a bit on how
using this approach will help achieve that end?

Regards,

Terry
