Hi,

when querying with a wildcard, e.g., "project*", QueryParser (v1.3rc2-dev)
does seem to count the * as "at least one character" (RE=/.+/), i.e., the
query finds documents containing "projection" and "projective" (no stemming
involved) but not "project". Has anyone an explanation?

Not sure if I have stepped across a bug or for some reason misconfigured
Lucene. (The implementation uses MultiFieldQueryParser.)

Thanks for comments,

Gregor
