Hi Mark,

short answers to your questions:

ad 1: MultiFieldQueryParser is what you might want: you can specify the
fields to run the query on. Alternatively, the practice of duplicating the
contents of all separate fields in question into one additional merged field
has been suggested, which enables you to use QueryParser itself.

ad 2: Depending on the Analyzer you use, the query is normalised, i.e.,
stemmed (remove suffices from words) and stopword-filtered (remove highly
frequent words). Have a look at StandardAnalyzer.tokenStream(...) to see how
the different filters work. In the analysis package the 1.3rc2 Lucene
distribution has a Porter stemming algorithm: PorterStemmer.

Have fun,

Gregor

Hi all...

I've been playing with Lucene for a couple days now and I have a couple
questions I'm hoping some one can help me with.  I've created a Lucene
index with data from a database that's in several different fields, and
I want to set up a web page where users can search the index.  Ideally,
all searches should be as google-like as possible.  In Lucene terms, I
guess this means the query should be fuzzy.  For example, if someone
searches for "cancer" then I'd like to get back all resuls with any form
of the word cancer in the term ("cancerous", "breast cancer", etc.).

So far, I seem to be having two problems:

1) How can I search all fields at the same time?  The QueryParser seems
to only search one specific field.

2) How can I automatically default all searches into fuzzy mode?  I
don't want my users to have to know that they must add a "~" at the end
of all their terms.

Thanks,
-Mark
