Hello Terry,

Lucene can do forward indexing, as Mark Rosen outlines in his Master's
thesis: http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/rosen03email.html.

We use a similar approach for (probabilistic) latent semantic analysis and
vector space searches. However, the solution is not really completely fixed
yet, therefore no code at this time...

Best regards,

Gregor

Hi Terry,

we have been thinking about the same problem and in the end we decided
that most likely the only good solution to this is to keep a
non-inverted index, i.e. a map from the documents to the terms. Then you
can query the most terms for the documents and query other documents
matching parts of this (where you get the usual question of what is
actually interesting: high frequency, low frequency or the mid range).

Indexing would probably be quite expensive since Lucene doesn't seem to
support changes in the index, and the index for the terms would change
all the time. We haven't implemented it yet, but it shouldn't be hard to
code. I just wouldn't expect good performance when indexing large
collections.

to refine a search by selecting one of the hits returned from the initial
query and subsequently retrieving other documents "like" the selected one.)
