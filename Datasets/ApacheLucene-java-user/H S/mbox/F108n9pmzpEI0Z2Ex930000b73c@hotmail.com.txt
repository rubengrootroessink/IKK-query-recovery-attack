SUBJECT: corrupted index
DATE: 2 Apr 2002

Dear All,

We are experiencing a problem with
index updates. We have a fairly
large index (>10 gigabytes). There
are no problems searching it. But
when we add a single file and then
try to optimize, optimization fails
with a null pointer exception in
RandomAccessFile.seek.

Has anybody come across this problem?
Is there a way to tell whether an index
is corrupted?

Thanks very much -

Hinrich Schuetze
