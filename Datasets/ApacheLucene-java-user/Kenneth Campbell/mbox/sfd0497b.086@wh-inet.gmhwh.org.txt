DATE: 5 Dec 2003

Can someone point me in the right direction with regards to "Hit Highlighting"

I have seen what Mark Harwood has done and I like it, however I am using lucene 1.2. Are there
a compatibility issues. 

If no any suggestions about implementation would be helpful.

If yes are there any suggestions for "Hit Highlighting" with lucene 1.2.


Thanks 

Ken C.
