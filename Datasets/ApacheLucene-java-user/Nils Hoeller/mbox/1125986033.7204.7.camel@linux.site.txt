SUBJECT: use of Luke s getHighFreqTerms
DATE: 6 Sep 2005

Hi,

i ve got only one little question:


I m using the class HighFreqTerms of the Luke Project to
find those terms in my index ( made by Nutch) 

Now I wanted to filter the Terms with a 
stopwordlist (junkwords).

The method getHighFreqTerms gives me the ability 
to define a Hashtable junkwords , which I suppose 
to be the filtering part. 

But how do I have to use it, since 
my first tries failed:

I ve tried something like:

Hashtable junk = new Hashtable();
String word = new String();
word = "the";
junk.put(new Integer(word.hashCode()),word);
TermInfo[] terms = getHighFreqTerms(dir, junk, new String[]{"content"});

But this did not work, which means did not filter the word "the".

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for your help.

Nils
