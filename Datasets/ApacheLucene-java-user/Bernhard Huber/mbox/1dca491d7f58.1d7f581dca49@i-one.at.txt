Hi 
As I was playing around with lucene, i saw that there is no
jsp samples using lucene.
Thus i added some jsp pages for creating an index, and searching.
I was testing using tomcat-3.2.3

As i think it might 
other users too, to start using lucene i attach a zip-file
containing the lucene jsp webapplication.

bye
