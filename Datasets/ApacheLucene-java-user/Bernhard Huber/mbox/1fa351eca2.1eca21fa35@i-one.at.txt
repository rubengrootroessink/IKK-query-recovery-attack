Hi,
I have enhanced the jsp-samples a bit more:
* select index directory
* select analyzer for creating, and searching
* added token analyzer page

i was originally developing, and testing with rc1.
i hope it helps other lucene users, so i have
attached a zip containing containing a jsp sample
webapp.
bye
