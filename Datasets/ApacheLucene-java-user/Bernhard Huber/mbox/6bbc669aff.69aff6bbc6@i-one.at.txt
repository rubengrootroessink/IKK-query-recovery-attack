 Well, that's because IndexHTML sets field url, and not field file.
  But SearchFile tries to output the field file.
  I think IndexHTML can only be used with the jhtml sample.
  You may from the command line only the IndexFile, and SearchFile
  together, or IndeHTML, and the jhtml/html sample.

  I was having the same problems, you may try the jsp sample in
  lucene-user for sample html indexing....
  bye
