SUBJECT: New Lucene-powered site, plus a Lucene job
DATE: 6 Apr 2005

Lucene folks,

Just a quick note to announce the launch of a new Lucene-powered site,
the GATT Digital Library at Stanford. The URL is
http://gatt.stanford.edu.

Over the past seven years, the Stanford Libraries have digitized a
large collection of documents produced by the GATT, the predecessor to
today's World Trade Organization. This site, which offers access to
over 30,000 documents, makes the products of this digitization effort
publicly available for the first time. Over the coming months and
years, we hope to release tens of thousands more documents through
this website, and through other digital library systems.

As you might have guessed, the functionality for searching and
browsing the GATT library is driven by Lucene. We owe a huge debt of
gratitude to Doug and the Lucene team. Without Lucene, it would have
been much more difficult to release these important historical
documents to the public.

I also wanted to announce an opening for a developer job at Stanford
that may be of interest to Lucene programmers. The work will focus on
creating tools to put Stanford's digital collections online, and on
developing an open source toolkit for indexing XML with Lucene. (We
already have a good beta, which was used to create the index for the
GATT site.) For more details on the job, please take a look at the
posting at Craigslist.

Comments and questions on the site and/or job are most welcome. Feel
free to contact me at this address or via my work e-mail, dln (at)
stanford.edu.

- David
