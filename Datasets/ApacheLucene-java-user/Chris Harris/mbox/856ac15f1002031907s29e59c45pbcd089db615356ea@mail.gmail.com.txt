SUBJECT: Where to download Mark Miller's Qsol Parser?
DATE: 4 Feb 2010

The QSol query parser (brief overview here:
http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2009/02/22/exploring-query-parsers/)
used to be available at

http://myhardshadow.com/qsol.php

(there was documentation as well as a link to a SVN server) but it
looks like the myhardshadow.com has been relinquished to a domain name
squatter. Is there any other place to get a fresh copy of Qsol?

Thanks,
Chris
