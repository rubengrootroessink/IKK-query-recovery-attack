SUBJECT: Index Path in WAR
DATE: 2 May 2003

List,

I'm having problems using an absolute path to the index directory when my web application
is deployed in a WAR file.  The absolute path changes depending on the server.  Is there a
way to either dynamically determine an absolute path to the index directory or to use relative
pathing?

Thanks in advance,

Jason
