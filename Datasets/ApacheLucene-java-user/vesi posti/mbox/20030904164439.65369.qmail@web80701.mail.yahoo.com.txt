SUBJECT: Mullti-term NOT queries
DATE: 4 Sep 2003

Hi,

According to the QueryParser page:

"The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term".

Is this also true for multi-term NOT queries? E.g.

NOT "jakarta apache" AND NOT "lucene"

My tests suggest so, but I'd like to hear from someone
who'd know for sure.

Also, is this a limitation of the QueryParser or of
the Query API itself?

Thanks!

Eugene.
