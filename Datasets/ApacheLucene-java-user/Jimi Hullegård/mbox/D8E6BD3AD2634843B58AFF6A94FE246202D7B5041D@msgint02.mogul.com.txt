Ok, thanks. I will just have to look on how to do this the best way (since the CMS is handling
most of the indexing stuff).

But apparently this setOmitNorms(true) also disables boosting aswell. That is ok for now,
but what if we want to use boosting in the future? Is there no way to disable the length normalization
while still keeping the boost calculation?
