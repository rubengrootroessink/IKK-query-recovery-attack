SUBJECT: Lucene on Palm OS?
DATE: 9 Apr 2005

Does anyone know if it possible/feasible to run lucene on PalmOS? 
I've never done any Palm development before, but have an application
in which Lucene is a critical component that I'd like to make work on
my Tungsten T3 as well as other palms if possible.

I'm trying to feel out whether this is a project worth attempting.

Thanks,

-Pete
