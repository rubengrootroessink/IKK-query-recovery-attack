SUBJECT: New Lucene-based application.
DATE: 7 Dec 2005

kbforge.com is pleased to announce the first public release of "kbforge", 
a new, completely  free, desktop search application specifically designed 
for software developers. 
What differentiates kbforge from other desktop search programs, is its 
ability to assist the user in categorising the information before it is 
indexed. Using databases and collections of databases, kbforge can 
categorise information into meaningful subject matters. A host of other 
features and options make kbforge the ultimate tool for finding that 
elusive program fragment, or example or article.
Unlike most other Lucene based applications, kbforge uses Lucene as the 
default database manager (as well as for indexing and searching).
kbforge is a Java application, and possibly the first of its kind to run 
under Linux as well as Windows.

kbforge v1.20 can be downloaded free from http://www.kbforge.com
