SUBJECT: filtering results per field?
DATE: 1 Nov 2010

Hello,

I would like to search several fields while applying different Filter's to
the results of different fields.

Is it possible to (efficiently) filter out results according to which fields
they are coming from? I've been navigating the code and Javadocs, and
haven't found any way to do it.

One alternative would be to search for each field (or groups of
fields) separately. Can anyone comment on the performance impact and
scalability of searching separately per field?

Kind regards,
