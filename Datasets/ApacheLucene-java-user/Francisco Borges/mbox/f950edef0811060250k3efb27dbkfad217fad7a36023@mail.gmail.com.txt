SUBJECT: possible score value
DATE: 6 Nov 2008

Hello,

I have been going through the scoring documentation and code.

I had the expectation that Lucene would enforce a score value between [0,1].
But from what I can grasp from the code and docs, score values can be
greater than one.

Does Lucene considers score values greater than 1 as valid?

Kind regards,
