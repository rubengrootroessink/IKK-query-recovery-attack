I have a folder hierarchy, where each subfolder contains documents

A/B
A/C
A/D

and where only the contents of D have been indexed.

Now I would like to index the whole content of A.

I wanted to avoid re-indexing the documents in D, so I thought about
doing a merge. At the same time, I wouldn't like to lose the index I
already had.

Thus I am trying to merge without deleting the original index.

Kind regards,
