SUBJECT: Re: Best way for paging with TopDocs class?
DATE: 17 Apr 2009

Hi Alex,

As I know HitColector is useful when you need to deal with some data of 
ALL the docs in the index, but when you need just top of them 
HitCollector is said to be a performance killer. Then is better to use 
Hits with the old API and TopDocs with current one.
