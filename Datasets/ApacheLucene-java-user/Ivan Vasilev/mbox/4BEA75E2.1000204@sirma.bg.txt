SUBJECT: How to avoid sharing docStore files?
DATE: 12 May 2010

Hi Guys,

Can anybody tell me how to avoid sharing of docStore files (term vectors 
& stored fields)? I mean to avoid creation of cfx files.

This is important for us because we support some operations like 
splitting index, updating index fields (via running optimization that 
has some differences compare to normal optimization).

With Lucene 2.4.X we used constructor of IndexWriter that used 
"autoCommit" parameter. We set it to "true" and this forced each flush 
to be done in a new .cfs file.
Is there now some way to do it?

Cheers,
Ivan
