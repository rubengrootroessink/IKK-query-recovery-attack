SUBJECT: detect Lucene version
DATE: 8 Oct 2010

  Hi Guys,

Is there way to detect org.apache.lucene.util.Version of an index having 
IndexReader or just FSDirectory?
I know I can open segments file and read the proper bytes according to 
rules of creating it but is there more smart way to do this without 
using RandomAccessFile or something like this.
Actually I need just to know if index is pre Lucene 3_0 or 3_0 (or later).

Thanks,
Ivan
