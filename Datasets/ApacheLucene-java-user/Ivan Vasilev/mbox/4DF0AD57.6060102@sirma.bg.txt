SUBJECT: Bug fix to contrib/.../IndexSplitter
DATE: 9 Jun 2011

Hi Guys,

I would like to fix a class in 
contrib/misc/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index called IndexSplitter. It 
has a bug - when splits the segments in separate index the segment 
descriptor file contains a wrong data - the number (the name) of next 
segment to generate is 0. Although it can not cause exception in some 
cases (depends on existing segment names and the number of newly 
generated ones) in most of cases it do cases Exception.

I do not know if I would have rights to submit this fix to Lucene 
contrib dir but I am attaching the fix and a test that shows the 
exception when using original class and there is no exception when using 
fixing class.

Cheers,
Ivan
