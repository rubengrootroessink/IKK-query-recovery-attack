SUBJECT: Re: feedback: Indexing speed improvement lucene 2.2->2.3.1
DATE: 21 Mar 2008

Hi Uwe,

Could you tell what Analyzer do you use when you marked so big indexing 
speedup?
If you use StandardAnalyzer (that uses StandardTokenizer) may be the 
reason is in it. You can see the pre last report in the thread "Indexing 
Speed: 2.3 vs 2.2 (real world numbers)". According to the reporter Jake 
Mannix this is because now StandardTokenizer uses StandardTokenizerImpl 
that now is generated by JFlex instead of JavaCC.
I am asking because I noticed a great speedup in adding documents to 
index in our system. We have time control on this in the debug mode. NOW 
THEY ARE ADDED 5 TIMES FASTER!!!
But in the same time the total process of indexing in our case has 
improvement of about 8%. As our system is very big and complex I am 
wondering if really the whole process of indexing is reduces so 
remarkably and our system causes this slowdown or may be Lucene does 
some optimizations on the index, merges or something else and this is 
the reason the total process of indexing to be not so reasonably faster.

Best Regards,
Ivan
