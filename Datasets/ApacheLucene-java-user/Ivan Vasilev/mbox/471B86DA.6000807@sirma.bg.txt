SUBJECT: How to change Collators per field when querying?
DATE: 21 Oct 2007

Hi Guys,

We have implemented per field setting of Analyzers, based on the 
language that is used for the responding field. Example: field FileName 
is in English, field Content in Chinese. This we do by creating our 
class that implements Analyzer and wraps two analyzers StandardAnalyzer 
and CJKAnalyzer and in the method tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader 
reader) does the real tokenization with proper analyzer based on the 
field name.

So my question is:

What is the best practice Lucene approach to change the Collator object 
in the same manner per field during the searching process, when sorting 
the results?

Best Regards,
Ivan
