SUBJECT: Chinese test resources wanted
DATE: 16 Oct 2007

Hi Guys,

We just implemented multi language support in our application. We tested 
it with some files which content is copy/pasted from some Chinese sites 
and everything seems to work correctly, but we need to test it more 
thoroughly.
Any suggestions from were to get some testing resources and some advises 
on using them are welcomed :)
Actually if anyone has suggestions about any CJK lang testing is welcomed :)

Thanks in advance,
Ivan
