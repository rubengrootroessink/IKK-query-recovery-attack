SUBJECT: When is expected Lucene 2.3 to be released?
DATE: 7 Dec 2007

Hi Lucene Guys,

Can you say approximately when will be released Lucene 2.3? We have some 
costumizations in the source code of hte Lucene and we will have to 
transfer them in the 2.3 release, so it is important for us to know when 
approximately this will happen in order to make our plans.

Thanks in advance,
Ivan
