OK Guys Thanks ,

Thanks for your help. I really think that paging without caching will be 
best for in case. I think in most cases users find results in the first 
page. When not, I think they would not not go through more than 2-3 more 
pages or just will narrow the search by adding more filter words.
As Erick says the performance will be with no practical difference. If 
not I can apply caching. But I think unnecessary caching results on most 
one-page queries will just make more usage of RAM and after that GC what 
is worse that avoiding cache at all.

Thanks Again,
Ivan
