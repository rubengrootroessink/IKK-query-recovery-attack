SUBJECT: Re: Question about Lucene 2.3. file formats?
DATE: 23 Jan 2008

Thanks Michael for your answer :)

Actually writer.addIndexesNoOptimize method can not help us because our 
aim is to split indexes rather than to merge them. But you information 
about setting autoCommit=true is very helpful for us because so we will 
avoid sharing of stored fields and will be able to use our tools for 
splitting index. The only thing  that we will have to do is to add (-1) 
in position of DocStoreOffset in segments_N file.

Thanks,
Ivan
