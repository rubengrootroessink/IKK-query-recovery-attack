SUBJECT: is Lucene 3.0 coming soon?
DATE: 16 Oct 2009

Hi Lucene Guys,

I am interested what is your plan date for releasing Lucene 3.0.
I am asking because seeing on the changes in Lucene 2.9 (especially 
changes in backward compatibility) I guess that it will be difficult for 
us to adopt our app to Lucene 2.9. I see in your Jira there are not many 
issues planned for 3.0, but there are still some new deprecations 
removing. There also could come some bug fixes to 2.9. So if you plan to 
release 3.0 in some (3-4) months we prefer to adopt our app directly to 3.0.

Another question about your plans about changes in file structure. 
According to your backwards-compatibility policy Lucene 3.0 could be not 
able to read indexes created from Lucene 1.X. Will it be really so with 3.0?

Best Regards,
Ivan
