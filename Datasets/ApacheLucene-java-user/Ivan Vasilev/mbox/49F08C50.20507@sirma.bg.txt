SUBJECT: SpanQuery wildcards?
DATE: 23 Apr 2009

Hy Guys,

Does anybody knows if there is way to use wild cards in SpanQuery?
My idea is for example instead of query - content:"expansive 
computer"~10 - we to use query - content:"exp* comp*"~10. And the 
results of first query to be subset of those of second one.
I tried with parsing the above with different Analyzers but with no 
positive result. I also tried with different variants of SpanNearQuery 
but again with no result.

Is it possible at all?

Best Regards,
Ivan
