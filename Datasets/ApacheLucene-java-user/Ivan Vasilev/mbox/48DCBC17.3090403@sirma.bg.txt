Sorry about the spam with this thread. We started using ParallelReader 
in our app and we have some bug in the app with the sorts.
I tested with simple standalone app ParallelReader and discovered that 
sort works in the same way perfectly as with the other Readers.
Sorry once again.

Best Regards,
Ivan
