Hi Guys,

Has anybody integrated the Spell Checker contributed to Lucene. I need 
advise from where to get free dictionary file (one that contains all 
words in English) that could be used to create instance of 
PlainTextDictionary class. I currently use for my tests responding files 
from Jazzy and JADT projects, but I think I do not have right to use 
them officially outside of their applications.
 
Best Regards,
Ivan
