hi otis,

i think that out of 2 k 80 % can be stemmed and many of the words are
duplicates so they would not need full space.
can you give me an idea what in your opinion would mean  "don't need
queries to be quick" ...
i have no idea in what timeframe it could be handeled if it is not
completely in RAM.

regards chris

you really have lots of RAM or you don't need queries to be quick.  In other words, you may
have to spread this over multiple indices/machines.
