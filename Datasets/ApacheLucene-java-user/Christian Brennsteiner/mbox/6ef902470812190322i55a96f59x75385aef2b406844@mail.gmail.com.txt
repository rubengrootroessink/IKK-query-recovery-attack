SUBJECT: lucene suiteable ? 6 mio recods / day 1k
DATE: 19 Dec 2008

hi *,

i am searching for a fulltext index capeable of the following requirements:

index everyday 3 000 000 new records with a validity of N days (e.g.
90 days expiration)
== 34,7 / s
one record is e.g. an url and can be up to 2 k big

http://example.com/somedir/some.html

lucene should use "/" as a word seperator and should e.g. eliminate all ":"

so the following "sentence" shoule be indexed:

http example.com somedir some.html when having the url
http://example.com/somedir/some.html

my main concern about this requirement is that the index should not
grow over time as it always holds
NR OF DAYS * RECORDS PER DAY  and expires the records after a given
time. in my opinione ther must be some background thread always
throwing away expired hits.

is this easilly possible with lucene?

regards chris
