SUBJECT: Hierarchical Navigation in Lucene
DATE: 23 Feb 2006

Hi,

We have a custom built document repository which is searchable / indexed via
lucene.

I want to put together some kind of navigation framework based on the
repository metadata (which is also indexed with lucene). 


Is there a best-practice way to do this.?

 

Thanks,

Hugh
