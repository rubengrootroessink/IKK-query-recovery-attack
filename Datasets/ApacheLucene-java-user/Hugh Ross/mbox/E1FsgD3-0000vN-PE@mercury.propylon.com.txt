SUBJECT: Exact Match Searches and Stop Words
DATE: 20 Jun 2006

I am running an exact match search using an index which was created using
the StandardAnalyzer.

My problem is that when I do an exact match search on this index and look
for a phrase such as

content:"Head of State" using the query parser (StandardAnalyzer again for
searching), the search brings back documents which contain text such as "The
man's head was in a sorry state".

This is not an exact match. The problem is that the standard analyzer
removes the stop word (i.e. "of") before indexing and searching. Is there an
workaround for this?

Many thanks,
Hugh
