SUBJECT: Exact match on a single term / word
DATE: 28 Apr 2006

I am trying to get Lucene to perform an exact match on a single term or word
using the default query parser. It works fine whenever I have more than one
word / term in the search string (it parses the string into a PhraseQuery
with a slop of 0 which is correct). However when the search string just
contains a single word ie "state", the query parser parses this into a
TermQuery despite the quotes when I would have expected a phrase query.
Is there any easy way around this?

Many thanks,
Hugh
