DATE: 29 Jul 2006

Hiï¼ŒHow about implement multi-key search use lucene, for example use
boolean search exceed 1000 clauses,it will affect the performance
greatly. If use filter or custom sorter to select the result, because
the result is extremely large in amount,so the performance is lower.
Please give me some advice,Thanks.
