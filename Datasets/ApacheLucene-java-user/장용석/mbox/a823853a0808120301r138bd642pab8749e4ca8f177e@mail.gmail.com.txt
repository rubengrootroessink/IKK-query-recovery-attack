hi.

I am searching for lucene api or function like query "FIELD > 1000"

For example, a user wants to search a product which price is bigger then
user's input.
If user's input is 10000 then result are the products in index just like
"PRICE > 10000"

Is there any way to search like that?

thanks.
Jang.
