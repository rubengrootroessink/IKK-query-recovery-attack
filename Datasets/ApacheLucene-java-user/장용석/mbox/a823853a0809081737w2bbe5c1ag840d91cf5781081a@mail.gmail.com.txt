Hi~.
I hava a question about lucene incremental indexing.

I want to do incremental indexing my goods data.
For example, I have 4 products datas with
"GOOD_ID","NAME","PRICE","CREATEDATE","UPDATEDATE" colunms.

1, ipod, 30000, 2008-11-10:11:00, 2008-11-10:11:00
2, java book, 20000, 2008-11-10:11:00, 2008-11-10:11:00
3, calendar, 10000, 2008-11-10:11:00, 2008-11-10:11:00
4, lucene book, 5000, 2008-11-10:11:00, 2008-11-10:11:00

If I will Indexing these datas, they will have a unique docid.

And I update one of them that has good_id "1", price colunm 30000 to 35000
and UPDATEDATE colunm 2008-11-10:11:00 to 2008-11-10:12:00.

In this case , I want update my index with new data good_id "1".

In book, If I want to update my index then I should delete target data from
index and add data to index.
If the target data is one, I think It is no matter for me, and applications.
But if the target datas are over 3000 (or more) , this applcations must do
job delete data and add data each 3000(or more) times.
I worried about It will be problem to my applications.
Or Is this job no matter?

I need your helps.. :-)

many thanks.
Jang.
