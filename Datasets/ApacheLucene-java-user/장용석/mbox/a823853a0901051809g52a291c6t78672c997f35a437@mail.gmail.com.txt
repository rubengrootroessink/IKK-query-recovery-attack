Thanks for your advice.

If I want to sort some field (for example name is "TITLE") and It must be
Analyzed.

Then Do I have to make two field that one is ANALYZED and the other is
NOT_ANALYZED like this?

document.add(new Field("TITLE", value, Field.Store.NO. Field.Index.ANALYZED)
document.add(new Field("TITLE_FOR_SORT", value, Field.Store.NO,
Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED)

- Jang.
