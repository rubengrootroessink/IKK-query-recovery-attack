SUBJECT: How to use Sort cass in Lucene 2.4.0?
DATE: 5 Nov 2008

hi.
I have a question :)

In lucene 2.3.X I did use Sort class like this..

Sort sort = new Sort("FIELDNAME", true);
Hits hits = searcher.search(query, sort);

but, in lucene 2.4.0 search(Query, Sort) method is deprecated. I was
searched API, so I found this method
search(query, filter, n, sort)

Could one of you point me to an example of code for querying without using
the deprecated method search(query, sort)?

and an example of code for method search(query, filter, n, sort). :)

Thanks. :)
