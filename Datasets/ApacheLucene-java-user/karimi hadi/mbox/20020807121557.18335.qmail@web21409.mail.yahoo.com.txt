SUBJECT: A question about indexing
DATE: 7 Aug 2002

I want to index some documents with lucene in one
FSDirectory. I want to do it in defferent sessions.
In each try, Lucene overwrites the older data in the
FSDirectory. 
I want to index my documents in the incremental manner
that it seems to be not an unusual approach.

Is it possible to use Lucene in this way? If yes, How
I can do it ?  

Best Regards.
Hadi .
