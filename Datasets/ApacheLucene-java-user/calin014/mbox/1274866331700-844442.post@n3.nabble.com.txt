SUBJECT: Precision-recall curve with /contrib/benchmark/quality
DATE: 26 May 2010


Hi,

I am testing some ranking methods with /contrib/benchmark/quality package,
and i was wondering if there is a simple way of building a precision-recall
graph with the info gathered(maybe QualityStats.RecallPoint).

Thanks
