SUBJECT: Re: Filter to retrieve random documents without specific terms ?
DATE: 29 Mar 2011

Ok I've solved the first part of the problem. I'm now selecting all
documents that do not contain a given term with a BooleanFilter
and FilterClause, MUST NOT.

I still have to understand how to retrieve random documents and limit the
number of retrieved docs to N.

thanks
