SUBJECT: cannot find org.apache.lucene.search.TermsFilter
DATE: 29 Mar 2011

I've downloaded the nightly build of Lucene (TRUNK) and I'm referring to the
following documentation:

https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/view/G-L/view/Lucene/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc/all/index.html

But I get:
cannot find symbol
symbol  : class TermsFilter
location: package org.apache.lucene.search
import org.apache.lucene.search.TermsFilter;

thanks
