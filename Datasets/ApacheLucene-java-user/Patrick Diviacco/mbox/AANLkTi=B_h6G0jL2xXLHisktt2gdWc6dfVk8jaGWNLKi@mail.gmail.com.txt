all right. I still have one last question. If I pass a new QueryParser to
booleanQuery.add method, am I actually passing multiple single terms or it
is the same than just passing the string ?

See example below, please...

booleanQuery.add(new QueryParser(org.apache.lucene.util.Version.LUCENE_40,
"title", new
WhitespaceAnalyzer(org.apache.lucene.util.Version.LUCENE_40)).parse("my
multiple terms"), BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);
