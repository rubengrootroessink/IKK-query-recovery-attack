SUBJECT: Results: get per field scores ?
DATE: 22 Mar 2011

Is there a way to display Lucene scores per field instead of the global one
?
Both my query and my docs have 3 fields.

I would like to see the scores for each field in the results. Can I ?

Or should I run the query 3 times for each single field ?

thanks
