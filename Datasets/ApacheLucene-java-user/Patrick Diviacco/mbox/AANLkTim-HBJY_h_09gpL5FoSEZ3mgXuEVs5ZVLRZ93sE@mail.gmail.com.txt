SUBJECT: Am I correctly parsing the strings ? Terms or Phrases ?
DATE: 21 Mar 2011

I'm new to Lucene. If I use

    description = new TermQuery(new Term("description", "my string"));

I ask Lucene to consider "my string" as unique word, right ?

I actually need to consider each word, should I use PhraseQuery instead ? Or
is it correct ?

thanks
