SUBJECT: Re: Am I correctly parsing the strings ? Terms or Phrases ?
DATE: 23 Mar 2011

ups, I've just used toString as you suggested and this is what I got:

*.*:*.* title:Flickrmeetup_01 description:Michael description:R.
description:Ross tags:rochester tags:ny tags:usa tags:flickrmeetup
tags:king76 tags:eos350d tags:canon50mmf14 tags:mikros tags:canon tags:ef
tags:50mm tags:f14 tags:usm tags:canonef50mmf14 tags:canonef50mmf14usm

I can see the tags field repeated multiple times, so it seems to me
correctly parsed... correct ?
