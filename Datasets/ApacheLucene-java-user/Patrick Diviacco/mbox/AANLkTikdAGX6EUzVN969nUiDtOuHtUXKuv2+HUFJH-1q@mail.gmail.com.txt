SUBJECT: Re: get the cosine similarity measure as output results ?
DATE: 26 Mar 2011

Update:

I actually don't understand why if the scores are substantially the cosine
similarity between query and the docs, such scores are not comparable
between queries.

Isn't cosine similarity describing the divergence between vectors ? If I
have vector A and B (my queries) and vector C (a doc), can't I say which
vector is more similar to vector C by considering the score ? In other
words, can't I compare the scores ?

I'm asking this because I've been told I cannot compare the score of a query
with the score of another one.

Furthermore, my queries are docs from the collection: I compare 1 doc from
the Collection against all other docs.

I need some more info about this...
thanks
