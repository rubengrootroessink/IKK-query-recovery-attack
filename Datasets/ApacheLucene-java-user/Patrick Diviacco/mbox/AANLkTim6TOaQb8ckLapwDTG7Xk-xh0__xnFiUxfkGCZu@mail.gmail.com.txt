SUBJECT: Re: How to define different similarity scores per field ?
DATE: 1 Mar 2011

I see, but I don't get one thing... you are actually customizing only
normLenght method but not all the other methods that are calculating the
similarity scores...

those methods are called and they have the implementation you have in
DefaultSimilarityClass.. right ?
