SUBJECT: Filter to retrieve random documents without specific terms ?
DATE: 29 Mar 2011

Is there a Filter to get a limited number of random collection docs from the
index which DO NOT contain a specific term ?

i.e. term="pizza"

I want to run the query against 10 random documents of the collection that
do not contain the term "pizza".

thanks
