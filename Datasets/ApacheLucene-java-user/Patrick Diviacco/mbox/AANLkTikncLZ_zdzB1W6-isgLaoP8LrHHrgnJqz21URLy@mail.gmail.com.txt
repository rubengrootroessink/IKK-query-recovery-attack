DATE: 4 Mar 2011

hey Robert,

I know there is the documentation, I'm sorry I've confused setSimilarity
with setSimilarityProvider.

However, my question was about "Similarity get(String field) method" (I
cannot understand from documentation sorry).

Should I create a customSimilarity class implementing the SimilarityProvider
and then implement the get method ?

Also, inside the get method should I check the passed string field and
return different custom similarities classes ?

thanks
Patrick
