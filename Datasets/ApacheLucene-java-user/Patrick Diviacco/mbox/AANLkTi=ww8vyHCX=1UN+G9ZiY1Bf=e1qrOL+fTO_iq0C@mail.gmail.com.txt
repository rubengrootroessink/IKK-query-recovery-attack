SUBJECT: Lucene nightly build: similarity score per field
DATE: 3 Mar 2011

I've downloaded Lucene nightly build because I need to customize the
similarity *per field*.

However I don't see the field parameter passed to the methods to compute the
score such as "tf" and "idf"...

how can I implement different similarities score per document field then ?

thanks
