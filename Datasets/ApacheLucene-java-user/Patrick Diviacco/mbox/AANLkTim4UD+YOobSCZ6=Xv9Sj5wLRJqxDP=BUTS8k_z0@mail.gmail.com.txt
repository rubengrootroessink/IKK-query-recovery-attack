SUBJECT: How to define different similarity scores per field ?
DATE: 1 Mar 2011

I need to define different similarity scores per document field.

For example for field A I want to use Lucene tf.idf score, for the numerical
field B I want to use a different metric (difference between values) and so
on...

thanks
