SUBJECT: Building a query of single terms...
DATE: 21 Mar 2011

I'm new to Lucene and I would like to know what's the difference (if there
is any) between

PhraseQuery.add(Term1)
PhraseQuery.add(Term2)
PhraseQuery.add(Term3)

and

term1 = new TermQuery(new Term(...));
booleanQuery.add(term1, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);

term2 = new TermQuery(new Term(...));
booleanQuery.add(term2, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);

thanks
