SUBJECT: should I import the XML file into a mysql dataset ?
DATE: 29 Mar 2011

hi,

I performing multiple queries (stored in a 100MB XML file) against a
collection (indexed with lucene, and it was stored before in a 100MB XML
file).

The process seems pretty long on my machine (more than 2 hours), so I was
wondering if importing the 100MB queries XML file into a mysql dataset and
extract them with Java would dramatically improve the performances (rather
than working with Java + a xml text file).

thanks
