SUBJECT: get the cosine similarity measure as output results ?
DATE: 26 Mar 2011

I'm performing several queries and I get scores per each document which I
have been told being not comparable across queries.

For example, if I get score: 8.234234 for a specific document from a query
A, I cannot compare such score with the document score: 3.342432 of the
query B.

However I need to find a comparable score across queries, and more
specifically the cosine similarity... as similarity measure between my query
document and the documents in the collection.

could you give me some tip about it ?
thanks
