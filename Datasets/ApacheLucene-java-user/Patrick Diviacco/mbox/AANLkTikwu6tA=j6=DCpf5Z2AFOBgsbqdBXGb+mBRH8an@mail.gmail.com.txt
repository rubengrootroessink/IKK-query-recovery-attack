SUBJECT: Re: Lucene nightly build: similarity score per field
DATE: 4 Mar 2011

ok thanks, one last thing: in my TimeSimilarity class, I just need to use
this formula:

queryTimeValue - DocTimeValue / normalizationFactor

to compute the similarity score of a time/date field.
How do you suggest to implement this ? Which methods do I need to overwrite
?

thanks
