SUBJECT: How to normalize Lucene scores... (over all queries)
DATE: 21 Mar 2011

I'm combining several scores for my queries performed with Lucene and other
software.

My issue is that I have lucene scores + other scores (not related to Lucene)
for each query result.

The other scores are all normalized between 1 and 0.

I need to normalize Lucene scores (over all queries) because If I don't
normalize Lucene scores in the same way I'm going to have unbalanced
results...

How can I make it ?
thanks
