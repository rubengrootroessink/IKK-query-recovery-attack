SUBJECT: Are Okapi BM25 scores normalized into 0 and 1 ?
DATE: 28 Apr 2011

Is Okapi BM25 (its implementation in Lucene:
nlp.uned.es/~jperezi/Lucene-BM25) returning back normalized query scores (in
between 0 and 1) ?

According to Okapi formula the final score should be normalized. Could you
give some information about that ?

thanks
