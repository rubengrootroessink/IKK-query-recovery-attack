SUBJECT: Parallel access to TermPositions API
DATE: 14 Apr 2011

Hi,

I need to load a huge amount of TermPositions in a short space of time 
(millions of Documents, sub-second).
Does the IndexReader's API support multiple accesses to allow several 
parallel threads to consume a chunk each?

Thanks for any ideas / pointers.

- Chris
