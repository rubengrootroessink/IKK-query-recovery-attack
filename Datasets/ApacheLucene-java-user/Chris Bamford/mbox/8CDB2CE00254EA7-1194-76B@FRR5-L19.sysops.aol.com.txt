Hi, 

at this point it's too late, the field selector must be applied when you

fill resultDocs and call IndexReder.document(int id, FieldSelector fs) or

Searcher.doc(int id, FieldSelector fs).



Another point is that your code is too close from the dataset volume,

more doc means more heap. If you don't need yo have the whole dataset

loaded into RAM maybe you could implement a custom Collector that do the

whole job on a doc by doc basis and not collecting and saving all docs

in a Collection.
