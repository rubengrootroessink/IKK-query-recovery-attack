Hi,

Can someone point me in the right direction please?
How can I trap this situation correctly?  I receive user queries like 
this (quotes included):

    /from:"fred flintston*"/

Which produces a query string of

    /+from:fred  body:flintston/       (where /body/ is the default field)

What I want is:

/    +from:fred +from:flintston*/

In other words, I want quoted expressions to be treated as single units..
Thanks for any pointers,

- Chris
