Its possible its something tricky. When I was converting the Highlighter
to the new TokenStream API, I started to
get this exception in the Highlighter rewrite test - everything else
passed, but this was failing. I couldn't figure it out - and
before I could find the root cause, all the tests started passing
(perhaps from changing code doing other things, rebuilding, or who knows
- I don't have a clue). I couldn't get it to fail again after that.

Not very helpful - but just to note, there were not multiple threads
involved concurrently, nor multiple Writers.
