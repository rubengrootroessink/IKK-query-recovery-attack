Hi,

I was researching LockObtainFailedExceptions and came across this thread.
I
don't use Solr, just regular Lucene deployed via Tomcat - but I have
started getting these exceptions which coincides with our recent
upgrade from 2.0.0 to 2.4.0.
I have found that just removing the lock file
seems to clear up the problem, but I was hoping for (a) a better
understanding of why they might occur in the first place and (b) some
thoughts on how I might deal with them programatically.

Thanks for any ideas / pointers,

- Chris
