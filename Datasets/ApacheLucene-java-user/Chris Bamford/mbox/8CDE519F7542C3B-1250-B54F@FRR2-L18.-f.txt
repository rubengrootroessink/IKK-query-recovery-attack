SUBJECT: How to delete docs when using NRT?
DATE: 20 May 2011

Hi there,

Is there something special I should be doing here? This is my sequence:

open writer
add  doc #1
add  doc #2
get reader from writer
do a search on reader - matches doc #1
delete doc #1 from writer
commit writer
add doc #3
optimise writer
close writer

So by my reckoning, my index should contain docs 2 & 3.
Luke says different - all 3 are there!  Why hasn't doc #1 gone?

Have I missed something?

Thanks,

- Chris
