I'm glad its not normal.  That means we can fix it!  I will conduct a review of IndexReader/Searcher
open/close ops.

Thanks!

This is not normal.  As long as you are certain you close every
IndexReader/Searcher that you opened, the number of file descriptors
should stay "contained".

Though: how many files are there in your index directory?

Lucene FAQ, but on some of our installations, Tomcat eventually runs out of file descriptors
and needs a restart to clear it.  We know Lucene is the culprit because use lsof -p <java
PID> and the vast majority (usually tens of thousands) of files reported are Lucene index
files.

set, you will run out?  Or is there a policy of recycling that we are failing to utilise properly?
