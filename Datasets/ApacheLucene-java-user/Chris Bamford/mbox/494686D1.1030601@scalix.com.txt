SUBJECT: searching in 2 indexes
DATE: 15 Dec 2008

Hi

I have a situation where I have two related indexes which are logically 
linked by a common field called INDEXID. All other fields differ between 
the two indexes. For any given INDEXID I would like to be able to 
retrieve the matching pair of documents, one from each index. (Logically 
this is an AND /i.e. /only return anything if there is a document with 
INDEXID /X/ in index A *and* in index B.)

Is there a nifty way to do this with a single query or must I first 
search one, then the other?
I thought perhaps MultiSearcher might do it, but now I'm not so sure ...

Thanks...

- Chris
