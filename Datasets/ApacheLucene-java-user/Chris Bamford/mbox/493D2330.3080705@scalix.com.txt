SUBJECT: Re: Open IndexReader read-only
DATE: 8 Dec 2008

Thanks Mark.

I have identified the spot where I need to do the surgery.  However, I 
discover that IndexReader is abstract, but it seems crazy that I need to 
make a concrete class for which I have no need to add any of my own 
logic...  Is there a suitable subclass I can use?  The documented ones - 
FilterIndexReader, InstantiatedIndexReader, MultiReader, ParallelReader 
- all seem too complicated for what I need.  My only requirement is to 
open it read-only!

Am I missing something?
