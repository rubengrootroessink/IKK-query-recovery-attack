feed anything to it.  So unless you have an index-time analyzer that outputs terms that look
like "aaa ddd" -- that is, terms with embedded spaces -- then attempting to use PhraseQuery
or any other query type to look for these terms will bring you no joy.  (Of course, this only
applies if you are not using a query parser - I believe John's point about enclosing a phrase
query in quotes refers to the action Lucene's QueryParser takes when it sees input of this
sort.)
