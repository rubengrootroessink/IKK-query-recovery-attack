SUBJECT: IndexWriter.optimize()
DATE: 15 Jan 2008

Hello,
I have been running some experiments on lucene. To speed up index time, I
have disabled autocommit,
and I flush the indexwriter each 512 objects. So far I have tried with
256,512,1024,and 2048 and I have seen a really incredible speed difference
indexing.

However, if I the time required to run optimize() at the end has increased
too. So I have been running some more experiments to optimize the index
every 512*4, 512*8, etc. but I have not been able to find a sweet spot.

Could someone give me some insight on the optimize. Should I run it
incrementally while indexing or should I run it  at the end. If I run it
incrementally, is it better to run it often or not?

Best,
-C.B.
