great!

well I never use autoCommit=true.

However the documentation states that autoCommit=true.

How do we disable this? In 2.3 I used to do a:

writer.setMaxBufferedDocs(IndexWriter.DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH);

would that totally disable autoCommit, or will it autoCommit when the
ram usage reaches a certain criteria.

Best.
