SUBJECT: delete by doc id
DATE: 8 Aug 2008

hello,

what would happen if I modified the class IndexWriter, and made the delete
by id method public?

I have two fields in my documents and I got to be able to delete by those
two fields, (by query in other words) and I do not wish to go trunk version.

I am getting quite desperate, and if not found a solution I will have to
make my documents with 3 fields, a, b and a + b so I can delete by a and b.

Best.

could there be a side effect?

Best.

-c.b.
