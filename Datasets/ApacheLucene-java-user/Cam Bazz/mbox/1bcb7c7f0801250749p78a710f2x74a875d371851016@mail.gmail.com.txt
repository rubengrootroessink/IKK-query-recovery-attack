Hello,

How about getting which documents have the that term as a bitset?

In other words, now that I have field=a, field=b do I use regular query
logic to get the bitsets with hitcollector, or do can I do it with
TermDocs() - (I could not figure it out with termdocs);

Best, and thanks a lot for your help.
