Hello,

Could someone show me a concrete example of how to use HitCollector?
I have documents which have a field category. When I run a query, I need to
sort results by category as well as count how many hits are there for a
given category.

I understand:

searcher.search(Query, new HitCollector() {
   public void collect(int docnum, float score) {
     bitSet.add(docNum);
  }
}
);


So we now have a bitset that contains docnums.

How do we do sorting and filtering over this, and why is it more efficient
to do it from hits?

Best Regards,
-C.B.
