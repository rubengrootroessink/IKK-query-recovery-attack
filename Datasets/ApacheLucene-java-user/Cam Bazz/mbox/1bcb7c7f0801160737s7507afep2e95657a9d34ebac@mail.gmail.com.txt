Hello,

When storing fields to serve as id's - is it better to use
NumberTools.longToString(id) or just store the id as a field?
I have noticed when using NumberTools to store number as a string, this
makes range queries easier, however - you end up storing a long string.
Considering millions of ids, would it be faster to store them just as a
string representing this number. (would take less space, since you store 1,2
instead of 00000000001, etc.)
Best Regards,
