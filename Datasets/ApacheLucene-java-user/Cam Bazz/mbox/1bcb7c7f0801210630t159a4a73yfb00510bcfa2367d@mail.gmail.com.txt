SUBJECT: Clarification about IndexWriter.deleteDocuments and flush.
DATE: 21 Jan 2008

Hello,

When we delete documents from index - will it autoflush when count of
deleted documents reach a certain value. I am controlling my own flush
operation, and I have disabled autoflush by:

writer.setMaxBufferedDocs(IndexWriter.DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH);


But I have taken a peek at the IndexWriter and the DocumentWriter source
codes and from what I understand delete will flush the index when it reaches
a certain threshold.
But I am not sure if that will happen when the autoflush is disabled.

Also when deleted documents trigger a flush, that will be a cumulative flush
that flushes all the addDocs as well? is this correct?

Best,

-C.B.
