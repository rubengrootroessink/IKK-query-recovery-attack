Hello,

I would like to get advantage of isDeleted. If I delete a document
from index, and not commit, and index searcher is not reinstantiated,
how can I check if a document is marked for deletion? I tried it with
both commit() and without committing, the isDeleted(mydeleteddocid)
returns always false.

if the indexsearcher is refreshed, then it is deleted.

Best.

-C.B.
