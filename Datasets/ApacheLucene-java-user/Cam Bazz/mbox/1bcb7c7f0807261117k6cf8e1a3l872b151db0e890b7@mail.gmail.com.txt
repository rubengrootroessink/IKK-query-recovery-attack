SUBJECT: Re: deleting documents with doc id
DATE: 26 Jul 2008

hello,

the thing is:

I got a indexwriter and indexsearcher.

I do a indexsearcher.getIndexReader.delete(int id)

would not that cause problems? there is not a way to delete from
indexwriter, and I think i will cause a lock issue deleting from
indexsearcher.

best,
-C.B.
