SUBJECT: lucene link database
DATE: 8 Oct 2006

Hello,

I would like to make a link database using lucene. Similar to one that 
nutch uses. I have read the basic documentation and understood how 
document indexing, search, and scoring works. But what I like is 
different documents having different kind of links (semantic links) to 
each other. I would like to be able to search in the database like 
incominglinksofdocument(id), outgoinglinksofdocument(id). the links I am 
talking about, might not necessarily be hypertext links.

How would I approach to a problem like this?

Best Regards,
-C.B.
