SUBJECT: IndexSearcher and RAMDirectory
DATE: 17 Jan 2008

Hello,

I understand after writing some documents in an index with an indexwriter,
the IndexSearcher object has to be reinstantiated for it to find newly
instantiated objects. And this reinstantiation of IndexSearcher is costly
from what I understand.
I am working on a caching scheme that will allow transparent operation - so
what one can do indexsearches while updating the index, based on a certain
key.

Does anyone have any ideas to overcome this limitation? I thought of adding
documents to a map and searching the map first and then the index, and
writing the map every once in a while to index, but this approach has its
limitations too.
Could it be possible to use a ramdirectory as a cache, and could it be
faster to reinstantiate the indexsearcher on this ram directory?

Any input greatly appreciated.

Best Regards,
-C.B.
