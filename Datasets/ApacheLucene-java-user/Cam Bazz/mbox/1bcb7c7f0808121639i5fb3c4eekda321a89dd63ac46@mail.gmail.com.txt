SUBJECT: top terms
DATE: 12 Aug 2008

hello,

how do we get the terms with the highest frequency for a given field?

I know one can TermEnum terms = searcher.getIndexReader().terms() then,
iterate over it and filter the fields required and count them,
but is there a way to get lets say top 50 terms for a given field without
iterating?

Best Regards,
-C.B.
