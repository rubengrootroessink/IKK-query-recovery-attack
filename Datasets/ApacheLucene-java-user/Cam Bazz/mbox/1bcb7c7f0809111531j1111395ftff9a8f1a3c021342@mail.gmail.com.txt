SUBJECT: query to return docs that has a certain field
DATE: 11 Sep 2008

Hello,

Lets say we have different document types, and one type of document
only contains field A.

How can I make a query so that I get all the documents that only has field A?

There is a get all documents query, but that would get all the
documents whether they contain field A or not.

Is there a way? I could make the documents containing field A have
another field B equals some flag, and then query for that flag, but
that would be kind of inefficient.

Best,
-C.B.
