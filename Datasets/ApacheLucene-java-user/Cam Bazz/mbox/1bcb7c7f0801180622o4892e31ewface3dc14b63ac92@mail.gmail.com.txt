SUBJECT: delete a document from indexwriter
DATE: 18 Jan 2008

Hello,

How do I delete a specific document from an indexwriter? I understand there
is deleteDocuments(term) which deletes all the documents matching the term.
But what if I want to delete a document that has more then one term in
specific. I can search the document with a boolean query, and then get the
doc id.
I know that doc ids are temporary, but can I not use it for delete?

IndexReader has a delete by doc id method, but I am not sure how to use this
when using an indexwriter.

Best,
C.B.
