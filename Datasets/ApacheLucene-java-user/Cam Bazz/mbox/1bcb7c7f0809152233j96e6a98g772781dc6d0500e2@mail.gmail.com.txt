Hello,

Lets say I have two documents, both containing field F.

document 0 has the string "a b" as F
document 1 has the string "b a" as F

I am trying to make a phrasequery like:

        PhraseQuery pq = new PhraseQuery();
        pq.add(new Term("F", "a"));
        pq.add(new Term("F", "b"));
        pq.setSlop(2);

and then search. however I was not successful finding anything.

any ideas?

Best Regards,
-C.B.
