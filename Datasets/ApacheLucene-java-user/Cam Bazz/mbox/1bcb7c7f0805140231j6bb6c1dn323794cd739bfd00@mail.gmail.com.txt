SUBJECT: text extraction from pdf
DATE: 14 May 2008

Hello All,

Any suggestions for extracting text from PDF? I have tried pdfbox, but it
works nice, however if the pdf is structured, it wont provide good results.
For example consider the pdf:


P1 Lorem Ipsum Bla bla                                      P3 Lorem2 Ipsum2
P1 bla bla

P2 bla bla bla
P2 bla bla bla



above P1,2 and 3 are meaningful paragraphs or fields. The pdfbox will
convert

P1 Lorem Ipsim Bla bla P3 Lorem2 Ipsum2
P1 bla bla

which is not useful to me.

the unix program pdf2text can convert keeping the text places, but I wanted
to ask you guys if you know something better,

Best,
-C.B.
