Hello Karl;

This is good good good news. It works.

However, I added a document like

doc.add(new Field("f", "a", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS));

and then searched. The score is 0.3~ for the found document. should
not it be 1.0?

also it will find when searched for "f","b" only with a lower score.

Best.
