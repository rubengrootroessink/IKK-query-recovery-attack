Hello,

Regarding https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1026 , this seems
very interesting. I have read the discussion on the page, but I could not
figure out which set of files is the latest.
Is it the IndexAccessor-1.26.2008.zip file?

I will read through the code, make my own tests, and send some feedback.

Best.
-C.B.
