SUBJECT: Re: delete a document from indexwriter
DATE: 21 Jan 2008

Hello Michael;

how can I construct a chain where both reader and writer at the same state?
You can call getIndexReader method of the IndexSearcher. But when I delete
documents through the reader, how will this interact with the writer?
I am have disabled autoflush and using my own logic to do flushes, since I
have very small document sizes. However I am little confused about how to
use
IndexWriter and IndexReader and IndexSearcher at the same logic. Basically
currently I have a IndexWriter and IndexSearcher, I write documents, and
flush() my own. In this scenario
how can I access a reader so that my logic still works.

Best.
-C.B.
