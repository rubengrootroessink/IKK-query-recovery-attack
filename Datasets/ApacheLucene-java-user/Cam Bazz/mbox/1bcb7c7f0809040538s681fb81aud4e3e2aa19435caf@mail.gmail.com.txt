SUBJECT: string similarity measures
DATE: 4 Sep 2008

Hello,
This came up before but - if we were to make a swear word filter, string
edit distances are no good. for example words like `shot` is confused with
`shit`. there is also problem with words like hitchcock. appearently i need
something like soundex or double metaphone. the thing is - these are
language specific, and i am not operating in english.

I need a fuzzy like curse word filter for turkish, simply.

Best regards,
-C.B.
