SUBJECT: using hitcollector and scoring at the same time
DATE: 20 Mar 2008

Hello,

I recently changed my query logic. Before, I was getting a hits object, and
now I am using a bitSet with a hitcollector.
The reason for using bitSet is document caching, and being able to count how
many hits belong to which categories.

Although my new logic works, I have noticed that now the resulting documents
is not in order of boost (naturally).

Is there an easy way to accomplish this?

Any ideas / recomendations greatly appreciated.

Best.
-C.B.
