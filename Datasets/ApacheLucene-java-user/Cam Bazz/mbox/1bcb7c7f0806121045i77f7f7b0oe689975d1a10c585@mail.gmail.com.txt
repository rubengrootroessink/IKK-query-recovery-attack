SUBJECT: lucene wildcard query with stop character
DATE: 12 Jun 2008

Hello,

Imagine I have the following documents having keys

A
A>B
A>B>C
A>B>D
A>B>C>D

now Imagine a query with keyword analyzer and a wildcard: A>B>*

which will bring me A>B>C , A>B>D and A>B>C>D

but I just want to get A>B>C and A>B>D

so can I make a query like A>B>* but does not have the > character after
A>B>

Best Regards,
-C.B.
