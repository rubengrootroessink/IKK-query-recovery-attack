SUBJECT: how to handle words with accent?
DATE: 31 Oct 2006

hello,
i use lucene to index documents in Italian. many terms end with accented
letters: società, fedeltà, etc

What happen now is that if a user search for : societa' (note the a and the
' character), it doesn't get the same results as he would when searching for
società.

What is the best practice to handle such situations ?
i haven't tuned anyhow lucene, and i'm using the default analyzer.

thanks for any suggestions,
valerio
