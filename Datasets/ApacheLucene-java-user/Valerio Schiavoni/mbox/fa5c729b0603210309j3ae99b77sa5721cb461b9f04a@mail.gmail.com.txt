SUBJECT: how to cluster documents
DATE: 21 Mar 2006

Hello,
not sure if the term 'cluster' is the correct one, but here what i would
like to do:
given I have a small set of categories; i manually defined some keywords for
each category.
ie:

-spielberg: ET, munich, indiana jones;
-sport: football, basket, volley, etc etc;

then, i have a quite large archive of documents (html, pdf, doc) (~5000,
still growing) and I want to 'assign' each document
to those categories, using Lucene possibly (if it can help!).

what approach could I adopt ?

thanks,
valerio
