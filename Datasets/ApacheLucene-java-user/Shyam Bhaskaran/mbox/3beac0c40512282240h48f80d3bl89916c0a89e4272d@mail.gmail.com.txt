SUBJECT: Lucene parsing for PDF
DATE: 29 Dec 2005

Hi,

I am working on a search project using Lucene and currently I am working on
parsing PDF documents. I was successful in implementing my parser using
Lucene and PDFBox. I have a doubt on how to exclude or (maybe delete) pages
from the index. I am not sure how to do this.. I mean when exactly it has to
be done.. Looking at the Lucene book it tells about removing documents using
Lucene by id or by term, but I was not successful in implementing this.. Can
anyone help me with this...

Regards,
Shyam
