SUBJECT: Out of Memory Exception
DATE: 25 Feb 2008

Hi,
     I am using Lucene2.0. I am doing full text index of pdf file. To
extract the text from pdf I am using pdfbox library. When I start indexing
of pdf files I get Out of memory exception. This is becuase files are about
10 mb in size. I tried different value for mergefactor,  maxmergefactor and
maxbuffereddocs i.e. 100, 100; 100; 10, 100, 100; 100,100 ,1000; etc...   I
am storing the field value.

    I am not getting resolve this exception. Any suggestion to resolve the
issue.

Thanks
