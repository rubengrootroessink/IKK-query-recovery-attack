SUBJECT: Outof memory exception on using Integer.MaxValue
DATE: 28 Dec 2010

Hi,

  I am using multiSearcher as

objMultiSearcher.search(query,null,Integer.MaxValue);

I searched a query, which should & does not return any hit. As I run the
query, the above statement throw OutofMemory exception. I change the
Integer.MaxValue TO 100, then I again searched, it returned 0 hit.

Why its thowing memory exception, even there is not hit found for the query
?

Thanks
