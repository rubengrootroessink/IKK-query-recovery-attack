Is it true that Lucene will only Index up to a maximum of 10,000 Terms per
document ?

Subject:  EJB solution for Lucene


Hi,

I'm interested in a Lucene EJB solution with JDBC, possibly using something
like the SQLDirectory from Marc Kramis at
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg00416.html.
How has such an EJB usage been implemented by other users?  What happened
to
the performance when replacing file system storage with database storage?
Anyone who has been down this road before please share a map of the
terrain.

Thanks.
Jeff
