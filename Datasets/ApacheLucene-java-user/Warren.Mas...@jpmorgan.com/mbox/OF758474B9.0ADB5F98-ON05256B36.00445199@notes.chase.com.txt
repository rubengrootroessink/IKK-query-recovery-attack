Can anyone tell me why deleted documents are showing up in my searches?

when I update a document with Reader.delete(Term) then  re add the document
the Document will show up twice in my hits
I have tried opeing and closing the Reader and Writer after the operation .
I am also obtaining a new Searcher each time a search is performed.
I also noticed that docFreq(Term ) still shows the undeleted documents in
the count while Reader.delete(Term) does not delete the same number of
documents and returned bu docFreq(Term).

is Optimize the only solution here?
How do I get the document number of a document to pass to isdeleted() from
hits() ? I was thinking of filtering here?

thank you

warren
