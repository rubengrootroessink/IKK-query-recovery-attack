Andrei,

If this sort of thing is important enough, you could implement a 
customized analyzer which would reverse all terms and store them in a 
separate field (in addition to the a non-reversed field).  This will 
double your index size, of course.

Then, when searching, suffix query terms (those beginning with '*') 
could be reversed and wildcard-searched on the reverse-term field.

Hope it helps,
Steve Rowe
