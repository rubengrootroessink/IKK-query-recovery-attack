Harry,

You can have fields which correspond to each of the element names in 
your documents.  If you index all of the terms which occur within each 
field, via a custom Document generator and a custom stream/file parser 
for your XML documents, you could use the A:foo B:foo C:foo syntax in 
queries using the default query parser.  Come to think of it, given 
appropriate field naming, I think you can use the A/B:foo A/B/C:foo 
syntax, too: just add fields named "A/B", "A/B/C", etc.  (BTW, using the 
"A:B:C:foo" syntax is just asking for trouble, unless you want to write 
your own query parser, since the ':' character is used to separate field 
names from query terms).

For example, the document parser could return a list of element type 
names to the document generator, and a concatenation of the text nodes 
occurring within each element type (you'd have to think about multiple 
occurrences of element types in a single document, of course).  Your 
document generator class would then just add a tokenized field (I'm 
assuming you want tokenization here) for each element type name (or 
XPath-ish expression) and give the flattened representation for it as 
the value parameter to the Field constructor.

To use your XML document example, your Document generator would pass the 
document to your parser, which could report a series of fields (I'll use 
the XPath-ish syntax here): "A", containing "foo", "A/B", containing 
"foo", and "A/B/C", containing "foo".  (It might make more sense in 
actual practice to reverse the reporting order from the parser, but you 
get the idea.)

Hope this helps,
Steve Rowe
