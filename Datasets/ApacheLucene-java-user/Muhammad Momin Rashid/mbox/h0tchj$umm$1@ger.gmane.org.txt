SUBJECT: How to filter data based on dates?
DATE: 12 Jun 2009

Hello Everyone,

I need to filter records based on whether current system date is between 
startDate and endDate of a record.  Could someone guide me on this one?

(Current Date >= startDate)
and
(endDate == null || Current Date <= endDate)

Regards,
Muhammad Momin Rashid.
