SUBJECT: IndexWriter.doAfterFlush()
DATE: 11 Mar 2008

Hi everyone,

I have written an extension of IndexWriter which overrides its
doAfterFlush() method. I had no problems with this in Lucene 2.2 but I
noticed that in Lucene 2.3 the behavior of doFlush() has been changed so as
to only call doAfterFlush() on deletions rather than on both deletions and
additions to the index. I am wondering what the reasoning behind this is and
if it is safe for me to modify IndexWriter for myself locally to call the
method on additions as well.

Thank you,

Mark
