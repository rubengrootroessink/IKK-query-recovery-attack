Hello,

I was wondering if there had been any work done out there on an analyzer for
URL strings. I'm looking for something which will match on any of the words
in the domain or path of the URL. I am considering using a PatternAnalyzer
but I wanted to ask this group to see if this was something which has been
discussed here before. Thanks very much in advance,

Mark Ferguson
