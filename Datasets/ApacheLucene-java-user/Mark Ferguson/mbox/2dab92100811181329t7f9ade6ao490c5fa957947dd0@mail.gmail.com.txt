SUBJECT: Re: Searching repeating fields
DATE: 18 Nov 2008

Thanks for the suggestion, but I think I will need a more robust solution,
because this will only work with pairs of fields. I should have specified
that the example I gave was somewhat contrived, but in practice there could
be more than two parallel fields. I'm trying to find a general solution that
I can apply to any number of parallel fields holding any kind of data.

I was thinking of trying something along the lines of a multi-value field.
So for example, I could have:

page_user_title: ajax|news (where | is a field separator)

The problem is I don't know how to formulate the query that would be
equivalent to +username:ajax +page_title:news, or if it's even possible. (I
should also mention that I am creating the queries programmatically, not
using the query parser, so anything goes).

Any other ideas?
