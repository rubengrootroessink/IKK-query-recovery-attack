You have to close the IndexReader after doing the delete, before opening the IndexWriter for
the addition.  See information at this link:

Subject:	problem with locks when updating the data of a previous stored document
Hi,

Using lucene-1.4.1.jar on WinXP  

I am having trouble with locking and updating an existing Lucene document. I
delete the old document from the index and then add the new document to the
index writer. I am using the minMerge docs set to 100 (much quicker!!) and
close the writer once the batch is done, so the documents are flushed to the
filesystem

The problem i am having is I can't delete the old version of the document
(after the first document has been added) using reader.delete because there
is a lock on the index due to the IndexWriter being open.

Am I doing this wrong or is there a simple way round this?

Regards,

Paul


Code snippets of the update code (I have just cut and pasted the relevant
line from my app to get an idea)


    reader = IndexReader.open(location);
    // Delete old doc/term if present
    if (reader.docFreq(docNumberTerm) > 0) {
	    reader.delete(docNumberTerm);
    .
    .
    .

    IndexWriter writer = null;

    // get the writer from the hash table so last few are cached and don't
have to be restarted
    synchronized(IndexWriterCache) {

           String dbstring = "" + ldb;
           writer = (IndexWriter)IndexWriterCache.get(dbstring);

           if (writer == null) {
           //Not in cache so create one and add to cache for next time

               writer = new IndexWriter(location, new StandardAnalyzer(),
new_index);

               writer.setUseCompoundFile(true);

               // Set the maximum number of entries per field. Default is
10,000
               writer.maxFieldLength = MaxFieldCount;

               // Set how many docs will be stored in memory before being
saved to disk
               writer.minMergeDocs = (int) DocsInMemory;

               IndexWriterCache.remove(dbstring);
               IndexWriterCache.put(dbstring, writer);
            }
        .
        .
        .
  
        // Add the docuents to the Lucene index
        writer.addDocument(doc);




        .
        . Some time later after a batch of docs been added
     
	   writer.close();
