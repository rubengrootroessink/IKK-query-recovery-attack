SUBJECT: Boolean query term match count
DATE: 25 May 2006

Hello,

 

I'm working on a search application and I need to know if it is possible
to get the number of terms that actually matched a Boolean query.  For
example let's say I have field test with values aaa bbb ccc d e f and I
constructed a Boolean query like this:  test:aaa OR test:bbb OR test:e
is it possible to get the count - 3 for the the terms (aaa, bbb, e) that
matched from the test field.  If not would it be possible to modify the
BooleanScorer to accomplish this?

 

TIA,

 

Michael
