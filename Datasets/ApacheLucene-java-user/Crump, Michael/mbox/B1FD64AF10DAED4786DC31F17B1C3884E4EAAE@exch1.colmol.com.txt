SUBJECT: Check to see if index is optimized
DATE: 7 Jan 2005

Hello,

 

Lucene is great!  I just have a question.

 

Is there a simple way to check and see if an index is already optimized?
What happens if optimize is called on an already optimized index - does
the call basically do a noop?  Or is it still and expensive call?

 

 

Regards,

 

Michael
