SUBJECT: Can Span Queries contain boolean, prefix and other component queries?
DATE: 4 Sep 2005

Hello,
    I am trying to do some complex queries such as:

[Field contents]
The movie Napoleon Dynamite is a movie about a kid named Napoleon who 
has no Dynamite.

[Query]
"Napol* Dynamite" near "film|movie"


    Is this possible with some version of a span query? Something like a 
PhrasePrefixQuery joined to a BooleanQuery by a SpanNearQuery?

    If not, does anyone have a suggestion on how to do this? I am 
assuming I will need to do two queries, and determine the 'nearness' of 
the resulting hits myself.
Thanks,

Sean
