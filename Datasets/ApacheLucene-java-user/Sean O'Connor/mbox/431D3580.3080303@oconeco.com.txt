SUBJECT: Hits document offset information? Span query or Surround?
DATE: 6 Sep 2005

I believe I have heard that Span queries provide some way to access 
document offset information for their hits somehow. Does anyone know if 
this is true, and if so, how I would go about it?

Alternatively (preferably actually) does the surround code from the SVN 
development area have a way of returning offsets for the matching hits?

I believe the current highlighter code matches all query terms in a hit 
document, not just those satisfying a query criteria. I need a more 
precise way to access the hit term offsets. I am working on hit 
highlighting, hit excepts and summaries, and compound queries  (is this 
called search vectors?). I am still working through the surround code in 
dev. to see if that gives me the compound queries I need.

I am willing to spend a few days to work on implementing adding offsets 
to the returned hits (or something similar) if this is not currently 
available. It is something I need, even at the cost of search efficiency.
Thanks

Sean
