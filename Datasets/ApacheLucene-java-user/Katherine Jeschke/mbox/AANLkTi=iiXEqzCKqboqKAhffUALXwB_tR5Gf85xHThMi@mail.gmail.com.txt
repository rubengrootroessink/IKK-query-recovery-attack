SUBJECT: Surge 2011 Conference CFP
DATE: 18 Mar 2011

We are excited to announce Surge 2011, the Scalability and Performance
Conference, to be held in Baltimore on Sept 28-30, 2011. The event focuses
on case studies that demonstrate successes (and failures) in Web
applications and Internet architectures. This year, we're adding Hack Day on
September 28th.

The inaugural, 2010 conference (http://omniti.com/surge/2010) was a smashing
success and we are currently accepting submissions for papers through April
3rd. You can find more information about topics online:

2010 attendees compared Surge to the early days of Velocity, and our
speakers received 3.5-4 out of 4 stars for quality of presentation and
quality of content! Nearly 90% of first-year attendees are planning to come
again in 2011.

For more information about the CFP or sponsorship of the event, please
contact us at surge (AT) omniti (DOT) com.
