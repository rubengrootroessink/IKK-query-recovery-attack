You can do it with one of the alternate constructors, and they'll 
override the build-in list.

String[] MY_WORDS = new String[] {"this", "that", "thing", "thloople"};

StandardAnalyzer a = new StandardAnalyzer(MY_WORDS);

---

There are also constructors that take a Set of strings, a file to take a 
word list from, or a Reader. If you want the existing words PLUS your 
own, it shouldn't be too hard...

---

Set words = new HashSet(Arrays.asList(StandardAnalyzer.STOP_WORDS));

words.add("thloople");

StandardAnalyzer a = new StandardAnalyzer(words);

---

or similar.

Cheers,

Paul
