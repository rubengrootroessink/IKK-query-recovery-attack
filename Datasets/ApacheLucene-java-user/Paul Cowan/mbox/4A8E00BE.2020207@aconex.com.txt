Just checking here... you only want to match where the terms are in 
specific sub-documents? That is, if someone searches for 'term1a AND 
term2b', what do you want to see? Nothing (because no sub-document 
matches both terms)? Or subdoc2 and subdoc3, because they're both part 
of the reason that Document1 matched?

If the former, then just indexing each sub-doc as a separate document 
(duplicating the document-level information) may be the simplest option.

Cheers,

Paul
