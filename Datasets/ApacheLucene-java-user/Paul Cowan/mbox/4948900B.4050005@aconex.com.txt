Do you mean you want to run two separate queries -- get all the results 
from query 1 first, then get the results which match query 2 but also 
DON'T match query 1?

e.g. search for "fruit:apple", get back x records
then search for "colour:blue", get back records with 'blue' as a colour 
but WITHOUT 'apple' as a fruit?

Do the first query as normal, then create a second BooleanQuery; add one 
clause for "colour:blue", Occur.MUST, and then add the query from the 
first search as a MUST_NOT.

Query q1 = new TermQuery(new Term("fruit", "apple"));
... run query, get back all apples ...

BooleanQuery q2 = new BooleanQuery();
q2.add(new TermQuery(new Term("colour", "blue")), Occur.MUST);
q2.add(q1, Occur.MUST_NOT);
... run query q2, get back all blue things that don't have apples ...

Cheers,

Paul
