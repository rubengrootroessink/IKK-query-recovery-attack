With a bit of fudging, you may be able to use a SpanNearQuery to do this 
-- though you'll need to change your analyzer's positionIncrementGap, 
and depending on how many tokens you'll have for each field (if it 
varies between fields) you may need to patch Lucene to change the way 
the gaps are calculated.

I've done a prototype of exactly this (SpanNearQuery and analyzer 
changes) for a very similar situation here and it works BRILLIANTLY -- 
massively, massively faster for us than indexing a new document for each 
set of 'subfields'.

I've put some patches against 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1494 -- I think this 
approach might work for you. Let me know if you need clarification.

Cheers,

Paul
