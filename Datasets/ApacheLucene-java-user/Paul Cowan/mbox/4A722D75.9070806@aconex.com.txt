Or add them separately (rather than:
   doc.add(new Field("email", "foo@bar.com bar@foo.com com@bar.foo" ...);
use
   doc.add(new Field("email", "foo@bar.com");
   doc.add(new Field("email", "bar@foo.com");
   doc.add(new Field("email", "com@bar.foo");
), using an Analyzer that overrides getPositionIncrementGap(). This 
inserts a 'gap' between each set of Tokens for the same Field, which 
stops phrase queries from 'crossing the boundaries' between subsequent 
values.

Cheers,

Paul
