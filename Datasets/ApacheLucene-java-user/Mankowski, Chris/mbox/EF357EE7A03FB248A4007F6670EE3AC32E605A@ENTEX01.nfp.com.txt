SUBJECT: Scaling out Lucene /general architecture Q
DATE: 26 Oct 2007


I'm new to lucene and am interested in learning how enterprises deploy multi-server installations
of lucene for large  24x7 operations.  

The first question that comes to mind is: are most of the design decisions made at during
development time, or can a simple server be 'grown into' something that can handle multiple
search and index requests?

Also, I would appreciate any reference to a getting started guides you know of.

Thanks!
Chris
