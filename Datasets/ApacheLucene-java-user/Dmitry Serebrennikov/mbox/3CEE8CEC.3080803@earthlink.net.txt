>>Are there are known problems with indexes over very small numbers of files? I have
a program which works fine when it is indexing plenty of documents, but when it only indexes
10 or so, all that gets created is an 8 byte segments file. I build the index in RAM, and
then merge it to disc, and I am stabilizing and optimizing in appropriate places. The exact
threshold for an index to get created seems to vary with the document size - if they are smaller
you need more of them.
