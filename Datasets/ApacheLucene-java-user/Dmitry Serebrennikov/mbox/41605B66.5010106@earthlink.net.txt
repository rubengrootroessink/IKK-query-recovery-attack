As far as I know, yes. The only segments that matter are those 
referenced from the "segments" file or those that may still be open by 
the application. By the way, how do you know they are not referenced? 
Did you write some custom code to parse the segments file (or just using 
a hex editor or something)?

Is it possible that your index update code sometimes fails by does not 
record its exceptions? That could explain why you have abandoned 
segments lying around.
Also, are these segments about the size of your full index or about the 
size of an incremental segment you might find when new documents are 
added? If you are able to look into the "segments" file manually, 
perhaps you can also put a new one together that references these 
segments? This would allow you to use something like Luke 
(http://www.getopt.org/luke/) to look into them and see what documents 
they contain?

Good luck!
Dmitry.
