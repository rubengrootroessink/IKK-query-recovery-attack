This is not a normal behavior, unless you are running on Windows and 
have searchers open for that long that are still locking the segments 
(but then they would be in deletable...).

What version of Lucene are you running? At some point during the past 
two months there were a few days when CVS snapshot would have had this 
problem. If you are running from CVS, try the latest release and see if 
this occurs again.
