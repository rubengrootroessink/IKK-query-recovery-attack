By the way, I could be wrong, but I think the 35% figure you referenced 
in the your first e-mail actually does not include any stored fields. 
The deal with 35% was, I think, to illustrate that index data structures 
used for searching by Lucene are efficient. But Lucene does nothing 
special about stored content - no compression or anything like that. So 
you end up with the pure size of your data plus the 35% of the indexed 
data.

Cheers.
Dmitry.
