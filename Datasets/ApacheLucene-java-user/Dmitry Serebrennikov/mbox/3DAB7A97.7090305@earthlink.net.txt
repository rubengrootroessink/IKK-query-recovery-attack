SUBJECT: Are score values always between 0 and 1?
DATE: 15 Oct 2002

Greetings,

I know that the FAQ says that they are, but in at least one instance in 
my index it appears to be equal to 1.94something. Are the scores 
guaranteed to be between 0 and 1, and if not, what would it take to make 
them such?

Thanks.
Dmitry.
