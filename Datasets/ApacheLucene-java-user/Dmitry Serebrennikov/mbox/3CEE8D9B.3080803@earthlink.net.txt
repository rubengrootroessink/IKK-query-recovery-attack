SUBJECT: List admin request
DATE: 24 May 2002

Could someone please change the Reply-To header on the digest messages 
from the lucene-user list? Right now it goes back to the 
lucene-user-digest address which bounces back. It's no big deal but it 
bites me from time to time and I imaging a few other people as well...

Thanks.
Dmitry.

PS: I'm sorry if this request should have been sent to another 
address... If so, what should it have been (for next time)?
