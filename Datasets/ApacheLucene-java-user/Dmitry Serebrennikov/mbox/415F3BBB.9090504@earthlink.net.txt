Here are a couple of possibilities:
- the setUseCompoundFile(true) will only apply to indexes created (or 
optimized) after the option is set.
  All pre-existing indexes will still be in the multi-file format.
- number of documents does not directly impact the number of files 
needed by Lucene. If the index is
  really in a compound file format (see above), and is optimized, you 
will need a fixed number of file handles.
  Even if the index is in a multi-file format, the number of files 
needed depends on the number of indexed *fields* in the index (not 
documents).
- do you get the error on the first and every search or only once in a 
while? Perhaps where there are lots of
  concurrent users? Perhaps after you've done X searchers?
- check your OS-level setting for the number of open files. This is 
shell/system-dependent somewhat, but
   "ulimit -a" should get you started. The number of open files should 
be large enough to allow for all files
   and sockets that your application needs to open. In a typical 
server-side Java app setting this value should
   be around 8000. Defaults are much smaller, so unless you have changed 
this, this may be the answer.
- look into "lsof" utility. It can display all file handles in use by a 
given process. This is a good tool to
  troubleshoot "too many open files" issues.

Good luck.
Dmitry.
