Thanks, Doug.

This is true. The code was actually intended, and is being used, for 
something more like what is being discussed on the "Relevance Feedback" 
thread - retrieving lists of terms based on matching documents. Terms as 
well as Term Positions are available from the API given a document. 
There is also a cost for using this API. It adds three or four files per 
index segment, and one of them is as large as the .prx file (provided 
that you choose to "vectorize" every indexed field in the document). 
Another issue with the code is that it does not (yet) support use with 
unoptimized indexes (those with more than one segment).

Dmitry.
