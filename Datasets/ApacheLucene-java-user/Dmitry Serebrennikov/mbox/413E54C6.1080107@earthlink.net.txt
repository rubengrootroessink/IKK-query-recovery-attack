Hi Wallen,

Actually, the files Daniel listed were modified on 8/11 and then again 
on 8/15. In the time between 8/11 to 8/15, I belive there could have 
been any number of problems, including corrupt indexes and poor 
multithreaded performance. However, I think after 8/15, the files should 
be in good working order. If you are not sure if you saw problems with 
pre-8/15 or post-8/15 version of the code, is it possible for you to try 
the latest CVS and see if the problem exists now? If it does, it will of 
course require urgent attention.

Thanks very much!
Dmitry.
