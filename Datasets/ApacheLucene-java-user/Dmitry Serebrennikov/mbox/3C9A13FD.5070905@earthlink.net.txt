Yes, I think if the Reader is a regular FileReader that has been opened, 
it would consume the file handle. On the other hand, if it is just a 
String or a StringReader it would consume memory equal (probably 
greater) to the size of the data. One way to fix this is to create your 
own Reader class, say DelayedReader, which does not open a file upon 
creation, but only upon the first read. That would help safe the file 
handles.
