If I understand correctly what you did, it's really pure chance that it 
has worked in the first place. As far as I know, there are no built-in 
parsers for any document type (including PPT) in Lucene. Rather it 
attempts to handle every stream or String you give it as regular English 
text (you can change the language by selecting a different stemmer, but 
it will still assume plain text). There are various efforts underway 
that are building a framework for plugging different document parsers. 
There is also a project (on Apache?) that has an OLE parser written in 
Java that might be appropriate for working with PPT files. I think the 
first file you tried has had the text listed in plain string form where 
as the second file had them in some encoding (or compressed / 
encrypted). That's all I can say without knowing more about the PPT file 
format. If you can find a program or library that will extract text from 
a PPT file, you then should be able to easily use Lucene to index this 
text. This might not be as elegant as the final solution of the project 
I mentioned above, but this is the way everyone is using Lucene with 
various document types today.

Good luck.
Dmitry.
