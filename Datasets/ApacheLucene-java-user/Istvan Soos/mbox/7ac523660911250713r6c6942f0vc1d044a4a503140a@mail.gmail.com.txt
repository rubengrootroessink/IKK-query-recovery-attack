SUBJECT: best way to ensure IndexWriter won't corrupt the index?
DATE: 25 Nov 2009

Hi,

What are the typical scenarios when the index will go corrupt? E.g.
can a simple JVM crash during indexing will cause it?
What are the best way to minimalize the possibility of corrupt index?
Copy the directory before indexing / then flipping the pointers?

I'm using Lucene 2.9.

Thanks,
    Istvan
