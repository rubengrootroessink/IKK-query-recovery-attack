Hi,

I guess an Analyzer (built in ones such as StandardAnalyzer, 
POrterStemAnalyer and etc) is not thread safe. But I wonder if it's ok 
to share the same analyzer object within a thread. For example, if I 
want to create a PerFieldAnalyzer for 5 fields, can I use the same 
Analyzer object for all the fields? Or can both a QueryParser and 
Indexer/Searcher use the same Analyzer object?

Any comment?


Thanks!

Jay
