Otis,

you are right. The QueryParser is treating '-' as a boolean NOT operator. I
was wondering whether I should encode the - character while indexing and
then apply the same encoding while searching. While I'll be working on this,
is there any better way to do this? (Apart from writing my own QueryParser
that is :-) )

Most likely you are using QueryParser, which considers - to be a
special character.  You could make a custom QueryParser that treats -
like any other character, but you would use some other nice things,
like range searches.  Maybe it's a conflict with the '-' that is used
as NOT operator.
