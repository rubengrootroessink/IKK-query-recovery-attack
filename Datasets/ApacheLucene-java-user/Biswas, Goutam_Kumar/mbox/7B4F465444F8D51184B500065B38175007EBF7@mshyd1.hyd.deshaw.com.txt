If your not letting lucene remove the write.lock file, and doing it with
your own code, that just screams out to me to be a very bad thing to do.

Unless of course you want things to get corrupted.

Maybe it has worked for you so far, out of luck, but I'm sure its not the
way you are supposed to be doing things.

I'm not removing the write.lock file by hand. I'm doing it inside the code
before opening the index

I don't think it is a good approach to delete the write.lock file by hand.
It is there for a reason. You may want to dig into some of the older
dialogs/e-mails on this topic.

well suneetha,

   before I write to the index I check whether a write.lock file exists! If
it does I delete it before opening the index. It works fine
for me.

Hi,
The write.lock file won't be there if you close the index using a lock
mechanism. I use my own RWLock to access the index dir and unlock it after I
close the index. Basically, the access to the index is synchronized. I have
never had any problems with this approach.

Hi,
        I'm currently indexing allowing  multiple access , I find that a
write.lock file has got created.
I know this is to prevent  multiple writers, but now how do I
continue.??I  do not want to reindex as I work on a very large database
and it takes a real long time How do I remove this lock file ??

Thanx 4 ur help,
Suneetha.
