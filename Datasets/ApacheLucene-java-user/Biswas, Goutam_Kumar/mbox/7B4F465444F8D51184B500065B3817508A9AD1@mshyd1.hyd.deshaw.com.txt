Otis,

Your suggestion worked. Thanks. However there is one more problem. If the
path contains a '-' I do not get the results, even if I escape the '-'. For
example: path:/u/biswasg/Install/jakarta\-tomcat*. If I search for
path:/u/biswasg/Install/jakarta*, however, I get the correct results. So I
figure out that the '-' causing the problem here. How do I deal with these
cases ?

Thanks always,
Goutam

I think that may be due to one of the new QueryParser methods.
setWildcardLowercase(boolean), I think.  Check the source for the exact
method name.
