SUBJECT: Accent filter
DATE: 28 Sep 2004

Hi,

I am certainly not the first, and probably not the last, that have had 
problems with accented characters in my index. But unfortunately I 
couldnt find anything in neither lucene nor the lucene-sandbox to solve 
the problem.
SÃ¥ I wrote an accent filter and thought that I might as well share it 
with you guys :)
