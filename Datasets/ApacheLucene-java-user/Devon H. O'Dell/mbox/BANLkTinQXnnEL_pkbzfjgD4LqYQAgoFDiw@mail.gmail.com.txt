I have my own collector, but implemented this functionality by running
the search in a thread pool and terminating the FutureTask running the
job if it took longer than some configurable amount of time. That
seemed to do the trick for me. (In my case, the IndexReader is
explicitly opened readonly, so I'm not too worried about it).
