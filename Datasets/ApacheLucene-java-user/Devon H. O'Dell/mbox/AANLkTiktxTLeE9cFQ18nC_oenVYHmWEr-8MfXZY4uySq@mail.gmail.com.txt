Could you elaborate on this point at all, Uwe? I'm using
ParallelMultiSearcher with 3.0.3 in an application right now and it
doesn't seem to be very buggy to me, but perhaps I'm missing
something. Switching to MultiReader / IndexSearcher wouldn't be a
problem, but I'm curious as to what exactly is wrong with the
MultiSearcher interface.

Thanks!
