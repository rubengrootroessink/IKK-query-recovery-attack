Hey,

this looks like you are hitting the optimization done in LUCENE-2773
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2773) that prevents
merged segments that are larger than 10% (by default - see
LogMergePolicy#noCFSRatio) of the index size it will be left in
non-compound format even if compound format is on.

for some background see:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/changes/Changes.html#3.0.3.changes_in_runtime_behavior

so its a feature not a bug :)
