Look at the JavaDoc:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_2/api/core/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#reopen()

The *reopen* method returns a *new reader* if the index has changed since
the original reader was opened.

So, you should do something like this:
IndexReader newReader = reader.reopen(true);
if (newReader != reader) {
reader.close();
 reader = newReader;
searcher = new IndexSearcher(reader);
}

instead of
reader.reopen(true);

Bye.
