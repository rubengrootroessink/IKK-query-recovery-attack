Hi,

I have several documents that share the same (large) searchable data.
For example, say my Documents represent movies, and  2 movies share the same actorBiography
of Brad Pitt (assuming I want 
to search movies by actorBiography words, far-fetched as it might seem):


Document1:  
- movieName="Benjamin Button"
- actorBiography="Brad Pitt was born in 1963 in Oklahoma and raised in..."
Document2:  

- movieName="Ocean 11"

- actorBiography="Brad Pitt was born in 1963 in Oklahoma and raised in..."

My question: I'm afraid my index files will become very large, due to the duplication of information.
Is there any trick that would keep my index files in a reasonable size, while still allowing
the functionality of "search movie by actorBiography"?
Thanks :)
