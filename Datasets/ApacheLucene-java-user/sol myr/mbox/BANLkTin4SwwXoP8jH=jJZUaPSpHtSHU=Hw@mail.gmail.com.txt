SUBJECT: Large index merging/optimization?
DATE: 15 Jun 2011

Hi,

Our Lucene index grew to about 4 GB .
Unfortunately it brought up a performance problem of slow file merging.
We have:
1. A writer thread: once an Hour it looks for modified documents, and
updates the Lucene index.
Usually there are only few modifications, but sometimes we switch the
entire content and re-index everything.

2. The default Lucene Merge thread (ConcurrentMergeScheduler)

Usually it works great. But every several hours the
'ConcurrentMergeScheduler' thread gets stuck (for hours - I'm guessing
it got to the point where it needs to merge large files).
During this, our Writer thread is stuck (waiting on a lock), so users
will see stale data.

My questions please:

1. Is there any configuration that would either speed up file merging,
or allow IndexWriter to write simultaneously?

2. And when do I call 'optimize'?
Won't it be another very operation, that holds the 'write' lock and
prevents updates?

Thanks:)
