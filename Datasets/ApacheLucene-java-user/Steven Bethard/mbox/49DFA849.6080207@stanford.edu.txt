Yes, that's fine too - that's actually what I'd be optimizing anyway.

But how would I do that? If I took the query boost route, how do I get a
TermQuery to produce a score in log-space, while keeping the boost in
regular space? Or if I took the CustomScoreQuery route, how do I combine
two Query scores (not a Query score and a ValueSourceQuery score)?
