SUBJECT: Why is CustomScoreQuery limited to ValueSourceQuery type?
DATE: 17 Apr 2009

CustomScoreQuery only allows the secondary queries to be of type
ValueSourceQuery instead of allowing them to be any type of Query. Why
is that? Is there something that makes it hard to implement for
arbitrary queries?

Steve

P.S. I played around with this briefly, and simply replacing all
ValueSourceQuery references with Query references yields only one simple
compile error, where ValueSourceQuery.createWeight() is being used
instead of Query.weight() for some reason.
