Yeah, PageRank is relatively easy to incorporate with a CustomScoreQuery
and a FieldScoreQuery. Just add a field to your index containing the
float value of your document's PageRank, and then specify that field
when you create the FieldScoreQuery that you provide to the
CustomScoreQuery constructor.

If you want to keep the PageRank scores in a separate index (that's what
I do currently), it's easy enough to combine two parallel indexes using
a ParallelReader.
