Some code snippets that may help. I add the PageRank value as a field of
the documents I index with Lucene like this:

    Document document = new Document();
    double pageRank = this.pageRanks.getCount(article.getId());
    document.add(new Field(
        PAGE_RANK_FIELD_NAME, Float.toString((float)pageRank),
        Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED));

Then when I want to get the value back, I use a FieldScoreQuery, which
just returns the field value as the document score, like this:

  new FieldScoreQuery(PAGE_RANK_FIELD_NAME, FieldScoreQuery.Type.FLOAT);

If you want to combine the PageRank score with another Query score, then
you can look at CustomScoreQuery to do so.
