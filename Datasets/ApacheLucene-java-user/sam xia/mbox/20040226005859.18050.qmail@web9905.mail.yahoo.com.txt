thanks for your quick response, Erik. BTW, I checked
your web site, the logo is cool. 

Is there a way to store the filter cache to hard
drive? Then I can just read it from hard drive. Since
I have lots of categories, it might be impossible to
cashe every query filter bitsets in memory.

How about I keep every category to one segment? Then I
have 10000 segements to work with. Is it going to be
faster than the filter solution?

Plus:
I am looking forward to your lucene book. I found one
in Amazon.com. Not sure if any good.
