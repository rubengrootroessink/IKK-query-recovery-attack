SUBJECT: Re: how use ranges for numeric values?
DATE: 19 Sep 2008

Hi,
   NumberTools provides method longToString(long l) which pads the values.
It can be indexed and range search like normal queries.

Slight issue is when you search view the index in Luke because the numbers
are hexadecimal notation and so not easily understandable. Hence you may
want to store the original prices also in the index. Handy for debugging.

Similarly in search time, use longToString to get hexadecimal coded values
for prices and make a range query encoded values.
