          I guess this would be the case. The free flowing text search leads
to this issue.

      I am not sure if Lucene will be able to directly able to do it.
However Indexed Terms in Lucene can certainly be used in learning the field
of a particular word/token.
      One way, would be Lucene Index can be traversed to generated a
Learning System which will be later used to learn the field name of a
particular system. I suggest traversing the termDocs and extracting out the
words and field information which can be stored in a separate DB/Index
(Learning System). This system can then be queried 1st to determine the
field type of word. The additional time that the Learning System will
require should be compensated by having a smaller Index Size.



Thanks
