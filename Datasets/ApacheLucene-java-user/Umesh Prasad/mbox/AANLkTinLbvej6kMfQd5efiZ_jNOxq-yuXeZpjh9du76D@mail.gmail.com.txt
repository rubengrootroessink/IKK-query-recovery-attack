 http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_1/scoring.html.
That will help you understand the bigger picture.

You can get see how , documents got assigned score by using

IndexSearcher.explain(query,docId); as described in
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_1/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/Searcher.html#explain%28org.apache.lucene.search.Query,%20int%29


If it is, how can I neglect the word order when searching. (I am not using
