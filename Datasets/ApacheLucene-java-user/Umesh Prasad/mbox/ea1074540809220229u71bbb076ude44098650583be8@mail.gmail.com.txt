SUBJECT: Re: Multi Field search without Multifieldqueryparser
DATE: 22 Sep 2008

Hi,
Having an extra indexed but unstored field is equivalent to having a bag of
words. So the search results quality will be affected.
Consider an Example:

Text : ----  President  of USA--
Other Fields ..

Text : --
Occupation: President of USA

In both cases searchable-mash = BAG of WORDs, will have President of USA
hence will score almost same, which would be undesirable.


Another solution is to learn the field name of each term in the unstructured
query and then form the query programmatically.
You will have to write 2 additional subsystems.
1. Field Learning System
2. Customized Query Tokenizer and Query Parser

That said, Best solution depends on your requirement.

Thanks
Umesh
