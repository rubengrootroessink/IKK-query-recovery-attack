SUBJECT: Using metadata of the requested files with Lucene
DATE: 2 Dec 2010


Hi All,
I'm trying to write a small app, ebook organizer, using Lucene.

I index metadata of various file types properly,and when I search a keyword
related to metada of documents I can get a result. However, I wanna get the
metadata of some specific indexed document e.g. I'll send the part/filename
to lucene, and it will return exact result including metadata of it. I
couldn't figure out until now. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
