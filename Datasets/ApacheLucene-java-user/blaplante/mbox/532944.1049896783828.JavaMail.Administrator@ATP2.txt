SUBJECT: JavaCC2_1 NoClassDefFoundError
DATE: 9 Apr 2003

Ok,

I have searched till I am blue in the face. I am wanting the compile lucene
and so I downloaded the JavaCC2_1 compiler and tried to installed it on a
windows 2000 machine. I typed c:\install>java JavaCC2_1 at the command line
and get the following error, Exception in thread "main"
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: JavaCC2_1.

The folks at http://www.webgain.com seem to have little to know support for
that particular product. I was not even able to determine if it is
compatible with windows at all.

I hope at least one of you have run in to this and can point me to better
resources than I have been able to find.

Thanks.
