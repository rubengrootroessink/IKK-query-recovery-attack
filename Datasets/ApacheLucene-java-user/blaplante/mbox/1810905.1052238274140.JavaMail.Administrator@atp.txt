DATE: 6 May 2003

yes I am using the org.pdfbox.searchengines.LucenePDFDocument class and I
did like the others and put in fork logic to call either HTMLParser or
LucenePDFDocument to index the InputStream. The strange thing is there are
about 8 pdf's in the site and they seem to be the only thing that gets
indexed. I am using eclipse and watching the debugger to make sure the
correct parser is getting called and I also watch the index grow durring the
index stage and shrink when the optomize is called, yet when I put in search
criteria I get no results unless I put in a single alpha character [a-zA-Z]
and then the results I spoke of earlier. Once I get this working I would be
happy the share my code that crawls a site using https, it looks like that
one is missing from the sandbox.
