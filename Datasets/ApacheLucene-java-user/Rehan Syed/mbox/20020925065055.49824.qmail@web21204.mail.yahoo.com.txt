Hi,

I am in process of implementing a Knowlegde base for internal use by my company.  
The contents of this Knowledge base will be stored in one or more database table(s).  I am
evaluating Lucene for performing text searches on this Knowledge base. I understand that Lucene
has two components, indexing and searching, but both these components work on files, not on
text data stored in an RDBMS.  

In order for me to use Lucene, would I need to develop a process that will extract text data
out of the database, create text files and then do the indexing and searching?  Are there
any other approaches to this problem?  Comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
