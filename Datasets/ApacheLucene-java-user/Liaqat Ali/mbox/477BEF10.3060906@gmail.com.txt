SUBJECT: Scoring in Lucene (for Precision and Recall)
DATE: 2 Jan 2008

Hello,

I am using treceval for precision, recall calculation. Treceval takes 
Relevance judgments and Result file as an arguments to calculate the 
precision, recall. There is a similarity parameter in the result file.

The score which is calculated by Lucene is equal to that similarity 
parameter. Kindly guide me.

Regards,
Liaqat
