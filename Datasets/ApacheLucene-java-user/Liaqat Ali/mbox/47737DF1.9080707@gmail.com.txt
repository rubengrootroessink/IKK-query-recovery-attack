Thanks alot Doron,  I was confused too, the index i thought was created 
by previous program. But this time when I run this program  (with 
stopwords as a argument), then it does not create index in the given 
directory, there is nothing inside the specified directory.
There is no error during compilation or during interpretation. And I am 
using LUKE for retrieval. So kindly suggest some guidelines.

Regards,
Liaqat
