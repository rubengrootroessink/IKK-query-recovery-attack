Hi, Erick

Thanks for your suggestion, putting the declaration of StringBuffer 
variable sb inside the for loop is working well. I want to ask another 
question, can we modify the StopyAnalyzer to insert Stop Words of 
another language, instead of English, like Urdu given below:




public static final String[] URDU_STOP_WORDS = { "پر", "کا", "کی", "کو" };
