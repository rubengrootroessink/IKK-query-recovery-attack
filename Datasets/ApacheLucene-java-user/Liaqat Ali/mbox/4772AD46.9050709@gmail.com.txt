Hi, Doro Cohen

Thanks for your reply, but I am facing a small problem over here. As I 
am using notepad for coding, then in which format the file should be saved.


public static final String[] URDU_STOP_WORDS = { "کے" ,"کی" ,"سے" ,"کا" 
,"کو" ,"ہے" };

Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(URDU_STOP_WORDS);


If I save it in ANSI format it will lose the contents, I tried Unicode 
but it does not work and I also tried UTF-8, but it also generate two 
errors of identifying two illegal characters. What should be the 
solution. Kindly guide in this.

Thanks ..
