Thanks Grant for the suggestion, I have relevance judgments. As treceval 
is concerned, I have a little bit problem with understanding of  Relfile 
of TREC format. the first field is Doc id , second Iter, Third Doc name 
and what is the fourth field (which is either 0 or 1).Can you explain 
that to me.  And how I can calculate things manually, because I have 
small number of documents.

Regards,
Liaqat
