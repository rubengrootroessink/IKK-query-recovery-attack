Hello All

I m new to the field of Information Retrieval and now working to 
develop  search engine for language like Arabic  and Urdu. Kindly guide 
me in this regard that how can Lucene be utilized for this purpose.
Can anybody tell me exactly what I should do to design a search engine 
from the scratch using Lucene.
