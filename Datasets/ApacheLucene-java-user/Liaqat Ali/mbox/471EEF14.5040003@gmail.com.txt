SUBJECT: Integration of Lucene
DATE: 24 Oct 2007

Hi All,

I m developing a search engine for Urdu language. I want to use lucene 
for that purpose. Now the situation is that

---I have a corpus of 2000 Urdu(Variant of Persian and Arabic) documents 
in XML form, how i will make index of them using Lucene.
---Well there will be need some stemming techniques while indexing, 
because there is no stemmer available for Urdu language.

---I have developed a GUI using HTML and have a Java Servlets for 
searching, so how i will integrate Lucene with my own servlets.

Thanks...
