SUBJECT: How to search multi indices
DATE: 12 Mar 2006

Hi:
  I have tow indices A and B. Field "title" is in index A and field "label "
is in B.Now I'd like to search with query "title:XXX AND label:XXX",surely I
expect search "title:XXX " in index A and "label:XXX" in index B.Is there
any Lucene API can help me to do this or I have to write some code by
myself?thank you in advance
