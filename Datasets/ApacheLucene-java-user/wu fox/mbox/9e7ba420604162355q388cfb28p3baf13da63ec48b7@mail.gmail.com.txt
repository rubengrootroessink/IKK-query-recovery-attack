DATE: 17 Apr 2006

 Hi all:
    Somebody told me recently that when lucene search a query which contain
a few of clauses ,for example a query: title:"lucene ina action" AND
publisher:manning ,lucene first search:  +title:"lucene in action" ,then
search +publisher:manning  and combine the results of two search process. Is
it true that lucene do search this way and if so,how lucene combine the
results of each search process? thank you
