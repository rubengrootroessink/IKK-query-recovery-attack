DATE: 7 May 2006

Hi all:
   Someone told me recently when lucene search a query which cotains several
clauses ,for example: title:"lucene in action" AND publisher:manning ,lucene
first search title:"lucene in action" and then search publisher:manning
,lucene will combine the results of these tow search process,I just wonder
how lucene can do this and If it it not true then how lucene combine search
results? thank you
