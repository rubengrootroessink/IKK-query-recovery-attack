Hi Jiang,

I'm currently facing a similar problem. Up to now I have to use for the
semantic query a graph matching algorithm, but the fulltext search in the
semantic web is performed by lucene. 
At first I wrote the whole text into a one index. The document contains one
field for the unique id and on for the whole text. For the semantic markup I
use an extra index. Every rdf triple will result in a document with the
following fields id, predicate + subject + object. Every query is executed
on both indexes. I use an extra index for the rdf data, because this results
in a higher score for the documents. You might argue that this would
adulterate the result, but from me point of view explicit Meta data should
be higher scored then terms in document body. 

Cheers,

Klaus

Hi friends,

How do you think use the lucene for searching in the Semantic Web? I am
trying using the lucene for searching documents with ontological annotation.
But i do not get a better model to combine the keywords information and the
ontological information.

regards
