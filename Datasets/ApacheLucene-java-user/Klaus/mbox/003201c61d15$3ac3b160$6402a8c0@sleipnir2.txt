Hi,

What do you exactly mean by features vector? You are referring to the
predicate - object pairs, connected to one subject node, don't you?

I'm going to implement something like a pagerank algorithm for my search
engine. In Contrast to the google approach I cannot just count the edge, of
one node, because of the know semantic I can weight them. Of course this
implies a knowledge of the domain ontology. For instance if there is a
predicate "cited_in_document" I could rank a document higher, if it is often
cited. But I'm not sure about the results...
