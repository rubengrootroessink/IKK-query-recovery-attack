Yes you can. Right after indexing the new documents fetch the termvector for
this document from the index. Computer some kind of weight for each term,
und construct a Boolean query from all terms. You can use the termweights to
boost the termqueries. The hits will be scored, this score is a measure for
the similarity between the documents.
