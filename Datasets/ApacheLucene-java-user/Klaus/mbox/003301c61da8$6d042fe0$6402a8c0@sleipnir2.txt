How do you do that? I have to reengineer the ontology in my application, but
I'm not sure how to express that a document belongs to one or more concepts.
Would you mind sending my your ontology?

Yes. I will have to provide some meta information about the ontology. You
can store this information as an Owl annotation, or in an extra file. I will
start to implement this during the weekend. I think it will be hard to find
the right weights for the predicates, I will keep you informed.

Cheers,

Klaus
