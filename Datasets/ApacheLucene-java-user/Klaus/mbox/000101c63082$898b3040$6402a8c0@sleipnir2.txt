A simple approach is to count the most common words in the result set and
present them in combination with the original query. If you have any meta
information you could use them the refine the query.

Betreff: Suggesting refine searches with Lucene

Hi,

I am trying to suggest refine searches for my Lucene search. For
example, if a search turned out too many searches, it would list a
number of document title subsequences that occurred frequently in the
results of the previous search, as possible candidates for refining
the search.

Does anyone know the right/any approach to implementing this in a
Lucene-based search app?

Thanks.
