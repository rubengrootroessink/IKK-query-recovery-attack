Hi,

I have got another question... How do I construct a BooleanQuery, where the
terms with the query a connected with OR? 

I have a list of term, representing to high scored terms in a document. Here
is my code

BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
for(Term t: terms)
{
	query = new TermQuery(t);
	query.add(t, false, false); // ist his wrong?	  
}

If I construct the query as a string like "A a OR B b OR C" I get much more
results. I assume that the Boolean query uses an AND operator. How can I
change that. 

And I'm wondering what happens if I boost a TermQuery with a value smaller
then one. I'm asking because I would like to boost each TermQuery with the
td*idf Value of the term in the original document. From my point of view,
this should lead to a better precision, but on the first looks the results
are worse.

THX,

Klaus
