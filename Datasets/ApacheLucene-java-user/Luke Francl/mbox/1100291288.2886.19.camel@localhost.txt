Would it be possible to write one? I would be very interested in this
feature. 

I poked around in the index and search packages today to see if it could
be done. I think it would take a big change in the Query.rewrite and
related code in the IndexReaders to make the results of the required and
prohibited parts of the query available. 

Again, I don't know if that's even possible. But it would be a great
feature.
