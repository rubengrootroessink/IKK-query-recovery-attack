I disagree. Most small companies don't have an IT staff capable of implementing a custom search
engine using Lucene for less than $5,000. Nutch might make this possible, but compared to
a plug-in-and-go solution like the Google mini, it still would probably cost a significant
amount of money.
 
Getting Lucene/Nutch to the point where it is possible to easily install it on a computer
and administrate its settings in a user-friendly way is a great goal, though.

It seems to me that any small biz will be ripped off if they install
this google mini thing, compared to using Lucene to implement a easy
to use search software, which could search up to whatever number of
documents you could image.
