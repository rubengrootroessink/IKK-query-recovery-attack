So, essentially, my query:

+item_type:xyz +(field_name:foo -field_name:bar)

Gets translated to:

+item_type:xyz +field_name:foo -field_name:bar

Whereas the more lenient one does not require field_name:foo and returns
what I expect.

Is that right?

Now, to decide whether to try to make this work the way I thought it
would, or just document that it doesn't. ;)
