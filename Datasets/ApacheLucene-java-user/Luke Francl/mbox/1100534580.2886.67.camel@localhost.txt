Be careful with this. You could conceivably run out of file handles.
This problem got a lot better in Lucene 1.3 with the compound file
format, it could still happen if you have a lot of heap and aren't
garbage collecting very often. So close the old one when you're done
with it.

Also, creating a new IndexSearcher only when the index has been modified
will give you a performance boost because you do not have to open the
index with every search.
