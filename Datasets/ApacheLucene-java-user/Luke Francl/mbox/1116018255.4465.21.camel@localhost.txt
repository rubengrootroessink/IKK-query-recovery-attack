Thanks to everyone who contributed advice to my question about how to
distribute a Lucene index across a cluster.

I'm about to start on the implementation and I wanted to clarify
something about using NFS that Chris wrote about above.

There are many warnings about indexing on an NFS file system, but is it
safe to have a single node index, while the other nodes use the file
system in read-only mode? 

On a related note, our software is cross-platform and needs to work on
Windows as well. Are there any problems known problems having a
read-only index shared over SMB?

Using a shared file system is preferable to me because it's easier, but
if it's necessary I will write the code to copy the index to each node.

Thanks,
Luke Francl
