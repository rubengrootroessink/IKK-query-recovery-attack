when I want to modify the single existing document and reIndex again, it is taking as new

it possibe to index  the modified document again and overwrite existing document without deleting
and recreation. can I do this? If so how? 

You do not need to recreate the whole index. Just mark the document as
deleted using the IndexReader and then add it again with the
IndexWriter. Remember to close your IndexReader and IndexWriter after
doing this.

The deleted document will be removed the next time you optimize your
index.
