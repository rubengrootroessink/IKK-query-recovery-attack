I really recommend against relying on the GC to clean up operating
system resources. It's just not reliable, especially in long-running VMs
with lots of memory (like an application server). 

This can leave file handles open indefinitely, which can lead to
problems in Windows with too many open files, or deletion, as you've
seen.

I also implemented a reference counting scheme for IndexSearchers and it
works well.
