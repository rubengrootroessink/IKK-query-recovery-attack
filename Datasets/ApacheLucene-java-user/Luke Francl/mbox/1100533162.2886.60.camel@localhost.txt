There is also a web-based tool that you can run in your servlet
container called LIMO. I've added some query features to it in CVS,
which you can check out from Sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/limo

But I will second what Otis said: you must (or rather your colleague
must) check to see if the index has been updated before a search (use
IndexReader.getCurrentVersion), and if it is, close the IndexSearcher
and create a new one.
