If you are using a CMS, your best bet is to integrate Lucene with the
CMS's content update mechanism. That way, your index will always be
up-to-date.

Otherwise, I would say reindexing everything is easiest, provided it
doesn't take too long. If it's ~15 minutes or less, you could schedule a
processes to do it at a low activity period (2 AM or whenever) every day
and that would probably handle your needs.
