How do you avoid the problem Eric just mentioned, iterating through all
the Hits at once to populate this data structure?

I do a similar thing, creating a List of asset references from a field
in each Lucene Document in my Hits list (actual data for display
retrieved from a separate datastore). I was not aware of any performance
problems from doing this, but now I am wondering about the implications.

Thanks,
Luke
