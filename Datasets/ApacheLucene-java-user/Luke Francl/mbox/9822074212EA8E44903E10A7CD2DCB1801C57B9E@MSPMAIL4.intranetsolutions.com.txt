SUBJECT: LIMO 0.5 released
DATE: 22 Nov 2004

I am pleased to announce that version 0.5 of LIMO, the Lucene Index Monitor, has been released.

LIMO is a web application that allows you to browse your Lucene indexes remotely. It is an
ideal companion for Lucene applications that run in a servlet container.

The 0.5 release adds some cool new features such as:

* More index summary statistics, including index version number, deletion status, number of
documents, number of fields, number of indexed fields, and number of unindexed fields.
* Querying the index.
* Display expanded wild card and range queries (using Query.rewrite) with term count so you
can see how many terms a complex query is expanded to. This is particularly helpful if you
are trying to track down an annoying TooManyClauses exception.
* Query timing to show how expensive queries are.
* Estimated query memory consumption (as given by the formula in this message: http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgId=1757461).
* Query result count.
* Query result explanation.
* Stored field reconstruction as in Luke.
* Highlighting of matching terms in search results and reconstructed documents using Mark
Harwood's library.

LIMO requires Java 1.4 or later and a servlet container.

Download it from SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/limo/ 

LIMO is still ready to go out of the box (er, war file). Just edit the web.xml to point LIMO
to your indexes.

Thanks to Julien Nioche for starting a great and very useful project and letting me join it;
and to Andrzej Bialecki for Luke from which I appropriated several ideas and his GrowableStringArray
class. If you are interested in getting involved, LIMO is now available in SourceForge CVS.

Regards,
Luke Francl
