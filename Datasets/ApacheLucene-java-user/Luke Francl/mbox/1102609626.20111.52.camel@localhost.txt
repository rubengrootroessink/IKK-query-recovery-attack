Ah, this probably means that LIMO cannot write to this location. If you
give the user you are running Tomcat as permission to write files to
your webapps/limo.war directory (or whatever it's called, I don't
actually use Tomcat), it should work.

If you don't want to do that for security reasons, simply create the
file and put it there yourself. It should be at the same level as the
index.jsp file.
