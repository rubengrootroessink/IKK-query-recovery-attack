SUBJECT: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in IndexHTML demo
DATE: 27 Jun 2002

Hi, again.  I would appreciate any pointers you could offer me as I
continue to work through this problem.

As an addendum to my previous message, I have tried the following:
- Moving the location of {index} to another directory
- Ensuring that I have permissions to write to the {index} directory
- Double checking my CLASSPATH and the functionality of the shipping Tomcat
demos
- Checking the web and this mailing list archive for similar problems

Also, I am running tomcat 4.0.4 (full edition).

What would cause the demo code to generate an
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?  Could be something simple--I'm a Java
newbie.

Thanks,
Jeff

I am working my way through the examples in the Getting Started
documentation, and I have run into a problem with the Web demo program.

When I run the following command

java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index {index} ..

I receive the following messages:

adding ./jsp/cal/Entries.txt
 caught a class java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException with message:
null
Dumping live threads:
 'Thread-0" tid 0x82bc010 ...

Regardless of the starting directory (.. in this case), the indexer appears
to find the first file and then catch the Array Index Exception after that.

I am able to run the other demo (IndexFiles) without any problems, and the
lucene jar and lucene demo jar are both in my CLASSPATH.

I would appreciate any help you could offer.

Jeff
