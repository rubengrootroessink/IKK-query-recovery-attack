Hi guys,

I am new in Lucene but i like  a lot. I am trying to develop a search
engine. 
I have two problems:
First
I did a program for indexing files, here the code:

public void indexFile(String filename) throws Exception {
		IndexWriter writer;
		writer = new IndexWriter(path, new SimpleAnalyzer(), false);

		InputStream is = new FileInputStream(filename);

		  
		Document doc = new Document();
		doc.add(Field.UnIndexed("path", filename));
		doc.add(Field.Text("body", (Reader) new
InputStreamReader(is)));

		writer.addDocument(doc);
		is.close();
		writer.close();

	}

when I do a search I receive severals links and the first is the link that I
need. The others link appear because the query have some letter or number
that match with the name of content of the file??? I don't know. I need a
help.

Second
I did a program for indexing a directory recursivily (my English is very
poor, I hope that you understand), here the code:

public void indexDirectory(String dir) throws Exception {

		File file = new File(dir);

		if (file.isDirectory()) {
			File[] f = file.listFiles();
			for (int x = 0; x < f.length; x++) {
				if (f[x].isDirectory()) {
					System.out.println("DIRECTORY:" +
f[x].getName());
					// search recursive in directory
	
indexDirectory(f[x].getAbsolutePath());
				} else {

					System.out.println("  FILE: " +
f[x].getName());
					indexFile(f[x].getAbsolutePath());
				}
			}

		} else {
			System.out.println("  FILE: " + file.getName());
			indexFile(file.getAbsolutePath());
		}

	}
When I do a search after to do an indexing of a directory with files only I
have the FIRST problem. But when I do a search after to do an indexing of a
directory with subdirectories and this subdirectories with others
subdirectories and this others subdirectories with files, is  not possible
to find the file that I want. What happens, there is an error in my code???
Some help I will appreciate.

Regards,
Michel
