Hi Adriano,
The Highlighting search results works with Lucene1.2 final released(the
latest for lucene1.2), because there is Lucene 1.3 RC1 released version.
Regards,
Michel

Lucene doesn't support native hit highlighting, but look at this web
site:

Highlighting search results with Lucene 1.3
http://home.clara.net/markharwood/lucene/highlight.htm 

I don't use it because I'm still with version 1.2, but I plan to give
it a try as soon as I upgrade
Lucene for our applications.

Hope this helps.
Adriano

Hi,

Does lucene (any version) support native hit highlighting? If so, how?
I 
searced the mailing lists and didnt come up with anything definitive.

Thanks
