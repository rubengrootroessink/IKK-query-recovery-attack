Hi Victor,
Thanks a lot, now I can delete documents in the index. Very nice!!! But I
have another question: when I do an upload file how I can to replace
automatically the old one in the directory, and how to identify this file in
the index to delete it ? I need some help. Thanks in advance
Michel

You have IndexWriter opened while trying to delete document. Use IndexReader

to delete document and then open IndexWriter to optimize.
