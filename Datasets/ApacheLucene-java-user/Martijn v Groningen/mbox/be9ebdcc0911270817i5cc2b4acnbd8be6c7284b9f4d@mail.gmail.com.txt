http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html gives
a good introduction what happens under the hood of a search engine and
you can download it for free. It does not explain Lucene directly, but
a lot of IR algorithms that are used in Lucene (and any other search
engine) are explained. I found this book very helpful.
