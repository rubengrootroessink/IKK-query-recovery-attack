SUBJECT: [ERR] Only a type can be imported
DATE: 6 Dec 2009

Hello,
I am new in lucene project. I got the following error while trying to run
the project and test Search Criteria (results.jsp) . I added all jar files
to class path. I notified that QueryParser accept three argument while the
code only includes two arguments. So, I've changed the qp = new
QueryParser("contents", analyzer); to this one: qp = new
QueryParser(Version.LUCENE_
CURRENT,"contents", analyzer);  However, it still doesn't work. Please
somebody help me to get through this issue.
