Hi all,

To allow mutilple users concurrently add, delete docs and at the same time search the same
index, what should I watch out for in terms of initing indexreader, indexwriter and indexsearcher?

My application is getting various IOException (seek failed, permission denied, etc...) when
concurrent add/delete/search happens. Is there any general guidelines that you can share?
Thanks in advance!

Alex
