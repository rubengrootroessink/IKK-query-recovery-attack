SUBJECT: Lucene sorting case-sensitive by default?
DATE: 11 Jan 2008

Hi All,

 

I was searching my index with sorting on a field called "Label" which is
not tokenized, here is what came back:

 

Extended Sites Catalog Asset Store

Extended Sites Catalog Asset Store SALES

Print Catalog 2

Print catalog test

Test Print Catalog

Test refresh catalog

print test  3

test catalog 1

 

Looks like Lucene is separating upper case and lower case while sorting.
Can someone shed some light on this as to while this is happening and
how to fix it?

 

Thanks in advance for your help!

 

Alex
