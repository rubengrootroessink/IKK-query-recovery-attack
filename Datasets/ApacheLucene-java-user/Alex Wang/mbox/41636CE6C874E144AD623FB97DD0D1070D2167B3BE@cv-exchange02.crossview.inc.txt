SUBJECT: RE: Urgent Help Please: "Resource temporarily unavailable"
DATE: 6 Aug 2008

Sorry about the double posting. After sending the first email I got a delivery failure notice
from support@magentanews.com. I resent it just to be sure.

Unfornately there is no stack trace in the log. The error object was passed to log4j.error(...),
but no stack trace was printed out.

I thought both IndexReader and IndexWriter are thread safe. Beside, I have no explicit multi-threading
in our own code.

Thanks again!
