Thanks everyone for your replies! Guess I did not fully understand the
meaning of "natural order" in the Lucene Java doc.

To add another all-lower-case field for each sortable field in my index
is a little too much, since the app requires sorting on pretty much all
fields (over 100).

Toke, you mentioned "Using a Collator works but does take a fair amount
of memory", can you please elaborate a little more on that. Thanks.

Alex

As Tom points out, default sorting uses natural order. It's worth noting
that this implies that default sorting does not produce usable results
as soon as you use non-ASCII characters. Using a Collator works but does
take a fair amount of memory.
