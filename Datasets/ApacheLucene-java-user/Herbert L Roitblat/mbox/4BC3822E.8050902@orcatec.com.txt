SUBJECT: Re: How to get the tokens for a given document

Thanks David.
I think that I neglected to say that I am using pyLucene 2.4.0.

Your suggestion is almost what we're doing:

>indexReader.getTermFreqVector(ID, fieldName)

        self.hits = list(self.lSearcher.search(self.query))
        if self.hits:
            self.hit = lucene.Hit.cast_(self.hits[0])
            self.tfvs = self.lReader.getTermFreqVectors(self.hit.id)

At the very least, I may be able to reduce overhead by just adding the 
fieldName to the indexReader.

The problem I'm facing is that all of the tokens in all of the fields in 
all of the documents get added to the heap, and it runs out of space.  
I'm looking for other ways of getting the information I need that might 
not fill up the heap.

Thanks again.
Herb


Your other suggestion may also be what we end up doing.  Since our 
documents can be in any language, I will have to make sure that I use 
the right analyzer.

the tokens and their frequencies and the problem is that these stay in the heap as I move
from document to document.
