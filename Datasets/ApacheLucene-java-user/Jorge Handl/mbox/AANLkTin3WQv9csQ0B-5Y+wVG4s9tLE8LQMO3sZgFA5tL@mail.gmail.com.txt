I happen to be one of Indextank's developers, so I think I'm qualified to
answer your question! ;)
We do use a small portion of Lucene, namely the index file structure and
tokenizer, but not much else. We think lucene's inverted index is a good
implementation and didn't want to mess with tokenizers at this point, so we
didn't feel the need to replace those, although we might in the future.
