Mark --

Yes please! I'm very interested in the mixing of boolean and proximity
operators. I have also worked on a parser (using JavaCC) but haven't
managed to crack queries such as:

     ((a OR b) AND c) NEAR (d NOT e)

I can get the parse tree okay, but haven't figured out how to translate
that into a valid Lucene Query object. Simple queries such as:

     (a OR b) NEXT (c OR d)   // note the use of OR exclusively!

are okay, but nothing more complex. So: bring it on!
