Thank you, David, for your very interesting suggestions. As I said
earlier in this thread somewhere, we are still at the exploratory
stage (considering Lucene as a replacement for a commercial engine)
so it will be some time before I can get my hands dirty, but you have
certainly given me some good ideas. Answers to your questions are
below.

Users can save their own queries and set an alert on any of the saved
queries. As new documents get published (quite a few each day) they
are matched against the saved queries and emails are generated to let
people know that such-and-such an article was matched by one of their
saved queries.

The queries can achieve any level of complexity, as they are written by
users. There are certainly multiple fields, wildcards, sounds-like, phrase
matches, etc. etc.

While most of the incoming documents are relatively small (under 100 Kb),
some can be fairly large (500 Kb and more)
