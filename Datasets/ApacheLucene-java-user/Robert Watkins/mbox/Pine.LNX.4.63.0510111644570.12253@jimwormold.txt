SUBJECT: Re: wildcards within a phrase query
DATE: 11 Oct 2005

I was under the impression that PhrasePrefixQuery only worked in the
special case of the term that would otherwise be used in a PrefixQuery
coming at the end of the sequence of terms, as in:

   ( term )+ ( term as prefix )

but not where either a WildcardQuery or a PrefixQuery occurs anywhere
in the sequence of terms, such as:

   ( term | term as prefix )+

Am I missing something?
