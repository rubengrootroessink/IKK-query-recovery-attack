Okay, I only bought your book a few days ago, so I haven't read much
yet! Also, this project is still at the exploratory level, so very
little time has been dedicated to it (the irony is I am currently
spending most of my time trying to work around K2 ... issues). As
such, it will be some time before I get my hands dirty with actual
code (my finger tips are itching, however).

There are further complexities, also. For example, if a query includes
a field search, then it will be important not to match the name of the
field in a given document. I _don't_ think the solution will come by
simply indexing the queries as if they were short documents, but how
the commercial guys do it is (of course) a black box.

Thank you nonetheless for your ideas,
-- Robert
