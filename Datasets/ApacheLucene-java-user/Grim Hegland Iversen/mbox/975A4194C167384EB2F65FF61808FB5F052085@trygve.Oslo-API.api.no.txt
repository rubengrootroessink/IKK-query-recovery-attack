SUBJECT: Adding multiple paths to a document
DATE: 5 Mar 2002

I am looking at using lucene to index a large set of documents.  In
order to be able to search a subset of documents, I've added a
"path"-field to each document (indexed, not stored, not tokenized).
Using a prefix-query seems to work fine. 

My problem: Our documents can have several different paths pointing to
the same document, so I would like to add several paths to each
document, and be able to find the document using different
prefix-queries.

So my question: Is this accomplished simply by adding several fields to
the document by the same name ?

	  doc.add(new Field("path",
"/test/path1/misc"),false,true,false));
	  doc.add(new Field("path",
"/test/path2/misc"),false,true,false));

This seems to work, but I would like to know if it is the right way.
