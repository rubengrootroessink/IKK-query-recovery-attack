SUBJECT: Re[2]: strange behavior 4 query term boost
DATE: 28 Sep 2006

Found the reason, it is a bug IMHO.

The example should be:

A: term1^5 term2^6 term3^7
B: term1^5E-4 term2^6E-4 term3^7E-4
C: term1^0.0006 term2^0.0006 term3^0.0007

A & C suppose return the same rank
B is different

Since B will be parsed as: term1^5 E-4 term2^6 E-4 term3^7 E-4

The parser takes E-4 as another term.

Can someone help to log it as a "parsing bug" if we consider it as a
bug. Thanks.

Charlie
