SUBJECT: Index Field feeded from Reader that also stores cleartext
DATE: 3 Sep 2010

 Hi!

I'm working on an indexer that should process documents on hard-disk 
which are of arbitrary size and type. I use Apache Tika for plain text 
extraction which offers the feature to stream the parsers output through 
a reader.

My problem is following:
Is there a possibility to generate a document field that gets its data 
from an Reader-instance and where the plain text is also stored into the 
index (like the Store.YES field denotes)?
If I can't stream the data, memory usage is exceeding the limits of my 
machine.


Thanks for your help,
Gregor
