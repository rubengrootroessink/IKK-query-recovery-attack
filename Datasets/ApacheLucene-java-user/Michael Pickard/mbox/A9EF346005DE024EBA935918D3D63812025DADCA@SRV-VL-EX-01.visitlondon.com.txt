SUBJECT: Help needed with BooleanQuery formation
DATE: 25 Jan 2006

  
Can anyone help me with the formation of a BooleanQuery ?

I want a query of the form:

x AND ( a OR b OR c OR d)

 

The nearest I've managed to get is

 

query.add(new TermQuery(new Term(2, "x")),true,false);

Term term = null;

for (int i=1; i<numberOfNodes; i++){

term  = new Term(IndexLn2.CATEGORY_NODE, (String) nodes.get(i));

query.add(new TermQuery(term),false,false);

}

 

 

But this results in a query something similar to:

x AND a OR b OR c OR d

 

Close, but no cigar.

 

Thanks in advance,

Mike
