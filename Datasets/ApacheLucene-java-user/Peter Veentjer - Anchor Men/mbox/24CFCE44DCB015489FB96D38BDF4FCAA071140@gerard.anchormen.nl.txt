You could always batch a single document :)

At the moment I have a components that stores documents to write/delete
and is called once and a while. This makes it very easy to do batch
processing (and also makes it easier to deal with the concurrency
problems)

This is not possible onless you only process one single 
document at a time. After the document is writing you have to 
refresh the readed and find the document. Why do have such a
requirement? 
Are you afraid that a single document is indexed more than once? :)

In the platform for Lucene I have writen for all document it is very
very
Important that the index never contains two (or more)instances of the 
Same document. This is possible, even with doing batch updates :)

That is why batchupdating is invented :)

It is explained in that book ;)
