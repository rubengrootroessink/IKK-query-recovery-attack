DATE: 18 May 2005

 

My company would like to make the following contribution to Lucene (in
sandbox?) licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Background: While doing project work on a web-based search engine we
have developed a component called LuceneIndexAccessor. This component
provides a high-level index access interface, that is, it synchronizes
read/write access to a Lucene index. You no longer need to worry about
concurrently opening readers/writers/searchers. The component also does
caching where applicable. Further, it makes sure that all Searchers get
closed whenever you have added a document to the index.

>>Did you use a readwrite lock? If you did, do you know how the
performance of new readers is effected if a single write is processed?
??Every request for a reader has to wait untill the writer is finished..


I used this solution in the beginning but at the moment I use one that
doesn`t block at all.
