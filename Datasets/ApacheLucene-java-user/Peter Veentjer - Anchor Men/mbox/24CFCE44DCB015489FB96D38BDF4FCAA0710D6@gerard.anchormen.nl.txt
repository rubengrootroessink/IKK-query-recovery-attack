SUBJECT: document relations

Does someone know anything about document relations/closeness? I want to
see all documents related to a specific document. The relations can be
link relations (the other documents refer to that document). But the
relation could also be some kind of semantic relation. Does anybody have
some thought about this?

Met vriendelijke groet,
