SUBJECT: Library for easy write/read from Documents.
DATE: 12 Aug 2005

 
I`m currently developing a small library for easy reading/writing stuff
to and from the document. All primitives
(long,short,int,bool,byte,float,double,char) and non primitive Numbers
are supported, optionally they are compressed (a long doesn`t need 19
characters but only 2) and they are optionally lexographically and
lexographically compressed. 
 
I also have created a few functions that make it easy to insert text:
keywords, unstored, unindexed etc.
 
I would like to make this library public on a very short time (I`m
currently writing and testing it) and I`m wondering what is the best way
to add/give it to Lucene.

Met vriendelijke groet,
