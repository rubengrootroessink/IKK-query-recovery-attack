I have figured out that part the hard way ;) Why can`t I access my index
anymore?? Ahh.. The lock file

You can have more than 1 reader open at anytime. Even while a delete or
add is in progress. But you can`t use a reader where documents are
deleted (IndexReader) and added(IndexWriter) at the same time. If you
don`t have other threads doing delete/add you won`t have to synchronize
anything.

And how do you synchronize on it? I have applied the ReadWriteLock From
Doug Lea`s concurrency library after I have build my own 
synchronization brick and somebody pointed out that I was implementing
the ReadWriteLock. But at the moment I don`t do any synchronization.

And I want to have a component that is executed if the system is started
and knows that to do if there is rubbish in the index directory. I want
that component to restore my index to a usable version (and even small
loss of information is acceptable because everything is checked once and
a while. And user-added-information is going to be stored in the
database. So nothing gets lost. The index can be rebuild..

What happens to the Index if the IndexReader crashes, after I have
deleted
documents, and before I have called close. Are the deletes ignored? Is
the
Index screwed up? Is the filesystem screwed up (if a document is deleted
new
delete-files appear) so are the delete-files still there (and can these
be
ignored the next time?). Can I restore the index to the previous state,
just
by removing those delete-files?
