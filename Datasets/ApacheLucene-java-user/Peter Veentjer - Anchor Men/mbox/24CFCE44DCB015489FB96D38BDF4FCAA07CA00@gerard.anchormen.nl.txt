I have extracted the sources from another project and created a new one. You can download a
preliminary version here:
 
http://members.home.nl/peter-veentjer01/lucenefields.zip
 
There is a lot to do. Documentation, reading/writing of non primitives, a few primitives are
not quite finished. But I`m using parts of it in another projects and it works fine. I would
like to head what you think of it.

Subject: Library for easy write/read from Documents.




I`m currently developing a small library for easy reading/writing stuff
to and from the document. All primitives
(long,short,int,bool,byte,float,double,char) and non primitive Numbers
are supported, optionally they are compressed (a long doesn`t need 19
characters but only 2) and they are optionally lexographically and
lexographically compressed.

I also have created a few functions that make it easy to insert text:
keywords, unstored, unindexed etc.

I would like to make this library public on a very short time (I`m
currently writing and testing it) and I`m wondering what is the best way
to add/give it to Lucene.
