SUBJECT: finding all docs with field.
DATE: 16 Apr 2005

How can I find all documents with a field (the value doesn`t matter).
 
I have tried:
Query query = new TermQuery(new Term(AbstractBaseDoc.FIELD_INDEX_ERROR,""));
  
 
But this never finds results. The field with name FIELD_INDEX_ERROR has been of type Unindex,
Text, Keyword  but it doesn`t matter. 
 
I have checked the index with Luke, and I did find a document with the specified field.. So
there are documents.
