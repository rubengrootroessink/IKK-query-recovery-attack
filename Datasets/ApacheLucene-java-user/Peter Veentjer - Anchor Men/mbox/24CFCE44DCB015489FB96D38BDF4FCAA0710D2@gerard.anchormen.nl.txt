Yes.. I have to remove the documents I`m going to update from the

Ok, I understand why there are problems. But how can I fix this problem?
I have to update documents, so how can I do this without deleting
documents from the Reader? I don`t want to add the same document twice. 

This is a problem many users of Lucene will face.. Could you please add
a good explanation to the FAQ?
