SUBJECT: how to get newest library version?
DATE: 23 Aug 2005

Does anyone know how I can download the newest version of Lucene from the SVN? I have been
trying (even the website) but I only get timeouts. I would even be happy with a newly build
jar (based on the newest sources). So I help someone can help me out so I can remove a MultiFieldQueryParser
bug out of the system that should have been removed on the newest version (and troubles)
