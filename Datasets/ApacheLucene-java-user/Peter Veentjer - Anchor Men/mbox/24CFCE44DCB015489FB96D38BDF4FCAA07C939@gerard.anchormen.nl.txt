SUBJECT: how to create a long lasting unique key?
DATE: 4 Jan 2005

What is the best way to create a key for a document? I know the id (from hits) can not be used,
but what is a good way to create a key

I need this key for a webapplication. At the moment every document can be identified with
the filelocation key, but I would rather some kind of integer for the Job (nobody needs to
know the file location).
