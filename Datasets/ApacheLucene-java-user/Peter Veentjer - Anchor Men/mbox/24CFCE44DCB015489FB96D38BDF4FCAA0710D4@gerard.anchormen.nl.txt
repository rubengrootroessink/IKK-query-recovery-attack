You could buy the ebook from Manning.. It only costs $22,50 and that
makes 16 euro :)

I have bought it there.. 2 minutes later I was reading it.

Sorry if this is the wrong forum but I wondered what's happened to
'Lucene In Action' in the UK.  Looking forward to reading it but
amazon.co.uk report it as a 'hard to find' item and are now quoting a
4-6 week delivery time and  tacking on a rare book charge.  Amazon.com
are quoting shipping in 24hrs.  Is this a new 'Boston Tea Party'? 

cheers

David
