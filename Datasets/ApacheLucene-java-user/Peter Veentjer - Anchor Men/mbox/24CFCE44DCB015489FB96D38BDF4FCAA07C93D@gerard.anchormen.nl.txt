SUBJECT: what if the IndexReader crashes, after delete, before close.
DATE: 8 Jan 2005

What happens to the Index if the IndexReader crashes, after I have deleted documents, and before
I have called close. Are the deletes ignored? Is the Index screwed up? Is the filesystem screwed
up (if a document is deleted new delete-files appear) so are the delete-files still there
(and can these be ignored the next time?). Can I restore the index to the previous state,
just by removing those delete-files?
