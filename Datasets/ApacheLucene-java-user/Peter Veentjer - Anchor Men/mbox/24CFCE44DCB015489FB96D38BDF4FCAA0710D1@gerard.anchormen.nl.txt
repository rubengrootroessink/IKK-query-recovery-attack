There are no problems searching while indexing.  How are you
experiencing otherwise?  What error do you get?

I have experienced (lock) problems if I use a Reader and Writer (on the
same index-directory) at the same time. My application is multithreaded
(a pool of worker threads for the webrequests) and a scheduledworker
thread for signaling changes (new (normal) files, changed files and
removed files) and updating the index.

And I`m not the only one experiencing this problem... It ( Reader and
Writer open at the same time) has been mentioned on mailinglist quite a
few times.

A possible solution I have seen is creating a shadow-index and switching
the reader to that index if the writer is finished. But I don`t
understand while a Reader and Writer can not be opened on the same
directory... On the same time.
