You will need a list, but you may not need to make it manually (look at 
WordNet, I'm not saying that it will have this exact example you just 
gave, but it has many others which would at least cut down your workload.)

I would do this by extending QueryParser and overriding the relevant 
methods.  It will be somewhat more difficult to handle phrase queries 
since the number of permutations will increase as the number of words in 
the phrase increases.  But at least it would give you a way to do it 
without actually performing multiple searches.
