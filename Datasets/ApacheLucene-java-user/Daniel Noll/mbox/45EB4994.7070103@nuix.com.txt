It doesn't "cache" the results, but what happens is the underlying 
IndexReader effectively sees no changes for its lifetime (this is 
presumably for safety; since usually you don't want the index changing 
underneath while trying to do queries.)

Yep.  Close the IndexSearcher and the IndexReader, and reopen them.

If you need to do queries quite often then it probably makes sense to do 
this only every now and then.
