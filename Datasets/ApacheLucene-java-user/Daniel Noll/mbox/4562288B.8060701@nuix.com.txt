How efficient is this for huge wildcard queries?  e.g. "a*"

At the moment we highlight our terms by using for instance, 
WildcardQuery#getEnum(IndexReader), and only storing the strings which 
it returns, whereas I would assume Query#rewrite(IndexReader) would take 
up much more memory.

Range queries are another one... try querying for a range from a to zzzz 
and see what happens. :-)
