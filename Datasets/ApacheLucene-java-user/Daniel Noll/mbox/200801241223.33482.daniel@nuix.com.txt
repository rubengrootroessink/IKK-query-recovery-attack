SUBJECT: field:* query type, and prefix queries
DATE: 24 Jan 2008

Hi all...

Just out of interest, why does field:* go via getWildcardQuery instead of 
getPrefixQuery?  It seems to me that it should be treated as a prefix of "", 
but am I missing something important?

Also, I've noticed that although RangeQuery was optimised in a recent version 
of Lucene, PrefixQuery is still quite slow even though any prefix query and 
range query both walk through a list of adjacent terms.  I would expect them 
to take about the same amount of time to run if covering the same terms.

Daniel
