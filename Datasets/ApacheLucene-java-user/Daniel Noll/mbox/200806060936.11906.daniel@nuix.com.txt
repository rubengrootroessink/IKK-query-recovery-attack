Well... technically encoding is out of the scope of Lucene since we're passing 
in a Reader.

I have to say though, analysing with the most naive analyser possible (the 
default one with no stop words and no stemming) works well enough.

Language detection isn't at a point where it's reliable enough to use to 
determine which analyser to use automatically.
