If I were analysing a URI, I would not be using StandardAnalyser, but 
something that splits only on what is special for a URI.  You wouldn't 
even want to break on a hyphen, normally.

In your case, you are breaking it up already so you could just make that 
your analyser.  Or if you want to keep breaking it up before it gets put 
into Lucene, wouldn't a trivial analyser which breaks on commas be the 
way to go?
