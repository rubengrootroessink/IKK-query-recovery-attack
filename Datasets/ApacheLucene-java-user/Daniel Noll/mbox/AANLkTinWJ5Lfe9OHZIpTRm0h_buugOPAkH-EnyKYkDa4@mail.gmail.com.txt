It does sound like a good idea to not permit a null doc ID set, since
there is a convenient constant for the empty result anyway. :-)

And actually, it turns out that we were returning null due to a
legitimate problem, which makes it an even better idea to prohibit
returning null.  I already changed all the other places where we were
"conforming to the API" ( ;-) ) to return EMPTY_DOCIDSET anyway.

This leaves me with an even bigger mystery though, which will probably
result in another post sooner or later.
