Is this true about the 64-bit JVM not working on Intel?  I was under the 
impression that it supported the AMD64 instruction set, and that Intel's 
64-bit processors basically cloned AMD's instruction set.

I really hope this isn't the case, because it's going to be one hell of 
a caveat if we end up telling customers "yes, we support 64-bit AMD, but 
not 64-bit Intel."
