I would say that the libs work great but are slow.

One problem is that they don't provide a Java API.  The "Java" API they 
provide is sample code which calls a native executable, not even a JNI 
library.  So you pay the penalty of that native app starting up every 
time you extract a document.

If all you want is the plain text, for many document types it's actually 
fairly fast, and beats having to write code for every document type 
yourself (or locating libraries to do it for you.)  But as soon as you 
want the marked up text, it becomes a completely different story.  We 
benchmarked it to be something like 10 times slower to handle markup 
than handling raw text and metadata.  Most of this extra time was spent 
parsing the XML it outputs, which is often far more verbose than it 
needs to be for the amount of formatting it actually contains.
