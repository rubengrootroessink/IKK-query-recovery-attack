It's true that you can combine multiple indexes, but don't make 
assumptions that this lets you break the limitation.  MultiReader still 
extends from IndexReader, and IndexReader still uses ints for the 
document IDs so there's no way you'll be increasing the maximum number 
of documents even if you combine indexes.
