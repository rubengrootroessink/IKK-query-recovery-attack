You'll find they both go through getFieldQuery() as-is.  The default 
implementation of that runs the string through the analyser; if it happens to 
return more than one token then it will create a PhraseQuery instead of a 
TermQuery.

If you subclass QueryParser than you can override this method and modify it to 
do whatever evil trick you want to do.
