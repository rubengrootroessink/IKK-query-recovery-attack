I'm not even convinced it would be tricky.  I'm fairly sure that if the token 
stream returns two terms over the same span, that they would have the same 
start offset and end offset and highlight identically.

What *would* be tricky is phrase queries since inserting a new term breaks the 
offsets AFAIK.

Although, I suppose you could always store the concepts in a different field 
and not modify the analyser being used for the text itself.
