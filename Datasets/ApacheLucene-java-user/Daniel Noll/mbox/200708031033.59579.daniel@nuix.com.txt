You can't store strings in a BitSet.

What I would do is return a List<String> but make a custom subclass of 
AbstractList<String> which creates the strings on demand from the Hits 
object.  We use similar tricks to convert Hits into a List of another more 
complex object type and it works great.  You can cache the strings as they're 
retrieved if you're planning to use some strings much more than others.
