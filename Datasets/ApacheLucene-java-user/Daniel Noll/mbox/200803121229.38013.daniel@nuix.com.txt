Ah, my bad.  It happens with both merge schedulers actually, but not during 
normal merges during the indexing, only with optimize().  Also, we're not 
adding docs after calling optimize either.  We're adding them all and merging 
along the way, and then calling optimize() once at the end.  If I comment out 
that one call to optimize() the problem seems to go away entirely.  Although 
to be honest it was happening once before and it looked like it went away, 
and we only just discovered it had returned.

Attached.

I have filtered out lines in the log which indicated an exception adding the 
document; these occur when our Reader throws an IOException and there were so 
many that it bloated the file.
