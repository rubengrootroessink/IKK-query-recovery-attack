You could probably subclass QueryParser to do something like this.

The naive way would be to have the subclass build a BooleanQuery as you 
mentioned already.  A less naive way would be to create a 
MultiFieldTermQuery which extends from MultiTermQuery, and does the 
enumeration over the fields which match the prefix.  You'd probably need 
to do the same for phrases though which would be more difficult. :-)
