SUBJECT: "Deleting" documents without deleting them
DATE: 16 Mar 2010

Hi all.

I'm trying to implement a form of document deletion where the previous
versions are kept around forever ( a primitive form of versioning) but
excluded from the search results.

I notice that after calling IndexWriter.deleteDocuments, even if you
close and reopen the index, the documents are still accessible using
document(int) but are returned from queries, which is exactly the
behaviour I want.  However, if I call optimize() they will obviously
be obliterated.

My question is: as long as I never call optimize() -- will the deleted
documents hang around forever, or will a merge due to adding the new
documents eventually cause them to be removed?

If they will be removed then I need some other way to avoid them being
returned.  I was thinking of actually *not* deleting them, but
maintaining a giant filter - I could store this filter on disk but
it's going to be pretty large even if I use a BitSet. :-(   Is there
any other way to go about it?

Daniel
