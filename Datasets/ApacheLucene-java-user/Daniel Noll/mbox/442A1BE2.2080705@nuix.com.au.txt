To answer my own question, I've just discovered that LOCK_DIR is public 
on FSDirectory, and that setting it to null makes it use the index 
directory as the means of storage.

My instant guess as to why it's not stored in the text index itself, is 
that it might have been done to support read-only text indexes.  (Or 
perhaps not... a read-only directory doesn't have to worry so much about 
getting into inconsistencies.  If you can't modify files, you can't 
cause conflicts.)

I've also discovered that Lucene is using createNewFile() to perform 
locking (the JavaDoc for said method says that it shouldn't be used for 
locking.)  Luckily the makeLock() method is overridable so we could 
easily avoid that issue without modifying Lucene.
