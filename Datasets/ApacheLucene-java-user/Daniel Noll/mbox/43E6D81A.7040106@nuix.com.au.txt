You can definitely use Lucene's analyser classes without indexing.  Our 
own application does this when it needs to do things like highlighting 
text on the screen.

The idea would be you'd have a bunch of terms which are considered 
nasty, and then every new document would get analysed, and you would 
look through the terms returned from the analyser for the suspicious ones.

But no, it certainly isn't something that Lucene as a whole is very good 
at solving.  Lucene is fast for executing a single query against 
multiple documents, but what you really need is something fast for 
executing multiple queries against a single document.
