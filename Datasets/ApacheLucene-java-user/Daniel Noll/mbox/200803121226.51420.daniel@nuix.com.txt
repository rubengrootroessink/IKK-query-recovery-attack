From memory it was around a factor of 10 times slower to use a text field for 
this; I haven't tested it recently and the case of retrieving the Document 
should be slightly faster now that we have FieldSelector, but it certainly 
won't be faster as to get the document you need the ID in the first place.

For single documents it wasn't a problem, the use cases are:
  1. Bulk database operations based on the matched documents.
  2. Creating a filter BitSet based on a database query.

Effectively this is required because Lucene offered no way to update a 
Document after it was indexed; if it had that feature we would never have 
needed a database. ;-)
