I suppose one could work around that by prepending the language code to 
every token.  Then those two words won't match each other, while 
stemming is preserved.

The real problem as I see it is when two languages have an *identical* 
word, and the user types that in as their search query.  Then you have 
to wonder which language it's from... perhaps you would just expand this 
to match multiple languages in the event of multiple matches.  Or 
perhaps you would just add a little drop-down to the place they enter 
their query, where they can indicate what language the query is in.
