Following Wikipedia's explanation, McDonald's -> McDonald, by removing 
the apostrophe *AND* the s.  That text you quoted doesn't say that you 
can omit the apostrophe while leaving in the s, so my guess is they're 
using the exact same analyser.

In any case, have you tried using stemming?  Stemming would convert 
"mcdonalds" -> "mcdonald" so that both work.
