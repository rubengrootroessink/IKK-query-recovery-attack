That's not quite an accurate description of what it does as it nowhere 
near as slow as doing a query for each term one by one, but yes, it's 
inefficient.  You can use a PrefixFilter to do much the same thing in a 
somewhat quicker fashion, although it still takes a little more time 
than having a new field.

This may help if adding a new field is impractical (e.g. if you have to 
support older text indexes.)
