One method might be using the explain method on the Weight interface to 
get an Explanation object, but I'm not sure how many semantics the 
explanation carries.  It will certainly tell you which branches of your 
query resulted in the the document matching, and if you're using a 
simple BooleanQuery to perform this multiple field matching, then that 
may be enough.
