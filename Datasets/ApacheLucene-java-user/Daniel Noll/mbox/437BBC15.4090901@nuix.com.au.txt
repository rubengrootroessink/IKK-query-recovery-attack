I actually did throw a lot of terms in, and eventually chose "one" for 
the tests because it was the slowest query to complete of them all 
(hence I figured it was already spending some fairly long time in I/O, 
and would be penalised the most.)  Every other query was around 7ms 
before tweaking, and the tweak increased them all to somewhere around 
10ms but that's still a lot faster than "one" was even at its fastest.
