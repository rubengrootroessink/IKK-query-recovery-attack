We have similar index modification notification in our own application, 
though we use it to keep track of the state of indexing (when the index 
is saved, we save other files, mainly a queue which tracks what is yet 
to be processed.)

One thing you'll probably notice pretty soon is that the index writer 
keeps a whole lot of segments in-memory (in order to be so fast.)  So 
not every document added to the index will necessarily result in a write 
to disk.

What we did for ours is to make a new class extending IndexWriter, 
overriding this method:

    public void addDocument(Document doc, Analyzer analyzer) throws 
IOException
    {
        long lastUpdate = segmentsFile.lastModified();
        if (lastUpdate > lastRecordedUpdate)
        {
            fireSegmentsMerged();
           
            lastRecordedUpdate = lastUpdate;
        }
    }

Of course I've omitted all the event firing, adding/removing listeners, 
and so forth, we've just used standard JavaBeans event handling for all 
of this.

It's dirty, but it works.  If there's a better way, I'm definitely 
interested in hearing what it is. :-D

Note though, opening an index can be expensive.  It might not be 
particularly good for performance if you expect the index to be modified 
quite often... accepting a bit of lag between adding entries and having 
them available can help performance a lot.
