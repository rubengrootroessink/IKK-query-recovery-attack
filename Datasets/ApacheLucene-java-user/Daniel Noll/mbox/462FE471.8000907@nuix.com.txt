I guess you could solve some of these by stemming (actually, lemmatising 
is probably more accurate, since you'll almost certainly need part of 
speech information to do it with any accuracy) to the wordnet number, 
for which the meaning is unique.

But there are still ambiguous sentences where you don't know which word 
it is.  To use the example just given, "I saw wood" is pretty ambiguous, 
without having more context.
