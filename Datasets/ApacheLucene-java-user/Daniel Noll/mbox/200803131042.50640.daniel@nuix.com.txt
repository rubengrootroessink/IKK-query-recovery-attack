Aha.  Under 2.2, a failure would result in nothing being added to the text 
index so this would explain the problem.  It would also explain why smaller 
data sets are less likely to cause the problem (it's less likely for there to 
be an error in it.)

Workarounds?
  - flush() after any IOException from addDocument()  (overhead?)
  - use ++ to determine the next document ID instead of
    index.getWriter().docCount()  (out of sync after an error but fixes itself
    on optimize().
  - Use a field for a separate ID (slower later when reading the index)
  - ???
