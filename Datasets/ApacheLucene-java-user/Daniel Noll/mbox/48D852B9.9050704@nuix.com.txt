Certainly I found LUCENE-461 during my search, and certainly grouping 
together the words is a lot better *if* there are spaces between them. 
Although in several cases I have found there are no spaces, it's 
relatively rare and the way it's breaking it now appears to produce 
better hits than when it was separating them out.

Really I was just wondering about the digits being mixed in.  Maybe it's 
legitimate to have a digit in the middle of a sequence of Hangul, like 
when we have AB3F for a product code with Latin characters.

You're right though, to do differently it will require a lot of jiggery 
to restrict ranges down to each language again instead of using 
[:letter:] which is much more convenient.
