See TermInfosReader.

It loads the .tii file into memory, which contains one in every N 
entries of the .tis file and points into the real locations in the .tis 
file.

When Lucene looks for a term, it does a binary search through this 
reduced index to find which segment of the .tis file the term is in, and 
then scans through the .tis file linearly until it finds the term.
