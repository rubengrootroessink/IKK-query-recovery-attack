I wish the two would collaborate though.  It's true that POI contains 
code for writing which isn't necessary for indexing.  But it's also true 
that POI contains code for extracting images, which for many projects 
*is* necessary.

It's not too difficult though:

   doc.getTextTable().getTextPieces();

Downside of that approach is that some of the text you get back isn't 
"text" in the sense that you might expect.  (I consider it an upside 
myself, because sometimes it's good to find all this otherwise hidden text.)
