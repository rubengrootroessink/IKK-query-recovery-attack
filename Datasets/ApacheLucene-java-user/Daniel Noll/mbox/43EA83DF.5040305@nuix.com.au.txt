I don't know how this will be for efficiency.  If you did it that way, 
you would have to re-open the index for every single document you add, 
otherwise you might miss a duplicate which was added recently.

Really it depends when you need to know that it's a duplicate.  If you 
don't need to know right away, then you might as well use a query.  If 
you need to know right away, then you're better off keeping some other 
store of which IDs and names have been added, like an SQL database.
