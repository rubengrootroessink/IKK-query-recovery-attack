You probably don't need to implement it, it's been implemented already.
 Just call the method.

I'm not sure because I've never used QueryTermVector before, but the
fact that QueryTermVector doesn't take an IndexReader as a parameter is
a good indication that it can't tell you anything about the frequency of
the term in your documents.
