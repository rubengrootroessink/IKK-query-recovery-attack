Not exactly.  It will fuse the indexes together such that things like TermEnum 
will merge the ones from the real indexes, and will search using those 
composite enumerations.

That's what the code seems to indicate.

Different analysers means a different query parser for each index.  If the 
resulting Query object is the same for all indexes though, there's no 
problem.  The problem occurs when the query does get rewritten by a filter.

That being said, doing a parse query / search in parallel isn't exactly 
difficult.  Look at how ParallelMultiSearcher does it and copy it.
