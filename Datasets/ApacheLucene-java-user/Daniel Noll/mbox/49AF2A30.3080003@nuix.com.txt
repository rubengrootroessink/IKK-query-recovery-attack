Surely this would be equivalent to a PrefixQuery with a prefix of "". 
Assuming the query parser is well behaved (I can no longer remember 
whether the default one is or not), field:* should create one.

This is assuming you have already indexed the data.  If you can reindex 
then clearly adding a placeholder value for "no content" is more efficient.
