I asked a similar thing in the past about term highlighting in general, 
and apparently it's just as fast to get all terms and then highlight 
those terms in your text, as it is to determine which terms are in the 
text without looking at the text, and then highlight those.

The terms which aren't in the text just won't result in any highlights.
