What makes more sense (at least the way I see it) is to implement a 
Reader which returns the text you need from the XML.  This sort of thing 
is relatively simple to do with the newer StAX API.  You can have your 
reader return even small chunks of text, and it should perform okay as 
long as you have a BufferedReader wrapped around the entire thing.
