Unless you define what "linked with" actually means it's going to be 
hard to offer suggestions, but have you looked at ParallelReader?

If that won't do what you want then the better way to approach this is 
to explain what you're actually trying to *do*, rather than asking for 
advice on how to implement one possibility of doing it.
