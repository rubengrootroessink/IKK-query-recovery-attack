SUBJECT: IndexReader method semantics
DATE: 20 Apr 2007

Hi all.

I'm considering making a kind of IndexReader where each time terms() is 
called it might return a different sequence even though the reader 
hasn't been reopened.

Would that kind of thing conceivably cause problems anywhere else in the 
framework?  Which is to ask, do other parts of the framework implement 
their own caching of the TermEnum, or is all the caching implemented in 
the reader and TermEnum implementations?

Daniel
