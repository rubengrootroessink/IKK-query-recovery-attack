What DateField does is to convert the date to milliseconds and then to a 
base 36 number, and then it pads the string out so that all date strings are 
the same length.  So no matter what Calendar you happen to have used to 
build up your Date, it would work correctly and sort in the correct fashion.

Strings on the other hand would never work since when you search a date 
range in one calendar it wouldn't correctly return results in the other 
calendar, which would generally be undesirable behaviour (but maybe in your 
application you need it to omit results when they're in the wrong calendar.)
