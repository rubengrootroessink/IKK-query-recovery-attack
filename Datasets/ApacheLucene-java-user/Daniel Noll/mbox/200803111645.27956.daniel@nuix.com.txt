SUBJECT: Document ID shuffling under 2.3.x (on merge?)
DATE: 11 Mar 2008

Hi all.

We're using the document ID to associate extra information stored outside 
Lucene.  Some of this information is being stored at load-time and some 
afterwards; later on it turns out the information stored at load-time is 
returning the wrong results when converting the database contents back into a 
BitSet for filtering.

Using version 2.2.x doesn't appear to cause the problem, so I have been 
wondering if something happened in 2.3.x to change the document IDs.  Having 
already looked to try and determine this myself, it doesn't appear to be 
reordering them in DocumentsWriter, but perhaps there is some subtle 
side-effect of the way segments are merged which has caused this?

Daniel
