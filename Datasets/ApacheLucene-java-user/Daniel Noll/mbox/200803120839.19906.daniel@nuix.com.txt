That was my first thought, but SerialMergeScheduler doesn't cause the problem.  
I've done a little more investigation since; it turns out that if I don't 
call optimize() then the problem doesn't occur.

Could it be that optimize(int,boolean) is storing the segments to optimise in 
a HashSet, which by its nature reorders the segments?

As far as that, we assume that if there are N documents in the index then the 
next document ID will be N (we determine this before adding the document.)  
As we're only doing this in a single thread and we never delete documents, 
this was previously safe.
