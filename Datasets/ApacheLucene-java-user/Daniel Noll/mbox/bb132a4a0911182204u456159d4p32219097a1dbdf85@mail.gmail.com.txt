This sounds interesting.

I take it the existing numeric fields can't already do stuff like
this?  (We don't have access to them yet anyway for backwards
compatibility reasons, otherwise I would have looked into it.  But
next major version...)

For now I am writing a routine which subdivides the term space until
it thinks it's down to some size which is small enough to use
iteration instead of seeking (which seems to be in the realm of
100,000 ~ 1,000,000 terms -- but the hard thing is guessing how many
terms would be either side of the split.)
