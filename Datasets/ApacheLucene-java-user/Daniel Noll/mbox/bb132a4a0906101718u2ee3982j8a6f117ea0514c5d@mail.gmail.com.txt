I would rewrite it to this:

cool gaming computer "cool gaming" "gaming computer" "cool gaming computer"

Naively assuming a score of 1.0 for each hit, you would get something like...
 1. "cool gaming laptop"    => 3 (cool, gaming, "cool gaming")
 2. "cool gaming lappy"    => 3 (cool, gaming, "cool gaming")
 3. "gaming laptop cool"    => 2 (cool, gaming)

And of course if it actually finds "cool gaming computer" it would get 6.
