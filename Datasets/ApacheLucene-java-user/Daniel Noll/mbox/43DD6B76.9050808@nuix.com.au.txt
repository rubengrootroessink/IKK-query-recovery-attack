Ah.  Okay, sorry about that.  The only response I saw was the one about 
JRockit supporting it.

True enough.  At the moment our most likely move is to support Sun's 
64-bit JVM on Windows, but not other vendors' JVMs (i.e., we'll support 
whatever JVMs we redistribute with our own app.)  Of course, this will 
only come once we claim to support 64-bit hardware... I'm sure there are 
many things still yet to be done there, such as making sure all our JNI 
libraries will compile properly for 64-bit Windows.
