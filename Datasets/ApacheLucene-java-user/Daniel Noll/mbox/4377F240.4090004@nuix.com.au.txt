Excellent, that looks like exactly what we're after.  Now, to figure out 
how to set it.

There's no setter that I can see... then again it may be in trunk, and 
just not in the version we're stuck on for the time being.  I can always 
add it as we've patched so much other stuff.

I think though, that I will need a setter on the reader, rather than the 
writer.  That is, I don't know what factor we want until I know how 
large the index is.  And I don't know how large the index will be at the 
time of creating the writer, but I can just ask for maxDoc() at the time 
of opening the reader.

I can't see the obvious place to put such things on the reader end, though.
