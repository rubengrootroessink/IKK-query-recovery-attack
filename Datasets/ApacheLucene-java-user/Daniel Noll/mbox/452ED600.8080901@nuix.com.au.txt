What I'm doing for our application is to advise users to put in the 
parentheses.  It's cheesy, but safe.

What I would do if the application were relatively new is to advise 
against using AND/OR/NOT, and using + and - instead since it seems that 
syntax is relatively reliable.  Actually I would probably consider 
removing the AND/OR/NOT syntax from the query parser itself.
