We're using 1.4.2.

The minimalist example:

public class Test {
   public static void main() throws Exception {
     QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("text",
                                          new StandardAnalyzer()) {
       protected Query getBooleanQuery(Vector clauses)
           throws ParseException {
         System.out.println("getBooleanQuery called");
         return super.getBooleanQuery(clauses);
       }
     };
     parser.parse("-foo");
   }
}

Output of this will be:
getBooleanQuery called

If it isn't being called in your application, the likelihood is that 
you're not using the overridden query parser at all.
