 From TFJD:
    Return an array of term frequency vectors for the specified document.
    The array contains a vector for each vectorized field in the
    document.  Each vector contains terms and frequencies for all terms
    in a given vectorized field.  If no such fields existed, the method
    returns null.

i.e. you may not have stored the term vectors when indexing the data.
