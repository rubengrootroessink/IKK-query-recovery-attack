This would make sense only if you're planning to do some kind of text 
search over the configuration.  Otherwise, you're better off just 
keeping configuration somewhere else.

Updating a text index when a configuration element changes is a less 
than pretty operation, whereas using the Preferences API is reasonably sane.
