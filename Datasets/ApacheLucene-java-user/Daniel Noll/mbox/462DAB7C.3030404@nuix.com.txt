Yeah, in our use case the documents are never deleted (when your data is 
evidence it's not a good idea to delete any. ;-))

Our database already keys on Lucene IDs, a decision made ages ago for 
performance reasons; calling hits.doc(i) is much slower than hits.id(i) 
plus we're trying to build filters based of database records where the 
indexes are huge so it wasn't very practical to keep reading documents.
