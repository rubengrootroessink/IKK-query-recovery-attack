Basically I'm thinking of writing a different kind of IndexReader which 
uses a database to return fake terms for things like tags.  The idea 
would be that it can be slotted in alongside a real index via 
ParallelReader in order to provide the fast-changing part.  So it would 
be possible to implement real queries on a database rather than the 
approach at present which is to use filters and ConstantScoreQuery.

It's going to be highly experimental anyway.

That sounds like a good thing since it means the tags changing *during* 
the query might not upset things (this was my other concern about trying 
to do something crazy like this.)
