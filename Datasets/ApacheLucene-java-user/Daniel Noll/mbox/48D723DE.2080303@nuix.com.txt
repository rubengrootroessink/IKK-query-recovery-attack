SUBJECT: StandardTokenizer and Korean grouping with alphanum
DATE: 22 Sep 2008

Hi all.

I have a question about Korean tokenisation.  Currently there is a rule 
in StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex which looks like this:

ALPHANUM   = ({LETTER}|{DIGIT}|{KOREAN})+

I'm wondering if there was some good reason why it isn't:

ALPHANUM   = (({LETTER}|{DIGIT})+|{KOREAN}+)

Basically I'm seeing some tokens come back with mixed digits and Hangul, 
and I'm questioning the correctness of that.

Disclaimer: we're not performing any further processing of Korean in 
subsequent filters at the current point in time, and I don't know the 
language either.

Daniel
