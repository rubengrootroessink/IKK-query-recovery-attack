Why didn't you switch the IndexSearcher when you were done with the 
second index?
When you are done reindexing in the second directory, your queries 
switch from the IndexSearcher that
performed its searches on the old index, to the new IndexSearcher 
pointing to the new index.
This way, no locks on the search threads, the threads that had a search 
going will finish it on the old index.
Next time you index you use the old directory again, and so on.
