Hi Ian,

Your problem doesn't seem to be Lucene (not yet, at least ;-) ), but 
JBuilder. You just need to find the way in JBuilder to feed arguments to 
your program.

Usage: java class org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles <root_directory>

only means that the application IndexFiles expects an argument pointing to your document root
directory.

I hope this helps a little
