SUBJECT: Problem with reverse ordering
DATE: 27 Feb 2006

Hi,
I have an index with some fields, one of them is a String representing a 
date in the format yyyyMMddHHmmss.
I store this field as a Keyword to be sortable.

My problem is that I obtain the results in the same order with
Hits hits = is.search(query, new Sort("formatted-date"));
than
Hits hits = is.search(query, new Sort("formatted-date", true));


doen anyone why this could be happening?

Thanks
