SUBJECT: Can changes on an index be visible to an open IndexSearcher without reopening it?
DATE: 5 Nov 2007

Hi,
I have an application using Lucene 2.2.0 that opens an IndexSearcher only once to optimize
performance, because opening the index is a heavy operation. My question is, if I modify the
index with an IndexWriter or IndexModifier, is there any way for the changes to be visible
to the opened IndexSearcher without reopening it?

Thanks
