I think I found it.

I must do a query an then loop through the hits to obtain the id with 
hit.id(int n).

If anyone knows any better way...

Thanks

Hi,
I've been reading Lucene documentation and I see there are two ways of 
deleting a document from an index: by id and by term.

Supose I have an index with three fields: field1, field2 and field3, and I 
want to delete all documents with field1=value1 and field2=value2.
I think I must use deletion by Id, but I don't know how to obtain the Id of 
the documents I want to delete.

Thanks
