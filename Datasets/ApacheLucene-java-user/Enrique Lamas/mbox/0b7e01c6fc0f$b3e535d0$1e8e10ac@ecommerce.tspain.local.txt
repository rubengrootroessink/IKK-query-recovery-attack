SUBJECT: How do I obtain the document id in order to delete from index?
DATE: 30 Oct 2006

Hi,
I've been reading Lucene documentation and I see there are two ways of deleting a document
from an index: by id and by term.

Supose I have an index with three fields: field1, field2 and field3, and I want to delete
all documents with field1=value1 and field2=value2.
I think I must use deletion by Id, but I don't know how to obtain the Id of the documents
I want to delete.

Thanks
