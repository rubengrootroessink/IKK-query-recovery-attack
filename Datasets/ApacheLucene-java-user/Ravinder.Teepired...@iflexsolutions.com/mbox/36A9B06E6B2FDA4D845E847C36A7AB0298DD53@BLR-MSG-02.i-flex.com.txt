Hi John,

I am getting Summary value null in results.jsp page and I need "snippet"
or "fragment" to be highlighted. 
I have gone through lucene faqs related but it's not clear. I will
appreciate if you help me to find list of files (Java) to be modified.

Thanks in advance.
Ravinder

Ravinder,

If you want something from an index it has to be IN the index. So, store
a
summary field in each document and make sure that field is part of the
query.

Hi All,

 

Is there a way to get a text summary of an indexed document to display
along with the search result?

Please let me know the technical changes.

 

Thanks,

Ravinder
