Thx for the pointer to your code. It's a smart approach even it not related
to Lucene only.

I guess terms will only be took into the corpus when the search found
results at least once for that term (and removed if no more results were
found).

Persisting the corpus has to be done, but should be no problem.

It should be possible to weight the terms by number of searches or number of
results too i guess.

If i dont find a way to ask the lucene index directly or if that gives a
performance problem, i will give your Trie a try...

Mark
