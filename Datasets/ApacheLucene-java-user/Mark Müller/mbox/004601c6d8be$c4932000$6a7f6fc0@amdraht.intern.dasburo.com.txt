SUBJECT: Lucene Suggest ?
DATE: 15 Sep 2006

Hi all,
I like to know if it is possible to let make Lucene Suggestions while the
user types in the search query.

Like in Google Suggest: http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en

I just need to send with AJAX the part of the word the user already typed
and get back the list of matching terms. Even better would be if the number
of occurrences would be show at well.

Is there a function for that in the Lucene API ?

Thanks in Advance,
Mark
