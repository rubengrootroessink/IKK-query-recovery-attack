Hi,

We have the requirement for an "i'm feeling lucky" button, at least sort of. Whereas google
just delivers the first record in a result set, we should deliver 10 arbitrary hits chosen
out of, let's say, 1000. All of these documents have the same importance i.e. have the same
weight.

So, is there an elegant way with the Lucene API to achieve this? Or do we need to retrieve
all 1000 docs first, to do a random selection on our own afterwards? That appears to be quite
expensive.

Thanks for any hint,
-- Juerg
