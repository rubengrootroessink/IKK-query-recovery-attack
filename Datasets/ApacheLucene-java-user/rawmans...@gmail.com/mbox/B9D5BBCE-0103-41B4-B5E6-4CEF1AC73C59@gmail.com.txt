SUBJECT: Random sorting results
DATE: 21 Mar 2009

Hi,
In the search application I'm working on I would like to prevent the  
user from getting always the same search results for a certain query,  
but  without affecting results quality too much.
In order to do so I'm processing the hits in smaller chunks and doing  
some random shuffle inside the chunk
For example, If I have a 1000 hits result set and I shuffle the  
results in 50 hit chunks, I might not get the best match first (and  
for my current application thats ok), but I won't get the last one  
first.
What I'd like to know is if there is a better way to affect the  
sorting (maybe affecting the scoring) so I can get this behaviour  
without having to do the processing myself.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks a lot.
