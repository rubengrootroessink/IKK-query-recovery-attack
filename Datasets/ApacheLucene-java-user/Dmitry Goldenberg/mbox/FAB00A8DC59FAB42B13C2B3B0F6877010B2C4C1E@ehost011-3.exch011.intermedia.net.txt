I think it's a good idea.  For an enterprise-level application, Lucene appears too file-system
and too byte-sequence-centric a technology.  Just my opinion.  The Directory API is just too
low-level.
 
I'd be OK with an RDBMS-based Directory implementation I could take and use.  But generally,
I think the Lucene authors might like to take a step back and consider splitting off the repository
and making it more extensible and high-level.  Perhaps something like JSR-170 (Java repository
API) may be a good route to go....

What about using lucene just for searching (i.e., no stored fields
except maybe one "ID" primary key field), and using an RDBMS for
storing the actual "documents"?  This way you're using lucene for what
lucene is best at, and using the database for what it's good at.  At
least up to a point -- RDBMSs have their limits too.  OR maybe if you
have a huge dataset, you might want to check out Nutch.

 The nitty-gritties of dealing with Lucene indexing structures at a single byte level are
just way too much trouble to deal with for application integrator like myself.
