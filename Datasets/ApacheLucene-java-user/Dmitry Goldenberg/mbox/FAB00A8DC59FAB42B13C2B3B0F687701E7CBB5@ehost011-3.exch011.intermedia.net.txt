Erik,
What do you mean by _rewriting_ the query?  I checked all the classes in the highlighter package
and did not see any mention of having to rewrite.
 
Sorry for the highjacking, didn't mean to be a terrorist :)

You have to _rewrite_ the Query for this to work.  This, I believe, 
is mentioned in the javadocs.

I think you are hijacking a thread with your recent postings.  Please 
create a new message rather than reply to one and change the 
subject.  Thanks.

        Erik
