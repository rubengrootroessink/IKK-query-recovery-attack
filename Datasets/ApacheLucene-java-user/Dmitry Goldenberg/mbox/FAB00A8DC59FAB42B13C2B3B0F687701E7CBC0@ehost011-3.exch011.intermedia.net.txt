SUBJECT: Correlating best fragments back to native documents - ?
DATE: 29 Dec 2005

Hello,
 
I was wondering if anyone has seen or implemented the kind of solution where the best fragments
generated by Lucene's Highlighter, are correlated back to the native documents such as PDF
or MS Word.
 
Basically, I want to be able to use native (or any other) API's to highlight Lucene's findings
in the actual documents.
 
I am probably "all wet" but if this makes any sense, please give me a shout.
 
Thanks,
- Dmitry
