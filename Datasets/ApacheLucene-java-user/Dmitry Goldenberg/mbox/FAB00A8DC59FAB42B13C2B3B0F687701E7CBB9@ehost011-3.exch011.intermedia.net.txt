SUBJECT: RE: Wildcard and Fuzzy queries - no best fragments generated - ??
DATE: 27 Dec 2005

Erik,
This is great.  Now, just so I understand how rewrite applies.  Are there specific cases when
the rewrite method should or should not be invoked on the query before it is passed on to
the search method?  Where I'm going with this is, if I have a UI which passes the user query
to the back end, can the back end always call rewrite or not?
 
By looking at the code, it seems that things just get reinterpreted as BooleanQuery's and
such.  I just want to know if there are any pitfalls to watch out for.
 
Thanks again,
- Dmitry

 From Highlighter's package.html in it's javadocs:

<pre>
        IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(ramDir);
        Query query = QueryParser.parse("Kenne*", FIELD_NAME, analyzer);
        query = query.rewrite(reader); //required to expand search terms
        Hits hits = searcher.search(query);

        Highlighter highlighter = new Highlighter(this, new QueryScorer
(query));
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; hits.length(); i++)
        {
                String text = hits.doc(i).get(FIELD_NAME);
                TokenStream tokenStream = analyzer.tokenStream(FIELD_NAME, new 
StringReader(text));
                // Get 3 best fragments and seperate with a "..."
                String result = highlighter.getBestFragments(tokenStream, text, 3, 
"...");
                System.out.println(result);
        }
</pre>
