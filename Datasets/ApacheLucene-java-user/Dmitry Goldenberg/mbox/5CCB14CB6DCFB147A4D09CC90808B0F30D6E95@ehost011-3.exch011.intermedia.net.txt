SUBJECT: Doc classification / categorization with Lucene ?
DATE: 6 Nov 2006

Hello,
 
What are the best practices for document classification / categorization using Lucene?  Any
recommendations as far as manual vs. automatic, which products to use or not to use?  Does
Lucene offer anything out of the box?
 
Thanks,
- Dmitry
