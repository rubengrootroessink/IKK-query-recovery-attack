Ideally, I'd love to see an article explaining both in detail: the index structure as well
as the merge algorithm...

Subject: Data structure of a Lucene Index



It seems to me that lucene doesn't use B-tree for its indexing storage.
Any paper/article which explains the theory behind data-structure of 
single index(segment).  I am not referring to the merge algorithm, I am
curious to know the storage structure of a single optimized lucene index.

Any pointer is greatly appreciated.
