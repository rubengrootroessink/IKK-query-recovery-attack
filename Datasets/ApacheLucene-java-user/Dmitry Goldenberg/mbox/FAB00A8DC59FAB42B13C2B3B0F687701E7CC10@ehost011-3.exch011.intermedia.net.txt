SUBJECT: How to find "function()" - ?
DATE: 27 Jan 2006

Hi,
 
I'm trying to figure out a way to locate tokens which include special characters.  The actual
text in the file being indexed is something like "function() { statement1; statement2; }"
 
The query I'm using is "function\()" since I want to locate precisely "function()" - the query
succeeds but what it finds is actually "function", not "function()".  If I run the same query
against "function { statement1, statement2 } it still succeeds and I get "function" in best
fragments.
 
How can I enforce () to be included?
 
Thanks,
- Dmitry
