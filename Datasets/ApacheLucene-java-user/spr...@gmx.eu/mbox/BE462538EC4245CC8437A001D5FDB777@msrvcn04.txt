I'm just writing the tool. The customer (IT staff, not end user) uses it.
Now I have to find out the best stategy which allows fast indexing and
searching.

I'm not asking about flexibility, only about indexing performance.
I know that I have to index in parallel (initial data is about 150 million
pages with more than 1 TByte).
Now I'm thinking about what I have to take into consideration when building
the merge tool.
Then I saw the code of IndexMergeTool I was astonished about the hardcoded
use of SimpleAnalyzer and why one uses an anylzer at all. Therefore my
questions.

No the frontend just provides a textbox where the user can type in a text
like "foo*".

The query is then executed against some un_tokenized fields (fixed
parameters for the current user like company etc.) and against this single
tokenized field.
I want to filter on these fixed fields too, to reduce the number of hits for
the fulltext query. I think this is the right approach to achieve a better
search performance. Isn't it?

Thank you!
