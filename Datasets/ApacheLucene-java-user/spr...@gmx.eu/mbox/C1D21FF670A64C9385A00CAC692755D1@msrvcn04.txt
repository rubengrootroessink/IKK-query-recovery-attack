SUBJECT: Merging database index with fulltext index
DATE: 28 Feb 2009

Hi,

what is the best approach to merge a database index with a lucene fulltext
index? Both databases store a unique ID per doc. This is the join criteria.

requirements:

* both resultsets may be very big (100.000 and much more)
* the merged resultset must be sorted by database index and/or relevance
* optional paging the merged resultset, a page has a size of 1000 docs max.

example:

select a, b from dbtable where c = 'foo' and content='bar' order by
relevance, a desc, d

I would split this into:

database: select ID, a, b from dbtable where c = 'foo' order by a desc, d
lucene: content:bar (sort:relevance)
merge: loop over the lucene resultset and add the db record into a new list
if the ID matches.

If the resultset must be paged:

database: select ID from dbtable where c = 'foo' order by a desc, d
lucene: content:bar (sort:relevance)
merge: loop over the lucene resultset and add the db record into a new list
if the ID matches.
page 1: select a,b from dbtable where ID IN (list of the ID's of page 1)
page 2: select a,b from dbtable where ID IN (list of the ID's of page 2)
...


Is there a better way?

Thank you.
