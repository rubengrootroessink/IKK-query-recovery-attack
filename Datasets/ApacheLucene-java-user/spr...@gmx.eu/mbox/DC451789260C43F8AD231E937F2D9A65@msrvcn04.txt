Each doc has up to 10 A4 pages text.
There will be about 100 customers/clients/companies (not users, every
customer will have about 10 users).
I would expect 1 query/s not more.
No updates to the index.

This is the biggest problem I see.

I would open the index on demand and close it after a period of inactivity.
