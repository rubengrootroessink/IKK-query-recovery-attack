SUBJECT: When to use which Analyzer
DATE: 13 Jan 2008

Hi,

I have some doubts about Analyzer usage. I read that one shall always use
the same analyzer for searching and indexing.
Why? How does the Analyzer effect the search process? What is analyzed here
again?

I have tried this out. I used a SimpleAnalyzer for indexing with
Field.Store.YES and Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED. I can see with Luke that the
field values are store unchanged, 1:1. OK.

Now I did a search with Luke and depending on the used analyzer the Query
returns results or not.

I can see that when I use the SimpleAnalyzer again, the values of my search
are all converted to lowercase and numbers are removed. 
This leads to wrong results, because my values are stored with
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED.

Why is my query changed this way?

I think it has to do with QueryParsing, which uses an analyzer. Right?

Can I create a query directly, without parsing?

Or in other words: 

How can I search for fields stored with Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED?
Why do I need an analyzer for searching?

Thank you.
