SUBJECT: Max size of index (FSDirectory )
DATE: 13 Jan 2008

Hi,

is there any maximum size for an index?

Are there any recommendations for a useful max size?

I want to index in parallel. So I have to create multiple indexes.
Shall I merge them together or shall I let them as they are using
(Parallel)MultiSearcher?

Thank you.
