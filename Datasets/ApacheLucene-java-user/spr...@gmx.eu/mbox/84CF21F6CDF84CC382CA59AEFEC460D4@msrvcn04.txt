SUBJECT: Searching sets of documents
DATE: 12 Oct 2008

Hi,

I want to search for sets of documents. For instance I index some folders
with documents in it and now I do not want to find certain documents but
folders.

Sample:

folder A
  doc 1, contains X, Y
  doc 2, contains Y, Z

folder B
  doc 3, contains X, Y
  doc 4, contains A, Z

Now I want to find all folders which match "A AND Y" -> folder B.

How can this be done?

Thank you
