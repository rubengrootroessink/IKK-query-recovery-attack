Ah I see, I need to cast it to TermPositionVector. OK.

Hm.

What I need is are startOffsets of a special term.

I use TermPositionVector#getOffsets(TermPositionVector.indexOf("foo")).

Can TermVectorMapper speed this up?


And how can I find the offsets of something like "foo bar"? I think this
will get tokenized into 2 terms and thus I have no chance to find it, right?


Thank you.
