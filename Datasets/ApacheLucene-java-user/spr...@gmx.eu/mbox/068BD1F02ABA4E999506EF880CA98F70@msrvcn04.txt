Therefore I wrote:

"(including time to get the document from the archive)"

Not the absolute times are important, the differences are imported.
They only occur due to the different batch sizes.

I think it is a real world scenario because one has always the read the docs
from somewhere and offen has to store the index state somewhere else.

A test with docs created in memory and no state in a database would have of
cause completely other results.
