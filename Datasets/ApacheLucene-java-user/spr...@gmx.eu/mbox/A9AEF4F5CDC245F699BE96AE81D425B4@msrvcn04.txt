Hi,

I have some questions about indexing:

1. Is it possible to open indexes with Multireader+IndexSearcher and add
documents to these indexes simultaneously?
2. Is it possible to open indexes with Multireader+IndexSearcher and
optimize these indexes simultaneously?
3. Is it possible to open indexes with Multireader+IndexSearcher and merge
these indexes simultaneously?

Thank you.
