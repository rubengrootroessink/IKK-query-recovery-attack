SUBJECT: Multiple indexes vs single index
DATE: 14 Feb 2009

Hi,

We have have an application which manages the data of multiple customers.
A customer can only search its own data, never the data of other customers.

So what is more efficent in respect of performance and resources:

One big single index filtered by an index field (customer-Id) or multiple
smaller indexes, one per customer?

I think there will be 10 million docs max. for all customers together.

Thank you
