SUBJECT: Re-combining already indexed documents
DATE: 2 Jan 2009

Hi,

I have already indexed documents. I want to recombine them into new
documents. Is this possible without the original documents - only with the
index?

Example:

doc1, doc2, doc3 are indexed.
I want a new indexed doc4 which is indexed as if I had concatenated doc1,
doc2, doc3 into doc4 and then indexed doc4. 


Thank you
