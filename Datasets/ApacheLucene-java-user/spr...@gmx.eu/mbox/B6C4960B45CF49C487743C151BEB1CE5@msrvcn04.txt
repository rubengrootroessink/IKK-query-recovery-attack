Yes of course, the answers to your questions are important too.
But no anwser at all until now :(

For me I can say (not production yet):

2 ID-Fields and one content field per doc. Seach on content field only.
Simple searches like "content:foo" or "content:foo*".
1,5 GB index per 1 million docs.
About 50 million docs now.
Max. 10 million docs per year increase.

So I will have 75 GB index soon.

Can searching this index be handled by a single machine? 

Thank you.
