SUBJECT: design: merging resultset from RDBMS with lucene search results
DATE: 13 Feb 2008

Hi,

I have the following scenario:

RDBMS which contains the metadata for documents (ID, customer number,
doctype etc.).
Now I want to add fulltext search support.

So I will index the documents content in lucene and add the documents ID as
a stored field in lucene.

Now somebody wants to search like this: customer number 1234 AND content
"foo bar".

So I go to lucene, search for content:"foo bar" and get back a hitlist
containing the documents IDs.

Now - how to merge these Ids with the resultset of the RDBM's search for
customer number 1234?

1) select ... from ... where customer=1234 and ID in (<lucenes ID list>).

or

2) select ... from ... where customer=1234 and them join both resultsets in
the application.

or

3) no idea :)

What is best practice here?

Thank you.
