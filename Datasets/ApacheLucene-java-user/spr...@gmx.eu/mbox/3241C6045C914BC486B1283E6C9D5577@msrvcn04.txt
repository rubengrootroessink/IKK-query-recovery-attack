DATE: 8 Feb 2008

Hi,

if I understand this property correctly every time the ram buffer is full it
gets automaticaly written to disk. Something like a commit in a database.
Thus if my application dies, all docs in the buffer get lost. Right?

If so, is there any event/callback etc. which informs my application that
such a commit happend?

Thank you.
