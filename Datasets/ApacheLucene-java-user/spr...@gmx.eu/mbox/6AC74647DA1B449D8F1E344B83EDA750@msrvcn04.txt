SUBJECT: How to construct a MultiReader?
DATE: 21 Feb 2008

Hi,

how can I construct a MultiReader?

There is only a constructor with an IndexReader-array. But IndexReader is
abstract and all other IndexReader-implementations also need an IndexReader
as constructor param.

Now I'm a bit confused...

I want to construct a MultiReader which reads multiple FDDirectories.

Thank you.
