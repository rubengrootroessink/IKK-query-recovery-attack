2 files attached, SubstringQuery (which you'll use) and 
SubstringTermEnum ( used by the former to be
consistent w/ other Query code).

I find this kind of query useful to have and think that the query parser 
should allow it in spite of the perception
of this being slow, however I think the debate is the "user centric 
view" (say mine, allow substring queries)
vs the "protect the engines performance" view which says not to allow 
expensive queries.
