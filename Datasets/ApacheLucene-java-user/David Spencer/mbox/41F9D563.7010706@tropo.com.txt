I was gonna mention this - you beat me to the punch.  I suspect that 
LDAP/JNDI itegration is a start, but you need hooks for an arbitrary 
auth plugin. And once we address this it might be the case that a user 
has to *log in* to the search server.  We have Verity where I work and 
this is all the case, along w/ the fact that a sale seems to involve 
mandatory consulting work (not that that's bad, but if you're trying to 
ship a shrink wrapped search engine in a box then this is an issue).

Also need http://jcifs.samba.org/ so you can spider windows file shares.

Indeed.
