Yeah, great book. I thought my approach fit into Lucene the most 
naturally for my goals - and no doubt, things like just having the 
possibility of different pos increments is a great concept that I 
haven't seen in other search engines. I keep meaning to try an idea that 
appeared on the list some months ago, bumping up the incr between 
sentences so that it's harders for, say, a 2 word phrase to match w/ 1 
word in each sentence (makes sense to a computer, but usually not what a 
human wants).  Another side project...

I think so but this is the first time I've done this kind of thing. When 
I hit the special case several of the "subtokens" are 1st returned w/ an 
incr of 0, then the normal token, w/ an incr of 1 - which seems to make 
sense to me at least.

Oh sure, I'll post any changes but wait for Mark for now.
