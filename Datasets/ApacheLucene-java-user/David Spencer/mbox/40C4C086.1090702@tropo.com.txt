SUBJECT: Setting Similarity in IndexWriter and IndexSearcher
DATE: 7 Jun 2004

Does it ever make sense to set the Similartity obj in either (only one 
of..) IndexWriter or IndexSearcher? i.e. If I set it in IndexWriter can 
I avoid setting it in IndexSearcher? Also, can I avoid setting it in 
IndexWriter and only set it in IndexSearcher? I noticed Nutch sets it in 
both places and was wondering about what's going on behind the scenes...

thx,
  Dave
