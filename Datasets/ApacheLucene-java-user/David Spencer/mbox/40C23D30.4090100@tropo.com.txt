SUBJECT: "No tvx reader"
DATE: 5 Jun 2004


Using 1.4rc3.

Running an app that indexes 50k documents (thus it just uses an 
IndexWriter).
One field has that boolean set for it to have a term vector stored for 
it, while other 11 fields don't.

On stdout I see "No tvx file" 13 times.

Glancing thru the src it seems this comes from TermVectorReader.

The generated index seeems fine.

What could be causing this and is this normal?

thx,
 Dave
