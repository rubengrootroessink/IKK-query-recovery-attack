If you want an informal way of doing it you're right, just feed the 
words of the source doc to a query. The doc for the code it is at this 
easy to  remember URL:
http://searchmorph.com/pub/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contributions/similarity/build/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/similar/SimilarityQueries.html#formSimilarQuery(java.lang.String,%20org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer,%20java.lang.String,%20java.util.Set)

Follow Otis's link above to my weblog for the code.

The "MoreLikeThis" stuff is similar but more sophisticated.


Also if you want the IR way I think you'd do a "cosine measure". I know 
carrot2 has the code - this might be it:
