No, no problem with it and it's in fact what my "Wordnet Query 
Expansion" sandbox module does.

The nice thing about Lucene is you at least have the option of doing 
things the other way - you can write a custom Analyzer that puts all 
synonyms at the same token offset so they appear to be in the same place 
in the token stream. Thinking about it...this approach, with the 
Analyzer, lets user search for phrases which would match a synonym, so, 
using your example below, the text "bright red engine" would be matched 
by either phrase "bright red" or "bright colour". Doing the query 
expansion is trickier if you allow phrases.

I don't like that bit about substring terms, but if it's right for you 
ok - if you insist on loosening things I'd consider fuzzy terms 
(desc:red~ ...etc).
