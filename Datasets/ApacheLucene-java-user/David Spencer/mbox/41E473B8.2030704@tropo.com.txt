I verified that the code works w/ the latest WordNet (2.0), and it does 
so, no problem. The relevant data from WordNet has not changed so 
there's no need to upgrade WordNet for this package at least.

I added "query expansion" which takes in a simple query string and for 
every term adds their synonyms. There's an optional boost parameter to 
be used to "penalize" synonyms if you want to use the heuristic that the 
  user probably knows the right word.

One example of expansion with the synonym boost set to 0.9 is the query 
"big dog" expands to:

big adult^0.9 bad^0.9 bighearted^0.9 boastful^0.9 boastfully^0.9 
bounteous^0.9 bountiful^0.9 braggy^0.9 crowing^0.9 freehanded^0.9 
giving^0.9 grown^0.9 grownup^0.9 handsome^0.9 large^0.9 liberal^0.9 
magnanimous^0.9 momentous^0.9 openhanded^0.9 prominent^0.9 swelled^0.9 
vainglorious^0.9 vauntingly^0.9
  dog andiron^0.9 blackguard^0.9 bounder^0.9 cad^0.9 chase^0.9 click^0.9 
detent^0.9 dogtooth^0.9 firedog^0.9 frank^0.9 frankfurter^0.9 frump^0.9 
heel^0.9 hotdog^0.9 hound^0.9 pawl^0.9 tag^0.9 tail^0.9 track^0.9 
trail^0.9 weenie^0.9 wiener^0.9 wienerwurst^0.9

Amusingly then, documents with the terms "liberal wienerwurst" match 
"big dog"! :)

Want to try it out? This page *expands* a query and prints out the 
result (but doesn't execute it yet).

Hope y'all like it and someone finds it useful,

PS
  Oh - it may need the 1.5 dev branch of Lucene to work - I'm not 
positive but it I tried to remove deprecated warnings and doing so may 
have tied it to the latest code...
