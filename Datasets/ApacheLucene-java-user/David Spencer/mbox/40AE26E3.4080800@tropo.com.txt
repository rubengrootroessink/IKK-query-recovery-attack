SUBJECT: now maybe Mozlla/IMAP URLs - Re: StandardTokenizer and e-mail
DATE: 21 May 2004

This reminds me - if you have a search engine that indexes a mail store 
and you present results in a web page to a browser, you want to (of 
course...well I think this is obvious)  send back a URL that would cause 
the users native mail client to pull up the msg.
IMAP has a URL format, and I use Mozilla on windows to browse & read 
mail, however when I've presented IMAP URLs on a results page the IMAP 
URL doesn't work - either nothing happens or the cursor changes to busy 
but still no mail comes up. Has anyone come across this? This may be 
more appropriate for a moz list but it's definitely a search issue.

This page mentions the problem:
