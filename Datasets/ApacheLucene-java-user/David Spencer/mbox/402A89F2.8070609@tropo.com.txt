I've written a PrefixQuery and it's not hard to do  -I can post it too.
Problem is that it is not integrated into the query parser (.jj) so odds
are noone will use it, and the general sentiment on this list (and 
lucene-dev)
is that prefix queries are evil because it's an expensive operation as 
the query
code has to traverse all terms to "expand" the query. I would prefer
a more user oriented view i.e. just allow it as sometimes it's what you 
need and
the only alternative I can think of, doing a fuzzy query, isn't quite right.
