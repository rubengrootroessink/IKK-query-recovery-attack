Would be nice if we could have up to date sandbox javadoc somewhere.
I've linked to some local copies of it from my page here:
http://www.searchmorph.com/pub/

Also useful would be to use the "-linksource" tag to javadoc so the 
htmlized source code is avail too, that way you have a source code search.

Maybe I should release my "javadoc" Analyzer which I use on 
searchmorph.com - it tries to do intelligent tokenization of java so 
that a word like "HashMap" becomes 3 tokens at the same offset 
('hashmap', 'hash', 'map') and which might be useful for you.

I do like the way you provide snippets from the book - nicely done.
