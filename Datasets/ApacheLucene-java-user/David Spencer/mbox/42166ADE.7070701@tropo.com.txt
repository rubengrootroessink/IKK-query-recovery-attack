Yeah, but in theory, in the ideal world :), it should't be any slower - 
there's no magic Lucene has that DB's don't.  And the big advantage of 
it being embedded in the DB is the index can always be up to date, just 
as if you had Lucene updating the index based on a trigger. You don't 
need any separate cron job to periodically update the index.

But this brings up - has anyone run Lucene off a database trigger or are 
  triggers known to be slow and bad for this use?
