I did this a few weeks ago.

There are two ways, and they both revolve round the same thing, you need 
the tokenized PDF text available.

[a] Store the tokenized PDF text in the index, or in some other file on 
disk i.e. a "cache" ( but cache is a misleading term, as you can't have 
a cache miss unless you can do [b]).

[b] Tokenize it on the fly when you call getBestFragments() - the 1st 
arg, the TokenStream, should be one that takes a PDF file as input and 
tokenizes it.
