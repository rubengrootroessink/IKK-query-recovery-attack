I have a demo site that does this.
I thought I posted a mention of this a week ago in a different thread 
but it seems that
my mailer ate the outgoing msg so I don't think this is a dup....

Anyway, the site is:

http://www.hostmon.com/rfc/index.jsp

I index all RFCs w/ Lucene.

When you're viewing an RFC at a URL like this:

http://www.hostmon.com/rfc/get.jsp?id=1823&s=LDAP%20Security

if you click on 'show similar' then you go to a URL like this:

http://www.hostmon.com/rfc/related.jsp?id=1823&s=LDAP%20Security

the implementation takes the source RFC, forms a query with all words in 
it, and then
passes this large query to lucene. The display lists docs that are 
'similar' to the
source doc, and the little blue bar graph is bigger for more similar docs.

The nature of what's going on is that the more 2 documents have words in 
common, and the
more they have rare words in common, the more similar they are.

Similarity is not by concept, and even alternate spellings throw off 
this simple technique.

Site warning: linux JVM just crashed so I upgraded to 1.4.2b which is 
hopefully more stable.
