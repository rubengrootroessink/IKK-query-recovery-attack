And what I've noticed is that typically systems with dynamic content 
that comes from, say, a database, do not implment the HTTP "HEAD" verb 
nor "if-modified-since", which a smart spider might try to use to be 
more efficient. Thus an "incremental" spider run can be just as 
expensive as the first one.
