It's something I contributed.
Relevant links are:

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/lucene-sandbox/
http://www.tropo.com/techno/java/lucene/wordnet.html

Basically it uses the Lucene index as a kind of associated array to map 
words to their synonyms using the thesaurus from Wordnet, so a key like, 
say, "fast" will have mappings to "quick" and "rapid". This can then be 
used for query expansion.

An example of this expansion in use is here:
