SUBJECT: Fun with the Wikipedia
DATE: 14 Jan 2005


For my own amusement I've indexed the Wikipedia and put up pages that:
- display search results
- cluster the results using Carrot2 (my first use of this)
- display similar pages using the entire text to re-query for similar 
docs and
- display similar pages using the "more like this" algorithm (TBD is get 
this into the sandbox, sorry for delays..)


You start off here to search:

And the weblog entry goes into a bit more detail:

It's kinda fun to explore the Wikipedia by looking for pages similar to 
other ones.

Hope people find this useful...

- Dave

PS
   I'm in the process of running the page rank algorithm (from 
jung.sf.net) on most of the entries in the Wikipedia. It has taken over 
2 days so far....
