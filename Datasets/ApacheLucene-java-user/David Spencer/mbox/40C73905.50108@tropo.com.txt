But with automagic query expansion these things might be done behind the 
scenes.  Nutch, for one, expands simple queries to check against 
multiple fields, with different boosts, and even gives a bonus for terms 
that are near each other.

I suggested in some email a while ago making the QueryParser extensible 
at, runtime or startup time, so you can add other types if queries that 
it doesn't support - so you have a way of registering these other query 
types (SpanQuery, SubstringQuery etc) and then some syntax like 
"span:foo" to invoke the query expander registered w/ "span" on "foo"...
