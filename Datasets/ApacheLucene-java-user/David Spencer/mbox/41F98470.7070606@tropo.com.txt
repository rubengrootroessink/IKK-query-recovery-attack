SUBJECT: rackmount lucene/nutch - Re: google mini? who needs it when Lucene is there
DATE: 28 Jan 2005

This reminds me, has anyone every discussed something similar:

- rackmount server ( or for coolness factor, that mini mac)
- web i/f for config/control

- of course the server would have the following s/w:
-- web server
-- lucene / nutch

Part of the work here I think is having a decent web i/f to configure 
the thing and to customize the L&F of the search results.
