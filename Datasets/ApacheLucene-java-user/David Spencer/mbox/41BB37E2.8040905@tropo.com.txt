Ohh, good point - I was wondering how to "cancel" a URL - this is the 
right way. I'll try to code that in.

I also realized they're prob not doing searches at all - instead they're 
going off a DB of query popularity - I wanted to code up something 
generic, based just on term frequency but I don't think it'll be useful 
e.g. let's say
in my index (index of javadoc-generated documentation) the user types in
"hash" - well a human might guess that they intend "hash map" or 
"hashmap" or "hash tree" but I'm sure other terms are more frequent in 
my index than "map" and "tree"...I'm sure "hash java" occurs more 
frequently than "hash map" - or any other freq, non-stop word, and it's 
dubious that "hash java" is a useful suggestion...
