SUBJECT: stop words and index size
DATE: 14 Jan 2005

Does anyone know how much stop words are supposed to affect the index size?

I did an experiment of building an index once with, and once without, 
stop words.

The corpus is the English Wikipedia, and I indexed the title and body of 
the articles. I used a list of 525 stop words.

With stopwords removed the index is 227MB.
With stopwords kept the index is 331MB.

Thus, the index grows by 45% in this case, which I found suprising, as I 
expected it to not grow as much. I haven't dug into the details of the 
Lucene file formats but thought compression (field/term vector/sparse 
lists/ vints) would negate the affect of stopwords to a large extent.

Some more details + a link to my stopword list are here:
