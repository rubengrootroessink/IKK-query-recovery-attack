Actually I realized this is a trickly and possibly counterintuitive issue.

In theory one might want the MoreLikeThis logic to use a *larger* stop 
word list than the Analyzer uses, even in the case where the Analyzer 
does not use any stop word list.

Reasoning is:
-- maybe you don't want Analyzer to have any stop words (so user can 
find the classic "to be or not to be" phrase) and the search index 
compression won't (in theory?) be affected by frequent stop words anyway
-- the stop words used by MoreLikeThis are a heuristic with 2 points 
behind them - the obvious (stop words
are not interesting in similarity) and the fact that they're there to 
minimize the expensive IndexReader.docFreq() calls, thus more stop words 
are fine to reduce docFreq() calls and let the query generator run faster

As an aside I sometimes use a list of ~500 English stop words from 
"SMART" (sorry, can't easily find the ref, though this might be close: 
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/45797/0 ). I can contribute these if 
wanted.
