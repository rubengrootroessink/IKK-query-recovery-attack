Code attached - don't make fun of it please :) - very prelim. I think it 
only uses one other file, (TRQueue) also attached (but: note, it's in a 
different package). Also any comments in the code may be inaccurate. The 
general goal is as stated in my earlier mail, examples are:

AlphaBeta ->
 Alpha (incr 0)
 Beta (incr 0)
 AlphaBeta (incr 1)

MAX_INT ->
 MAX (incr 0)
 INT (incr 0)
 MAX_INT (incr 1)

thx,
 Dave
