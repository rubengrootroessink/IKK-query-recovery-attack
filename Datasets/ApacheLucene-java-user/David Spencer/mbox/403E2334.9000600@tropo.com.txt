I've done this extensively. Basically you create documents out of the 
database and in my case I generated a URL for each doc which would be 
fed to users after a query.  This is one of those things where Lucene 
stands apart from what seemed to be the alternatives a few years ago 
(htdig was one thing I used) -- it doesn't have to spider a web site, 
and if you have a dynamic web site (pages generated from db queries) 
then the indexing is in a way more efficient as you don't have to parse 
html to extract what may or may not be the actual text - the db will 
have your exact content so you index off the db, not from web pages..
