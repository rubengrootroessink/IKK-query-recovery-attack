I was referring to this fragment below from BooksLikeThis.docsLike(), 
and was mentioning it as the javadoc 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/TermFreqVector.html 
does not say that the values returned by size() and getTerms() are 
cached, and while the impl may cache them (haven't checked) it's not 
guarenteed, thus it's safer to put the size() and getTerms() call 
outside the loop.

  for (int j = 0; j < vector.size(); j++) {
       TermQuery tq = new TermQuery(
           new Term("subject", vector.getTerms()[j]));
