I agree this is the usual tricky/"fun" thing.
In similar situations I have:
- batched the updates in, well, sort of a "queue"
- flushed the "queue" after "t" seconds or "n" documents (e.g. t=60sec, 
n=1000 docs)

Part of the trick is a document that changes multiple times during one 
of these periods - if you have a "add queue" and a "delete queue" then 
you'll probably have the wrong index with the doc either zero times or 
more than one time - not impossible to cover, just something to keep in mind
