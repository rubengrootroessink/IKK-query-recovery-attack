You're welcome, it's a fun problem.

Unless there's a requirement to the contrary, I would try to only 
execute the queries, say, 1x/day, and try to avoid all the cool 
optimizations by default - this uses one of those first principles of 
optimization, "don't do it".

I'd also suggest you look at how you invoke the (Lucene) JVM - a 
combination of the -server flag, a big argument to -Xmx (max memory), 
use of a RAMDirectory, and maybe even -XX:CompileThreshold=10 should 
give you better-than-default performance. The last secret arg tells the 
JVM to compile methods sooner.
