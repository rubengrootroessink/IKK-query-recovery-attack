Already done, I did it, bottom of this page, search for wordnet:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/lucene-sandbox/

It runs in 2 phases:
[1] Parses some of Wordnet, stores synonyms in a Lucene index as a kind 
of persistent Map. This is just run once.

[2] Query expansion, does things like expanding "monitor" to "monitor 
screen". This runs against an unchanged index.
