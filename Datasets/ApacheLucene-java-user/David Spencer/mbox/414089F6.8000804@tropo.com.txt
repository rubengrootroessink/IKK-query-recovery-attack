Sounds interesting/fun but I'm not sure if I'm following exactly.

Let's talk thru the trigram index case.
Are you saying that for every trigram in every word there will be a 
mapping of trigram -> term?
Thus if "recursive" is in the (orig) index then we'd create entries like:

rec -> recursive
ecu -> ...
cur -> ...
urs -> ...
rsi -> ...
siv -> ...
ive -> ...

And so on for all terms in the orig index.
OK fine.
But now the user types in a query like "recursivz".
What's the algorithm - obviously I guess take all trigrams in the bad 
term and go thru the trigram-index, but there will be lots of 
suggestions. Now what - use string distance to score them? I guess that 
makes sense - plz confirm if I understand.... And so I guess the point 
here is we precalculate the trigram->term mappings to avoid an expensive 
traversal of all terms in an index, but we still use string distance as 
a 2nd pass (and prob should force the matches to always match on the 1st 
   n (3) chars using the heuristic that people can usually start the 
spelling a word  corrrectly).
