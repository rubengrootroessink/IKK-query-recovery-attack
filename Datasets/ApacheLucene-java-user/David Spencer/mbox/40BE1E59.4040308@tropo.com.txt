Yeah, but if you're gonna do that why not just form a query with all 
words in the source document, and let the Lucene engine do the idf/tf 
calculations? I've done this and it seems to work fine.

Here's code I've used. It could be done better by avoiding QueryParser, 
and odds are it could hit that exception for too many clauses in a 
boolean expression unless you configure lucene from its default, but 
this is the idea. "srch" is the entire body of the source document.


     public static Query formSimilarQuery( String srch, Analyzer a)
		throws org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException, IOException
	{
		StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
		TokenStream ts = a.tokenStream( "foo", new StringReader( srch));
		org.apache.lucene.analysis.Token t;		
		while ( (t = ts.next()) != null)
		{
			sb.append( t.termText() + " ");
		}
		return QueryParser.parse( sb.toString(),DFields.CONTENTS, a);
	}
