Noone has mentioned JVM options yet.

[a] -server
[b] -XX:CompileThreshold=1000
[c] Raise the -Xms value if you haven't done so (-Xms...)

I think by default the VM runs with "-client" but -server makes more 
sense for web containers (Tomcat etc).
[b] tells the hotspot compiler to compile methods sooner - you can lower 
the 1000 to, say, '2' makes it compile methods after they've executed 2 
times - I had trouble once lowering this to 1 for some reason




Also, even though you're not supposed to need to do this, I've found it 
helpful to force gc() periodically e.g. every minute via this idiom:

public static long gc()
{
	long bef = mem();
	System.gc();
	sleep( 100);
	System.runFinalization();
	sleep( 100);
	System.gc();
	long aft= mem();
	return aft-bef;
}
