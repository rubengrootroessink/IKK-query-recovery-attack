FYI I recently discovered "ppthtml" in this package: 
http://chicago.sourceforge.net/xlhtml/

Also "antiword" seems to work well for word docs.

Also also also....I use a utility from xpdf 
(http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/) for pdf text
extraction.

When you get down to it, I have found that "portable c" tools (above) 
work better
than the pure java ones avail.  To be fair however I have found that POI 
does work fine
for XLS docs.
