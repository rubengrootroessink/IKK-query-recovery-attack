Yes, in theory the "similarity" package in the sandbox can help.
The code generates a query for a source document to find documents that 
are similar to it - the MoreLikeThis class uses the heuristic that 2 
docs are similar if they share "interesting" words. "Interesting" words 
are words that are common in a source doc but not too common in the 
corpus. If you were do do this you'd do something like this:

[1] Do your normal query
[2] As you loop thru the results, for every doc
[2a]	generate a similarity query
[2b]	requery the index for similar docs
[2c]	then, maybe, for every doc from [2b] with a score above some 
threshold, it it's also high up in the results from [2] then "hide" the 
doc a la google et. al.

Could be tricky coding. Another way is to only show 1 doc from any given 
domain. Note that instead of 1 query you'll have "1+n" queries for the 
display of "n" search results.
