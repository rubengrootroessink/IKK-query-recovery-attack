This is just the way it is - you can always compress the content. Only 
alternative is enabling term vectors for the body field - then - (um..I 
think) you don't need the entire content separately - instead is comes 
from the Lucene index.
To store the term vector the 3rd arg here will be true.
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html#Text(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20boolean)
I believe the index size will increase, but I haven't measured it.
