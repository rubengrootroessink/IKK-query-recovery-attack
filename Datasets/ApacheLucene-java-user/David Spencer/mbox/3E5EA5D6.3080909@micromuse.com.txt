We use Lucene (v1.2) extensively internally.
Largest single database looks like 11,552 docs with the db size (the sum 
of the
sizes of the files that make up the index) is 842MB.

All indexes are also merged into one "mega" index which contains 249,184 
docs
and is 1.2GB - I think think this is done because the JSP search pages were
not coded to use MultiSearcher.

Overall there are 24 indexes with 536,415 docs indexed into a total of 
2GB of index space - though this count includes the mega index so you 
could 1/2 the numbers which I guess agree with the previous paragraph...
