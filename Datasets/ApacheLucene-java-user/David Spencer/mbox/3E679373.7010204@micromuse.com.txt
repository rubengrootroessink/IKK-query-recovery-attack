How? You exec passing the file name and it prints the ascii text to stdout.
This method takes the file name (e.g. "c:/dir1/dir2/foo.doc") and returns
the output from antitext as one big string:

    public static String getAntiText( String fn)
        throws Throwable
    {
        Process p = null;
        InputStream is = null;
        DataInputStream dis = null;
        try
        {
            p = rt.exec( new String[] { anti, fn});
            is = p.getInputStream();
            dis = new DataInputStream( is);
            String line;
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
            while ( ( line = dis.readLine()) != null)
            {
                //o.println( "READ: " +line);
                sb.append( line);
                sb.append( " ");
            }
            return sb.toString();
        }
        finally
        {
            try { dis.close(); } catch( Throwable t) { }
            try { is.close(); } catch( Throwable t) { }           
            try { p.waitFor(); } catch( Throwable t) { }           
            try { p.destroy(); } catch( Throwable t) { }
        }
    }
    private static String anti = "c:/antiword/antiword.exe";

 From where? If the file is a word doc e.g. name ends with ".doc".

Hmmm not sure what the exact issue is but is this the answer:

doc.add( Field.Text( "contents", new StringReader( getAntiText( 
file_name_of_word_file))));
