IMHO keeping the data in the same index is easiest.

PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper is part of the magic...approx uasge follows from 
my code below. Second magic is to call doc.add(...) multiple times, 
"redundantly".

Don't use code below exactly however - things like MySnowballAnalyzer 
should become SnowballAnalyzer in your code...


Analyzer fa;
Analyzer getAnalyzer()
{
	Analyzer snowball = new MySnowballStopAnalyzer();
	Analyzer def = new AlphaNumStopAnalyzer();  // prob StandardAnalyzer 
for most people..
	PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper fa = new PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper( def);
	fa.addAnalyzer( "scontents", snowball);  // "s" in "scontents" if for 
stemming
	fa.addAnalyzer( "stitle", snowball);		
	return fa;
}


...

later:

Document doc = new Document();
doc.add( Field.Text( "title", title));
doc.add( Field.Text( "stitle", new StringReader( title))); // don't need 
recall
String body = ...;
doc.add( Field.Text( "contents", new StringReader( body), true)); // 
term vector
doc.add( Field.Text( "scontents", new StringReader( body)));
writer.addDocument( doc);
