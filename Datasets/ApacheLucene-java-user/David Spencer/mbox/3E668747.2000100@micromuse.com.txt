SUBJECT: my experiences - Re: Parsing Word Docs
DATE: 5 Mar 2003

FYI I tried the textmining.org/poi combo and on a collection of 350 word
docs people have developed here over the years, and it failed on 33% of them
with exceptions being thrown about the formats being invalid.

I tried "antiword" ( http://www.winfield.demon.nl/ ), a native & free 
*.exe, and
it worked great ( well it seemed to process all the files fine).

I've had similar experiences with PDF - I tried the 3 or so 
freeware/java PDF
text extractors and they were not as good as the exe, pdftotext,
from foolabs (http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/).

Not satisfying to a java developer but these work better than anything 
else I can find.

You get source and I use them on windows & linux, no prob.
