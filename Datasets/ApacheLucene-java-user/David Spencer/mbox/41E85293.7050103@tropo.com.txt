Technically I don't think carrot2 uses lucene per-se- it's just that you 
can integrate the two, and ditto for Nutch - it has code that uses Carrot2.

This post is where the code I used as a basis came from:

http://www.newsarch.com/archive/mailinglist/jakarta/lucene/user/msg03928.html

This is URL w/ the code:

http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dweiss/tmp/carrot2-lucene.zip


And here's my question. I reread the Carrot2<->Lucene code, esp 
Demo.java, and there's this fragment:

     // warm-up round (stemmer tables must be read etc).
     List clusters = clusterer.clusterHits(docs);

     long clusteringStartTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
     clusters = clusterer.clusterHits(docs);
     long clusteringEndTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

Thus it calls clusterHits() twice.

I don't really understand how to use Carrot2 - but I think the above is 
just for the sake of benchmarking clusterHits() w/o the effect of 1-time 
initialization - and that there's no benefit of repeatedly calling 
clusterHits (where a benefit might be that it can find nested clusters 
or whatever) - is that right (that there's no benefit)?

Could always search citeseer for mentions of Lucene too.
