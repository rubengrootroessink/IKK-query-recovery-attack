SUBJECT: Visualization of Lucene search results with a treemap
DATE: 1 Jul 2004


Inspired by these guys who put results from Google into a treemap...
http://google.hivegroup.com/

I did up my own version running against my index of OSS/javadoc trees.
This query for "thread pool" shows it off nicely:

http://www.searchmorph.com/kat/tsearch.jsp?s=thread%20pool&side=300&goal=500

This is the empty search form:

http://www.searchmorph.com/kat/tsearch.jsp

And the weblog entry has a few more links, esp useful if you don't know 
what a treemap is:

Oh: As a start, a treemap is a visualization technique, not 
java.util.Treemap. Bigger boxes show a higher score, and x,y location 
has no significance.

Enjoy,
   Dave
