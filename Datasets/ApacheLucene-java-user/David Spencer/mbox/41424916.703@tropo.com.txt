I keep thinking over this one and I don't understand it. If a user 
misspells a word and the "did you mean" spelling correction algorithm 
determines that a frequent term is a good suggestion, why not suggest 
it? The very fact that it's common could mean that it's more likely that 
the user wanted this word (well, the heuristic here is that users 
frequently search for frequent terms, which is probabably wrong, but 
anyway..).

I know in other contexts of IR frequent terms are penalized but in this 
context it seems that frequent terms should be fine...
