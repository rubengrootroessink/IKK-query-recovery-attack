Are you interested in the opposing view? Lucene is essentially a 
"library", not an application. You have to create a whole app around it 
including admin interfaces, training classes, etc. Something like Verity 
has the whole infrastructure - front end, admin i/f, training classes, 
consultants, machine sizing guides. The cost for a commercial solution 
seems easier to scope- how much does Verity (or whoever) charge? With 
some Lucene/OSS solution there's development that would need to be done 
and all the stuff that makes a complete, comprehensive app...

Of course if cost is a big issue then trying some Lucene++ solution 
makes sense. And don't get me wrong...I'm a big fan of Lucene, and when 
I was CTO at Lumos Technologies, we were cost sensitive, and I took care 
of making sure we used Lucene on the intranet and our public sites and 
were very happy w/ it. I'm just trying to make sure the, um, the, or 
one, "business viewpoint" is stated....commercial solutions already 
exist and are complete and they work and there's no development to do, 
so there's less risk... Where I'm at now I brought it up to the VP/MIS 
however it just didn't make sense for the way that dept was run, thus 
we're starting to use Verity.
