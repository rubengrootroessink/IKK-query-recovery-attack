Thanks for the writeup and nice to see that you guys are using Lucene.

It would be interesting to know what Analyzer you're using, and as your 
blog entry says you're having some wierd problem, well, I suspect the 
most common source of strange Lucene behavior is that the "wrong" 
Analyzer is used.

Also, out of curiosity: what's the peak load the search system gets?

thx,
