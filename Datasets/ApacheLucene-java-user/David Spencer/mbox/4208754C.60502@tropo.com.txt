Carrot2 seems to work nicely.
Demo here...

Search for something like "artificial intelligence" in my Wikipedia 
Search engine:

http://www.searchmorph.com/kat/wikipedia.jsp?s=artificial+intelligence

The click on "see clustered results.." link to go here:

http://www.searchmorph.com/kat/wikipedia-cluster.jsp?s=artificial%20intelligence

And voilla, what seems like decent clusters.

I'm not sure what the complexity of the algorithm is, but for me ~100 
docs works ok, maybe 200, but beyond 200 you need lots more CPU and RAM.

I suggest: try it w/ ~100 docs, and if you like what you see, keep 
increasing the # of docs you give it. You might have to wait a while w/ 
all 1,200 docs...
