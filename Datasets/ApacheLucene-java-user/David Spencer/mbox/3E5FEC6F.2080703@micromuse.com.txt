SUBJECT: [ANN] Sample code to index an IMAP message store
DATE: 28 Feb 2003

I've written what I'd like to donate as example code to the project.
I'm not on the list to have CVS write permissions, so if one of the power
users agrees then please put this into the sandbox.

This code indexes the mail in an IMAP message store.
By default it reads all email from an IMAP server and forms an index.
Yes, I know IMAP supports searching: this is for those who want uniform 
Lucene
indexes for all data.
The code is a main() driver + the indexing code.
It is not a full app like Zoe -- the intent is to help build out the 
indexing of data sources in Lucene.

The source file, sample output, syntax, and a description of the fields 
in the index are
here:

Enjoy - oh - and I'd like to know if anyone actually uses this.
It works fine for me but noone else has tested it.

 Dave
