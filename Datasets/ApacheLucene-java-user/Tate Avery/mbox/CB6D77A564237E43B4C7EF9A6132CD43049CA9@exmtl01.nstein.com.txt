Basically, Google uses its stop lists selectively.  To me, the 2 rules appear to be:

1) Do not use stop list for items in quotes (i.e. exact phrase)
2) Do not use stop list if the query is ONLY stop words

Furthermore, they DO let you do silly things like find out there are approximately 5,760,000,000
pages containing the word 'the' (see rule #2).    :)

Anyway, that is how I interpreted my Google tests.  And, as an observation, one would need
to be a bit creative to get the same behaviour with Lucene given the current analyzer setup
(IMO).

In short, it is interesting that they do it that way, but it certainly doesn't mean that it
is THE way to be done.

Thanks for doing the legwork.  My favorite example is "to be or not to 
be" with and without quotes.  The top hit without quotes is quite 
funny.

So, Google doesn't throw away stop words, but they do special query 
processing to keep you from doing silly things like "show me all 
documents with 'the' in them".  Look at Nutch for how it does something 
very similar.
