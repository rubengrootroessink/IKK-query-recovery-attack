Subject: BooleanScorer - 32 required/prohibited clause limit


Hello,

I am using Lucene 1.3 and I ran into the following exception:

java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: More than 32 required/prohibited
clauses in query.
	at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanScorer.add(BooleanScorer.java:98)

Is there any easy way to fix/adjust this (like the
BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount, for example)?
Strangely, I couldn't find mention of the BooleanScorer class in my javadoc.


Thank you for any tips.

Tate

p.s.  Yes, I am intentionally generating some rather long boolean queries.
:)
