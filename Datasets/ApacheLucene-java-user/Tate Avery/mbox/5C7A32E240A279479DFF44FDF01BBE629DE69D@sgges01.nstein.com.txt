Hello,

This is the first time that I noticed this.

Is the 'powered by Lucene' a legal requirement?  Or just a suggestion?
Does it apply to any system embedding Lucene (web pages, applications, etc)?
That is not covered in the Apache Software License, I believe.

Just curious...

Tate

There was discussion about it, yes.  I don't think we ever reached any
conclusions, and the powered.html still says 'include the logo'.
