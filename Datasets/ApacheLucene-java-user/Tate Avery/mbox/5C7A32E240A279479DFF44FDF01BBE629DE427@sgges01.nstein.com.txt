Categorization typically assigns documents to a node in a pre-defined taxonomy.

For clustering, however, the categorization 'structure' is emergent... i.e. the clusters (which
are analogous to taxonomy nodes) are created dynamically based on the content of the documents
at hand.

Hi Otis,

Not that I'm an expert in any of this, but clustering is a much more 
"holistic" approach than categorization. Usually, categorization is 
understood as a more precise endeavor (e.g. dmoz.org), while clustering 
is much more "fuzzy" and non-deterministic. Both try to achieve the 
same goal though. So perhaps this is just a question of jargon.

I'm confident that the owner of this site could help bring some light 
on the finer point of clustering vs categorization:
