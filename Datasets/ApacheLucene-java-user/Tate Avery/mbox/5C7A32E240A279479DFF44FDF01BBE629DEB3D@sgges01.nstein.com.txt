SUBJECT: Natural Language Queries
DATE: 26 Jan 2004

Hello,

Has anyone come across a good (preferably open-source) module for parsing natural language
queries into Lucene queries?
I.e. Identifying concepts (single vs. multi-word), concept expansion (via thesauri), filtering
extraneous words, etc.


Any information would be appreciated.


Thank you,
Tate
