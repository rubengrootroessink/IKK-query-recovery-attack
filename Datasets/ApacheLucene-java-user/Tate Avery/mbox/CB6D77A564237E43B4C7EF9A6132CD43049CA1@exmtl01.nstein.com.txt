Well, as far as I know you can boost 3 different things:

- Field
- Document
- Query

So, I think you need to craft a solution using one of those.

Here are some possibilities for each:

1) Field
	- make a keyword field which is alongside your content field
	- boost your keyword field during indexing
	- expand user queries to search 'content' and 'keywords'

2) Document
	- I don't really think this one helps you in anyway

3) Query
	- Scan a user query and selectively boost words that are known keywords
	- This requires a keyword list and is not really scalable

That is all that comes to mind, at first glance.  So, IMO, the winner IS #1.

For example:
	
	Field _headline = Field.Text("headline", "...");
	_headline.setBoost(3);

	Field _content = Field.Text("content", "...");

	_document.addField(_headline);
	_document.addField(_content);


But, the tricky part is modifying queries to use both fields.  If a user enters "virus", it
is easy (i.e. "content:(virus) OR headline:(virus)").  But, it quickly gets more complex with
more complex queries (especially boolean queries with AND and such ... you probably would
need something roughly like this:  "a AND b" = "content:(a AND b) OR headline:(a AND b) OR
(content:a AND headline:b) OR (headline:a AND content:b) and so on).

That's my 2 cents.
