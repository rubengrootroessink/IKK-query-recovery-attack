You might have trouble with "too many open files" if you set your mergeFactor too high.  For
example, on my Win2k, I can go up to mergeFactor=300 (or so).  At 400 I get a too many open
files error.  Note: the default mergeFactor of 10 should give no trouble.

FYI - On my linux box, I got the 'too many open' error on mergeFactor=300 (and 200).  So,
I am using 100.

Yup, used Lucene on Windows lots.  Is there a specific issue you feel 
is Windows related?  Its pure Java and works the same on all supported 
platforms.  So no real gotchas with respect to Windows.
