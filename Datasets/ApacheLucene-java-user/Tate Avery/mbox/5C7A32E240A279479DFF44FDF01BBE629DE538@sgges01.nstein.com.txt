Have a look at the API

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/

For example, the Hits object has a score
	see: org.apache.lucene.search.Hits  (score)

And the IndexReader allows you to get num docs in the index and term data, etc.
	see: org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader   (numDocs, docFreq)

Subject: Ask something about lucene



Deal all,

I am a new comer into this lucene e-mail list. I am doing research on 
distributed information retrieval so I would like to have a few different 
systems. I run the simple demo of lucene, it does not seem to statisfy all 
my requirements.

I hope for those documents in the result, there is a score for each of them 
to indicate the possible relevance of the document to the given query.

some other questions are: does the index include any statistics of the 
collection? For example, how many documents in the collection have been 
indexed? what is the frequency of a particular term? 

Generally speaking, I would like to have a system that can run queries as in 
TREC conference. If lucene does not work like that, then is it possible 
forme to make lucene to become such a system with modest efforts? Or anyone 
has done something on that?

Especially, to those of you have inside understanging of lucene, please help 
me. Thanks a lot.

Shengli
