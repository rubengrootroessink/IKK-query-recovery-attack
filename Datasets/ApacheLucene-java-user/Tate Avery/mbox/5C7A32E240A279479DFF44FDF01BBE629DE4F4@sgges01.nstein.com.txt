SUBJECT: Which operations change document ids?
DATE: 17 Nov 2003

Hello,

I am considering using the document id in order to implement a fast 'join' during relational
search.

My first question is:  should I steer clear of this all together?  And why?  If not, I need
to know which Lucene operations can cause document ids to change.

I am assuming that the following can cause potential changes:

	1) Add document
		- since it might trigger a merge

	2) Optimize index
		- since it does trigger a merge

	3) Update document
		- since it is a delete + add

What else could cause a document id to change?  Could delete provoke a doc id change?

And, I am assuming that the following DO NOT change the document id:

	1) Query the index


Also, am I missing any others that will or will not cause a document id to change?  

Thank you,

Tate


P.S. It appears (to me) that the SearchBean (in lucene sandbox) sorting makes use of the Hits.id(int
_n) method.  How does it cope, if at all, with changes to the underlying document ids?
