SUBJECT: How to deal with not analyzed fields and analyzed ones in the same query
DATE: 20 Jun 2011

Hi :)

I know it is possible to create a query on different fields with 
different analyzers with PerFieldAnalyzer class but is it possible to 
also include fields which are not analyzed ?

I want some fields not to be tokenized (an exact reference of an article 
for example) and others to be tokenized (like the description of the 
article). I would like to be able to search for a word in both fields 
with one single query.

Thank you :)
