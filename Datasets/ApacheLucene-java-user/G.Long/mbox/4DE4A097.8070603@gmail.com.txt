SUBJECT: Re: which analyzer for exact matchs
DATE: 31 May 2011

Thank you :)

It seems to work as I wanted to. Now If I want to index content to do 
full-text search, would it be better to choose a standardAnalyzer or a 
more specific one like EnglishAnalyzer or FrenchAnalyzer (assuming the 
content I want to index is only in english or only in french) ?

Regards,
