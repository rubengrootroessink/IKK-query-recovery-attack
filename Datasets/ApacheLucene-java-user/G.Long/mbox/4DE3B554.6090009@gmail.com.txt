SUBJECT: which analyzer for exact matchs
DATE: 30 May 2011

Hello :)

I'm wondering which Analyzer would be the best to query exact value for 
a property. I read the javadoc and it it said that when a document is 
indexed, I could use the Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED to store the value as 
is and then I would be able to query for it. But in the same time, I 
need to provide an analyzer for the indexWriter constructor and for my 
queries.

Is it possible to specify that no analyzer should be used for both 
indexing and querying ?

If not, which analyzer would be the best choice?

Thanks for the help :)
Regards.
