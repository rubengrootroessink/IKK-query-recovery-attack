SUBJECT: question about wildcards
DATE: 21 Jun 2011

Hi :)

I've got the following text indexed with simpleAnalyzer :

"security is a real problem."

If I try to search for secu*, it will find the document. But if I try to 
search for curi*, there are no results.

I raed that it's not possible to add a * wildcard at the begining of the 
query so what should I do to handle this type of query where the user 
write just a part of the word (which is in the middle of the word) ?

Thank you :)
