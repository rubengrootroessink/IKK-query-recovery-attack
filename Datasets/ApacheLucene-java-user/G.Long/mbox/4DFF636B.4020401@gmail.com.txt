SUBJECT: Re: How to deal with not analyzed fields and analyzed ones in the same query
DATE: 20 Jun 2011

Ok, I'll try this.

But will it work if one of the fields has no analyzers assigned ?

For example field1 is associated with a keyword analyzer, field2 with a 
standardAnalyzer and field3 has no analyzer because it was indexed as  
Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED. Is there something to specify in the 
constructor of the PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper for the field3 ?

Regards,
Gary
