SUBJECT: how to create a range query with string parameters
DATE: 17 May 2011

Hi there :)

I would like to perform a range query on a lucene index. I'm using 
lucene 3.1 api.
I looked at the javadoc and found a rangeQueryNode but i'm not sure how 
to use it.

I've got a field "article" in my index which is indexed this way :

entry.add(new Field("article", article, Field.Store.YES, 
Field.Index.ANALYZED));

Now I would like to create a query such as :

+article:[L. 140-1 TO L.145-2]

I didn't manage to find code sample on the web. Could someone give me a 
hand please?

Regards :)
