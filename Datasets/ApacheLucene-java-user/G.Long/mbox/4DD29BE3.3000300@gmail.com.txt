SUBJECT: Re: how to create a range query with string parameters
DATE: 17 May 2011

I added a standard analyzer and a Query Parser to parse each boolean 
clause of my query and i got some results :)
But now there are some strange behaviors.

the following queries :

+code:CCOM +article:"l123-12"
+code:CCOM +article:"l123-13"
+code:CCOM +article:"l123-14"

return one result.

However, the following query :

+code:CCOM +article[l123-12 TO l123-14]

return nothing =(

With other parameters, the range query works almost fine but some 
results are missing.
What could be the problem? Could it have something to do with the way 
the documents are indexed?
(the use of Field.Index.ANALYZED for example)

Thank you for your help :)
