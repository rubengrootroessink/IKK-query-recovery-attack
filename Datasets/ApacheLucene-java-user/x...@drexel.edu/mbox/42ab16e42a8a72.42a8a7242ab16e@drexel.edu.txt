Hi -

I tried increasing SUMMARY_LENGTH to 10000 (originally 200) in HTMLParser.java and HTMLParser.jj
files. The purpose is to create snippet and highlight the search terms within it.

Then I used ant to compile (also used javacc-HTMLParser, compile, jar, jar-demo, war-demo
and copied war file to appropriate directory), however, it looks like still 200 is used as
SUMMARY_LENGTH, not 10000. 

Did I miss something here?

Thanks,

George
