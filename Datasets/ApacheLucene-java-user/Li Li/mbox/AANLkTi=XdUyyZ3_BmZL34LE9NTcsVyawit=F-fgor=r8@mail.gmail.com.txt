SUBJECT: will load fdx into memory make search faster?
DATE: 5 Aug 2010

hi all
    we analyze system call of lucene and find that the fdx file is
always read when we get field values. In my application the fdt is
about 50GB and fdx is about 120MB. I think it may be benifit to load
fdx into memory just like tii. Anyone else tried this ?
