SUBJECT: full text searching in cloud for minor enterprises
DATE: 5 Jul 2011

hi all,
    I want to provide full text searching for some "small" websites.
It seems cloud computing is  popular now. And it will save costs
because it don't need employ engineer to maintain
the machine.
    For now, there are many services such as amazon s3, google app
engine, ms azure etc. I am not familiar with cloud computing. Anyone
give me a direction or some advice? thanks
