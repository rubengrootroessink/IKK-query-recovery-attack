SUBJECT: Question about Field.setOmitTermFreqAndPositions(true)
DATE: 31 May 2010

I read in 'lucene in action" that to save space, we can omit termfreq
and postion information. But as far as I know, lucene's default
scoring model is vsm, which need tf(term,doc) to calcuate score. If
there is no tf saved. Will the relevance score be correct?
