SUBJECT: about norm
DATE: 2 Jun 2010

in javadoc http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html#formula_norm
norm(t,d)   =   doc.getBoost()  ・  lengthNorm(field)  ・   ∏  f.getBoost()
                                                                field
f in d named as t
whre is field come from in lengthNorm(field)?
In my option, term t may appear in a doc d many times with different fields. So
       ∏  f.getBoost()
 field f in d named as t
makes sense.
But Why there is only one lengthNorm(field) ?
does it mean that norm(t,d)=norm(t.text, t.field, d)? That's is--
every doc,every field,every term , there is a norm value ?
