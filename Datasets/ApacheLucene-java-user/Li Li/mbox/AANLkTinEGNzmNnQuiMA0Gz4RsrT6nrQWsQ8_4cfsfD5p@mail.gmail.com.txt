SUBJECT: about contrib instantiated
DATE: 2 Jul 2010

it is said that "At a few thousand ~160 characters long documents
InstantiatedIndex outperforms RAMDirectory some 50x, 15x at 100
documents of 2000 characters length, and is linear to RAMDirectory at
10,000 documents of 2000 characters length. ".  I  have an index of
about 8,000,000 document and the current index size is about 30GB. Is
it possbile to use this contrib to speed up my search? I have enough
memory for it. Thank you.
