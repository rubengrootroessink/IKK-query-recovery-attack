Thanks, do you know if nonalphanumeric characters are excluded by default?
since & works, but - works, I am assuming they are not.  I am not sure how
to cleary include nonalphanumeric character explicitly.  If you have any
exmaples of this that would be great. Much thanks again.

Yes... you should extend one of the standard analyzers and provide a
mechanism to include the dash (-) within words.  Use this analyzer to index
and search.
