SUBJECT: min hit score
DATE: 30 Oct 2001

Anyone know how to filter pre result sets with a minimum score?

lets say i search for cars and it returns me back 100 total matched results
where my returned rows = 10 and start index = 0.

currently by default lucene sorts the results based on the hit score.
however is there a way to set the minimum hit score pre search?

so hypothetically for my car search say 50 of the 100 meet the score...then

my new result set should just return 50 total matched results while keeping
intact the returned rows 10 and start index = 0.  

if we do post rendering of these hit scores then there is no way we nkow th
total match result number.

just wondering if anyone knows a way to set min hit score or a clean hack
around it.  thanks!!!
