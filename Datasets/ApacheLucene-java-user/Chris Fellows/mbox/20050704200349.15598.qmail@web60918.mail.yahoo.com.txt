SUBJECT: Most Useful Lucene Taglib?
DATE: 4 Jul 2005

Hello,
 
Looking for most useful lucene taglib and have found references to one written by a Iskandar
Salim found at www.javaxp.net/lucene-taglib, but that site is 404. Found a patch submited
in 2003 bug# 20283. Downloaded and seems adequate, but from the docs I've read, the javaxp
seems superior. Does anyone know where to find or the best lucene taglib to use? Looked in
jakarta taglibs but could not find.
 
Regards,
 
Chris
