The searcher/reader is a view on the index. And each time you open a new one, 
it cost some time. And the only reason to have a new view on the index is 
that you modified it.
As you never modify it, as said Mark, never close your searcher/reader. If 
your sevral users are reading the same index, you might share the instance of 
the searcher in the different user sessions.
