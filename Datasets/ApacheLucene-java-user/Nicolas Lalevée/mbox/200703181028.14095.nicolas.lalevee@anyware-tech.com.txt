The solution I use is using filters. So before doing the search, you have to 
already compute a pool a filters, one filter for each category.
Then use the search(Query, HitCollector), and use a collector which will 
dispatch in different queues the results, depending of which filter matched. 
The collect function of the collector should look like that :

        public void collect(int doc, float score) {
            total++;
            for (int i = 0; i < filters.length; i++) {
                if (filters[i].get(doc)) {
                    DocScoreCategory docScoreCategory = new 
DocScoreCategory(doc, score, i);
                    queue[i].insert(docScoreCategory);
                    subTotals[i]++;
                }
            }
        }

It is nearly as fast as a normal search but has the background that some 
filters have to be computed, and it can take some time. In our application 
updates are done not so often, so we can generate them in background. With an 
index permanently updated this will be very time consuming.
