In fact Lucene is just a search engine. Then you can use the search engine to 
search in web pages, like Nutch is using Lucene. And Google is more like 
Nutch : a web crawler plus a web-search engine. So when you are taking about 
page raking, it has nothing to do with Lucene scoring. Lucene scoring is how 
about the result entry match your query. Page raking is more about how 
relevant is the web page. So for a document, the Lucene scoring depends on 
the query, and the page raking is quite absolute.
