Strange. Looking to the source of Ajani's mail, there is :
To: <java-user@lucene.apache.org>
And my filter worked : I put a "To contains ..."

I don't understand what you are talking about, but here are some usefull 
pointers :
- the FAQ: http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/LuceneFAQ
- some articles: http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/Resources. I remember 
reading a article written by Otis, even if it was for 1.4, it was very 
interesting.
- if it is not sufficient, there are the sources ! ^^
