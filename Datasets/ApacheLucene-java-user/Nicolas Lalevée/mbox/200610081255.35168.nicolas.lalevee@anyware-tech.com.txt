If you read the entire source as I did, I becomes clear ! :)
The interesting code is in FieldsReader.

LOAD : normal load of the field (the default behaviour)
NO_LOAD : skip the field, it's value won't be available
LAZY_LOAD : do not load the field value, but if you request it later, it will 
be loaded on request. Note that it can be lazy-loaded only if the reader is 
still opened.
LOAD_AND_BREAK : load the field value, and don't load the next fields of the 
document
LOAD_FOR_MERGE : internal use when merging segments: it avoids uncompressing 
and recompressing data, the data is merged "binarily".
