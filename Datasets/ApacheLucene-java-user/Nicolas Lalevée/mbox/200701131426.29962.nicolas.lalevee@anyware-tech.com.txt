Hi Melange,

The two document types design will be only usefull if you want to search for 
topics and search for messages. Here you want to search for messages grouped 
by topic. So you should have one kind of document : message documents. In 
this message docment, you will refer the topic's id, so you will be able to 
group by topic. To group by topic some search results, you might be 
interested by Solr's [1] faceted search [2].

cheers,
Nicolas
