SUBJECT: NOT_ANALYZED field
DATE: 28 Apr 2009


Hi,

In my simple program I have an ID field which is NON_ANALYZED. I find that if
the field contains only numeric characters (e.g. id="00023"), I can
successsfully search for the doc. (search for "id:00023")

But if the field contains non-numeric characates (e.g. id="nJK00023") then the
search returns nothing. (search for "id:nJK00023")

Is there anything wrong with my program?

Regards,
CM
