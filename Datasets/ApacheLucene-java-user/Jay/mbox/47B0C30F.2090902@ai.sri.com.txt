SUBJECT: update field boost
DATE: 11 Feb 2008

Hi,

It's clear that there is no easy way to do "in-place" doc update in the 
lucene index, but I think it should be theoretically possible to update 
the field and doc boostings in place, that is, without deleting and 
re-adding the doc and it's fields. Does anyone know how?

Thanks!

Jay
