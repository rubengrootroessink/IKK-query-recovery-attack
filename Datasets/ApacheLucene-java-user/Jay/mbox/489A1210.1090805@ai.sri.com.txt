SUBJECT: CustomScoreQuery and BooleanQuery
DATE: 6 Aug 2008

Hi,
The new addition of the class CustomScoreQuery is very useful and 
powerful in customizing the score of one query using the indexed field 
values.
Another feature that I am looking for in Lucene is the ability to 
combine the scores of multiple (sub)queries in a way different from the 
BooleanQuery. BoostingQuery is one such attempt but it's not very 
flexible (e.g. the damping is independent of the scores of sub queries).
Does anyone know any other existing examples similar to CustomScoreQuery 
but deal with multiple sub queries?

Thanks!

Jay
