SUBJECT: Using Pooled IndexSearchers?
DATE: 17 Oct 2002

Just a question for the group.  Is anyone using or have benchmarked a pooled
IndexSearcher setup?  (Especially the Jakarta Commons POOL implementations)
I am looking to increase the concurrent search performance because quite a
few of our users use DateFiltering which dramatically increases search
times.

Is it worth the effort?

Thankyou in advance.
