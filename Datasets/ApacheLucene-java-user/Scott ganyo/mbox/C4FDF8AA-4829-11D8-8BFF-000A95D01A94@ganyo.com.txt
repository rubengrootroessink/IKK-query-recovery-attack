No, you don't need required or prohibited, but you can't have both.  
Here is a rundown:

* A required clause will allow a document to be selected if and only if 
it contains that clause and will exclude any documents that don't.

* A prohibited clause will exclude any documents that contain that 
clause.

* A clause that is neither prohibited nor required will select a 
document if it contains the clause, but the clause will not prevent 
non-matching documents from being selected by other clauses.

Hopefully that helps,

Scott
