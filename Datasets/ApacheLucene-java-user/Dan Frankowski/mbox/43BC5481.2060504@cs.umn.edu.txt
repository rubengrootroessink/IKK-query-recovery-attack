SUBJECT: Search result snippets?
DATE: 4 Jan 2006

Folks,

I'm a Lucene newbie, and I've been searching awhile today to answer this 
question. Googled, read Lucene FAQ, looked at Javadoc for Document and 
Hits, etc.

How would you implement "snippets" with Lucene? A snippet is some text 
around parts of the text that caused a match, with the search matches in 
bold. For example, the supporting text in Google searches. A snippet is 
NOT a document summary, which has a FAQ entry and someone answered about 
on this email list.

I can store the full text in Lucene, but then when I get the match back, 
it seems as if I'd have to reimplement the query matcher if I wanted to 
know which things matched.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Dan
