SUBJECT: Plus factor in returned results
DATE: 2 Aug 2006

I'd like to start with a standard parsed query, then combine it with
another that says requires a field's untokenized value be inside of a
set. The catch is, I want the document's position in that set to be
included in the scoring.

So I want to search for "chinese restaurant", but only for these
towns. However, if it's town A, I want that to be a plus-factor, even
though towns B and C are in the set. Make sense?
