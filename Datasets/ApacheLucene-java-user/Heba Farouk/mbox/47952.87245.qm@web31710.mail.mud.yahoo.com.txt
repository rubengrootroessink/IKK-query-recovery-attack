DATE: 21 Aug 2007

Hello
i would like to implement a suggest implementation (like google suggest) using lucene. i actually
tried using lucene and it was successfull but i was stuck in some point which is returning
a list of results to the user that have no duplicates. my question is: is there any way i
can remove duplicates with that r returned from the search in the hits or i should manage
it manually ??


thanks in advance


Yours 

Heba
