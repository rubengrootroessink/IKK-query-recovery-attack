SUBJECT: SearchFiles demo fails with exception while IndexFiles works
DATE: 28 Oct 2009

hi, I am playing with lucene 2.9.0 source build, ant 1.7.1, jdk1.6.0, win XP
home edition.
I dont have clover or jFlex installed.
I built the srcs and ran IndexFiles demo and that worked. However when I run
SearchFiles
I have an exception that says:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems:
        The field directory is defined in an inherited type and an enclosing
sco
pe
        The field directory is defined in an inherited type and an enclosing

        at
org.apache.lucene.index.DirectoryReader.open(DirectoryReader.java:71)
----------------------------------------
I run the build again and its the same thing.
Is there anything else I need to do?

tks,
