Hi,

what's *really* happening.....
>Google 'lucene' 'luke' and try it.


I've tried Luke but still have no clue what is going on:
I have the following entry:

2007-06-26T10:56:20-05:00  globus-gatekeeper:  PID: 15986 -- Notice: 5: Authorized as local
uid: 12967


While searching  in Luke with StandardAnalyzer I can find
+uid +12967

but "No Results"
+PID +15986

Any idea?
Thanks,

Tanya
