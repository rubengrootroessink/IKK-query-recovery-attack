SUBJECT: Question about search and analyzer
DATE: 26 Jun 2007

Hi,

I have indexed files using StandardAnalyzer. Now I am trying to search these indexes and use
Highlighter to display the content. I have a 
weird problem with numbers:

The line below is displayed when the following queries are issued
18?
183
+accept +18?

globus-gatekeeper: accept_sec_context.c:gss_accept_sec_context:183:

but the other line that also has "183" is not found regardless what I am trying to search
(+pid +18390, or 18930 or pid*18390 , 183? etc). It is 
displayed if I do searching based on words so it is indexed.

globus-gatekeeper:  PID: 18390 -- Notice: 6: /local/stage1/usrlocal/vdt-1.6.1/globus/sbin/globus-gatekeeper
pid=18390 starting at Sun Jun 24 
20:32:28 2007




Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Tanya
