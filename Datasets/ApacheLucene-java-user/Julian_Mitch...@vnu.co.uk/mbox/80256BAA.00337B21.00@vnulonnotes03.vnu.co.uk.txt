Hi Petite,

java.io.FileNotFoundException: _2.f14 (Too many open files)"

I don't know what environment you're using Lucene in. However, we had this "too
many open files" problem on our Solaris box, and increasing the number of file
descriptors through the ulimit -n command fixed it.

regards, Julian
