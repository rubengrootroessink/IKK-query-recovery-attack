SUBJECT: Re: I need the internal lucene's document id from Hits
DATE: 5 Apr 2007

As long as there are no deletions, the ids will remain unchanged and
it is safe to use them outside.

But in a case where you delete some document, the resulting gap in the
document list will be filled during the next optimize (triggered
manually) or merge operation (may be triggered automatically on adding
a document), which means all following documents are shifted one
position and their ids change respectively.
