Hi,

 

I am building a portal where users are able to maintain a personal doc, placed in a database
or dir on server.

I want the users to be able to search all other users doc's for keywords.

Like give me a top ten of documents containing the work bike.

 

Is Lucene useful for this? Or do you know a better approach?

 

 

Greetings,

 

Erik
