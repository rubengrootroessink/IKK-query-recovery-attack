SUBJECT: Alternate Use of Lucene
DATE: 10 Mar 2006

Is there a technique, using Lucene, to retrieve the remaining index
values from the results of a query?

Here is a better explanation of the question.

I have various fields that have been indexed on a particular
collection of Java POJO's. For example, an Employee object may have
the following fields: id, salary, hire date, termination date,
department, supervisor, etc..

I want to issue a query such as "department: 15". This restricts my
list of Employee objects to those with a department value of 15. What
may be a little different at this stage is I don't care about the
resulting Employee list. What I really want is access to the Lucene
index values for the 'supervisor' field. Basically, I want a list of
those supervisors for the resulting filtered list of Employees.

Does lucene provide an API to access these values?
