SUBJECT: Re: indexing binary files?
DATE: 30 Jan 2009

we have parsers for these files.

to index them, do the string representations need to be stored (aside
from sitting in the index file)? or can the reader simply provide the
string in order to record the location of the record in the binary
file?

if i need to convert the binary file into text fields, the files will
get VERY large.

the binary data are well-formed events, so queries would be like
"where ACCOUNT = 'Microsoft'"
