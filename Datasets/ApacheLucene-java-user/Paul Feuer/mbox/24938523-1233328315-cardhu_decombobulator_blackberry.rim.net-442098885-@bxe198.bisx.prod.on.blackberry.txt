The binary events in the file are parsable by both our java server-side processes and the
clients of these processes, so we need to keep the data in the binary format.

Hi Paul, have you tried persisting the binaries in Base64 format and then indexing them?
As you are aware, Base64 is a robust representation used in email attachments for example.


Thanks

Subject: indexing binary files?

Hi -

I've looked on the FAQ, the Java Docs, and searched a little in
google, but haven't been able to figure out if Lucene can index binary
files.

Our binary files can get up into the 20-30 gigabyte range.

If it is possible, anyone have any pointers to what interfaces I should look at?

Thanks,

../paul
