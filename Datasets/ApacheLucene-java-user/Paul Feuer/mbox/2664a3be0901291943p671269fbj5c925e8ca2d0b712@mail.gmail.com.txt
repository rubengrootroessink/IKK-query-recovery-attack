SUBJECT: indexing binary files?
DATE: 30 Jan 2009

Hi -

I've looked on the FAQ, the Java Docs, and searched a little in
google, but haven't been able to figure out if Lucene can index binary
files.

Our binary files can get up into the 20-30 gigabyte range.

If it is possible, anyone have any pointers to what interfaces I should look at?

Thanks,

./paul
