I tried to build lucene 1.2-rc4, installed ant 1.4
and JavaCC2_1. I edited build.properties to reflect the name of
the JavaCC2_1.zip (it was JavaCC.zip before).


But it looks like not much is happening.
All I get is this:
Buildfile: build.xml

init:

javacc_check:
     [echo] 
      ##################################################################
      JavaCC not found.  
      JavaCC Home: /javacc2.1/bin
      JavaCC Zip: /javacc2.1/bin/lib/JavaCC2_1.zip

      Please download and install JavaCC 2.0 from:

      <http://www.webgain.com/products/java_cc/>

      Then, create a .ant.properties file either in your home
      directory, or within the Lucene directory and set the javacc.home
      property to the path where JavaCC.zip is located. For example,
      if you installed JavaCC in /usr/local/java/javacc2.0, then set the
      javacc.home property to:

      javacc.home=/usr/local/java/javacc2.0/bin/lib

      If you get an error like the one below, then you have not installed
      things correctly. Please check all your paths and try again.

      java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: COM/sun/labs/javacc/Main
      ##################################################################
    

compile:

jar:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Total time: 0 seconds

But I'd guess it should be doing a bit more than that.
Anyway, no java file seems to get compiled.
