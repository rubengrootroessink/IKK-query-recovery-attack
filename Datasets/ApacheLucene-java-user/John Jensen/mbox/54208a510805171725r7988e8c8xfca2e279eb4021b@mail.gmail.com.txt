SUBJECT: MultiTerm Or Query with per-term boost. Does it exist?
DATE: 18 May 2008

Hi,

I have an application where I need to issue queries with a large number of
or-terms with individual boosts.

Currently I just construct a BooleanQuery with a large number (often 1000)
of constituent TermQueries. I'm wondering if there is a better way to do
this?
I'm open to implementing my own Query subclass if I can expect significant
performance improvements from doing this.

TIA for any insights and suggestions.
