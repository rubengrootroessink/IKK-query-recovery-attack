SUBJECT: How to serach in sentence and dispaly the whole sentence
DATE: 23 Apr 2006

I intend, to make a search, to find a word or a word pair
in  a sentence or a paragraph. But then the sentence should be indicated
as a whole. The question relates to the fact, that I need to extend Lucene
in such a way that this is possible. But where to I make a start, because
I have no idea, how I have to change the IndexFile, whether that 
conforms with the Lucene Team.

cheers

anton feldmann
