SUBJECT: Using Luke on a Lucene Index in a Database
DATE: 19 May 2009


Hello,

I would like to use Luke to connect to an existing Lucene Index which is
stored in a Database.
However, Luke seems only to be able to read file based indexes.

What are my options to analyze the DB index?

thx,
Christoph
