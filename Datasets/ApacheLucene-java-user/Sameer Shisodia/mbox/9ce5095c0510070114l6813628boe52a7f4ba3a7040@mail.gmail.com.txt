SUBJECT: Field length normalization
DATE: 7 Oct 2005

Hi,
Have started using Lucene recently so this might be a oft repeated
qn (Do point me to archives if any).
I'm storing multiple values of a field as a comma separated string
during indexing.
Obviously, some docs have more values and some only one and
so hits against those with multiple values for the field suffer.
Is there are trivial way of changing this without writing my own
version Similarity() completely ?
Rgds,
Sameer
