SUBJECT: Stemming terms in SpanQuery
DATE: 1 May 2006

Hi,

I'm trying to build a SpanQuery using word stems. Is parsing each term 
with a QueryParser, constructed with an Analyzer giving stemmed 
tokenStream, the right approach? It just seems to me that QueryParser is 
designed to parse queries, and so my hunch is that there might be a 
better way.

Any help will be much appreciated.

Michael
