SUBJECT: Making SpanQuery more effiicent
DATE: 23 May 2006

Hi,

As I use SpanQuery purely for the use of slop, I was wondering how to
make SpanQuery more efficient,. Since I don't need any span
information, is there a way to disable the computation for span and
other unneeded overhead?

Thanks.

Michael
