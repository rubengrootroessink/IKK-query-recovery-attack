SUBJECT: Matching at least N terms of subqueries
DATE: 20 May 2006

Hi,

Is there any way to make sure, e.g. at least 2, terms of a subquery
are contained in the results? For example, with the query
"OR(t1,t2,t3) AND OR(t4,t5,t6)", the docs returned must contain either
2 or more of (t2,t3,t3) and either 2 or more of (t4,t5,t6). I've read
about Similarity, but it seems to restrict over whole queries rather
than getting down into subqueries.

Thanks.

Michael
