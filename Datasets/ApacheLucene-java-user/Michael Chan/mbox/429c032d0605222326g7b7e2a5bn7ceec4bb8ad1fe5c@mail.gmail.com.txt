SUBJECT: Running 20mil queries against an index
DATE: 23 May 2006

Hi,

I'm trying to run 20mil+ queries against an index containing 2mil
documents, and it has been quite slow. I've been reading about
MemoryIndex, but it is only a single-document index. As I have quite a
bit of RAM (~20gb), is there a way I could store the index in RAM or
any other way that makes use of it to improve performance?

Thanks.

Michael
