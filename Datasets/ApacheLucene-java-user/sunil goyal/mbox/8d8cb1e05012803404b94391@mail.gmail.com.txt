SUBJECT: lucene query (sql kind)
DATE: 28 Jan 2005

Hello all,

I want to run dynamic queries against the lucene index. Is there any
native syntax available for Lucene so that I can query, by first
generating the query in say an XML or SQL like format (cache this
query) and then  use this query over lucene index.


e.g. So a lucene query syntax in which I can define a query
(name="john" AND age <10)  and then I can just use this query to
execute over Lucene index.


Regards
Sunil
