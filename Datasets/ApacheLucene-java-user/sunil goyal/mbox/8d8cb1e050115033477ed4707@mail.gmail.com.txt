SUBJECT: lucene integration with relational database
DATE: 15 Jan 2005

Hello all,

I am new to the lucene user group and trying to know more about
lucene. I want to know if lucene can be integrated with relational
database for querying ?

Lets say I have an employee database with their salaries, age , some
textual description (articles) and some other description. I can use
Lucene for instance for building index for the articles and do
querying for certain keywords on those articles.

But can i do for instance a unified query where i want to take certain
parameters (non-textual e.g. age < 30 ) from relational databases and
keywords from the lucene index ?

Thanks

Regards
Sunil
