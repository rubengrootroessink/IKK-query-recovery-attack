DATE: 20 Mar 2003

Hi There,
            I wonder if anyone can help me. I am submitting a simple Boolean query to the
Lucene search engine and recieving a set of 'Hits' in return. I now want to determine the
frequency of the terms as the occur in the returned documents. How do I do this??

Help greatly appreciated
