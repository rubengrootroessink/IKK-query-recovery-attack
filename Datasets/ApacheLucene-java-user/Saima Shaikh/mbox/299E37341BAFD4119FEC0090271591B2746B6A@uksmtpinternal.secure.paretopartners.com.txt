SUBJECT: Lucene beginner
DATE: 11 Feb 2002


I am new to Lucene and am quite overwhelmed with the whole installation and
deployment process. I am trying to get the web application demo going but am
stuck at the stage  where you have to create the index as I am a bit
confused at the instructions. Could someone please clarify this part for me
?

Also, I have not yet installed Ant. What is it and do I need to install it ?

Thanks very much.
Saima
