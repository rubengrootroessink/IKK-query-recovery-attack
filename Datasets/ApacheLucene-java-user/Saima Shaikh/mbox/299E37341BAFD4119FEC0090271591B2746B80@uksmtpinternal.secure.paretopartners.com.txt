Daniel,

Thank you very much for replying.
I've managed to get to the stage of running the demo and can bring up the
search page. But I get an internal server error saying that it was unable to
compile the class for JSP because 7 packages were not found:

-org.apache.lucene.analysis.*;
-org.apache.lucene.document.*;
-org.apache.lucene.index.*;
-org.apache.lucene.search.*;
-org.apache.lucene.queryParser.*;
-org.apache.lucene.demo.*;
-org.apache.lucene.demo.html.Entities;

I know that these are imported at the top of results.jsp but where should
they be places within the Jakarta directory and where in lucene can I obtain
them from ?

Thanks again,
Saima

Hi,

You have to use the IndexHTML program to create an index and then you can
use this index with the demo. Something like
'java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML [-create] [-index
<index>]<root_directory>'. You need lucene and lucene-demo jars in your
classpath. If needed, you can use -cp to provide them (java -cp
"lucene-demos-1.2-rc3.jar;lucene-1.2-rc3.jar"
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML ....)
What's exactly the problem you're having?

Regarding Ant, it is a Java based build tool (like make) You don't need to
use it unless you want to build lucene. If you're using
lucene's binary distribution you only have to have lucene's jar in your
application classpath.

Regards,

--Daniel
