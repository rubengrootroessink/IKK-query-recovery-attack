SUBJECT: Finding out which field caused the search hit
DATE: 10 Sep 2007


This question has been asked numerous times here. But the answer has never
been satisfactory. Can someone answer it full and final, please ?

If you get back a document as a search hit. How do you find out which field
in it matched ? Just the position of the field is sufficient !

-thanks
