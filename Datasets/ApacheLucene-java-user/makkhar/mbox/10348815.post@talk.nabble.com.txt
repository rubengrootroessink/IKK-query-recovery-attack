SUBJECT: Finding out which field matched for a query
DATE: 6 May 2007


Here's what is going wrong for me :

I have 10 documents, each with 10 fields with "parameterName and
parameterValue". Now, When i search for some term and I get 5 hits, how do I
find out which paramName-Value pair matched ? Very simple a problem, but I
could find no information on the forum for this. 

appreciate your help.

-thanks
