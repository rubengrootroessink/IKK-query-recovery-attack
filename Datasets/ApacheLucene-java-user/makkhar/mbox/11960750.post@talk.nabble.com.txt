SUBJECT: Getting only the Ids, not the whole documents.
DATE: 2 Aug 2007


Hi all,

   Can I get just a list of document Ids given a search criteria ? To
elaborate here is my situation:

I store 20000 contracts in the file system index each with some
parameterName and Value. Given a search criterion - (paramValue='draft'). I
need to get just an ArrayList of Strings containing contract Ids. I dont
need the lucene documents, just the Ids.

Can this be done ?

-thanks
