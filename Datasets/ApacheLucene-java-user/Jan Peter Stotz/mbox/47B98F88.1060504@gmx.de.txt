I think there is a misunderstanding, the WordExtractor extracts text 
from MS Word (.doc) files. Those files are binary and therefore does not 
have an encoding.
I would print out the extracted text into a plain text files and compare 
if there are differences between the file generated on Windows and 
Linux/Ubuntu. This allows to determine if this is a WordExtractor or a 
Lucene problem.
