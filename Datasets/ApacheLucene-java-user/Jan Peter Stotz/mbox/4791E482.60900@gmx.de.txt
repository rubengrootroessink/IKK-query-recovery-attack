SUBJECT: Creating an alias for a field name?
DATE: 19 Jan 2008

Hi,

I would like to provide multiple field-names that are all mapped to the 
same field in background (e.g. a long field-name and a short 
field-name). Is there any mechanism for creating such field-aliases, may 
be in the IndexWriter or an QueryParser?

Jan
