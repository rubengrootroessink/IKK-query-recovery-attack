Well I found a much better solution which avoids "double parsing". I 
created my own QueryParser by extending the existing. Then I identified 
five methods to override:

getFieldQuery(String field,String queryText)
getFuzzyQuery(String field,String termStr, float minSimilarity)
getPrefixQuery(String field,String termStr)
getRangeQuery(String field,String part1, String part2, boolean inclusive)
getWildcardQuery(String field,String termStr)

In each of this methods I call my own method:
field = translateField(field);
before passing the values to it's super implementation.

And my translateField method uses a Hashtable for looking up field 
aliases. It it finds an alias it returns it, otherwise the field is 
returned without modification. Therefore I have my field aliases without 
having to implement an own parser - thanks to the good OO-design of the 
QueryParser class.

BTW: If someone wants to took onto the complete source just ask. I did 
not want to attach/include them because of its size (most of the code 
has been generated by Eclipse...)
