SUBJECT: rec.food.recipes data
DATE: 16 Oct 2001

When I was playing with lucene a couple of months ago, the
data for the javadoc examples was either bundled with the distro
or available separately (I don't recall exactly). I now wish
to explore the 1.2 release with the javadoc examples but cannot
find the rec.food.recipes data on the apache site. Anyone know
if that data is still available?
    Thanks, MikeB.
