Thanks for all the info. I've been working on streamlining my indexing 
and I've finally
found the message from last year that intrigued me

 (http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=1220).

In that message, karl Ã¸ie suggests

1. use a ramdir, and mutliple fsdirs
2. merge the fsdirs into a single fsdir
3. use threads

(Of course he provides more details.)

I have a question concerning RAMDirectories - is there any benefit using 
them over setting the
mergeFactor higher? Also, I notice a lot of  advice to use 
RAMDirectories but not much verbage on
how to use them effectively.

In the above msg from Karl, he suggests writing to a RAMDirectory and 
then at
some point flush the RAMDirectory to an FSDirectory. Anyone have any 
code to illuminate
that? It's the "flushing" part that's getting me. Is flushing just 
calling list() on the
RAMDirectory and then deleteFile() each one? Originally I was just 
creating a new
RAMDirectory each time I needed one (not the best approach but it does 
work).

I know I should spend time profiling the code and see exactly where the 
bottle necks
occur and I will do that but I'd like to get a good handle on the 
multiple ways to
index also.

Thanks for your time, Mike.
