SUBJECT: How to make each term of query appear in at least one field of multiple field query
DATE: 17 Oct 2009


I am a bit stumped by how to ensure that, where there are multiple terms in
my query, that each term must appear at least once across all specified
fields of my document. I am using MultiFieldQueryParser and
BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD in the query; I tried putting all fields into a
single giant field and prefixing each term with + but that loses the ability
to boost individual fields in the search (unless there is a way to add a
boost per term indexed at index time?) so it doesn't seem a good solution as
I need the boosting too.

Anyone any idea how to do this ? BooleanClause.Occur.MUST would force all
terms to be in all fields, I would have thought - and the ability to do
weighting is important to me.

I'm using Lucene 2.2.0.

Thanks for any help !
