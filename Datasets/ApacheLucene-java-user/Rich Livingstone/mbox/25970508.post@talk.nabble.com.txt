SUBJECT: RE: How to make each term of query appear in at least one field of multiple field query
DATE: 20 Oct 2009


Good idea, Steve, thanks for that. It could end up being a very large query,
though, and my search is even more complicated by the fact I have to do
synonym expansion on the search too so

+(field1:term1^field1boost field2:term1^field2boost ...)
+(field1:term2^field1boost field2:term2^field2boost ...)

could turn into

+(field1:term1^field1boost field1:term1synonym1^field1boost
term1synonym2^field1boost  field2:term1^field2boost ...)
...

I thought about doing the expansion at indexing time but that makes it less
dynamic as changes require a reindexing and this is driving an ecommerce
website which might not take kindly to search downtime too often.

The javadocs for MultiFieldQueryParser also suggest that using this class by
creating an object & then calling parse, rather than using
MultiFieldQueryParser.parse which is what I do, could achieve the same
effect. At the moment I'm sort of working round this by doing 2 queries, one
on a concatenated field which determines the valid set of hits and doing a
union of that with a search that actually takes into account weightings
properly. Seems to work but 2 searches is obviously not so good !

I'll give it a whirl and post my results.
