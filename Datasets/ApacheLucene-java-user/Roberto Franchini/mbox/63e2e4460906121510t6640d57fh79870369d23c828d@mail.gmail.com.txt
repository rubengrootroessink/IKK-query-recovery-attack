write each document, optimize the index, then close the index writer.  The problems comes
about in the second 1000.  Somewhere in writing the second 1000 I start to get a Too many
files open exception.  What I don't understand is why I can write the first 1000 with no
problem, optimize and close the writer and then have a problem the next time around.

1024 is too low. For a desktop machine too! So increase it.
