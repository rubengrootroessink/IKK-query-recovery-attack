Hello,

I am indexing documents which may have more than one title and I would like
to be able to search these titles separately.
For example, a document may have two titles, "Jakarta Lucene" and "Powerful
search engine".
A search on 'lucene AND jakarta' should return this document but a search on
'lucene AND search' should not return it.

Is there a way to achieve this?

Thanks,
Romain
