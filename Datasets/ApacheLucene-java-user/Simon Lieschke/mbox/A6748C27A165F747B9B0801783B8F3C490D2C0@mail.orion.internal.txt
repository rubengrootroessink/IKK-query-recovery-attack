Yes, there is.

But as far as I can tell, the intention of the example code is to provide a searchable date
field. Problem is that the modified date is stored in a format that isn't very "human searchable".
As I've had no replies saying otherwise, I beginning to think there indeed is a flaw in the
implementation of the sample code here.

Cheers,


Simon

Simon,

I believe there's another method in DateField that converts the value into a
human readable form.

Regards,

Terry

The example code that ships with Lucene includes the following snippet in
HTMLDocument.java:

    // Add the last modified date of the file a field named "modified".  Use
a
    // Keyword field, so that it's searchable, but so that no attempt is
made
    // to tokenize the field into words.
    doc.add(Field.Keyword("modified",
  DateField.timeToString(f.lastModified())));

Now, I guess the point of this is so that we can search for HTML documents
using Lucene's range search syntax. But as far as I can tell, the result of
DateField.timeToString(f.lastModified()) returns a non-human readable date
format, hence the modified field will not really be "human searchable"
format. Is this an oversight in the example implementation, or am I just
missing something else here?

Thanks in advance,


Simon
