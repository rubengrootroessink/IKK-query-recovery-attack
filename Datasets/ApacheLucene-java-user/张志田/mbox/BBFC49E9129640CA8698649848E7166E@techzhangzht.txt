Lucene considers an index with a single .cfx and a single .cfs as optimized.

Also, note that how Lucene stores files in the index is an impl detail
-- it can change from release to release -- so relying on any of these
details is dangerous.

That said, with recent Lucene versions, if you really want to force
these two files to be consolidated, you can make a custom MergePolicy
that returns a merge from the findMergesForOptimize for this case (the
default MergePolicy returns null since it thinks this case is already
optimized).

Or... if you index with two separate IndexWriter sessions, and then
call optimize, that should also merge down to one file.

> Hi all,

> I have an index task which will index thousands of records with lucene 3.0.1. My confusion
is lucene will always create a .cfx and a .cfs file in the file system, sometimes more, while
I thought it should create a single .cfs file if I optimize the index data. Is it by design?
If yes, is there any way/configuration I can do to merge all of the index files into a singe
one?
>
> By the way, I have a logic to validate the index data, if the size of .cfs increases
dramatically comparing to the file generated last time, there may be something wrong, a warning
message will be threw. This is the reason that I want to generate a single .cfs file. Any
other suggestion about the index validation?
