Updating the standard analyzer BNF to allow terms with punctuation is  
not a
big deal. If there is a list of terms you want to allow, you would  
handle
them in a TokenFilter. See StandadardTokenizer and StandardFilter.

You might save a couple of clock ticks by implementing a BNF rule rather
than a filter though.
