You have a product data management software of some sort that use  
MySQL via Hibernate for persistency, and now you want to use Lucene  
to search the data?

What possible solutions did you find, and what was the problem with  
these?

My guess is that very few people in this forum knows how Windchill  
works, what a WTPart is or what the complexity of the system is in a  
persistent state. So you probably need to explain your requirements a  
bit more in order to get a helpful answer or discussion going.
