Much clearer now, thanks.

Deleted as in still available in the segment and noted in the delted  
file, but not optimized and IllegalArgumentException thrown in case  
of IndexReader.document(n)? At least I think that is the way a  
Directory works?

I ask because you write that it withinin parantheses.

Does the consumers of this method really want to take the number of  
documents that is not accessible in account too, or is that just  
something that is done for optimization reasons?

Luckely only in the IndexWriter of my alternate RAM index. :)


In essence, should I return
   index.getDocumentsByNumber().size() - index.getDeletedDocuments 
().size() + unflushedDocuments.size();
or
   index.getDocumentsByNumber().size() + unflushedDocuments.size();
?
