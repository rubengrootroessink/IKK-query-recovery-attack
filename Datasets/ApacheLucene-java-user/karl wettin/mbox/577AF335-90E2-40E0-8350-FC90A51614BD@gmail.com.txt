There is some fairly advanced caching on top of the Searcher going on
in both Solr and LUCENE-550. In some cases I've using nothing more
than a simple Map<Query, ScoreDoc[]> cleared on index updates and seen
the CPU go from 1% idle to 90% idle.

What you should use really depends on your index and how the users act.
