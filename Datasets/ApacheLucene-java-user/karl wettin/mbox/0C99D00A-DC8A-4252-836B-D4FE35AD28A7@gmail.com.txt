You will have to do something like this (dry-coded and not tested):

List<YourBusinessObject> ybos = ...
IndexWriter iw = ...

for (YourBusinessObject ybo : ybos) {
   Document d = new Document();
   d.add(new Field("documentID", String.valueOf(ybo.getID()),  
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.YES));
   d.add(new Field("title", ybo.getTitle(), Field.Store.NO,  
Field.Index.YES));
   d.add(new Field("content", ybo.getDescription(), Field.Store.NO,  
Field.Index.YES));
   iw.add(d);
}

iw.close();

You will now be able to retreive the stored value of field docuemntID  
from documents in your index.


Hope this helps.
