The idea with stop words is to keep the index as small as possible  
without major loss of features, thus they ought to be frequently  
occuring words with little or no semantic meaning. What these words  
are really depends on language, corpus, et c.

My guess is that they are manually choosen from a corpus term  
frequency vector.

If you have no knowledge of the language for wich you wish to produce  
stop words, then it will be fairly hard to know what to consider a  
stop word. You might be able to consider it as a text classification  
problem. Feature/attribute selection for classifiers is a well  
researched subject. Weka, Yale, R, et c are all tools that might help  
you. But I honestly think no matter how you turn and twist the data,  
manually choosing the stop words is the way to go.
