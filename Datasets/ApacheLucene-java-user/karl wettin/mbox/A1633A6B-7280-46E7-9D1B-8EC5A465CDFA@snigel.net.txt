You might be looking for stem-analysis? You can, for instance, take a  
look at the snowball stemmers.

Wildcards would be if the user enters 'fast* car'.

But to answer your question, there is no SpanWildcardQuery as far as  
I know. You could make one though. And I can imagine it would, just  
as SpanFuzzyQuery, be really slow and virtually unusable in the hand  
of the users.
