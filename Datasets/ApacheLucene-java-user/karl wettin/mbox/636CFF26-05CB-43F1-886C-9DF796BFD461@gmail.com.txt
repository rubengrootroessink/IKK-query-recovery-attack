I did not look any closer at this than reading you post, but what  
about if you made sure that no empty strings is passed to the  
QueryParser?

I'd expect an exception if I passed a string to a parser that did not  
match the grammar defined by it. And the QueryParser is a parser, not  
a searcher. It apptempts to parse a query from the string value. If  
it was to do nothing then it would return null. And that would just  
cause another exception.
