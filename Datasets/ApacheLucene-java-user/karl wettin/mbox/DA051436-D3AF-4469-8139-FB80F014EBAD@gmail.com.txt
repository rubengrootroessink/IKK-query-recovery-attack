I'm not sure if you mean that it should treat all repetative tokens  
as only one token? Then you are better of using a filter when  
analyzing text you insert to the index: rather than creating one  
token for each the in "the the the the the the" you only create one.  
You might also want to use this filter when parsing user queries. (It  
will be hard to find the band 'the the'.)

If not and what you write above is all you want to match, nothing  
more, nothing less, then you could do something like this:

(dry coded and untested.)

int n = 3; // the; the the; the the the
String field = "title";
String token = "the";
BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
for (int i=0;i<n;i++) {
   Term[] terms = new Term[i+2];
   terms[0] = new Term(field, "^");
   for (int j=0;j<i;j++) {
     terms[j+1] = new Term(field, token);
   }
   terms[i+2] = new Term(field, "$");
   bq.add(new BooleanClause(new PhraseQuery(terms, 0), Orrcurs.SHOULD);
}


I hope this helps.
