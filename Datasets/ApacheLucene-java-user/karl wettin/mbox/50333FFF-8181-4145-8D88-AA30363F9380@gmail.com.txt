You can train it with any data you want. So you would need to figure  
out what people probably will be searching for. The first thing I can  
think of is to extract the most frequenct n grams at a word level in  
your title field, or so. It is tough to say what might actually work.  
Frequent phrases in the corpus might have nothing to do with consumer  
popularity.

If I understand everyhing, your application is installed locally on  
consumer machines. Perhaps you could allow end users to share  
anonymous data based on taste and build a set per end user.  
Collaborative filtering comes to mind. Reducing a data set to  
something relevant usually equals behavioural analysis.

Hope this helps.
