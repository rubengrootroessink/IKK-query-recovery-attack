If the content of your corpus is static enough, then time is the  
friend that will enable you gather enough user queries to build the  
suggestion data set.

Otherwise you have to produce simulated user queries by reducing your  
data set to the most common information. Perhaps using Markov chains,  
top n paths of terms with Dijkstra or so could be an easy way out.  
You can also start looking at the documents people choose to inspect,  
and use these as the base for phrase training.

I think you will get further considering this from a behavioral  
psychology angle rather than how to access the  corpus access  
problem. Also, navigating a reduced data set (such as the trie in  
LUCENE-625 compared to the corpus it suggests to) will save you a lot  
of system resources.

Hope this helps some.
