You probably need to explain the reason for splitting them up in  
order to get a good answer to that. And how big are they?

Without knowing anything about your application I say: merge them all  
to one and add a field you apply to a boolean clause.
But with a few hundred indices it sounds like you have a design plan  
that don't work with above.
