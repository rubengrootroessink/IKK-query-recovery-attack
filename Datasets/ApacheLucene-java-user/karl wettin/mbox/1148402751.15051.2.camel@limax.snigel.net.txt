Try to create a new instance of SpellChecker for each suggestion. Will
it work? Then you have hit the bug where the per instance float for
maximum score (accuracy) is modified instead of using it local in the
method.

Something like this:

public String[] suggestSimilair(... {
    float accuracy = this.accuracy // add this line in
}

I'll pop a patch in the Jira later today.
