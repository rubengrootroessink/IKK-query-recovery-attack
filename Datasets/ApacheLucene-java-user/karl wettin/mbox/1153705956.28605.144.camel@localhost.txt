I'm want to filter words with a dash in them.

["x-men"]
["xmen"]
["x", "men"]

All of above should be synonyms. The problem is ["x", "men"] requiring a
distance between the terms and thus also matching "x-men men". Or? How
about storing ["x", "men"] as the first term and the use set a negative
position increment?

I could just try that prior to posting, :) but choose not to as I have a
feeling many of you already implemented something like this, that there
are multiple solutions to the problem?
