I think the big undertaking would be to refactor all of Lucene to use  
longs as document numbers.

But not in the store. There it would still be integers, and the  
MultiReader can keep track of Integer.MAX_VALUE stores.  
Integer.MAX_VALUE*Integer.MAX_VALUE = Long.MAX_VALUE. So there would  
not have to be any arrays around with a length greater than  
Integer.MAX_VALUE?

class SegmentReader extends IndexReader {

+  private int documentNumber(long n) throws IOException {
+    if (n > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
+      throw new IOException("Max " + Integer.MAX_VALUE + " documents  
in a Segement!");
+    }
+    return (int)n;
+  }

-  protected void doDelete(int docNum) {
+  protected void doDelete(long longDocNum) {
+    int docNum = documentNumber(longDocNum);

    ...

But lets not do that right away now.

And as we are on the subject of things not to be implemented anytime  
soon, I would like a layer of JXTA (or so) via bluetooth for Lucene  
on J2ME for mining purposes.

I'm serious.

As always in the the future, people will walk around with a  
communicator in the pocket. It will keep track of all your movies,  
music, drink recipes, and all that other important stuff. And your  
preferences about them. And of course, lots of big brother related  
things too. About you and about other people that might be  
interesting for you to know what they have been doing. And how much  
you trust them. And how much you like them. With the use of neat  
technology the collective intelligence and karma of these devices  
will ensure that all of us get to listen to great music all the time,  
drink the things we will enjoy the most at the moment, only meet  
interesting people all the time, and all that. Most important, it  
will supprise us. It will be great, so remeber where you heard about  
it the first time!
