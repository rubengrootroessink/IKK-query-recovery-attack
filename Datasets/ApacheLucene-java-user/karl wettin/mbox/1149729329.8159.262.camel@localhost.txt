Something just hit me.

Perhaps it would be interesting for you to track sessions that search
for the same thing but don't seem to find what they are looking for (no
clicks on the hits) and refine their query until they find what they
found something (click on the hit). Associate the "bad queries" with
that document. When some threshold is reached for a document in a "bad
query" you add it to the hits of such a query.

"People who first place the query Q usually refined the query in any way
and ended up clicking on document D1, D2 or D3".

That might be easy enough and yield fairly good results.

But watch it so that you don't end up writing a very complex and
resource consuming spell checker.

(I usually work the results and not the query as users generally have
bad query skills. And queries can have the same semantic even though
they are assembled in totally different ways.)
