SUBJECT: MultiSearcher vs IndexSearcher(new MultiReader
DATE: 21 Feb 2007

Could someone enlighten me a bit about the subject? When do I want to  
use a MultiSearcher rather than a searcher running of a MultiReader?  
There seems to be a bunch of limitations in the MultiSearcher, and it  
is these that made me curious.
