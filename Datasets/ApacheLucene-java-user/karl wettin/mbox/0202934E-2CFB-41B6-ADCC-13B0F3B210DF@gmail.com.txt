The simplest solution is to tokenize your index and queries as  
ngrams. However, it can turn out to be quite expensive to bash the  
index with 2-10 times as many queries as it is used to. If you have a  
really busy system, try to reduce the auto-complete corpus to what is  
popular.

LUCENE-625 is a solution that use a trie-pattern rather than Lucene.  
It learn and adapt on user behavior. I.e. it require user activity.  
But if you have that, this is what I recommend for a speedy auto- 
complete.
