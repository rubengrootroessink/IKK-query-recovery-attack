We don't really know what your problem is. Explaining that rathern  
than the solution you have thought of might render a couple of  
alternate solutions. Perhaps something could be precalculated and  
stored in the documents. Perhaps feature selection (reduction) of the  
terms might do the trick for you. And so on.

Let me pull some questions out of nowhere that might help: How slow  
is it, and how fast did you expect it to be? How many documents does  
your queries normally yeild in? Can you limit the evaulation to the  
top n documents?

As Lucene primarily is an inverted index the document vector space  
model is not available in any other fashion than the term frequency  
vectors, or building them from scratch by enumerating the whole  
index. The latter of course beeing horrible slow in most cases.
