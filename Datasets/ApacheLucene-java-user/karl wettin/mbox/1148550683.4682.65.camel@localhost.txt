Did anyone write some neat tool for statistical analysis of hits over
time? I need one. And it must be fast. Was thinking something like this:

List<TimeFrame> timeFrames;

class TimeFrame {
  Date from;
  Date to;

  void add(Hits hits) {
    int score = 10;
    for (int d = 0; score<0 && d<hits.length(); d++) {          
      increaseScore(it.next(), score);
      score--;
    } 

    // I would then apply similar scoring on most top classifications
    // (categories or what not) in the hits.
  }  
}


But I only work the hits. Perhaps I should work the queries too?

Any great ideas?
