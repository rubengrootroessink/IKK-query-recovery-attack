It is a good thought, but as number of locales grows with similar
languages you'll get deterministic errors in the lexer. So I would
absolutely recommend one grammar file per language. Not sure if JavaCC
allows inheritance, but with ANTlr this would be a very simple and
effective way to solve the problem.
