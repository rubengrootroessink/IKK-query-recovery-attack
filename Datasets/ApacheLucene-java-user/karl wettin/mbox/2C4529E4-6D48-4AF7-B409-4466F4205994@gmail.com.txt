There is this one place where I use it. The index is add only, and  
the only data that interests me is the stored field MyID, also kept  
track in an int[docid]. In case of index operation that change docid,  
I simply repopulate the int[].

I throw this MyID value around quite a bit, starting in the hit  
collector. It save me time from deserializing all hits.

Is this reasonable?
