You can do that with IndexWriter#deleteDocuments(Term)

And if Lucene.Net does not support that, can you try doing it by  
searching and deleting just to see how it changes the outcome?

That is a fairly large amount of code. And as it is C# I have nothing  
to test it on. Too much for me to compile and run in the head. I was  
hoping for a few line of code that demonstrated the problem and  
nothing else.
