Right, but /why/ do you need these values? Do you present them as  
they are, or do you use them for some secondary calculation? Then  
what is the result of this secondary calculation?

I'll reask of of the questions I placed in my previous reply:

>> How slow is it, and how fast did you expect it to be?

>> Can you limit the evaulation to the top n documents?
