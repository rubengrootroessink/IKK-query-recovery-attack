There is now pretty good support for multiple words in <https:// 
issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-626>.


     addDocument(indexWriter, field, "heroes of might and magic III  
complete");
     addDocument(indexWriter, field, "it might be the best game ever  
made");

     assertEquals("heroes of might and magic", suggester.didYouMean 
("hereos of magic and might"));
     assertEquals("heroes of might and magic", suggester.didYouMean 
("hereos of light and magic"));
     assertEquals("heroes might magic", suggester.didYouMean("magic  
light heros"));
     assertEquals("best game made", suggester.didYouMean("game best  
made"));
     assertEquals("game made", suggester.didYouMean("made game"));
     assertEquals("game made", suggester.didYouMean("made lame"));
     assertEquals(null, suggester.didYouMean("may game"));
