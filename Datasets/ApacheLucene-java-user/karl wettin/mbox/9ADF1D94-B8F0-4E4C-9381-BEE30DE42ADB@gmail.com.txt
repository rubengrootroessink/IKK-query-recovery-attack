In the original post you mention 2-10 million documents. How much is  
that is bytes?

If you can fit it in RAM, I think that http://issues.apache.org/jira/ 
browse/LUCENE-550
could be your friend. It keeps each document as an instance in  
memory. Extend the
InstantiatedIndexDocument class with an association to the user  
owning the document.

I wrote the index for this particular case where I due to very heavy  
load needed to
retreive some 100,000 aggregated class instances per second, based on  
a field value.
