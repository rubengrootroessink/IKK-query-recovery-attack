Sorry, I read your post too fast. You are right, 3.0 may or may not  
be able to read 2.0 indices.

I'm curious, why is migrating the index not OK when it is OK to  
upgrade the software? It doesn't really add up in my head.

One solution would be to load the 2.0-jar from a secondary  
classloader. But that is probably not what you want though.
