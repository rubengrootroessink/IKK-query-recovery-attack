I recommend you to take a look at the spell checker in <http:// 
www.alias-i.com/lingpipe/>. Make sure to read the license agreement  
as it might not be free of charge for you.

I've posted <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-626>, an  
Adaptive, user query session analyzing spell checker. It learns from  
the misstakes and corrections users do, similar to how Google does it.

It will of course require a lot of people placing searches to work,  
but the longer it runs, the better. I've got one that has been  
running on a very busy place for 6 months now, and it is actually  
getting fairly good now.

I have many ideas about what one can do to make it better and learn  
faster.
