It could probably be done, but would be quite an expensive query to  
place.

However, a request like this usually tiggers questions about the  
design of an index with such needs. There is probably a better  
solution. Start by telling us about the data you have inserted to the  
index, and what it is you try to achieve.

In essence, Lucene is not a relational database.
