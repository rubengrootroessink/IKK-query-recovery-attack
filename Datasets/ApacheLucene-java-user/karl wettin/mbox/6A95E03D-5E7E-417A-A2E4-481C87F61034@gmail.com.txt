I'm not completely sure what you are asking, so I hope this helps:

If you passed a Directory to the IndexSearcher constructor the  
IndexReader within will be created at IndexSearcher construction time  
and closed at IndexSearcher close time.

If you passed an IndexReader to the IndexSearcher constructor, then  
the IndexReader will not be closed when the IndexSearcher closes. If  
you do it this way be careful not to leave unused open IndexReader:s  
around, as they consume memory.

An IndexSearcher requires the IndexReader associated with it to be  
open, and the same goes for any Hits produced by that IndexSearcher.  
However, the results in Hits are cached, so even if you close the  
IndexReader you will be able to access the top n accessed documents.  
You will always be able to access the document numbers and their  
score, as that does not require any access of the IndexReader. I.e.  
accessing documents from Hits requires an open IndexReader.
