Why is it not a satisfying solution? Is tokenization really such a  
burdon to your system? Is your CPU at 100% at all times? Are you  
really adding that many documents to you index?

One solution would be to add the document in a contrib/memory index,  
do your secondary analysis, update the document and then add it to  
your primary index if applicable.

Another solution would be to implement pre-analyzed fields. There is  
an old outdated patch of mine that does that, <https:// 
issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-580>.
