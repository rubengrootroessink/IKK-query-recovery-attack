Given you don't have too many users, you could do it the other way  
around, storing
the distance to all users from each document.

But the bottom line really is that Lucene is not designed for this  
sort of thing.

If I was you, I would make a filter that navigates an in heap object  
graph of all
users and their connections using a breadth first (or perhaps even  
A*). I'm
certain it will turn out to be much simpler to maintain, and probably  
several
thousand times faster than implementing such a feature in the Lucene  
storage.
