Right, you can't do a toString prior to rewriting it. The problem is of
course that the rewritten query contains lots of possible choises for
the fuzzy term, extracted from the IndexReader passed when rewriting it.

If you reallt really want to inspect the rewritten query, create a new
instance and pass on the IndexReader. This will be slow though. In fact,
fuzzy span is quite slow by it self.

By the way, what do you plan to use it for? I use it as a very crued
text mining classifier, never exposed to the end user.
