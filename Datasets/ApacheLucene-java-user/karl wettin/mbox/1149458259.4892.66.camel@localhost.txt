SUBJECT: query parser field name aliases
DATE: 4 Jun 2006

I was thinking it could be nice if the query parser handled aliases by
passing a Map to the parser. The data could be compiled from the index.

"name", "nam", "na" and "n" all trigger on "name", taking there is no
other field starting with an "n". 

Did anyone implement this, or should I hack one up?
