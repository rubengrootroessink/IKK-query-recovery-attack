Marcus is trying to use the norms to enforce results in chronological
order when matching a TB-sized corpus. He can't get any speed by sorting
on a date field.

Here is an idea:

Never delete documents. Use unsafe document number as system clock. Make
sure TermDocs always return references in reversed chronological order
and write a HitCollector that does not re-order.

That should work, right?
