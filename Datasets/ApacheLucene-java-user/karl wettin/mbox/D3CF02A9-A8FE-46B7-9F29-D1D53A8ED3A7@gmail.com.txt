SUBJECT: TerraCotta cluster Lucene

Some people might find this interesting. I have personally not looked  
at it in depth:

Engineers at TerraCotta have detailed a new way to cluster lucene,  
the popular text search library from Apache. Their method involves  
implementing the lucene RAMDirectory interface and using TerraCotta  
DSO to share the RAMDirectory across JVMs.
