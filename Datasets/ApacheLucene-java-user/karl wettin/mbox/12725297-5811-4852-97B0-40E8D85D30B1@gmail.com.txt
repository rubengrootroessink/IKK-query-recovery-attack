Without having looked at the code for a long time, I think the  
problem is what the lucene scoring consider to be best. First the  
grams are searched, resulting in a number of hits. Then the edit- 
distance is calculated on each hit. "Genetics" is appearently the  
third most similar hit according to Lucene, but the best according to  
Levenshtein.

I.e. Lucene does not use edit-distance as similarity. You need to get  
a bunch of best hits in order to find the one with the smallest edit- 
distance.


Hope this helps.
