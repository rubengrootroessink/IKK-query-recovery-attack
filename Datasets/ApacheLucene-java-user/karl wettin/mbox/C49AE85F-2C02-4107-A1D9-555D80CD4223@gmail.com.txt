Must have thought of it as a MultiSearcher working rather than the  
MultiReader, sorry about that. Any year now I'll take a better look  
at scoring. I presume that is the problem with a MultiSearcher  
(unless some really silly similarity or so?).

I started digging in to MultiReader to understand whats going on, but  
mostly in a desperate attempt to save my face.

My first attempt was to mess with MultiReader.maxDoc, to make it  
start on Integer.MIN_VALUE rather than 0 to allow four billion rather  
than two billion documents. An immediate hack resulted in a lot of  
negative array sized and similar mess.

Then it hit me that perheps the integer limitation should be in the  
store (Directory) and not the IndexReader? If not now, perhaps in the  
future when everybody is running on 64bit JVMs. I don't think it will  
be a very expensive thing to implement. But did anyone need that yet?

Two billion documents is quite an amount, but it is not an insane and  
unthinkable number. I doubt that I'll hit something like that anytime  
soon, but it should not be that hard or expensive to refactor Lucene  
to support the 18 billion billion (18 followed by 19 zeros) documents  
a long can count to.

I'll stop trolling now. :)
