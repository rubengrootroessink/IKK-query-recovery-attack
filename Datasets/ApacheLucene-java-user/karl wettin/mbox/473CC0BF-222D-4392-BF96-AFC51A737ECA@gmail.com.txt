You can also try InstantiatedIndex, similair in speed and design with  
a MemoryIndex, but can handle multiple documents, IndexReader,  
IndexWriter, IndexModifier et.c. just like any Directory  
implementation. It requires a minor patch to the Lucene core.

I have a more updated version on my local system. (Actually, I'm  
working full time on improving the code and adding benches this and  
next week.)
