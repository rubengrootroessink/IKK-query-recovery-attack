There is of course a cost of RAM and CPU involved with flyweighting  
instances. In order to win the CPU costs back you need to do compare  
an instance to something else more than once. Thats pretty much it, I  
think. There might also be some weak/soft/whatnot reference costs  
involving values passed to String.intern, but I'm not sure.
