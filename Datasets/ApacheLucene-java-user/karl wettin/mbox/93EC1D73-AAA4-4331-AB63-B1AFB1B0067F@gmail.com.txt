SUBJECT: Reduction based "more like this"?
DATE: 9 Feb 2007

I just woke up thinking it would be cool to attempt reducing the data  
of all documents using PCA (or so) and store the output in a new  
field per dimention introduced in order to find similair documents by  
placing a simple proximity query. Did anyone attempt something like  
this?

I did not think this through that much. Nor do I need this feature.  
Just think it would be a cool experiment.
