Are you really sure Google does this? It would surprise me if they did.

As far as I know, there is no such thing implemented. Mechanisms that  
change based on user input are commonly known as "adaptive". You  
might want to search for something like that. I would personally  
implement it as a second level scoring in a HitCollector. It might be  
tricky to get it optimized though.

I hope this helps.
