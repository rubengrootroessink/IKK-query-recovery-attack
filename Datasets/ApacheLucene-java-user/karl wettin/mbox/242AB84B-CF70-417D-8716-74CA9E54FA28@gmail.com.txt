What about alternative solutions to avoid change of document numbers?  
That would be an alternative solution for me. Perhaps something like  
adding dummy documents, marking them deleted even after merge or so?  
What would the effects or implications be?

I'll probably just hack something in there, but would of course  
welcome a discussion on some sort of policy interface design.
