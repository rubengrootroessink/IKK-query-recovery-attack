If you do some language specific token analysis such as stemming, yes.

Detecting the language on such small texts is sort of tricky though.  
You might want to introduce more dimensions in the classifier: user  
location, user locale, et c. Perhaps you want to store stemmed data  
in language specific fields. It might also be a good idea to place an  
initial query and re-classifiy to one of the top n scoring language  
and then replace the query.

The easiest way out is to simply ask the user what language they want  
to search in. And that seems to be the most common.
