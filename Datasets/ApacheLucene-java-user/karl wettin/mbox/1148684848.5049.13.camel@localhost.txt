If you know what analyzers you used, all values are stored (in the index
or somewhere else) and have some way to identify a document, then it is
easy to build a new document, delete the old and add the new.

It is possible to to merge new fields to existing documents in an index,
but it is not very easy. Nor is it fast. Luke contains code that tampers
with your index.
