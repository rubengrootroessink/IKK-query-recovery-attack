I've been looking close at this, but for Swedish. The major problem in
that case is how a composite word generally have totaly diffrent
sematincs compared to the parts. Here is a classic school example:

"En brun hårig sjuk sköterska" 
A brown hairy sick care taker

"En brunhårig sjuksköterska"
A brunette nurse


Thus it is not very helpful to index the composite parts by them self.
It is really a problem to be handled by a spell checker. So I wrote and
posted the Jira issue 626, an adaptive session analysing spell checker.
It makes recommendations based on how previous users changed their
queries. davinci -> da vinci. heroes iii -> heroes 3. And so on.

This strategy does however require quite some user traffic.
