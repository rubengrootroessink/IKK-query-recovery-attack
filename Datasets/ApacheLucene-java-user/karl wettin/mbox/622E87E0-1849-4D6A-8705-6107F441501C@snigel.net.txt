I'm not sure I understand your question. How to install Lucene?  
Lucene is not something you install and run. It is an API and you  
have to do a bit of coding in order for Lucene to do something.  
Perhaps Egothor (another open search engine written in Java) suits  
better if you just want it working out of the box.
