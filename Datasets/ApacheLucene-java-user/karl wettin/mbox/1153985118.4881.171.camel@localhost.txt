No offense, but your current solution is not viable. What you need is to
rewrite the code that handles your index, not a workaround. Or you could
wait for the new deleteDocument method in IndexWriter. Not sure when
that will be around though.

You release the lock by closing the reader... It is also possible to
plain old skip the creating of locks using -DdisableLuceneLocks=true,
but that might cause many other problems for you.

You are aware that no document will be deleted from the index until you
close the reader? If you keep a reader open at all times just for
deleting documents and never close it, they will not be deleted.

If you need to update lots of documents in your corpus (delete and add)
then first delete the documents with the reader, close it and add them
again with the writer. And then close the writer when you are done. And
don't open it again until you need to add documents again.
