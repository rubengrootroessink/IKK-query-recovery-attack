Sorry for flooding. Here is a class diagram (go fixed size font) of  
what I want to do:

[MyTokenizedClass](field)-- {0..*} | {0..1} --[Token]<- - - <<query>>  
- -[Searchable]
                                    |
                                    \---[Offset]

I want to store all the tokens in the realm of my application. I do  
not want to use the IndexWriter to analyze and tokenize my fields.  I  
do that my self.

I only want the query mechanism of Lucene.
