My immediate thought when reading this is if it really is a text  
search engine you want to use for this?

If it is, how do you process the log? What fields to you split it up  
in and what analyzsers do you use? Optimizing the use of that is  
probably you best way to achieve better speed when appending  
documents to the index.
