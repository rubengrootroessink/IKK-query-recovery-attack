Not that I know.

Might be slow, but you can work the TermFreqVector. It would probably be
best to store this data in an alternative index.

I would start with making it an all in memory index using Maps and hard
links. Then use your favorite object mapping layer to store the
information. Perhaps java.io.Serializable is enough.
 
Weka is a really nice data mining library. You should post the same
question to them, and tell them what you try to achieve with this data. 

Perhaps they have some really nice classifier for you. 

Feel free to report back here.
