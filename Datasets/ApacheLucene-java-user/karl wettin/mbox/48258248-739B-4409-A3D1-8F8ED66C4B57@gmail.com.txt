You tried to parse the string "OR" as a query. AND, OR and NOT are  
treated as boolean operators by the query parser, and a query that  
match the operator is expected.

<http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html>:

Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators.  
Lucene supports AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" as Boolean operators(Note:  
Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS).

If your index is case sensitive, what if you type "OR" (with quotes)  
instead?
If you index is not case sensitve, use "or" (without quotes) instead.
