I was trying out Matcher some month ago when fooling around with ways  
of improving speed in the "active search cache" of LUCENE-550. It  
worked just fine for me. I made no futher investigations, nor do I  
have any performance details. I plan to implement it in there for  
real any year now.

So +1 for commit.
