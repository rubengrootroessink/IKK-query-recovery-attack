SUBJECT: Using Lucene for searching tokens, not storing them.
DATE: 14 Apr 2006

I would like to store all in my application rather than using the  
Lucene persistency mechanism for tokens. I only want the search  
mechanism. I do not need the IndexReader and IndexWriter as that will  
be a natural part of my application. I only want to use the Searchable.

So I looked at extending my own. Tried to follow the code. Is there  
UML or something that describes the code and the process? Would very  
much appreciate someone telling me what I need to do :-)

Perhaps there is some implementation I should take a look at?

Memory consumption is not an issue. What do I need to consider for  
the CPU?
