If you don't know the field names you'll have to use the IndexReader to
iterate available fields:

http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html

getFieldNames(IndexReader.FieldOption fldOption) 
          Get a list of unique field names that exist in this index and
have the specified field option information.
