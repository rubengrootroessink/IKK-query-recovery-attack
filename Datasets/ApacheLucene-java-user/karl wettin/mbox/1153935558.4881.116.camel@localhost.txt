My guess is that you keep a writer open even though there is no activity
involving adding new documents. Unless I have a massive never ending
stream of new data arriving (many thousand per minute) I usually try not
to have an open writer. Opening, adding documents and closing the writer
in iterations.

It will help if you posted some code showing how you handle the writer.

You probably should not have to do that.
