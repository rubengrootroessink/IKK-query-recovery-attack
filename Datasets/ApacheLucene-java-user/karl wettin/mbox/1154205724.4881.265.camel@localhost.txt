Instead of above I would probably choose an int[index size] where each
position in the array represents the global order of that document. It's
much easier to re-order that than re-indexing the whole corpus every
time you want to insert something.

It limits your corpus to 2 billion items (Integer.MAX_VALUE). And it
will consume 32 bits of RAM per document.
