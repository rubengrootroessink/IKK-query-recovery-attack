Limax is a Java 1.5 @annotation and reflection powered transactional  
object storage and tokenization framework for Lucene, distributed  
under the Apache license.

There are no external dependencies. Lucene is used for object storage  
and index.

This is version 0.1 beta 1. If you do look at it, please let me know  
what you think of the API. It works, but I'm sure there are plenty of  
bugs I have not yet encountered.
