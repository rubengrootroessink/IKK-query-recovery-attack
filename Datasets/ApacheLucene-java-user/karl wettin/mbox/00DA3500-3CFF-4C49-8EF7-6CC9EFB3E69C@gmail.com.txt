I can't get the benchmarker to start from ant. I'm running the  
current SVN snapshot.

Lucene isn't found in the classpath. But where should I place my  
lucene.jar? I see it beeing referenced to in the build.xml, but the  
path differs from the dependencies in ./lib.

Please advice, I've been noob blinded level 2 by the ant script.
