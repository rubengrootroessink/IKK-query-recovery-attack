SUBJECT: Re: Distinct terms values? (like in Luke)
DATE: 10 May 2009

Don't mean to hijack this thread, but I have a related question:

Is there also a way to filter the terms based on another field?

For example, the documents might also contain the field "published  
date", so I want to get a distinct list of values for the term  
"religion" in documents published within a range of dates.

Thanks
Jeff
