Hi,

I was trying to build Lucene with JavaCC 3.0 and completly got lost.

Sorry about the dummy question, but where can I download the patch?

I tried the bug URL, and was able to download JavaCC_3.java, but the last
attachment is this big text file
and I cannot figure out what to do with it.

As I understand build.xml should be changed and javacc3-ant-support.jar
should be somewhere but I cannot find it.

Thanks,
lily
