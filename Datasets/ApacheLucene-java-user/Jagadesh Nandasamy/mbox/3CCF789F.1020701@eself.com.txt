Hi,
     I do not totally agree that in lucene *og would not match 'dog'.

     public ArrayList wildCardSearch(String query) throws Exception {
         
        String fieldsToSearch[] = { "fieldOne","path","date","uniqueId" };
        ArrayList docList  = new ArrayList();

        for(int i=0; i<fieldsToSearch.length; i++){
           
            BooleanQuery bQuery = new BooleanQuery();
            WildcardQuery wQuery = new WildcardQuery( new 
Term( fieldsToSearch[i], query ) );
           
            bQuery.add( wQuery, true, false );
 
            Hits hits = searcher.search(bQuery);           

            for(int j=0; j<hits.length(); j++){
                Document doc = hits.doc(j);
                docList.add(doc);
            }
             return docList;
     }

      Take this as a hint and work around it. It surely is working for me
       also take a look at this
