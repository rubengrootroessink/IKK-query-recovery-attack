Hi, I'm trying to modify the StandardTokenizer, in order to get to get a
good tokenization for my needs.
Basically I would like to separate two tokens when I find an apostrophe. I
think I should modify the StandardTokenizer.jj file to do that, but I'm in
trouble while changing the grammar. Can someone help me with the right
syntax?
Thanks,
Lorenzo
