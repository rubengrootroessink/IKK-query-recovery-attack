Some months ago I created an index from the reuters collection. I converted
the SGML files to XML using a tool that I've found somewhere on the net
(just google for it), then I parsed the files to create the index, using a
standard DOM parser. If you have problems parsing the SGML files I think you
should consider converting the files to XML. Otherwise post a sketch of your
indexing code to get some help.
