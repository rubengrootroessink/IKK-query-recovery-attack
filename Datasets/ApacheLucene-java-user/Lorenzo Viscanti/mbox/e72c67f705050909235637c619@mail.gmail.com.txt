SUBJECT: Re: Difference between minMergeDocs and mergeFactor
DATE: 9 May 2005

Hi Barbara, while mergeFactor deals with the size of new segments and the 
number of segments in the index, minMergeDocs deals only with the size of 
new segments.
minMergeDocs sets the number of documents a new segment must contain before 
it is written from RAM to the index. So does mergeFactor; in addition to 
that mergeFactor sets at the same time the maximum number of segments that 
will be present in the index. When the number is equal to mergeFactor Lucene 
tries to merge all the segments into a new one.
Ciao,
Lorenzo
