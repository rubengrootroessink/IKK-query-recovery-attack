Thanks Mike.

So can I say that calling optimzie() is really optional?  Because I was
worrying that these deleted documents would never get cleaned if I don't run
optimize() and eventually it would run out of the disk space.  What I am
trying to figure out here is if optimization is mandatory.  I know that
optimization would improve the search performance, however it would take a
long time to run and the application I am writing needs to update the index
very frequently.  According to "Lucene in Action", running optimization is
not recommended in my case.  So would you please advise?

Thanks,
Dan
