SUBJECT: How did Lucene clean out the deleted documents from the disk?
DATE: 18 Jul 2008


Hello,

Could someone please confirm that calling indexWriter.optimize() is the only
way to clean out the deleted documents from the disk?

I understand that indexWriter.deleteDocuments() does not clean the disk
space, and I tested that calling after indexWriter.flush() and
indexWriter.close() after indexWriter.deleteDocuments() does not clean the
disk space either.  So do they only mark the documents have been deleted,
then which method really do the "delete" the documents (from the disk)?

Thanks,
Dan
