SUBJECT: Indexing Yes and No
DATE: 12 Mar 2008


Querying Lucene with

includeNews:Yes

Works fine and brings back expected results..

includeNews:No

Does not work and brings back nothing..

There are definitely documents in my index that has the word "No" in the
includeNews field.

Tested in Luke with all the analyzers.

Any ideas? Any thoughts? Any workarounds..? 

Any help much appreciated.

Thanks

Raq
