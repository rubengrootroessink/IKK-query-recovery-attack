The best strategy.

Hello.
I want to ask you opinion about to "How
store multiple fields of same document".

I see now two possibility's.
1. Multiple fields in document
2. One filed: for example named PROPERTIES, with multiple instances.
  And values combined with name for example “name@value”

What choice the best for search speed and resource usage?

Thanks.
