In example  I want to show what I  stored field as  Field.Index.NO_NORMS

As I understand it means what field contains original string
despite what analyzer I chose(StandardAnalyzer by default).

All querys I made myself without using Parsers.
For example new TermQuery(new Term(“filed”, “MaMa”));


I agree with you about possible implementation,
but it increase size of index at times.

But are there other possibilities, such as using  custom query, possibly
similar to  RegexQuery,RegexTermEnum that would compare terms
at it's  own discretion?
