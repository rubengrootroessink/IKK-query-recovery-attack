Hi,

Is it possible to scale lucene indexing like 2000/3000 documents per
second?  I need to index 10 fields each with 20 bytes long.  I should be
able to search by just giving any of the field values as criteria. I need to
get the count that has same field values.

Will it be possible?

with regards,
MSK
