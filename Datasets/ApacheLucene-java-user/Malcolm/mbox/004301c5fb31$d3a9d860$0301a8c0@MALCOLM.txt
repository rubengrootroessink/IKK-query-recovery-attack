Firstly you should obtain LUKE and check everything is layed out correctly 
in your index.
Secondly maybe a Wildcard/prefix query or termquery.for example(termquery):

TermQuery heTerm = new TermQuery(
           new Term("p",
               "x"));
   TermQuery sheTerm = new TermQuery(
           new Term("p",
               "xx"));
   TermQuery theyTerm = new TermQuery(
           new Term("p",
               "xxx"));

I'm sure the folks on here will be able to come up with a more efficient 
method.Try obtaining Lucene in Action or look at the examples at
