Hi,
I'm just asking for opinions on Analyzer's for the indexing. For example 
Otis in his article uses the WhitespaceAnalyzer and the Sandbox program uses 
the StandardAnalyzer.I am just gauging opinions on the subject with regard 
to XML.
I'm using a mix of the Sandbox XMLDocumentHandlerSAX and a bit extra. I 
originally started using Digester but found that I preferred the Sandbox 
implementation.
Thanks,
Malcolm Clark
