SUBJECT: Re: Analysis
DATE: 1 Nov 2005

I'm currently indexing the INEX collection and then performing queries on 
the Format features within the text. I am using a wide range of the XML 
features. The reason I asked about the XML Analysis is I am interesting in 
opinions and reasons for adding a wide range of discussion to my 
dissertation regarding Lucene.
Thanks,
Malcolm
