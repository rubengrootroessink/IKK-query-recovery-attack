Probably being very naive here but:
These are my index details:

Location:C:\LuceneDemo\Project6thDec
Number of documents in Index: 571
Index Current Version: 2
Last Modified: 1133899684000
The index has not had any deletions.

What is: Last Modified: 1133899684000?

I thought of indexing a date for each field but it's too inefficient as I only want it once.I
just want the date for the index.Where does it lie?
cheers,
Malcolm
