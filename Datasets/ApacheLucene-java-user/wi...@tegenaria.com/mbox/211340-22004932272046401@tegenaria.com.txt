SUBJECT: Implement custom score
DATE: 22 Sep 2004

Hi,
I know this is probably a common question and I've found a couple of posts
about it in the archive but none with a complete answer. If there is one
please point me to it! 

The question is that I want to discard the default scoring and implement my
own. I want all the the hits to be sorted after popularity (a field) and
not by anything else. How can I do this? What classes and methods do I have
to change?

thanks,
William
