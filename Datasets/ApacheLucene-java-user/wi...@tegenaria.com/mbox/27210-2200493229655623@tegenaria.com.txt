Yes thanks,
I implemented my own Similarity class that returns 1.0f from lengthNorm()
and idf() then I use setBoost when writing the document. However I get some
small round errors. When I boost with 0.7 that document gets the score
0.625. I've found that this has to do with the encode/decode norm in
Simliarity. Should I do anything about it? or does'nt it matter?
