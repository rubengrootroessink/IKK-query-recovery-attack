SUBJECT: Re: minimum string length for proximity search
DATE: 30 Mar 2011

We are trying to do proximity search for multi-terms and we don't care
the order of the terms. Therefore "term1 term2"~5 probably will not
get you "term2 term1" if both terms are long. So instead of applying
distance at the end, we apply distance to each word, "term1~2
term2~2". I am wondering if we should skip short words if it is not
done automatically by the engine.

Thanks,
Andy
