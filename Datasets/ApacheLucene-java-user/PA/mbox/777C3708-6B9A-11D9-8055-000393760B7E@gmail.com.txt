Lucene works just fine with any flavor of Unicode as long as _your_ 
application knows how to consistently deal with Unicode as well. 
Remember: the world is not just one Big5 pile.

As far as Analyzer goes, you may or may not be better off using 
something more tailored to your linguistic needs. That said, even the 
default Analyzer does a fairly decent job at handling non-roman 
languages. YMMV.
