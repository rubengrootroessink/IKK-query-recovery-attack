Well... I don't see any way around that as you basically want to 
uniquely identify your messages based on their Message-ID.

That said, you don't need to do it during the search itself. You could 
simply perform your search as you do now and then create a set of 
unique messages while preserving Lucene Hits sort ordering for 
"relevance" purpose.

HTH.
