 about RAMDirectory based B/S plantform problem

hello, I just start to use lucene and become confused about RAMDirectory
based lucene index establishment, the problem is one user use this RAM to
establish index is ok, but, when it comes to multi user, the results is not
correct. when i use synchronized{ writer.writeIndex (...)}, all go alright.
but users have to wait. i mean, is that RAM can only be used in single
thread, esp. writing the index? how to solve it in a B/S plantform?

============================
the detailed test code is like these, very simple, just use jsp:


RAMDirectory idx=new RAMDirectory();

LuceneIndexWriterImpl writer=null;
writer=LuceneIndexWriterImpl.getInstance();

//RAM-based lucene index establishment

synchronized(wirter){
//if no synchronized the result is not correct
writer.writeIndex(idx);

}

LuceneIndexReaderImpl luceneReader=new LuceneIndexReaderImpl(idx);
....
....

out.println("****");
for(Integer id :documents.keySet())
out.println(id);
out.println("****");

===========================
result:
if only one user: out put is correct 7,3

but two users(if no synchronized): out put may be 0,0 and 4, 0 or other
unexpected result.
