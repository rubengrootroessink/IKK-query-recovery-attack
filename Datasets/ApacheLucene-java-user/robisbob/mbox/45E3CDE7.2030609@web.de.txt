Thanx for your answer.
I will use the latest version to check this. Unfortunately I have only 
access to the computer, where the application will be run, once a week. 
And I can't reproduce the error at my local machine or any other 
computer I have access to.
So If someone has (better had) the same error, now it's the time to go 
public !!!
