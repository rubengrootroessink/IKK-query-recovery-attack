Hi Toke,

Thanks for the write-up. Speaking for the community, the graphs (as 
earlier) would be great.

There is no benchmarks page on the Wiki. There is one on the main site 
to which you can add your stuff -
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_1_0/benchmarks.html
Maybe one should create one on the wiki - not exactly called benchmarks 
but titled as performance studies/findings or something similar to that.

BTW, guys, I am slowly going into testing performance on multi-disks on 
multi-core machines (one indexer/searcher/index per disk). Initial 
results are encouraging. If anyone has some pointers or done something 
similar, it would be great.

Thanks
Srikant
