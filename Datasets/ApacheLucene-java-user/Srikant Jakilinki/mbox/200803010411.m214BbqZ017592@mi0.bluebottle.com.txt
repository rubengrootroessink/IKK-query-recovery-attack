Hi

I remember doing it once a long time ago (Lucene 1.9) but could not go 
anywhere since term vectors and such were not easily accessible then.

However, if text analytics is what you are after, perhaps you already 
know about LingPipe. I used it for named entity extraction (enhanced 
with some TF-IDF statistical information from Lucene Index) and it 
worked well.

Maybe, you can do the same for sentiment analysis i.e. use LingPipe 
capabilities but enhance it with the corpus statistics that the Lucene 
index provides - and which are more powerful now.

HTH,
Srikant
