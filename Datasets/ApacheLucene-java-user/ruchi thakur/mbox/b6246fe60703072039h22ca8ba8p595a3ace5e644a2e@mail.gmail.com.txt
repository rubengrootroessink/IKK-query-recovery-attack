SUBJECT: Re: Query String for a phrase?
DATE: 8 Mar 2007

Thanks Patrick. One more question. The info in link says to use the below
query for phrase
"jakarta apache"      . It works fine.
But when i run     jakarta&apache     also, it has the same effect, ie; like
a phrase. It works fine too. Though it is working but still am little
doubtful as i could not find this phase representation anywhere on net. So
am worried if  jakarta&apache , might slip somewhere.

Regards,
Ruchi
