SUBJECT: ensuring search String availability in the content returned by lucene
DATE: 11 Mar 2007

Am using lucene search. I have a field as "summary" in my Document, which is
having large amount of content/data. In each search i want to get not more
than 200 words from the field "summary". Now i want that in the 200 words
that i get, there should be search String available. If this possible in
lucene search to get the relevant search result having search String.
Thanks and Regards,
Ruchika
