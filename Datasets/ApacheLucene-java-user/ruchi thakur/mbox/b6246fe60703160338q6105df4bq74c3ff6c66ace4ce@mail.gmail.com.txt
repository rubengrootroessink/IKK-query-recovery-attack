SUBJECT: character like &,+,.. getting ignored in search
DATE: 16 Mar 2007

Hi all,
I am using StopAnalzer for indexing and searching. Am searching for phrases.


q1 -> "a b"
this query gives me all documents conatining a b , but also gives
documents conatining a & b

again q2 -> "a & b"
this query q2 gives documents conatining a & b, but also gives
documents conatining a b

How can i resolve this. I only want a b for query q1
and i only want a & b for query q2

If any ideas, please help.

Regards,
Ruchi
