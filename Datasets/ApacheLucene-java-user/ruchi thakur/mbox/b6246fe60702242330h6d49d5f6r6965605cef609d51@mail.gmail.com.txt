SUBJECT: Querying multiple fields in a document
DATE: 25 Feb 2007

 Hello,
I am new to Lucene.
I have a document with 3 fields -   name,subject,rollno

I want to search on the 2 field names name and subject
ie; i want to search for documents having a particular combination of name
and subject, (say all the documents with name as bob and subject as maths) .
Would appreciate if i can have any ideas on this.
Thanks and Regards,
Ruchika
