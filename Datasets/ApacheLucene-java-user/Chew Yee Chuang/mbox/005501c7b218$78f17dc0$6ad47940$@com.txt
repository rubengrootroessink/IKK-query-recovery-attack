Thanks for the sharing and suggestion. 
Yes Chris, the index is to be partitioned by date time, and old index will
not be access so frequent. 

I also did consider indexing in parallel to different index as well Erick.
But I can only put all index in ONE machine and there is only ONE machine to
process the job (both searching and indexing). 

I havenâ€™t try out the addIndexes to combine indexes but I did tried out
MultiSearcher for 3 millions of documents in 3 separate indexes and it does
not have much different compare to a search in 1 index. Could you mind to
share your experience in addIndexes, how is the performance for that ? In my
situation,  the indexes may be use for searching at the same time. Another
worry for indexing is optimization process, I have tried it out and it take
quite some time to optimize my index, e.g indexing for 5000 is about
10seconds (MergeFactor = 1000, and recreate IndexWriter every 5000
documents), but to optimize, it will take around ONE minute. So do you guys
have any suggestion on optimization process as well ? when should I run the
optimization process ? and is it a lot of different with searching in a
optimized index compare to a un-optimize ?

Definitely very aggressive.

Currently my experience is that, together with database access,
DBSight can do 3 million in 2 hours, with Pentium D 3.4Hz. Seems you
definitely need some good hardware, and a fast hard drive for this. I
feel the hard drive is actually the bottleneck for large indexes.
Partitioning your data and pruning the old data should be also
considered.
