SUBJECT: High CPU usage duing index and search
DATE: 31 Jul 2007

Greetings All,

 

I have been trying out Lucene recently and very happy with the search
performance. But just notice that when Lucene performing search or index,
the CPU usage on my machine raise to 100%, because of this issue, some of my
others backend process will slow down eventually. Just want to know does
anyone face this problem before ? and is it any idea on how to overcome this
problem ? Currently Im running Lucene in a machine with the following spec:-
Pentium D 3.00GHz, 2G Ram (allocate 1G for Java Heap space).

 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

 

eChuang, Chew
