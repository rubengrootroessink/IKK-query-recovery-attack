SUBJECT: FW: Lucene indexing vs RDBMS insertion.
DATE: 15 Jun 2007

Hi, I’m  a new user to Lucene, and heard that it is a powerful tool for full
text search and I’m planning to use it in my project for data storage
purpose. Before the implementation, I could like to know whether there is
performance issue on Lucene indexing process. I have no doubt on the
retrieving and searching feature in Lucene but the indexing process. I have
tested my current system to insert 1000 records in RDBMS storage it took
about 1 seconds. Thus, if I change my solution to Lucene, can Lucene
indexing process perform faster than RDBMS ? I have go through some of the
article talking about the “MergeFactor” and “MaxMergeDocs” parameter for
fine tune the indexing process, but no comparison between Lucene indexing
process and RDBMS insertion. Thus, hope someone who have experience in
Lucene can provide this information or some article that discuss between
Lucene and RDBMS.

 

I really appreciate any help in this. Thanks
