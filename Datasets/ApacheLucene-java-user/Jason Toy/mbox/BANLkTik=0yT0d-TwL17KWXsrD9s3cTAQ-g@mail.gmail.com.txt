SUBJECT: found a bug, not sure if its lucene or solr
DATE: 4 Jun 2011

Greetings all,
I found a bug today while trying to upgrade solr  from 1.4.1 to 3.1  I'm not
sure if this is a lucene or solr problem, I normally use lucene through
solr. I've already posted this to the solr mailing list, but I wanted to
notify the lucene group also.

In 1.4.1 I was able to insert this  doc:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><add><doc><field name="id">User
14914457</field><field name="type">User</field><field name="city_s">San
Francisco</field><field name="name_text">jtoy</field><field
name="login_text">jtoy</field><field name="description_text">life
hacker</field><field name="scores:rails_f">0.05</field></doc></add>


And then I can run the query:

http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=life&qf=description_text&defType=dismax&sort=scores:rails_f+desc

and I will get results.

If I insert the same document into solr 3.1 and run the same query I get the
error:

Problem accessing /solr/select. Reason:

    undefined field scores

For some reason, solr has cutoff the column name from the colon
forward so "scores:rails_f" becomes "scores"

I can see in the lucene index that the data for scores:rails_f is in
the document. For that reason I believe the bug is in solr and not in
lucene, but I'm not certain.
