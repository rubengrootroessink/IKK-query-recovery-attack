SUBJECT: [Announce] Solr 3.3 with RankingAlgorithm NRT capability, very high performance 10000 tps
DATE: 18 Jul 2011

Hi!

I would like to announce the availability of Solr 3.3 with 
RankingAlgorithm and Near Real Time (NRT) search capability now. The NRT 
performance is very high, 10,000 documents/sec with the MBArtists 390k 
index. The NRT functionality allows you to add documents without the 
IndexSearchers being closed or caches being cleared. A commit is also 
not needed with the document update. Searches can run concurrently with 
document updates. No changes are needed except for enabling the NRT 
through solrconfig.xml.

RankingAlgorithm query performance is now 3x times faster than before 
and is exposed as the Lucene API. This release also adds supports for 
the last document with a unique id to be searchable and visible in 
search results in case of multiple updates of the document.

I have a wiki page that describes NRT performance in detail and can be 
accessed from here:

http://solr-ra.tgels.org/wiki/en/Near_Real_Time_Search_ver3.x

You can download Solr 3.3 with RankingAlgorithm (NRT version) from here:

I would like to invite you to give this version a try as the performance 
is very high.

Regards,
