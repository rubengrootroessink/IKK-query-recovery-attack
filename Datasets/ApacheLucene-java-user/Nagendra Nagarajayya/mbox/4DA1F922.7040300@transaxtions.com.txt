SUBJECT: [Announce] Solr with Near Real Time (NRT) Functionality
DATE: 10 Apr 2011

Hi!

I would like to announce Solr with RankingAlgorithm has Near Real Time 
functionality now. The NRT functionality allows you to add documents 
without the IndexSearchers being closed or caches being cleared. A 
commit is not needed with the document update. Searches can run 
concurrently with document updates. No changes are needed except for 
enabling the NRT through solrconfig.xml.

A lock-free concurrent time managed access is used to eliminate locking 
between the IndexWriter and the IndexSearchers to speed up the 
performance. The performance is about  262 TPS (document adds) on a dual 
core intel system with 2GB heap with searches in parallel. The 
performance at the moment is limited by how fast IndexWriter.getReader() 
performs.

I have a white paper that describes NRT in details, allows you to 
download the tweets, schema and solrconfig.xml files used for testing. 
You can access the white paper from here:

You can download Solr with RankingAlgorithm (Solr-RA) from here:

Please give this a try and let me know if you see any problems.
