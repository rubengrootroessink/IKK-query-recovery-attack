Hi!

I would like to announce the release of RankingAlgorithm ver 1.1 and 
would like to invite you to try it out. It is very good and does not 
need any changes to your existing indexes but the way they are accessed, 
ranked and scored changes. This version has Score Boosting  enabling  
Document, Field and Query & Query Term boosting, norms and bug fixes to 
scoring and ranking, and is a little more faster.

You can download and try it out from here:
