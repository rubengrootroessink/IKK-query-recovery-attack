SUBJECT: [Announce] Solr 3.2 with RankingAlgorithm NRT capability, very high performance 1428 tps
DATE: 29 Jun 2011

Hi!

I would like to announce Solr 3.2 with RankingAlgorithm has Near Real 
Time capability now. The NRT performance is very high, 1428 
documents/sec [ MBArtists 390k index]. The NRT functionality allows you 
to add documents without the IndexSearchers being closed or caches being 
cleared. A commit is not needed with the document update. Searches can 
run concurrently with document updates. No changes are needed except for 
enabling the NRT through solrconfig.xml.

A new visible attribute has been introduced that allows one to tune the 
visibility of a document added to the index. The default is 150ms. This 
can be set to 0 enabling documents to become visible for searches as 
soon as they are added. The visibility attribute is added as below:

<realtime visible="150">true</realtime>

With visible attribute at 200ms,  the performance is about  1428 TPS 
(document adds) on a dual core intel system with 2GB heap with searches 
in parallel.

I have a wiki page that describes NRT performance in detail and can be 
accessed from here:

http://solr-ra.tgels.com/wiki/en/Near_Real_Time_Search_ver3.2

You can download Solr 3.2 with RankingAlgorithm (NRT version) from here:

I would like to invite you to give this version a try as the performance 
is very high, comparable to the default load.
