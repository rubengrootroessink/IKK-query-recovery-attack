SUBJECT: [Announce] RankingAlgorithm exposed as Lucene 3.2.0 Api
DATE: 22 Jun 2011

Hi!

I would like to announce the release of RankingAlgorithm exposed as 
Lucene 3.2.0 api and would like to invite you to try it out.  Since 
RankingAlgorithm is exposed as the Lucene API, no code changes are 
needed. Just download the new lucene-core-3.2.0.jar and the 
rankingalgorithm.jar, drop them into your existing lucene implementation 
(replace the lucene-core-3.2.0 jar) and you should be able to use the 
RankingAlgorithm for your searches.

You can download RankingAlgorithm from here:
