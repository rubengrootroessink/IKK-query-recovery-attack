SUBJECT: [Announce] Solr 3.2 with RankingAlgorithm
DATE: 22 Jun 2011

Hi!

I would like to announce the availability of Solr 3.2 with 
RankingAlgorithm. Please download and give the new version a try. This 
version of RankingAlgorithm exposes a lucene compatible api so almost 
all of  Solr features should work as it is.

Note:
NRT support will be available by next week.

Sincerely,

- Nagendra Nagarajayya
