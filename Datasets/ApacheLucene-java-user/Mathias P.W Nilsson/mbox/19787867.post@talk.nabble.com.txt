SUBJECT: Advise for Mediabase with Lucene
DATE: 2 Oct 2008


Hi!

I'm currently developing a mediabase for 20-100 customers. A Customer can
upload a file, folder via ftp and a file grabber searches the file system
and adds the new file to a mysql database. It also creates thumbnails, adds
search words etc. Now, this mediabase is pretty old and is developed in php
for the web and the server that monitors events on the file system is java
based.

I want to recreate the mediabase with Wicket as web framework and lucene as
file indexer and have Spring manage the File grabber thread. 


This is what I want to do.

1.) Create a file grabber that searches files and folders for new files. 
2. ) Add keywords to the file. ( The folder path, file size, user rights,
index the content in the document )
3.) Make the files and folders searchable. Tree view for all the folders and
when a user clicks on a folder branch the files in that folder will be
visible for the user.

Is Lucene the right tool for me?
