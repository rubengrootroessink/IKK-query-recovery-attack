SUBJECT: Sharing Documents between Lucene and DotLucene
DATE: 25 Aug 2006

Hello-

I am just wondering if any one has encountered any good strategies for
sharing search records between a Linux based server using Lucene and a
Windows based client using DotLucene.

I am doing all the indexing on the server ( i.e. the master index is
contained on the server) and I would like to transfer parts of that index
across the wire to a client.

Presently I am creating a temporary sub-index on the server, adding the
appropriate Document objects to that index, then transferring the the entire
index to the client which then merges the index into any existing index it
may already have.  However, I would like to avoid building/transferring a
sub-index.

I would like to know if anyone has attempted to directly marshall Document
objects from Java to C#.  Or if there are any other good approaches sharing
individual Document objects between Lucene and DotLucene.

Thanks.
