I have also observed this behavior.

Subject: Problems with exact matces on non-tokenized fields...


Hi, i have a problem with getting a exact match on a non-tokenized
field.

I have a Lucene Document with a field named "element" which is stored
and indexed but not tokenized. The value of the field is "POST"
(uppercase). But the only way i can match the field is by entering
"element:POST?" or "element:POST*" in the QueryParser class.

Have anyone here run into this problem?

I am using the 1.2 release version of Lucene.

Mvh Karl Øie
