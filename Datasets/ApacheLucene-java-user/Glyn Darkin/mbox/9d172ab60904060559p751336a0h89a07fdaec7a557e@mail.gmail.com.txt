DATE: 6 Apr 2009

Hi Guys,

We are using Lucene for our search and have implemented "Did you
mean?" with the built in Spell Checker. However what we really need is
to be able to spell check phrases

E.g

"Harry Poter" is converted to "Harry Potter"

We have a fixed dataset so can build indexes/ dictionaries from our
own data. Has anybody tried this or is this feature the kind million
dollar feature?

Thanks for your help in advance.

Glyn Darkin
