Well, I have seen this link many times before. It doesn't really explain 
the data structures part of it. Perhaps I should have asked my question 
this way:
"What data structures are being used by Lucene to read the posting lists 
from the index ?" .
My guess is that a hash table is being used for reading the postings of 
each term, with the key being the term and the hash value being a multi 
level skip list.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

Regards,
Prafulla
