DATE: 15 Dec 2008

Hi Everybody,

Could someone please explain the actual data structures being used by 
Lucene for storing the postings list in the index. I see a file called 
MultileveSkipListReader and MultiLevelSkipListWriter. Is lucene using 
Multi-level skip lists behind the scenes, for maintaining the index ? I 
want to understand clearly the actual data structure being used by 
lucene for storing the index and postings list, so that I can deduce the 
complexity for reading from that datastructure and decide whether my 
application would scale as per my requirements while using Lucene. So, 
someone please give me some pointers to the data structures being used 
by Lucene .

TIA,
Prafulla
