Thanks Peter,

I know that jsp is a dynamic page, that is the problem.
but a jsp also contains static information, usualy this is html.
If index html files, it also creates some keywords to the link.
is that possible for jsp files to?

and should i write my own java application to index jsp,
or is it also possible to use the current application?

thanks for helping,

Richard

Lucene will index anything you ask it to index.

In order to index content, you have to create a Lucene Document object. 
Lucene Document object is made up of Field's. Each field contains data.

The html indexing example parses the html text and create appropriate 
Lucene Documents. If you have other content you want to index, just 
follow the same example.

You question is a little strange since you want Lucene to index a 
dynamic page or are you asking to index the raw jsp file?

I hope this helps a little.
