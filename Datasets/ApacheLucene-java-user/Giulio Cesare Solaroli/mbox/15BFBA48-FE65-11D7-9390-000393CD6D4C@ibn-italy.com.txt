Hi.

We have no problem at all searching while indexing or optimizing.

The only problem we had was on the IndexReader; the reader has 
visibility only on the documents available on the index when it is 
first loaded. Thus you have to define a policy to drop and recreate the 
reader periodically.
This because I think (if I have understood it well) Lucene handles the 
duplication of the index on its own, if there are active readers while 
it update and index.

Hope this helps.
