[code removed]

your code works fine, but I we work with much more complex query that
are not easily translatable into Terms.

Here is a sample query:
//---------------------------------------
(+responsib* 
 +social*
 +(corporat* firm? business* compan* invest* entrepren* enterprise?))

(+(ethic* solid*)
 +(corporat* firm? business* compan* invest* entrepren* enterprise?))

(+CSR
 +(corporat* firm? business* compan* invest* entrepren* enterprise?))
//---------------------------------------

Given this query, I suppose you need the index to expand all the terms
and get the real word that match the results.

I can expand all the terms with the query rewrite method, but I
usually get huge results.

I was trying to reduce the amount of work to do out of Lucene, in
order to take full advantage of the performace of Lucene that I doubt
I can improve.
