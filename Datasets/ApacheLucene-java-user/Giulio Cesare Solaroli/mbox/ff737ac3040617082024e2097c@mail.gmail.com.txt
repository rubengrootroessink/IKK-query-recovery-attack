I have thought more about this option, and I have tried to implement
the following policy:
- find the matching documents (Hits);
- create an IndexWriter associated to a RamDirectory;
- for each document in the request range
   * process the document;
   * insert the document into the RamDirectory index
         ramDiskWriter.addDocument(hits.doc(i));
- when all the required documents have been processed (and inserted
into the new ramDirectory index) rewrite the original query against
this new index.

But this looks too nice to be true.

Indeed, the rewritten query (against the the index) is empty. :-[

Does anybody know if it is possible to copy documents across indexes
for this purpose?
