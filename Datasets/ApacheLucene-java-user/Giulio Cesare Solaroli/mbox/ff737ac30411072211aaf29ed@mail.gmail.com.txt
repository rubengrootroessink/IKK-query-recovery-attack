You should probably better post this kind of message to the developer
list to get more feedback.

Anyway your suggestion makes a lot of sense.

I would like to suggest a further extensions: storing TermVectors on

The rationale for this feature is a carbon copy of your original post. :-]

Hope to see your patch in one of the next release.
