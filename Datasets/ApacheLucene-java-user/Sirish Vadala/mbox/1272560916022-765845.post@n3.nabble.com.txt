SUBJECT: Using Sort
DATE: 29 Apr 2010


I have a requirement where in the results have to be sorted in ascending
order for few fields, and descending order for one field.

Currently I am using:

String[] sortOrder = { IFIELD_YEAR, IFIELD_TYPE, IFIELD_NUM, IFIELD_SESSION
};
Sort sort = new Sort(sortOrder);
hits = indexSearcher.search(booleanQuery, sort);

Using the above code, everything gets sorted in ascending order starting
with year, type, number and session in that precedence.

Now I have a requirement to first sort in ascending order for year, type and
number, and then sort in descending order only for session.

Is there a way to get this to work.

Thanks.
