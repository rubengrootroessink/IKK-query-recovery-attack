Awesome! Thanks a lot Steven! This is exactly what I wanted.


Hi Sirish,

Have you looked at SpanQuery's yet?:

http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_2/api/all/org/apache/lucene/search/spans/package-summary.html

See also this Lucid Imagination blog post by Mark Miller:

http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2009/07/18/the-spanquery/

One common technique, instead of using a larger-than-normal position
increment gap between sentences, is using a sentence boundary token like '$'
or something else that won't ever itself be the target of search.  Quoting
from a post Mark Miller made to the lucene-user list last year
<http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/c9641cbb1a3bf928/multiline_regex_with_lucene>):

	First you inject special marker tokens as your paragraph/
	sentence markers, then you use a SpanNotQuery that looks
	for a SpanNearQuery that doesn't intersect with a
	SpanTermQuery containing the special marker term.

Mark's suggestion would work for your within-sentence case, and for the case
where you don't care about sentence boundaries, you can use SpanNearQuery
without the SpanNotQuery.

Using this technique, a single field should serve all of your needs.

Steve
