SUBJECT: Re: Which is the +best +fast HTML parser/tokenizer that I can use with Lucene for indexing HTML content today ?
DATE: 14 Mar 2011

I had exactly the same requirement to parse and index offline html files. I
had written my own HTML scanner using
javax.swing.text.html.HTMLEditorKit.Parser. It sounds difficult, but pretty
simple and straight forward to implement, a simple 40 line java class did
the job for me.
