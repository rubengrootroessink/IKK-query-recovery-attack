SUBJECT: Problem fetching number of occurrences
DATE: 1 Jun 2010


Hello All:

Can any one suggest me the best way to get the no. of occurrences of each
word per document in Lucene?

Eg: Let the indexed text be:

If you are posting a question, please try search first. Your question may
have already been answered.

Now if I search for the word 'question', then I would like to get this
document along with the number of occurrences of question in the document,
in the above case it would be 2.

Any hint would be appreciated.
Thanks.
