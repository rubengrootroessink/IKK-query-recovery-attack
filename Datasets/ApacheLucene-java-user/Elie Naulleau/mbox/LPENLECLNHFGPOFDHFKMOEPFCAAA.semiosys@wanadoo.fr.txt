Hi Stephan,

You'll find the example code attached to this message. The archive
contain also a model.dat file for french and english.
Remember that this is a simplisitic approach for language guessing.
It will works to distinguish between on french, english, spanish, etc
but is likely to fail between finnish, suedish, norvegian, ...etc
Porting to Java should be straightforward.

I have at the moment only two languages (en, de) but this could increase.
But I think not more than yours 4 to 5.
It would be great if you could send me your example code.
Probably I try to port it to Java.

Thanks in advance,
