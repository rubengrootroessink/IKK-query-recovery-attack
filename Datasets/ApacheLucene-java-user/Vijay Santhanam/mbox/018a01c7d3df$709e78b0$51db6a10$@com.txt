SUBJECT: Exact searches with PhraseQuery
DATE: 1 Aug 2007

Hi Guys,

For some reason, I said I was using "PrefixQuery" for exact queries.
What I meant to say is PhraseQuery... but the editor between my brain and
fingers had gone home.

The TermQuery idea may be the simplest solution, because I store the name
un-tokenized for sorting purposes.

Otherwise;  Between SpanFirstQuery, RegexQuery and the many other solutions
at 
http://www.nabble.com/Search-for-docs-containing-only-a-certain-word-in-a-sp
ecified-field--tf3655925.html

I should have a good solution.

Thanks for your help Guys!
