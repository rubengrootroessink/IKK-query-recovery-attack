SUBJECT: Question about Boosting Fields in a Query
DATE: 27 Apr 2005

 
 
Hi folks,
 
I have a question about boosting fields in a Query.
Suppose we have documents like this in the index:
 
fieldA:String fieldB:String fieldC:Date fieldD:Number
 
And the query is like that:
 
fieldA: wordA1 wordA2 wordA3 wordA4  
fieldB: wordB1 wordB2 wordB3 wordB4
fieldC:[date1 to date2]
fieldD:[number1 to number2]
 
 
Now what I want to do is to boost certain fields, for example the fieldA
of the query should be boosted by a factor of 2.
What is the most elegant way to do that?
 
btw. boosting document fields doesnt help as different users should be
able to boost different fields....
 
 
Thanks,
Sven
