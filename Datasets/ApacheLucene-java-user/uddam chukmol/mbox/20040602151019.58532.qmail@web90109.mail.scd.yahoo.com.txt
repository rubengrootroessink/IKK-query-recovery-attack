SUBJECT: indexing french text with Lucene
DATE: 2 Jun 2004

Hi all, 
 
Lucene is a very powerful tool for english document indexing. I really wonder if it's that
powerful to index french text.
 
In fact, I need to compute the similarity between 2 french texts. So, if somebody has already
had the experience of indexing french text, your ideas and recommendation are mostly welcome.

 
Thanks before hand.
 
Uddam
