DATE: 29 Jun 2004

Thanks alot Erik for  this hint. I went to the repository of "jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contribution/analyzers/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/fr"
and found the source of three class for analyzing the french text. 
 
that's usable in my case.
 
Thanks once again!

Here is a short example from our Lucene in Action book's code:

public void testSpanish() throws Exception {
Analyzer analyzer = new SnowballAnalyzer("Spanish");

assertAnalyzesTo(analyzer,
"algoritmos", new String[] {"algoritm"});
}

Substitute "French" for "Spanish" and you should be in business, 
provided you've grabbed 'snowball' source code from the 
jakarta-lucene-sandbox CVS repository in the contributions/snowball 
area.

Erik
