SUBJECT: similarity of two texts - another question
DATE: 1 Jun 2004

Hi all, 
 
Thanks alot to Erik and others for your invaluable indications.
 
I tried something simple today to calculate the similarity between two texts. I took the first
text and indexed it and the second served as the query. The two texts are analysed by the
same "Analyser". 
 
Then, at the end, I got the score of similarity between those two texts. 
 
Well, a question again, how does Lucene compute the score between a document and a query?
 
I'll try Erik's recommendation later.
 
Uddam
