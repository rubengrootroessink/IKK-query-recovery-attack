SUBJECT: how to incorporate french stemmer in snowball?
DATE: 29 Jun 2004

Hi,
 
Well, thanks to Otis for the pointing me to the page of snowball but i'm still so dumb to
get in on! 
 
I don't really know how to incorporate the french stemmer in to a snowball analyzer. 
 
Any sample code will be admired!
 
Thanks before hand!

Uddam,

I can't tell with certainty whether you are aware of Snowball Analyzers
for Lucene or not. Take a look at Lucene Sandbox:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/lucene-sandbox/. You will see
Snowball Stemmers for Lucene contribution there.

That includes the French stemmer, so you shouldn't need to write any
new code.
