Hi all,
 
It's so confusing the way Lucence computes the score. I tried to see what happaned but am
blocked with some parameters' mystery.
 
- in DefaultSimilarity.queryNorm(float sumOfSquareWeights) : how does it compute the query
weight?
- How does it compute the weight of each field in the index (fieldWeight, fieldNorm)?
 
Regards
 
Uddam
