DATE: 3 Jun 2004

Hi all,
 
I'm in real trouble with the way Lucene organizes its index. First time, i run an application
to index a text. Then, I changed the text and executed it once again, but still can not get
my index refreshed.
 
Is there anyway to do this? PLEASE HELP!!!
 
Thanks you before hand!
 
Uddam
