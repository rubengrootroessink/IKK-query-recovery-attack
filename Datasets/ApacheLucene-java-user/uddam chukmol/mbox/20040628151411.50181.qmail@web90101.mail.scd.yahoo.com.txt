SUBJECT: how to use the snowball analyzer to index french text?
DATE: 28 Jun 2004

Hi all,
 
I am a newbie and having some problems with how snowball analyzer works. I want to index a
collection of french documents. I have in my disposal the list of french stop words that would
be a help for the french language stemmer. 
 
Does anyone have any experience with writing a snowball-based analyzer for french language?
Any help and code sample will be appreciated? 
 
Thanks before hand!
 
Uddam
