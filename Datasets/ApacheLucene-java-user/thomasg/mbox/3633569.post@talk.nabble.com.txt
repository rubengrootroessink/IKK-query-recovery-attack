Thanks v. much for your thoughts, a lot to think about. I'm currently doing
some benchmark tests on typical usage scenarios with lucene. I'm actually
using lucene through its integration with Jackrabbit dms so may not be
easy/possible to use a different search engine anyway. Of course I'd rather
be developing with open source tools but the project manager thought it good
to ask around. Thanks again and will get some benchmarks that will mean more
than guesswork.
