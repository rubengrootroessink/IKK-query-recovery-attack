Hello,

This is a design question: For Lucene to be able to process a million
documents and in the purpose for the search application to be scalable
and still have a good response time do we need to use an EJB container
such as Weblogic or is a Servlet container such as Tomcat sufficient to
do the job? This design should take into consideration remote searching.

Thanks,
Mohamed
