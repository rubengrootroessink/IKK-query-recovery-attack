Otis,

Is  "the upcoming Lucene in Action part deux" a complement to LUCENE IN
ACTION (which I just recently bought)? And will it be for sale? Why
don't you and Erik don't write a Lucene/Nutch book?

Regards,
Mohamed

Hi Vladimir,

Yes, you are close.  Solr doesn't use SOAP, though, and JSON is only one
of its outputs.  Solr can be described as a REST-ish web service.  You
trigger it via HTTP GET requests and responses are XML, or JSON, or
something else in the future.

I think you are right about Compass, but I have not used it, so I'm not
certain.  All of these should really get some coverge in the upcoming
Lucene in Action part deux.

Otis

Hi,

Couple of people mentioned here SOLR as a 'new' Lucene based search
server. But NUTCH is also Lucene based. Also, there is an OpenSymphony
initiative called 'Compass', which is rather an integration framework
than server.

I wonder if anyone can come up with a small summary of what are scopes
of each of the products above? I did some reading and shuffling, but not
sure if I got it completely right. Here is my summary. Please,
correct/add-in:

- Lucene: the core/kernel of all the products. Contains all the search
logic as well as index maintenance.
- Nutch: Interent/Itranet search engine. Shipped with a web crawler and
a framework to run the Nutch in clustered environment (Hadoop). Open
Source 'Google' :).
- Solr: SOAP/XML/JSON interface to the Lucene
- Compass: a integration framework which wires your application with
Lucene using Spring/Hibernate

Am I close?

Vlad
