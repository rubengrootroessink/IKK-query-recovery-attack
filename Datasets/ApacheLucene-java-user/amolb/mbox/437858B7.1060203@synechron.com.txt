SUBJECT: FileNotFoundException while indexing data
DATE: 14 Nov 2005

Hi everybody,
I am trying to index arround 10 lacs user records, but my indexing 
application is failing with following exception after around 5 lacs user 
records. If I rerun it fails to the same record. I tried to skip the 
record, but that does not help. I tried to get help from google, but few 
such posts does not have answers ( e.g jguru ) or few answers are not 
helping me. I am going to try running this on linux, will update you on 
the results, but Please give me some pointers to solve this problem.
thanks
Amol
