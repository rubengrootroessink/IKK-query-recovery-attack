SUBJECT: Boost a field in fuzzy query
DATE: 14 Mar 2011

Hi,
I am using MultiFieldQueryParser to parse query for multiple fields with
custom boosts for each field.
The issue is when one of the terms in the query is fuzzy e.g abc~.
For such a term, the field boost is not applied. If the query is "abc~ xyz"
and fields are f1 & f2 with boosts 10, 5, the parsed query output is:
(f1:abc~0.5 f2:abc~0.5) (f1:xyz^10 f2:xyz^5).
Is there any way to apply the field boost factor to fuzzy terms as well?
Thanks.
