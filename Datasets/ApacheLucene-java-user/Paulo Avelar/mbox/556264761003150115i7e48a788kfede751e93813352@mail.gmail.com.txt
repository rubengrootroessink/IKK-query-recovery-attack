SUBJECT: issue querying index.
DATE: 15 Mar 2010

Hello,

I'm using the latest Lucene 3.0.1.

I have written a simple test, which does the usual, creates an index,
then add 2 tests documents to it.

I'm having a strange problem, first time I run my test, which runs a
query I get nothing.
but the second time I run my test (exactly the same code) ,  the query
wild results.

Any idea what could be causing this?   I'm going crazy trying to
figure this out.

I noticed the index segments_  file is incremented the second time I
run the test to 3. (segments_3)


Any help is very much appreciated.

Thank you,

Paul
