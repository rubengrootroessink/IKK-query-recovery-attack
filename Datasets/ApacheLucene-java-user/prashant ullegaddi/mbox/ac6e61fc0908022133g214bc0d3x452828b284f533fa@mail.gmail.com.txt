SUBJECT: How to improve search time?
DATE: 3 Aug 2009

Hi,

I've a single index of size 87GB containing around 50M documents. When I
search for any query,
best search time I observed was 8sec. And when query is expanded with
synonyms, search takes
minutes (~ 2-3min). Is there a better way to search so that overall search
time reduces?

Thanks,
Prashant.
