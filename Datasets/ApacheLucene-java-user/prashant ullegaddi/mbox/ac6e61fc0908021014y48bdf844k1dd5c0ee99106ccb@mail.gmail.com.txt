Yes, I'm sure that title:"Rahul Dravid" is extracted properly, and there is
a document relevant to this query as well.
The following query and its results proves it:

Enter query:
Searching for: +title:"rahul dravid" +url:wiki
4 total matching documents
   trec-id: clueweb09-enwp02-13-14368, URL:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid
   trec-id: clueweb09-enwp01-83-11378, URL:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_S_Dravid
   trec-id: clueweb09-en0011-08-22737, URL:

But see following query:

Enter query:
+title:"rahul dravid" +url:"wikipedia"
Searching for: +title:"rahul dravid" +url:wikipedia
0 total matching documents
Press (q)uit or enter number to jump to a page.

Isn't it weird?
