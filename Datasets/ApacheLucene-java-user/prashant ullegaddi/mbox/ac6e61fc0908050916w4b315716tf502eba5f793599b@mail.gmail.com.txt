SUBJECT: What happens after merging?
DATE: 5 Aug 2009

Hi,

I've some indexes. As you all know, each has these files:
_0.fdt  _0.fdx  _hqy.fnm  _hqy.frq  _hqy.nrm  _hqy.prx  _hqy.tii  _hqy.tis
segments_2  segments.gen

Once I merge those indexes into single index by (IndexWriter's
addIndexes()), the merged index has
only 3 files:
_0.cfs  segments_2  segments.gen

Search works fine. I out of interest want to know what happened in the
background. Where frequency
data (earlier present in *.frq) is stored? Where proximity info (*.prx) is
stored? What happened to those
files? Why there is only one compound file *.cfs?

Thanks,
Prashant.
