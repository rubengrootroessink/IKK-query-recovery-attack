Hi,

I've indexed some 50million documents. I've indexed the target URL of each
document as "url" field by using
StandardAnalyzer with index.ANALYZED. Suppose, there is a wikipedia page
with title:"Rahul Dravid" and
url: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid.

But when I search for +title:"Rahul Dravid" +url:"Wikipedia", I'm getting no
results. I get the document(s) when
I search for url:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid or url:"
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid". I get
results even when I search for url:"wiki/Rahul_Dravid".

It'd be helpful if somebody can throw some light on this.
