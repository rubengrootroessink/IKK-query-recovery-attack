Can you re-phrase your requirement? What do you mean by exact match?

Query: term1 term2
Doc1: term1 term2
Doc2: term1 term2 term3 term4

Here both doc1 and doc2 are "exact match" or just Doc1?

If you want to capture the "how many query terms matched" information may be you can use http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Explanation.html

Or you can modify similarity to ignore all things other than coord, so that your documents
are sorted by "how many of the query terms are found in the specified document"
