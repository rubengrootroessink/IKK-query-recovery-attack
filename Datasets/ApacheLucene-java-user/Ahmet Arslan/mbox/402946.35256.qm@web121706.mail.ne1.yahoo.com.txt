Okey all clear. Can you give us some example query strings where there are loads of matching?

Do you use stop word filter? Could it be case described as 

"As you approach the upper limits of a single machine,
extremely frequent terms (called stop words) can become very
expensive in the wrong query. If part of a top level BooleanQuery, a
SHOULD clause that appears in every document will cause a match and
score for every document in your index."
