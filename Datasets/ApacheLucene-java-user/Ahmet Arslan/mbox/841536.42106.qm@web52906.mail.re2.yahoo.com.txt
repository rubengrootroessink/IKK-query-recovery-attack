First thing is do not directly query questions. Manually formulate queries:
remove 'what' 'is' 'the' 'of' '?' etc.

For example i would convert this question into:

"mad cow"^5 "cow disease"^3 "mad cow disease"^15 "role PrnP"~5^2 "role mad cow disease"~45
mad^0.1 role^0.5 cow disease PrnP^10

Use OR default operator, collect and evaluate top 1000 documents only.

And instead of Porter you can try KStem.

Try different length normalization described here. Also their Lucene query example (SpanNear)
can inspire you.  http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec16/papers/ibm-haifa.mq.final.pdf
