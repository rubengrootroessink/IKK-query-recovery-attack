MPQ can support "(quick OR fast) (cat OR mice OR dog)" type of queries so that these docs
are retrieved:

quick rat
fast mice
fast dog

etc.

In your example term1=quick and term2=fast. You need to add another Term array. 
query.add( new Term[] { term1, term2 } );
query.add( new Term[] { term3, term4, term5 } );
