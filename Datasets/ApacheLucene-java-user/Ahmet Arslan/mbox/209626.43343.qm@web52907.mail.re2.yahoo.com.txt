Yes if you are using QueryParser to generate your queries. It does not support nested proximity.
But if you are constructing your queries programmatically it can be done with SpanQuery family.

There is a org.apache.lucene.queryParser.surround.parser.QueryParser that supports nested
proximity search. However it's syntax does not use quotes. There are two operators ordered
(w) and unordered (n). Your examples can be translated as follows:

crude 4w (west w texax)

(spot w prices) 3w (gulf w coast)

Also surround parser do not analyze query words. There are different query parsers here:
