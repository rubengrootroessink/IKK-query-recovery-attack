Sounds like KeepWordFilter[1][2] is what you are looking for. keepwords.txt will be the file
that contains thousands of entries, one word per line. 
And just as you guessed using this approach, the index will contain
only items that exist in your document (keepwords.txt). 

I can share the code to use this TokenFilter in Lucene if you want. Or alternatively you can
easily copy and paste KeepWordFilter.java
