SUBJECT: IndexWriter Class
DATE: 25 Nov 2010

Hello List,

Lucene 3.0.1
Windows Vista Premium Home Edition

I am currently attempting to configure my IndexFiles.java file. My intention is to add the
following functionality to the code as I require input text to be further analyzed than what
the default analyzer does.


IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(FSDirectory.open(INDEX_DIR),

new NGramTokenFilter(

new LowerCaseFilter(

new StandardFilter(

new StandardTokenizer

(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, null)))), true,

IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.LIMITED);

System.out.println("Indexing to directory '" +INDEX_DIR+ "'...");

indexDocs(writer, docDir);

System.out.println("Optimizing...");

writer.optimize();

writer.close();

Date end = new Date();

System.out.println(end.getTime() - start.getTime() + " total milliseconds");



My problem lies in the IndexWriter class and the number of analyzer's/tokenizer's I am permitted
to pass as parameters and I find that this is slightly unclear from the javadocs. Are there
any existing resources to solve this problem? or can someone help me out please.



Anything would be greatly appreciated.
