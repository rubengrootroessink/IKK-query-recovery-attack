SUBJECT: updating payloads
DATE: 31 Dec 2008

Is it possible to update the payloads of an existing index?  I having 
troubles finding any mention of this on the mailing list archives and it 
is not obvious that this is possible from the api.  I do not want to 
change the size of the payloads - just update the values.  My payloads 
values depend on values returned from reader.docFreq().  I don't want to 
update often - just once - and I would settle for a very hackish way of 
doing it if needed.  I suppose in the worst case scenario I could update 
the .cfs file directly - but now I expose my naivety. 

Any pointers are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Philip
