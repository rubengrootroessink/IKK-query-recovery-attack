SUBJECT: How to Integrate the WordNet Synonym Index with my Index
DATE: 29 Jun 2006

Hi,

seems like am awe struck. 

My Index is working fine.

Now,  have got the WordNet synonym-index.

How do I make use of this index to get synonym support search results.?

Do I have to Merge these 2 indexes using the Merge class?  will that
work?

or

Do I have to inject the field "word" values into my Index at the time of
creating my index?

or

Is there a way of making use of the synonym-index directly at the time
of searching?

Please get back as soon as possible.

Thanks in Advance.              Ramesh.S
