SUBJECT: Adding synonym-index to an other index
DATE: 12 Jul 2006

Hi,
can we ever add the WordNet Synonym-Index to an other Index.?
I think this is a bit painful process.

For now, I retrieve the Synonyms of the words from the Search-Query and
hence reform the Search-Query.

Will the AddIndexes(indexes)  do this for us? Does the Merged Index give
meaningful results?

Please Help...   

thanks...    Ramesh Reddy
