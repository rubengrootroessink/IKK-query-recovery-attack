SUBJECT: Sorting by calculated custom score at search time
DATE: 24 Jan 2006

Hi,

I am trying to find a way to create scores with a custom formula based
on the initial score from Lucene and field values from each document,
e.g. for each document:

 finalScore = searchScore * (popularity) * (userRating)

The customer requires this functionality as I have to replace an
existing system that works like this.  User rating and popularity are
already available and will be stored in Lucene.  I've looked through LIA
and the approaches there don't seem to fit the requirement:

5.1.6 Sorting by multiple fields: only sorts by one field, then the
next, I need to combine the scores
6.1 Using a custom sort method: does not take into account the
document's original score

>From an earlier thread discussing a calculated score based on the hit
score and the age of document I gather that TSS regenerate their indexes
to alter the document boost based on date.  I need to be able to sort by
either relevance or "popularity rated relevance" depending on user
input, so I don't think adding a precalculated document boost at index
time is an option.

In the worst case scenario I'll need to iterate through the hits and
then sort them in memory myself, but I'm looking to be indexing around
500,000 documents, and in this particular application there are a lot of
common keywords, so a large number of hits for a basic query is common.
I'm trying to avoid this as it's an untidy solution which is likely to
be (relatively) slow.

I notice Erik has commented that "I've not come across a really clean
way to do this sort of age-based  
boosting other than how TSS does it".  I was wondering if anyone has any
experience with dirtier approaches they could share with me?

Any help is really appreciated,

Thanks,

Nick
