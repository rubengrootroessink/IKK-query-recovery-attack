Hi Leon,
 
I had a similar problem when doing a test import which I believe was actually down to object
churn in parsing the data to create the Documents.  I achieved a quick fix by calling System.gc()
every thousand documents.
 
Cheers,
 
Nick

Subject: Memory problem



Hi All,

We have a lucene index of over 10 000 000 docs at this time.
When we try and run a search we get
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

We have tried setting the xmx settings to 1gb but to no avail (the box has
4gb of memory available) . IS there any guidance on handling memory or has
anyone had similar problems before that could help?

Many thanks

Leon

Subject: Greetings and my first question - Is it a good practise to store
application configuration in Lucene




I have just joined this user group, but I probably will be asking questions
/ contributing for a while now as I am starting to work on a product which
will use Lucene exclusively.

Still in the designing phase, and I see that we need to manage several user
/ application specific configurations and I am exploring the idea of storing
the configuration information also in the Index, may be create a separate
index just for the configuration, because each module of the application
will have access to Lucene classes.

I know technically this can be done, but are there any best practises which
discourage this?

Thanks in advance.
-Pradeep
