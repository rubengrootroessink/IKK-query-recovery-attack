You'll need to do this in such a way that the index entries stored
happen to be the same as realtive to lucene...  the easiest thing to do
is to do this from a context under webapp and go against ..

For the index, put it anywhere you like...suggest it not be accessible
via tomcat.  Make sure you tell the webapp where to find it in the
configuration jsp.
