Anita,

For Word, IT is possible if you're willing to hack to use Ryan's
prototype code that is being refactored into HDF.  It converts DOC->FOP
and well we have XML parsers.  

Obviously (Excel) HSSF @ POI is pretty robust at this stage.  

Document summary (HPSF) information is read only at this stage, but that
should be fine for your needs.

So essentially you can grab what you need via POI.  The HDF is going to
be the most work 

checkout jakarta.apache.org/poi for more details.
