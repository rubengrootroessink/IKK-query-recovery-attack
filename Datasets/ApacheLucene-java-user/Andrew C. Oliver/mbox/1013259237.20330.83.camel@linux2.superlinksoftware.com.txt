Hey Don,

My earlier correction was only half right.  I read it over again, walked
through it and corrected it.  The error you got below was because you
left off the directory at the end (in the instructions it was "..").. 
I've clarified the instructions and corrected them... Thanks for
reporting these documentation bugs ;-).
