Perhaps this reference
http://www.mail-archive.com/hibernate-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg062
60.html will give you some help. It's about Hibernate Lucene
integration.

Subject: Lucene as primary object storage

Until recently I have only used Lucene as an index. I'm very  
interested to hear what you people have to say about using Lucene as  
the primary and only persistance layer in an application.

I would feel much safer if I had a transactionlog for crash recovery.  
So I might get me one of those. Are there more things I should worry  
about?
