When index, you can add LowerCaseFilter to your analyzer, or just use
some analyzer already done lowercase, such as
StandardAnalyzer,SimpleAnalyzer

Subject: Question regarding ignore case?

Hi all, my lucene index is prepared for search, but I forgot to change
all the english word to lower case. When I search, I have to type the
same case as in lucene index. I found that QueryFilter may solve the
problem, but it seems that it's used for filter query, not the lucene
index. How do I ignore the case in lucene index?
