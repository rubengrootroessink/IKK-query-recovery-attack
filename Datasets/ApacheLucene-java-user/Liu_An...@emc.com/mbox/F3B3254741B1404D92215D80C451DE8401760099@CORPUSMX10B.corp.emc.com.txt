These two classes are generated by QueryParser.jj. Perhaps you should
first look at how to use JavaCC and modify QueryParser.jj to meet your
requirement.

Subject: Understanding QueryParserTokenManager and QueryParser classes


Hello.

I want to add an operator like (*) to query syntax. Then, I need to know
and
understand QueryParserTokenManager and QueryParser classes well.
But I don't know, how can I find documents about these classes and
algorithms of identifying tokens and other things in query string .

Thanks for your help.
