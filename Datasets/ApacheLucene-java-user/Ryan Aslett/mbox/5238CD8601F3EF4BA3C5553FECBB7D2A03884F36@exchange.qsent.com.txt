The test system is not multithreaded currently, i.e. the queries are
executed serially.
Which explains why the multi-term, single index was slower.. Ie. Only
using one thread vs the parallel multisearcher using many.
I had plenty of CPU on the multi-term single index.  So if I were to
make my querier multithreaded, the fastest index configuration would
ideally be one big index?

Thanks you for your help!
Ryan

What appears to be the bottleneck, CPU or i/o?  Is your test system 
multi-threaded?  I.e., is it attempting to execute many queries in 
parallel?  If you're CPU-bound then a single index should be fastest. 
Are you using compound format?  If you're i/o-bound, the non-compound 
format may be somewhat faster, as it permits more parallel i/o.  Is the 
index data on multiple drives?  If you're i/o bound then it should be 
faster to use multiple drives.  To permit even more parallel i/o over 
multiple drives you might consider using a pool of IndexReaders.  That 
way, with, e.g., striped data, each could be simultaneously reading 
different portions of the same file.
