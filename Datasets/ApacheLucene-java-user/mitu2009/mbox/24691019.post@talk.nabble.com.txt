SUBJECT: Storing words with apostrophe in Lucene index
DATE: 28 Jul 2009


Hi,

I've a company field in Lucene Index. One of the company names indexed is :
Moody's

When user types in any of the following keywords,I want this company to come
up in search results. 1.Moo 2.Mood 3.Moodys 4.Moody's

How should I store this index in Lucene and what type of Lucene Query should
I use to get this behaviour?

Thanks.
