SUBJECT: Need to know pros and cons of using RAMDirectory
DATE: 17 Oct 2009


Hi,

I need to improve performance of my Lucene search query. Can I use
RAMDirectory?Does it optimize performance?Is there any index size limit for
this? I would appreciate if someone could list pros and cons of using a
RAMDirectory.

Thanks.
