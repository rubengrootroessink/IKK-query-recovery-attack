SUBJECT: Need help regarding Lucene index/query
DATE: 5 Jul 2009


I want to have a "citystate" field in Lucene index which will store various
city state values like:

Chicago, IL 
Boston, MA 
San Diego, CA 
How do i store these values(shud it be tokenized or non-tokenized?) in
Lucene and 

how do I generate a query (should it be phrasequery or termquery or
something else?) which gets me all records whose citystate contain: Chicago,
IL OR Boston, MA OR San Diego, CA ??

I would appreciate if i can get help with the code as well.

Thanks.
