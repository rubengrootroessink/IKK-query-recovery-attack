SUBJECT: Synchronizing Lucene indexes across 2 application servers
DATE: 19 Jun 2009


I've a web application which uses Lucene for search functionality. Lucene
search requests are served by web services sitting on 2 application servers
(IIS 7).The 2 application servers are Load balanced using "netscaler". 

Both these servers have a batch job running which updates search indexes on
the respective servers in the night on a daily basis. 

I need to synchronize search indexes on these 2 servers so that at any point
of time both the servers have uptodate indexes. I was thinking what could be
the best architecture/design strategy to do so given the fact that any of
the 2 application servers could be serving search request depending upon its
availability. 

Any inputs please? 

Thanks for reading!
