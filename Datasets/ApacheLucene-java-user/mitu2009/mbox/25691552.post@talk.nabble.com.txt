DATE: 1 Oct 2009


Hi,

I've 3 records in Lucene index.

Record 1 contains healthcare in title field. Record 2 contains healthcare
and insurance in description field but not together. Record 3 contains
healthcare insurance in company name field.

When a user searches for healthcare insurance,I want to show records in the
following order in search results...

a.Record #3---because it contains both the words of the input together(ie.as
a phrase) b.Record #1 c.Record #2

How do i achieve this in lucene?

Thanks.
