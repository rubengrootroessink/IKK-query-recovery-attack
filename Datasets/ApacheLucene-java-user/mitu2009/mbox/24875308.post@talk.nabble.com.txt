SUBJECT: Handling synonyms using Lucene
DATE: 8 Aug 2009


Hi,

What is the best way to handle synonyms (phrases) using Lucene? Especially,
when I need to execute queries like :a OR b OR c NOT d

How about adding a new field called "synonyms" to each document while
indexing? This field's value would have a list of all synonyms. It would be
added to a document only when that document has any of the synonyms.

I would then execute an "OR" search query which would look for search
keyword in this field alongwith other fields.

Can this approach work well for any kind of query?

Please suggest.

Thanks.
