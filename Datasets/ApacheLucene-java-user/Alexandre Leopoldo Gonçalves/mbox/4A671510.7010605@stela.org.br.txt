SUBJECT: Backing up large indexes
DATE: 22 Jul 2009

Hi All,

We have a system with a lucene index with 100GB and growing fast. I 
wonder whether
there is an efficient way to backup it taking into account only the 
changes among old
and new version of the index, once after optimization process the name 
of the main
index file change.

Regards,

Alex
