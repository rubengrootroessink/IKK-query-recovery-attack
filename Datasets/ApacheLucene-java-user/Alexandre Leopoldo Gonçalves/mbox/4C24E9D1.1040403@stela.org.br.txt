SUBJECT: Index with multiple level structure
DATE: 25 Jun 2010

Hi All,

I wonder if it is possible to create Lucene indexes with a multiple 
level structure. For instance,
a field named "institutions" with all institutions I´ve worked and 
sub-fields to detail my
contribution in a specific institution.

The structure would be like this:

field: name
    content: person name
field: search
    content: full text from a set of papers
field: institutions
    content: institution_A  
          subfield: position
                content: manger
          subfield: admission_year
                content: 2001
    content: institution_B
          subfield: position
                content: professor
          subfield: admission_year
                content: 2006

After that, my intention is to query people which have worked with 
"information retrieval" at "institution_A"
as "professor" and admission year >= "2006".

Regards,

Alex
