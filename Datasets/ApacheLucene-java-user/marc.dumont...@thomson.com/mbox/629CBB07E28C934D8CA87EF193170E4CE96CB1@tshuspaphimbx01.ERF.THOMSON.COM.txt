SUBJECT: NumberTools - Range Searches
DATE: 18 Sep 2007

Hi,

 

I'm trying to do Range searches on a numeric field and have come across
the lexicographical behavior, such that

 

mylength: [0-2]

 

brings back values such as 1172

 

 

I've seen prior posts about the NumberTools class, and have indexed a
field using the longToString() method.

 

Do I have to rewrite the query to handle this field? I don't want
searches to have to looks something like

 

mylength: [00000000-00000002]

 

for example.

 

 

Any high level help or concrete examples would be much appreciated.

 

Thanks,
