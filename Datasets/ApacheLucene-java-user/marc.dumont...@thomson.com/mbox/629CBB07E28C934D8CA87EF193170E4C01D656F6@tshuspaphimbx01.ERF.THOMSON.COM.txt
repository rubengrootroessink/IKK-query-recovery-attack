SUBJECT: RE: large term vectors
DATE: 11 Feb 2008

Hi Grant,

Lucene 2.2.0

I'm not actually explicitely storing term vectors. It seems the huge
amount of byte arrays is actually coming from SegmentReader.norms. Maybe
that cache constantly grows as I read somewhere that it's on-demand. I'm
not using any field or document boosting..is there some way to optimize
around this?

Marc

Hi Marc,

Can you give more info about what your field properties are?  Your  
subject line implies you are storing term vectors, is that the case?

Also, what version of Lucene are you using?

Cheers,
Grant
