No, it's split into about 100 individual indexes. But I'm running my
64-bit JVM with around 10gb max memory in order to avoid running out of
memory after running all my unit tests (I have some other indexes as
well running as part of this application).

Upon further investigation, it seems to have something to do with the
norms
(SegmentReader.norms)

Is it a single index ? My index is also in the 200G range, but I never
managed to get
a single index of size > 20G and still get acceptable performance (in
both searching and updating).
So I split my indexes into chunks of < 10G

I am curious as to how you manage such a single large index.
