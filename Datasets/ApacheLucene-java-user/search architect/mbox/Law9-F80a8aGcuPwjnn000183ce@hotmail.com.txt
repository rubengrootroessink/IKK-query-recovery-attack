SUBJECT: Search Architect Job
DATE: 6 Feb 2004

Hello Everybody,

This may not be the right group for posting a job, but I couldn't find a 
better one. My friend's company is looking for a full time Technical 
Architect/designer. I don't know the exact job title. Here is the one line 
description of who they are looking for. It's a small sized company that's 
been around for 5 yrs.
" A J2EE technical architect with more than 5 yrs experience working on 
Linux/Unix platform, XML technologies and architected some search engine 
solutions using popular search engines like lucene, verity etc. Job is based 
in bay area, california."
If you are interested email me.

Thanks,
Guru.
