here you find the current code:

java:
SQLDirectory.java. (should work with all sql databases via JDBC)

sql:
Oracle: see appended scripts
SQL Server: change varchar2 to varchar, integer to bigint and raw to binary

it seems to be quite stable by now.
the input and outputstream methods should be reviewed.

indexing seems to be a little faster than FSDirectory (both db and files on
remote server)
querying is slower, but included cache increases performance over time or
repeated queries (especially paging)

enjoy ;)
