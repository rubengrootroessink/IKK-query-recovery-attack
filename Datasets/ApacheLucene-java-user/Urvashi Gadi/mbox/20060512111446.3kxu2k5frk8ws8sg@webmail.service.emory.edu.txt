SUBJECT: question about custom sort method
DATE: 12 May 2006

I am looking at DistanceComparatorSource class (for csutom sorting) and 
looks like it calculates the distance for each record in the index and 
not just the records returned from search, making the system very slow.

Is my observation correct? Are there ways to optimize this process?

Thanks,
Urvashi
