SUBJECT: using custom sort method
DATE: 18 Apr 2006

Hello All,

My requirement is to combine 2 or more fields using some critera (for 
example weighted average) and sort the search results based on the 
combined fields.

I am looking at DistanceComparatorSource class to implement custom sort 
but it takes only one field for calculation and then sorts the result. 
Is there a way to use more than one field? I looked in sorts in 
succession by the criteria in each SortField class but this doesn't 
fulfill my requirement.

Please suggest.

Urvashi
