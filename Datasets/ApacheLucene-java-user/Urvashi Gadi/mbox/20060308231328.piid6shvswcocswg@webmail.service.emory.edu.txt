SUBJECT: Atomic index/search for a phrase
DATE: 9 Mar 2006

Hi All,

I am trying index and search a phrase (multiple words seperated by 
spaces). How should i index it so that it remains atomic. I have 
observed that if i index the phrase are keyword, lucene doesn't let me 
retrive the phrase in search.

Please advice.

Urvashi
