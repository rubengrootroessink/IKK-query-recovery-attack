Hi,

I am using ChainedFilter to combine various filters. No mattar which 
logical operator i try to apply to all filters, when i try to print the 
chained filters using toString() method, i see

ChainedFilter: [views:[0.4-0.6] level:[1-} ]

i am concerned about not being able to see the logical operator in the 
print string. Should i be able to see the operator?

Urvashi
