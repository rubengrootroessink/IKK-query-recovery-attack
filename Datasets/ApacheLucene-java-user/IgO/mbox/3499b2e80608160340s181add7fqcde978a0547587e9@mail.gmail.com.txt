SUBJECT: counting and updating the index
DATE: 16 Aug 2006

Hi all,
here the scenario, i'm trying to index a database and i'd like to put in the
index "the counts of  all related table",

the first option is to count against the db and then store the data into the
documents but i think is not a real option because of huge ammount of
structured-data doesnt like to be counted...;-)

so the idea is to count against the index;

this leads me to to possibility:
- the index is filled up and then updated, but if i count after the index
has been created i must update(delete and create) the most part of the
documents; it's better(for the performances) to use a temp index?
- the index is counted while it is created but in this case i have to
respect an order of the table to index

Thanks
