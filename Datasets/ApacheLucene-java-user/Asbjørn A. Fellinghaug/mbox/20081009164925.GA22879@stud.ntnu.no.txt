Hi.

I interpret your question in such a way that you want autocompletion in
your search system? In that case, I believe there are some Analyzer's
which does this in the 'contrib' package. Also, I've created an Analyzer
which creates "bigrams" (n-gram of size 2) in my master thesis.
Feel free to download it from this page:

Also, have a look at the package org.apache.lucene.analysis.ngram:
