Hi Seid.

I constructed something like this in my master degree. What I bascially
did was to write a custom analyzer. However I identified the top 100
most searched phrases in my collection, and then filtered for those. If
a document contained a identified phrase, then the analyzer would
construct a Token for those terms.

Another approach is to decide that only two-word phrases should be
search for. And, for instance, find verbs and use the "word right after".

Example string: "The boat was very fast".
Tokens: "The boat", "was", "very fast".

If your analyzer contain a range of phrases to search for, then it
should be straightforward to identify those phrases and index them as
Tokens. Just remember to set the start and end offset of the Token to
correct values.

You can have a look at this thesis here:

Hope this helps.
