SUBJECT: Tokenization
DATE: 9 Jul 2002


Hi All

In Lucene the tokenization of Sentences is happening word wise not 
letter wise, So when we search for a letter which contained in a 
sentence it will search for a word like the like the letter we entered. 
Example :  sentence "life is a big stage where we are actors" If I 
search for life or any other word lucene seems to be returning correct 
results. But if I search for  "l" or 's' it will return no results.

I am not sure whether there are any methods which tokenizes the sentence 
into letters. If  anybody knows please put it in the mailing list

Best wishes
Pradeep
