Hi Lucene friends!

   How the files of different format can be indexed and searched? ( As I 
know lucene is having HTML indexer and searcher, which comes along with 
it and also XML indexer, but is there any way to index files  
irrespective of the file type)
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated..

Thanks in advance.
Pradeep
