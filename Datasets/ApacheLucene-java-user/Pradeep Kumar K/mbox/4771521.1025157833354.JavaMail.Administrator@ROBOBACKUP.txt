Hi

How to create a query which should search for  documents 
that doesnot containing a certain Term. I used '-' before the 
string to be avoided 

Query  qu= QueryParser.parse("-pradeep","name",new 
StandardAnalyzer());

I have two documents with 'name'  not equal to 'pradeep'
but the number of hits returned is 0 but   putting '+'  in the 
above query seems to be returning correct number of hits.

Regards
Pradeep
