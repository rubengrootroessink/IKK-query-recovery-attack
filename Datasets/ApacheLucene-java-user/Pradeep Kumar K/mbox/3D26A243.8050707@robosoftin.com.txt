SUBJECT: Hanging problem
DATE: 6 Jul 2002


Hi All

The search application I developed  using is working very fine. But Some 
time I used to see that after a lot of Searching process, the 
application completely gets hanged and stops for ever.

What are the possible ways that occur in Lucene which makes  my search 
application hang.

Can any body can clear my doubt .

Regards
Pradeep
