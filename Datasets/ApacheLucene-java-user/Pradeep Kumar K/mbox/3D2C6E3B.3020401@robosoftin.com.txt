Hi

Is it possible to search for a word contains some letters?
example : "God is love"

how can I create query to search for sentences having  "d".
I found that lucene is tokenizing a sentence  in to words not into letters.
is it possible using lucene? Can anybody give a clue for this?


Thanks
Pradeep
