SUBJECT: RamDirectory and FS at the same moment

Hi all!
i've just started my adventure with Lucene i've got one question  
regarding indexing.
Does Lucene have got built-in mechanism to store indexes first in RAM 
and after some time or after some number of documents added to move them 
to FS? And searching docs all the time in both  'storages' ?
I know the one reason is to use RAMDirectory  and FS and move the 
indexes 'by hand' but to do it i need two IndexWriters and two 
indexSearchers so  i have to  join results. Is there any better way to 
do it?
