Hi guys,
     Here is my noob question:

  I'm trying to do fuzzy search on first name, last name. I'm using 
double metaphone analyzer. and i encountered the following problem.
for example, when i search for picasso, "paski" shows up with the same 
score as the spelling of "picasso". when i look at the analyzer result 
of "paksi, picasso" they are both analyzed as ''PKS". why isn't the 
exact spelling getting a higher score?

thanks.
