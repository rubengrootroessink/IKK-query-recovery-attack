SUBJECT: Get Hits for a single document
DATE: 16 Dec 2009


Hi,

Can any one suggest me the best way to get a word hits(occurances) in single
document. I have found it through Termfrequency, but that is not efficient.

Example : If search string is "sir please", I would like to get sir hits and
please hits for a single document.

Thanks,

Regards,
PeterJohn.
