Erik, Just to make sure I understand you right, In an
example query:  ZipCode:CA10927 AND Gender:Male 

Sure I know ZipCode returns fewer results, do you mean
I build a filter 

QueryFilter x = new QueryFilter("ZipCode", "CA10927",
..);

Then build the query

Query y = QueryParser.parse("Gender:Male", "Gender",
..);

Then run it

Hit result = searcher.search(y, x);

I tried that, and the performance does not improve.
when I trace down the code, I found searcher object
searches on both ZipCode and Gender for terms
information (expesive) before processing on the
filters.

Am I doing something wrong, or you mean something
else? I would really appriciate if you can post an
example to this list, or send a copy of to my mail
address at jyang_work@yahoo.co.uk.

Kind Regards
