SUBJECT: Would Someone Give Me Pointer On How to Index Database?
DATE: 26 Oct 2005

Hi,
  I want to use Lucene/Nutch to index my mysql
database.  I think of using JDBC, is it a good idea? 
I searched all over the web, but all the examples are
non-lucene/Nutch related.  Would you guys give me
pointers or websites or examples on how to use JDBC on
Lucene/Nutch to index mysql database?  

Many thanks.
