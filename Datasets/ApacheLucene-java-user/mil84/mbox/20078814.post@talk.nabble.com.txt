SUBJECT: RE: How to search in metadata? (filename, document title, cocument creator, ...)
DATE: 20 Oct 2008


thx :) There was also another problem with filename (because I indexed full
path, not only name). But I fixed it, and now it finally works.

Last question - how to get number of hits in every document (not only global
number of hits)? Best would be a simple example, if possible...
