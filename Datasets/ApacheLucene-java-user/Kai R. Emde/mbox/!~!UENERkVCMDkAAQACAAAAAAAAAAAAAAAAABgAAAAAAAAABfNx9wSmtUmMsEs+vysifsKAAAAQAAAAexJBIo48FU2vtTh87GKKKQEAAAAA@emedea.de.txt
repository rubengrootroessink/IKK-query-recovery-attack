SUBJECT: BUG ? - lucene multisearcher / sorting
DATE: 28 Nov 2006

Hello,
 
we have one problem with the sort routine. We use the multisearcher function
over severall index.
The result will be sorted by the booknumber, but the produced list isn't
sorted correct. There are 300 hits from book a, then 150 from book b, 95
hits book 3, but then there are 1,2,3 hits of book a, 1 hit of book b. 
Is there a general problem? 
 
Thank's for a reply,
 
best regards 

kai
