SUBJECT: Apache Dinner DUS (co-located with FSFE fellowship meetup)
DATE: 17 Aug 2010


Hello,

the evening after FrOSCon - that is on August 22nd 2010 at 7:30p.m. CEST - a 
combined "FSFE Fellowship meetup/ Apache dinner*" takes place in Tigges in 
Düsseldorf (Brunnenstraße 1, at Bilker S-Bahnhof). Given it doesn't rain, we'll 
be sitting outside.

Would be great to meet you there for tasty food, interesting discussions on 
Apache in general, as well as projects like Lucene, Hadoop or Tomcat in 
particular. Anyone interested in either the FSFE or Apache is welcome to join 
us.

One personal request: Somehow, Rainer (Kersten, FSFE) talked me into preparing a 
talk on what the ASF is all about - would be really great to have more people 
around share their experience.


See you in Düsseldorf,
Isabel
