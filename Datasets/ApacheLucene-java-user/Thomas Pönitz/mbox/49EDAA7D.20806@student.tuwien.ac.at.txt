SUBJECT: Creating document fields by providing termvector directly (bypassing the analyzing/tokenizing stage)
DATE: 21 Apr 2009

Hi,

I have the same problem as discussed here: 
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200511.mbox/%3C200511021310.18686.rj@last.fm%3E

I want to specify termvectors directly instead of constructing a dummy 
string like "a a a b b c" that will be transformed to a[3] b[2] c[1].
The old discussion had no real solution but it is also a bit outdated, 
maybe someone has a better idea now.

Greets, Thomas
