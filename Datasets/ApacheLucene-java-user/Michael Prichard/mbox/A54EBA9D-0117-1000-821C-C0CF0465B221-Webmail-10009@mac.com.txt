Say I have a field of To addresses from an email archive.  I do a search and I get 10 To addresses
for a single hit.  Then I want to find similar email with the To addresses containing roughly
75% of those email addresses as well.  How would I do this?

In other words:
I get a result with:
To:  foo@bar.com, foo2@bar.com, foo3@bar.com, foo4@bar.com, foo5@bar.com, foo6@bar.com

Now I want to find similar emails with 75% of this addresses in the To field.....

Thanks!
Michael
