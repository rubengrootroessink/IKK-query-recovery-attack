SUBJECT: Threading Indexing Processes : Can we write concurrently to Index?
DATE: 30 Oct 2007

The subject pretty much describes the issue.   If I multithread an  
indexing process can two or more processes write to the same index?   
My knowledge of Lucene says no but I am hoping that I am missing  
something.  Also, what is a good solution?

Thanks.
Michael
