SUBJECT: Sorting on tokenized fields
DATE: 8 Jan 2008

Is it possible to sort on a tokenized field?  For example, I break  
email address into pieces, i.e.

michael.prichard@email.com

becomes

michael.prichard@email.com
michael.prichard
michael
prichard
email.com
email


so when sorting on this field I get some strange results.  Do I need  
to create another field just for sorting?  Or are there other ways to  
do it?

Thanks!
Michael
