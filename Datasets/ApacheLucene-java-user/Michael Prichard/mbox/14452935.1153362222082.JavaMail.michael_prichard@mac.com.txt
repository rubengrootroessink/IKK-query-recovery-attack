SUBJECT: Query does not work past 26 characters?!
DATE: 20 Jul 2006

Tell me I am totally missing something here....

I created an index w/ StandardAnalyzer with two fields as follows:

Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(new Field("to", "michael@reallylonglonglonglongname.com", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
doc.add(new Field("content", "blah3 blah3 blah3", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
writer.addDocument(doc);

When I search for as follows:

PrefixQuery pq = new PrefixQuery(new Term("to", "michael@reallylonglonglong"));

I get a hit. That is good.

When I search a little more like:

PrefixQuery pq = new PrefixQuery(new Term("to", "michael@reallylonglonglongname"));

No hits!!

Same thing with QueryParser, etc.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Michael

P.S.  I tried UN_TOKENIZED as well...but I don't think that messes with email addresses anyway.
