SUBJECT: wildcard search and german umlauts
DATE: 17 Sep 2003

Hi All,

has someone ever written an extension of QueryParser providing the
possibility to let wildcard search terms be run through an analyzer ( as
suggested by Tatu Saloranta a while ago)? I want to reduce german umlauts to
their base letters (eg. 'ä' (&auml;) to 'a' ) and for non-wildcard queries
my UmlautFilter does its job. Or is there any other option?

Many thanks,
René
