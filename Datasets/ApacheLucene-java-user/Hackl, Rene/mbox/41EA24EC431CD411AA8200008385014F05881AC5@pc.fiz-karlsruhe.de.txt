Thank you very much for your feedback, guys! 

Erik, Pierrick, thanks a lot for your code, I'm trying to adapt either
approach right now.

There'll be at least two indexes, one "normal" one and another bloated one.
Dan suggested splitting, too, but, unfortunately, if users search for e.g.

"9-Oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona-2,6-diene"

they don't want anything else than that substance, as opposed to 

"*-Oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona*" 

where they'd be interested in substances from that family - whatever the
numbers are.

If you're interested, once I've some hard performance results at hand, I
could post them around.

Best regards,

Ren√© Hackl
