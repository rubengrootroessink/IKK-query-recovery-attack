Is it really able to handle them at all? I thought "*foo"-type queries were
not supported.

That's because I build two indexes for the purpose of simultaneous left and
right truncation. One "normal" index and another special one, which takes
tokens and breaks them down, for instance "foobar" would be indexed also as
"oobar" and "obar". For a query "*oba*" the left wildcard would cause the
special index to be searched for "oba*", not left truncated queries would
search the normal index.

The special index is created with maxFieldLength = 100000

build-time specialIndex vs. normalIndex: +60%
index size specialIndex vs. normalIndex: +240%
index size specialIndex vs. originalDocSize: +60%

Query execution is still very fast on a 3GB specialIndex. 

I guess the usability depends on how large your document collection is and
what kind of search functionality you need. The drawbacks of this approach
are that proximity and phrase searches on the special index are busted. 

Would it make sense to prevent creating the prx-file to reduce index size
when not offering that kind of search anyway? Is it possible at all?
