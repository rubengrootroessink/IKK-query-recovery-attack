Yes and yes. Users range from Information Professionals to "naive" end
users.
If there's a string like "N-(t-Butyl)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-nitroxyl" users
can be expected to search for "dinitro", "3,5-dinitro", "nitrobenz" etc.

There are also sequences of amino acids or DNA that users might want to
match
partially.

That's what I have been pondering about the whole morning and I'm going to
give
it a try. As far as I have tested, Lucene carries out these queries far
quicker 
than your average relational DB text retrieval tool :-)

Thanks a lot for your comments!
