You're absolutely right, I misunderstood.

Now, instead of return true, I'd maybe put something like

return !Character.toString(c).equals(",");

and then cut off surrounding spaces like "man, people, time out,..."
--> "man" " people" " time out"
--> "man" "people" "time out"

I haven't tested this though. Keep us posted when you find 
something that works. :-)

Best regards,
