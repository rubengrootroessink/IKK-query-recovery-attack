SUBJECT: Bug in QueryParser?
DATE: 21 Jun 2007

Hi folks!

I'm having a little problem with a specific query that does not seem to get
parsed correctly. If a term has both a leading and a trailing * wildcard
character, I get no results in Lucene 2.1.0. It works when I omit one of the
stars, and I activated the option to allow leading wildcards.
Example: *project*

When I insert a ? somewehere in the query, it works again, which leads me to
the conclusion that this must be a bug in the QueryParser.
Example: *pro?ect*

Is this a known issue? I couldn't find anything about this.


Thanks a lot!
