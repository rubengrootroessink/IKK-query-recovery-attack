Hi,

MultiFieldQueryParser($Revision: 965585) says that when you pass something
like  (title=>5 body=>10) you can get

+(title:term1^5.0 body:term1^10.0) +(title:term2^5.0 body:term2^10.0),

whereas what I have received is the following (with Version.LUCENE_40):

+(title:term1 title:term2)^5.0 +(body:term1 body:term2)^10.0;

Which is something different ... does anyone know how I can get it as the
fomer?

Cheers,
Dan
