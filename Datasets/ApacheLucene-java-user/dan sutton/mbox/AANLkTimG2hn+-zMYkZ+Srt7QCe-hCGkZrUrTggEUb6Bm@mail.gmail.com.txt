Hi Shai,

What I really wanted to do was reduce the frq file size

Oddly (when tokenizing 3 seperate fields) with the
WhitespaceTokenizer, more terms are produced than with the CJK
analyzer and the CJK frq filesize is much larger ... examples below:

with WhitespaceTokenizer:
89M 	        _0.tis
1.4M 	_0.tii
71 	        _0.fnm
5.8M  	_0.fdx
741K 	_0.fdt
20  	       segments.gen
293  	segments_2
119M  	_0.frq

with CJKTokenizer:
31M   	_0.tis
633K 	_0.tii
71  	        _0.fnm
5.8M 	_0.fdx
741K  	_0.fdt
20  	        segments.gen
293  	segments_2
166M  	_0.frq

Also I believe solr calls addDocument with payLoads turned off. I'm
not sure why the size is much larger.

Cheers,
Dan
