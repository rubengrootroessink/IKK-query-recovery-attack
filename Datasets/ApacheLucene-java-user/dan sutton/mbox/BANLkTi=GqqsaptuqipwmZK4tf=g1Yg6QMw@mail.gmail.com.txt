SUBJECT: dynamic frag size - highlighter
DATE: 25 May 2011

Hi,

I'd like to make highlighting work as follows:

length(all snippits) approx. 200 chars
hl.snippits = 2 (2 snippits)

e.g. if there is  only 1 snippet available, length <= 200chars
e.g. if there is >1 snippet, length each snippet == 100chars, so I
take the first 2 and get 200 chars

Is this possible with a custom fragmenter?

Or does anyone know of any contrib fragmenter that might do this?

Many thanks
Dan
