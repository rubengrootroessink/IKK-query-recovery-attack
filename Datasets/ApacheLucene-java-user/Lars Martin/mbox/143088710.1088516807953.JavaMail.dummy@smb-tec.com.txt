Thanks for your reply.

I do not want to delete documents by terms. All my indexed documents 
are referenced by id, so I have to use delete( id ). What makes me
insecure is the fact, that there are still terms in index from documents
which are already deleted. This would mean that TermEnum is a continously
growing beast. No problem when I query such a term, because no document
is matching the query. But when I do computation based on indexed terms
I heavily depend on the number of terms in the current TermEnum. Even
if such terms don't impact my computation - because the freq is always
0 - it would have an impact on my runtime behavior and complexity.
