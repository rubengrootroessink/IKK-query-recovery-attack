SUBJECT: What is the right query syntax for matching some field's substring?
DATE: 1 Apr 2009


Hi all,

    I've a question about the query syntax statement,
    There is a lucene text field and the value of the field like
,11,12,15,16,
    if I want to query some data and the value of the field has included
some number what I like(11 or 15),
    how can I do?
    I try to give a query like (filed_name:,11,) but it can not get the
matching.

    or I must reformat the field value with some other symbol not the symbol
comma ','

Bon
