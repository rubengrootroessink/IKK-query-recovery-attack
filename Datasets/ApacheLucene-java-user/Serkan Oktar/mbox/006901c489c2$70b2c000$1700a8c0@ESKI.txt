SUBJECT: term frequency data of terms of all documents
DATE: 24 Aug 2004

I want to build a list of terms of all documents and their frequency data. 
It seems the information I need is in "tis" and "tii" files. However I havent't found a way
to handle them till now.

How can I get the term frequency data?

Thanks ,
Serkan
