Hi,

I have a question regarding repeatable field names.

I have a database with, among other fields, a field title and a field 
subtitle. I want to add them to a Lucene index with a field 'title' to 
enable the user to find books by title words that are in the title or 
subtitle. Can I simple add both fields with a field name title (this 
seems to work fine), or is it a better approach (for example more 
efficient) to concatenate both title and subtitle first and add them as 
a single field to the index?

Regards,

Bas Peters
