Thanks for the replies and discussion.

I think I didn't express my problems correctly.  The problem is I want to
find documents containing only the "the" token in the title field, but not
necessarily with only one appearance.  For example, if the query is "the",
I want to find documents whose title is "the", "the the" or "the the the".

I am not sure whether the start/stop-tokens and indexing the whole field 
as keyword
will help, it seems not.  Sorry if I misled you. But from what is 
discussed, it seems
there is no easy way.  I think this is just a corner case for myself 
now, since
nobody seems to find this a problem. But if you still have interest in 
solving
this problem, I will be very glad. :)
