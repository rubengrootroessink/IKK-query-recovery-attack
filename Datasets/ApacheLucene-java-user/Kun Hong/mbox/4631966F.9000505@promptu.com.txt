SUBJECT: Search for docs containing only a certain word in a specified field?
DATE: 27 Apr 2007

Hi,

I wonder if there is a way to search for documents containing only
a certain word in a specified field.

For example, I would like to search for documents that contain only
"the" in title field. Some titles just contain a single stop word,
but I really need to find it. If the index is created without stop
words removed. I should be able to find documents containing "the"
in the title field. But, how about I just want that one document which
contains no other words than "the". Is it possible using Lucene query?
I know I can get all the results and filter it myself. But this way could
be too expensive, if the return results are enormous (Eg. if one million 
docs
containing "the").

TIA,

Kun
