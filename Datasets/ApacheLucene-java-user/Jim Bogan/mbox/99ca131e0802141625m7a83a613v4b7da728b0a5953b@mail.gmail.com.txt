SUBJECT: regex expressions within phrase queries
DATE: 15 Feb 2008

I would like to be able to handle the following:

"/\d\d\d{4} \\d\\d/ office"

Where / indicates a regex expression phrase.

One option is extending MultiFieldQueryParser and catching the phrase within
getFieldQuery evaluating whether /, the regex identifier, is present and
then returning a  SpanNearQuery  comprising of  SpanQueries.

I was wondering if anyone has a more efficient method for achieving this.
Would changing QueryParser.jj and developing a custom PhraseQuery class be a
good idea?  Any comments would be appreciated.
