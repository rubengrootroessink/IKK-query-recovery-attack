SUBJECT: Semantic indexing in Lucene
DATE: 24 May 2011

Hello,

I have a project which indexes and scores documents using Lucene. However,
I'd like to do that using semantic indexing (LSI, LSA or Semantic Vectors).

I've read old posts and some people said that Semantic Vectors plays well
with Lucene. However, I noticed that its classes are used only by command
line (throw method main) instead of by API.

So, I'd like to know if anyone can suggest any other approach so that I
could use semantic indexing in Lucene.

Thanks,
Diego
