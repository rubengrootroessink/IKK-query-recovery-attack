SUBJECT: optimize Index problem
DATE: 22 Dec 2007

Hi guys,

  I met some trouble in optimizing the index. The index looks fine in Luke
and I can carry out the search in the index. However, when I try to merge
all these seperated files into a complete index. A java internal exception
indicates that the file are too large.The index size is about 40GB. Any one
know how I can carry out the index?  Or is there any parameters to adjust
the size of optimization.

Thanks in advance.
