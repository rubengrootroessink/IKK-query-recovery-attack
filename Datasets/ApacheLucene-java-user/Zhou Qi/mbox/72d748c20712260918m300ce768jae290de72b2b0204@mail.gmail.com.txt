Hi Grant,

The exception is throw from java native method."Failed to merge indexes,
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space ". ( I have set the -Xmx1024m in
JVM.)
I guess it is similar as the problem appeared in previous thread before (
http://www.nabble.com/Index-merge-and-java-heap-space-tt505274.html#a505274).
But I don't know the detail reason. Anyone has answer?
