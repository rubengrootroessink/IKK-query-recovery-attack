SUBJECT: IndexReader open problem?
DATE: 27 Dec 2007

Hi all,

  I encounter a strange probelm. To improve performance, I open the
indexreader at the start time and reuse it in later search. I have another
process running to do online indexing. The search service and indexing
service is accessing the same index folder. But I found out the search
service only returns old documents. That is to say, my index reader did not
refresh the index folder for up-to-date index. If it acutally works like
that in lucene, should I try to open the index to init the indexreader
everytime I do search?

Thanks
