Hi,


Yes, I print the query.toString(), it is ConstantScore.


Which method should I use to change it? And How to modify it to make it sort by relevance
not the constant score(reading file order)? Any example?

 Don't prefix queries get rewritten wrapped in ConstantScoreQuery,
meaning all will get the same score and you get them in read order?
Checking the API, PrefixQuery uses
MultiTermQuery.CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO_REWRITE_DEFAULT, which can be changed
with setRewriteMethod.

Probably a bug in your code.

If you post again with, as a minimum, the version of lucene that you are
using and your search/sort code, you might get a better answer.
Best of all would be a complete self-contained standalone program or
test case that demonstrates the problem.
