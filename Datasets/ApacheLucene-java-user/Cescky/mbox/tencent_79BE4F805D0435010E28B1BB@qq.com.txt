Hi,


I search using the ComplexPhraseQueryParser (e.g. "great* sum*"), it becomes SpanNearQuery
so i cannot use multiTermQuery.setRewriteMethod(). Because prefix query is constant query,
it can only sort the document by the order of reading files.



Which method should I use to change it? And How to modify it to make it sort by relevance
not the constant score(reading file order)?


Thanks
