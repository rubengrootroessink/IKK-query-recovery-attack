DATE: 14 Jul 2008

Hi,

I'm in the process of trying to optimize searches and avoid the dreaded 
OutOfMemoryError s.

We currently return the entire document from each of the search results 
and then filter the results using parameters obtained from a database. 
Not very efficient.

The idea was to override TopFieldDocCollector to do the sorting etc. and 
only load the full document for those we need to display. But, I haven't 
found an easy way to use TopFieldDocCollector (FieldSortedHitQueue etc.) 
with MultiSearcher.

Is there an easy way I've missed?

Thanks for any advice.

Declan
