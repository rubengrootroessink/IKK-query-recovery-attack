(excuse the semi-appropriate forum to make this comment in - but it is very
brief and may actually help improve the final Lucene-based app)

You may also like to import popularity data from Amazon using their open
APIs and mix the relevancy between your own popularity score and theirs.

Subject: Sorting based on a selling rate


I want to implement a specific search based on a selling rate.

Let me explain this:

I have a book collection in my store.
I index my books like that:

- One Lucene Document by book
- Two Lucene Fields in the document
	- TITLE OF THE BOOK
	- KEYWORDS OF THE BOOK

The keyword field is a BOOSTED field (* 1000)

This is working fine :-)

Now, I would like to search and sort my books according to the selling rate
of the 

book.
Exemple:

If the user search for: "Java", the first books that lucene will return must
be the 

best sellers books based on this specific search: "Java"

If the user search for "Java and .net", the first books that lucene will
return must 

bze the best sellers books based on this specific search: "Java and .net"

For each query, I have a programm that records the product selling rate
based on the 

specifiq query.

For exemple:

Query: "Java" -> [ProductId:123, rate: 23%], [ProductId:222, rate: 15%], 

[ProductId:567, rate: 7%]...


Query: "Java and .net" -> [ProductId:99, rate: 45%], [ProductId:194, rate:
30%], 

[ProductId:93, rate: 10%]...

How can I return books based on the selling rate (for a specific query)
Must I developp a specifiq handler after the basic Lucene search and sort it


programmatically, or is it possible to implement a mechanism at Index or
search time ?

Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad english ;-)

John
