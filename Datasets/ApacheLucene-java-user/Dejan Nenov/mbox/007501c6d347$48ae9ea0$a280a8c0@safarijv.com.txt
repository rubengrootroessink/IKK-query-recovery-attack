Second that - I was a client of Stellent - the libs work great but are
expensive. To see Stellent in action - get a copy of the free X1 desktop
search or the X1 server (Lucene based).
Another alternative is KeyView from Verity - now Autonomy.

If you have a budget for this stuff then Stellent provide tools for parsing
multiple document types and also have a viewer that can display documents
with their original formatting, plus your highlights. See
http://www.stellent.com/en/products/outside_in/viewer_tech/index.htm

I don't work for Stellent and haven't used it but I do know this stuff is
hard to do and they are the only ones I'm aware of trying to provide tools
to cover all document types which is why I mention it. If anyone has any
other similar recommendations I would be interested to hear them.

Highlighting a PDF document, last time I looked (quite a while ago), 
involves supplying an xml file that describes offsets for highlighting. 
You can specify the file in the URL. You can also do simple highlighting 
by passing in a list of words to be highlighted, but this does not even 
catch minor differences, like singular to plural.

If someone knows more about using to the lucene highlighter to highlight 
PDF's then please speak up. I think I will have to get into this soon.
