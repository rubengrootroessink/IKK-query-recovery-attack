SUBJECT: check if document is deleted using indexwriter
DATE: 21 Jan 2009


Hey there,
I would like to know how to check if a document has been deleted if I am
using an IndexWriter and the fucntions deleteDocument or updateDocument.
I have seen that deleteDocument from IndexReader returns an integer but in
the IndexWriter's case it's a void.
Any advice?

Thanks in advance.
