SUBJECT: FastVectorHighlighter and query with multiple fields
DATE: 29 Jan 2010


I have FastVectorHighlighter working with a query like:
title:Ipod OR title:IPad

but it's not working when (0 snippets are returned):
title:Ipod OR content:IPad

Could this be because when FieldQuery is created the query to build it must
have just one field?
If it's not the case I may be missing something... any idea?

Thanks in advance
