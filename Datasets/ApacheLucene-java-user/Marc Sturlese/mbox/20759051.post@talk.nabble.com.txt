SUBJECT: Boosting fields are searching or indexing time?
DATE: 30 Nov 2008


Hey there,
I have a simple question about boosting fields,
I have a lucene indexer app that indexes data from a db. At indexing time I
give different boost to the fields depending on if the field is title or
content. Would it be the same to set the boost at searching time instead of
at indexing? I mean, the results of the search would be exactly the same?

Thanks in advance
