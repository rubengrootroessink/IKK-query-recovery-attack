SUBJECT: Re: performance merging indexes with addIndexesNoOptimize

Thanks a lot Shai, couple of questions:

>> In Lucene 3x there is a new addIndexes which accepts Directoryâ€¦ that

>> That makes addIndexes very fast. 
With the lucene 3.X addIndexes which accepts Directory, if after the merge I
need to optimize the index using compound file, what would happen? Would
this optimize be slower than if I use the addIndexesNoOptimize?

Actually I always build all the "small indexes" from scratch and have to
optimize my final index using compound file (the merged one). If i do:
w.optimze() ; 
w.close (false) ;
Would I be getting any benefit if the w.close (false) ?

Thanks in advance
