hi i need help. 

i need to search by word in sentences with lucene. for example by the word
"bbb" i got the right results of all the sentences : 

"text  ok ok ok bbb" , "text 2 bbb text " , "bbb  text 4...". 

but i need the result by the word offset in the sentence like this: 

"bbb text 4...". , "text 2 bbb text " , "text 1 ok ok ok bbb" .. 

waiting for ideas.. thanks..
