SUBJECT: Using multiple drives and non-CFS format to improve search performance
DATE: 26 Aug 2010

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to figure out the effects on search performance of using the
non-CFS format and spreading the various underlying files to different
disks/media types. For example, I'm considering moving a segment's various
.t* term-related files onto a solid-state drive, the .fdx/.fdt
stored-fields-related files onto a standard rotational drive, and using
symlinks to hide all of this from Lucene.

Any ideas on what the performance effects of such a setup would be? Which
files would you recommend putting on the slower media, and which on the
faster media?

Thanks!

-Stefan
