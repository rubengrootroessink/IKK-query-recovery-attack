Sanne,

I'd prefer to use symlinks for existing, static indexes, but I'm really glad
you showed me FileSwitchDirectory. I think it will be useful for me in the
future. Thanks for your advice!

Any tips on how to convert an existing CFS index to non-CFS? I'm aware of
the extractor in IndexReader, but I don't know how to repair/rebuild the
segments_N file afterwards. Is this even possible?

Also, I found this:
http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Distributing-index-over-N-disks-td577483.html
Gives
me hope!

Thanks again,
Stefan
