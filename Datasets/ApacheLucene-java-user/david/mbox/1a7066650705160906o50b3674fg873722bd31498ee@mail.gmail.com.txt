SUBJECT: Re: Suspected problem in the QueryParser
DATE: 16 May 2007

I understand that it would be best to have a UI that mapped lists of terms
to MUST, MUST_NOT and SHOULD, but I'm currently constrained to using the
QueryParser with boolean operators.

Given that, I was thinking that the addition of "*:*" (in 2.1) to represent
MatchAllDocsQuery might help solve:

To test, I indexed these documents:

  *DocID*

*Body Value*

0

A B C

1

A B C D

2

A C D

3

B C D

4

C D

5

B

Searching in Luke, here's what I see:

*Query*

*Parsed As*

*Expected Matches*

*Actual Matches*

NOT B

-body:B

2, 4

<none>

*:* NOT B

MatchAllDocsQuery -body:B

2, 4

2, 4, 5

*.* AND NOT B

+MatchAllDocsQuery -body:B

2, 4

2, 4, 5

Can someone explain why doc 5 is matched for both "*:* NOT B" and  "*.* AND
NOT B"?
Are my Expected Matches incorrect?

Thanks, david
