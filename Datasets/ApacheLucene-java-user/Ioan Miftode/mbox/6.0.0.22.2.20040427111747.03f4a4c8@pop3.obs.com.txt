SUBJECT: "phrase search" AND term
DATE: 27 Apr 2004



I recently upgraded to lucene 1.4 RC2 because I needed some
sorting capabilities. However some phrase searches don't
work anymore (the hits don't even have the term's I'm searching on).
They were fine when using 1.3final.
I noticed it happens when I combine
a phrase search with a simple term like this:

field1:"some phrase search" AND field2:term

Has anyone experienced anything similar ?
Any thoughts.


thanks

ioan
