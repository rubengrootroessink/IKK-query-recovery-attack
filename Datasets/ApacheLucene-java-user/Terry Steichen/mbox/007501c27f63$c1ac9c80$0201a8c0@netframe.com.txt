SUBJECT: Re: Searching in date ranges
DATE: 29 Oct 2002

Peter,

I'm not sure if I'm doing it right, but I use a Text Field (rather than
Keyword) for my (string-based) date which allows me to use wildcards (such
as date:200210* for all documents published in October) as well as range
queries (like date:[20021001 - 20021031].  Does that make sense?

Regards,

Terry
