Christoph,

Just curious - how are you currently using Term Vectors?  They seem to be a neat feature with
lots of future promise, but I'm not sure how to best use them now.

Regards,

Terry

  Hi Grant,

  I try to look into your latest code by the end of September but I probably
  won't find time earlier. I am using the current TermVectors very successfully.
  Thanks for the excellent code.
