I believe that the tokenizer treats a dash as a token separator.  Hence, the
only way, as I recall, to eliminate this behavior is to modify
QueryParser.jj so it doesn't do this.  However, doing this can cause some
other problems, like hyphenated words at a line break and the like.

(Of course, if you do make such a change, you'll have to go back and reindex
after such a change.)

I've run into this problem myself and I've 'punted' -  on certain fields,
when I index, I replace the dash with an underscore.  This isn't a real good
solution, and it does require me to keep remembering in which fields I have
to do this substitution in the search.  But, for the moment it works.  I'll
probably go back and make some kind of change later, when I have more time.

HTH,

Terry
