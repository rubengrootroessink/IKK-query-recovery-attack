Responding to my own problem - I think it may not be a Lucene issue, but a
web one.  I'm passing the query to Lucene via a web browser, and I now
believe that what's happening is that the automatic url encoding/decoding is
stripping off the leading (at least) "+" sign (treating it as an encoded
space).  That would explain the behavior.  I will confirm this later on
today.

Regards,

Terry
