Otis,

Doing some more testing, it turns out that it is the *trailing* tag that
screws things up.  Assume the text contains the phrase '<b>college
soccer</b>'.  This will match on 'college' or on 'soccer*', but not on
'soccer' or 'college soccer'.

I need to fix this quite soon.  In the absence of any better suggestions,
I'm just going to have to go in and either insert spaces or delete brackets
(ugh!).

Regards,

Terry

PS: Am I the only one that's having this problem?  If so, I must have
screwed up something.  If not, it could be a potentially serious bug.
