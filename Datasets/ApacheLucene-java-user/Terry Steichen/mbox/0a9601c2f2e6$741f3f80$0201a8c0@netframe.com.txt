Arsineh,

There was some discussion on this list about this topic earlier.  As I
recall, the escaping a '-' doesn't work (for reasons I don't recall -
something about interaction of analyzer and tokenizer, I think).  To handle
this for my own purposes, I believe I modified the QueryParser.jj source to
add a '-' as a valid alphanumeric code.  However, you have to be careful
because this may cause ordinary words not to match if they are hyphenated
from word-wrapping.

HTH,

Terry
