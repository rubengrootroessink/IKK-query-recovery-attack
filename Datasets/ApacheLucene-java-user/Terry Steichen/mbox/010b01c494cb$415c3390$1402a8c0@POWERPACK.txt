  Free?!

  http://www.manning.com/hatcher2 is the book Otis and I have spent the 
  last year laboring on.  It has been a long hard effort that is about to 
  come to fruition.  Lucene in Action is in copy/tech editing right now 
  and will be pushed into production very shortly.  There will be some 
  chapters, as always with Manning, available for free download once the 
  book has been typeset (probably even before physical copies are 
  available).  We have not decided which chapters we'll make available 
  for free yet.

  I hope a few folks buy it - it would be a shame for my kids to go 
  without food ;)

  Erik
