Alex,

If you are using an older version of Lucene, and at the line input (going
into q1 and q2) your user is entering terms without a plus or minus, I think
what your code is actually doing is creating the following query:

+( a b c) -(d e f)  (which is +(a OR b OR c) OR -(d OR e OR f))

What I think you want to create is:
+(a AND b AND c) AND NOT (d AND e AND f), or
+a +b +c -d -e -f

You can check it quickly by, for the line input going into q1, enter on the
line: +a +b +c, and for the line input going into q2 enter on the
line: -d -e -f.  That should give you what you're looking for.
Alternatively, if you follow Doug's comment about using one of the later
Lucene versions and changing the default operator, your code should work the
way you want when terms are entered without pluses or minuses.

HTH,

Terry
