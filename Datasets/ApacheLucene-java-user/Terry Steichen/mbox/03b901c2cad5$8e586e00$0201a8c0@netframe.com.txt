Leo,

>From my experience, as I update the index (without optimizing), the number
of physical index files grows.  I typically use the number of files as an
indicator as to when optimization is required.  While I don't think Lucene
itself has any API to check this, a shell script or the application can do
so easily.

HTH,

Terry
