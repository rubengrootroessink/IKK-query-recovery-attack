Well, I'm not too confident of my JavaCC skills, and when I've messed around with this stuff
in the past, I sometimes ended up inadvertently creating problems in other areas of the query
syntax. 

But if, in the future, I or someone else took on this task of enhancing QueryParser, I'd like
to be assured that the underlying Lucene engine will accept and support negative boosting.
 Is that the case?

Regards,

Terry

  Closer inspection on the parsing:

  <Boost> TOKEN : {
  <NUMBER:    (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ ( "." (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ )? > : DEFAULT
  }

  where

     <#_NUM_CHAR:   ["0"-"9"] >

  So, no, negative boosts don't appear possible with QueryParser 
  currently.  I have no objections if you'd like to enhance the grammar 
  to allow for it (provided sufficient unit tests, of course).
