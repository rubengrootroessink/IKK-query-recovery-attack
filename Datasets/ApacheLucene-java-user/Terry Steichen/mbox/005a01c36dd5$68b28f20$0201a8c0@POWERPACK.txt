If I understand your issue correctly, I think what you're experiencing is
the fact that you can have a phrase query "hello world", or a wildcard query
+hell* +wor*, but you can't mix the two together.  As far as I've found,
that's a basic limitation you just have to live with.  (Of course, if
someone on the list can show me where I'm wrong, I'll be delighted.)  You
can add boosting to any kind of term (such as wor*^10 or "world order"^10),
but (I don't think) you can't mix wildcards and phrases.

HTH,

Terry
