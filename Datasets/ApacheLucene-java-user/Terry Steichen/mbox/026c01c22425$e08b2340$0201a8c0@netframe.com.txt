Peter,

The main problem was that I was unfamiliar with the way you used static
methods and members.  Once I got my head around that, it wasn't hard to get
things working.  I fixed a couple of minor bugs, got rid of some surplus
methods, and added the ability to change the sorting order.  Seems to work
fine now.  Thanks for the help (and the code, of course).

Regards,

Terry
