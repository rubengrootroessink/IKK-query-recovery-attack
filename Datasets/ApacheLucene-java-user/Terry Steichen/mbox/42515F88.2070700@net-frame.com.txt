SUBJECT: Re: Collecting documents where only one field term matches
DATE: 4 Apr 2005

I wonder if you could accomplish your goal by creating another field 
during indexing which holds the number of terms in the "species" field.  
If that's possible, then you might get what you want with a query like: 
+species:"homo sapien" +num_species:1.
