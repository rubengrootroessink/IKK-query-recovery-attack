SUBJECT: Code Testing Snippet
DATE: 22 Dec 2002

Not too long ago someone on the list mentioned a small program that you could run to check
how your tokenizer and analyzer was treating some test queries.  I believe they retrieved
it from an earlier archived message.  I'd like to try it, but I've looked all over and can't
seem to find it.  

I'd appreciate if someone could give me a pointer to it.

Regards,

Terry
