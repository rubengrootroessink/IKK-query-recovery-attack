Doug,

(1) No, I did *not* boost the pub_date field, either in the indexing process
or in the query itself.

(2) And, each pub_date field of each document (which is in XML format)
contains only one instance of the date string.

(3) And only the pub_date field itself is indexed.  There are other
attributes of this field that may contain the date string, but they aren't
indexed - that is, they are not included in the instantiated Document class.

Regards,

Terry
