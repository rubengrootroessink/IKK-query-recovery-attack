SUBJECT: Enumerating Concatenated Fields
DATE: 17 Nov 2002

I have a collection of XML documents, each of which contains a 'codes' section, each of which
contains zero or more 'code' sections.  When I index the documents, I concatenate all the
non-empty 'code' sections into a single 'codes' index field to facilitate boolean searching.

Given my structure, is there a way that I could get a list all the defined 'code' values in
the entire set of documents?  If not (as I suspect), is there a way that I could change the
indexing scheme to add this functionality?

Regards,

Terry
