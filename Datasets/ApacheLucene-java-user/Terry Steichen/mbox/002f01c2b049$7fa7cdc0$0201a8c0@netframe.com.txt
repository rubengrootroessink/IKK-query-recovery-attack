Doug,

Aha.  I feel better knowing that I haven't lost my mind, now that I know
what you were trying to do.

As to a suggestion, I would only venture to say that, in its present form,
this results in confusing behavior (as noted in my original message).
Whether that drawback is outweighed by the benefits you mention, I could not
say in a general sense (although from my personal use, it is not).

Regards,

Terry

PS: Is this kind of thing (and more importantly, any other similar design
issues) documented any place?

PSS: What is the simplest way to alter this behavior to one that parses the
same regardless of the presence or absence of numeric characters?

Otherwise the slash is apparently treated as a token separator.
