SUBJECT: RC2 requires reindexing?
DATE: 28 Aug 2003

I just switched to RC2 and found that a number of queries now don't work.  (When I switch back
to RC! they work fine.)  Can't seem to figure out a pattern regarding those that don't work
versus those (the vast majority) that still work fine.  I looked in the RC2 source and noticed
that the dates on IndexWriter and IndexReader and a bunch of related modules seem to have
been changed.

Is it necessary to reindex (a major task for my stuff) to use RC2?

Regards,

Terry
