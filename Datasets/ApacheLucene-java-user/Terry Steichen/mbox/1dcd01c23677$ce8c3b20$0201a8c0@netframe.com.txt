Matt,

It all depends on how much information in your documents you index, and how
much information you cause to be stored in the index.  In my specific case,
the index is something less than half the size of the database.  I figure
when/if I have time to fine-tune it, I can reduce the size of the index by
about a third.

Hope that helps.

Regards,

Terry
