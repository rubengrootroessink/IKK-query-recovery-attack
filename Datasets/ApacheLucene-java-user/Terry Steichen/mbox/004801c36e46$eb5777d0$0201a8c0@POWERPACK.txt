Tatu,

I agree.  One problem, however, that new (and not-so-new) Lucene users face
is a learning curve when they want to get past the simplest and most obvious
uses of Lucene.  For example, I don't think any of the docs mention the fact
that you can't combine a phrase and a wildcard query.  Other things that are
obviously quite well understood by many members of the list, are still
less-than-clear to others.  For example, I found (and still find) it a bit
difficult to find concrete examples/advice of how to get good benefit from
filters.

My whole point is that this is a *very* powerful and flexible technology.
But I think it's often very difficult for those most experienced in using
Lucene to fully appreciate how it looks from the "newbie" point of view.

Just my $0.02.

Regards,

Terry
