I tested against the phrase in my text, '<b>men's college soccer</b>',
matching successfully on 'college AND soccer*'.  However, I found no match
for 'college AND soccer', 'college AND soccer<*', 'college AND soccer<',
'college AND soccerb', 'college AND soccerb*', or 'college AND soccer/'.

Regards,

Terry
