Erik,

Back in September I ran into similar problems and suggested (to the list) a
number of changes, some or all of which have, I believe, been incorporated.
I've recently made some specific additional changes (regarding scoring, as I
recall).  At this point I don't recall which of these have been included in
the distribution and which have not.

However, since then I've been using SearchBean extensively and, my version
at least, works fine for sorting in either ascending or descending date (or
relevance) order on whatever field I choose.

Please let me know what kind of problems you're having and I'll see if I can
help.

Regards,

Terry
