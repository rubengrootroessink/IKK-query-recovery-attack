Joshua,

To clarify: I require the capability to perform precise, structure-sensitive
searches - you can't do that very well with simple HTML, since a simple
full-text search won't suffice.  The content for the XML 'semantic tags' is
extracted from the original HTML with some complex, XPath-assisted logic.
In other words, that content isn't conveniently wrapped in tags in the
original HTML. I don't recall the exact number of elements in the resulting
XML structure, but it's around 30 (including some metadata that I add).
That's one (of several) reason why the XML/DOM step is necessary.

Regards,

Terry

PS: The problem that caused me to ask my original question stems from the
fact that some of the extracted content (stored in a couple of the XML
sections) sometimes contains HTML tags (in the form of entities), and the
StandardTokenizer (which I'm using) doesn't ignore/remove them.
