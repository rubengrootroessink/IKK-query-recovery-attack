Not exactly sure what you're trying to do.  You can easily generate a number when you index
each Document and insert it in a uid field (which is, BTW, what I do), and if you base it
on a timestamp plus some characteristic of the document (which is also what I do), it should
always be unique.  As you add more documents, they will each get their own unique id.  When
you delete documents and optimize, these ids won't be affected.

However, in your subsequent clarification, you indicated you already had a unique id, and
want to find the maximum value.  So why did you say you want one auto-generated?

  Just to clarify. I have a Field 'uid' those value is an unique integer. I  
  use it as a key to the document stored externally. I don't mean Lucene's  
  internal document number.

  I was wonder if there is a method to query the highest value of a field,  
  perhaps something like:

     IndexReader.maxTerm('uid')
