Erik,

Thanks for your response.  My specific comments (TS==>) are inserted below.
I should make clear that I'm using
fairly complex, embedded queries - not ones that the user is expected to
enter.

Regards,

Terry

TS==>Except that I'd like to be able to choose to do this on a
query-by-query basis.  In other words,
it's desirable that some specific queries significantly increase their
discrimination based on this multiple matching,
relative to the normal extra boost given by the coord factor.  However, I
take it from your answer that
there's not a way to do this in the query itself (at least using the
unmodified, standard Lucene version).

TS==>I've not been able to get negative boosting to work at all.  Maybe
there's a problem with my syntax.
If, for example, I do a search with "green beret"^10, it works just fine.
But "green beret"^-2 gives me a
ParseException showing a lexical error.

TS==>Well, I hope I'm not trying to be fancy.  It's just that listing all
the different variants, particularly (as in my
case) I have to do this for multiple fields, gets tedious and error-prone.
The example above is simply one such case
for a particular query - other queries may have entirely different desired
combinations.  Constructing a single stemmer
to handle all such cases would be (for me, at least) very difficult.
Besides, I tend to stay away from stemming because
I believe it can introduce some rather unpredictable side-effects.
