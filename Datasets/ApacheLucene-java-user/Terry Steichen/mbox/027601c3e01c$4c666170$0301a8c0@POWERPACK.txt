By the silence, I gather that the answers to my questions are "no", "no" and
"no".

Subject: Query Term Questions


1) Is there a way to set the query boost factor depending not on the
presence of a term, but on the presence of two specific terms?  For example,
I may want to boost the relevance of a document that contains both "iraq"
and "clerics", but not boost the relevance of documents that contain only
one or the other terms. (The idea is better discrimination than if I simply
boosted both terms.)

2) Is it possible to apply (or simulate) a negative query boost factor?  For
example, I may have a complex query with lots of terms but want to reduce
the relevance of a matching document that also included the term "iowa". (
The idea is for an easier and more discriminating way than simply increasing
the relevance of all other terms besides "iowa").

3) Is there a way to handle variants of a phrase without OR'ing together the
variants?  For example, I may want to find documents dealing with North
Korea; the terms might be "north korea" or "north korean" or "north
koreans" - is there a way to handle this with a single term using wildcards?

Regards,

Terry
