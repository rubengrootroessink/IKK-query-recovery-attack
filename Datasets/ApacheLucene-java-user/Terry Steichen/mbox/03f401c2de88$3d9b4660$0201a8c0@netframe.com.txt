Samir,

The size of the index depends on (a) the size of the documents, (b) the
number of fields per document, (c) the fields that are kept in the index.
The time taken to index depends on the same plus the characteristics of the
processor and storage i/o.  With so many variables, I don't think the simple
listing you're requesting will be of much use.

Regards,

Terry

Hello friends,
If it is not much of a trouble, I would like to ask as many of you as
possible, to post some statistics.
This would preferably include

1. Size of the index.
2. No of documents indexed.
3. Time taken to index new documents.
4. Time taken for a typical query.


thank you,
Samir
