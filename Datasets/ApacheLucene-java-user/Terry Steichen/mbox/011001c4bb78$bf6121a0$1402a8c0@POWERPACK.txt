I think what Erik's asking is whether you can live with expressing your indexed date in the
form of YYYYMMDD, without the hour and minute extension.  That will sharply educe the number
of range query expansion terms.  If you're using the timestamp as a unique identifier, you
might consider creating two fields, one for the unique identifier (YYYYMMDDHHmmssZ) and one
for the date (YYYYMMDD), and only use the range on the date field (not on the timestamp field)

  I need to do range searches. They are part of the requirements and even
  worse, the range can be as big as up to 10 years for now. It will get
  bigger. I'm indexing using YYYYMMDDHHmmssZ format and as you said there will
  be more than just 365 terms per year. This number changes every day as new
  documents are indexed daily. The only limit I can see is the number of
  documents that were indexed. I guess maxClauseCount can't be more than the
  indexed documents.

  What do you mean change how the dates are indexed? By the way this field is
  indexed as a string.
