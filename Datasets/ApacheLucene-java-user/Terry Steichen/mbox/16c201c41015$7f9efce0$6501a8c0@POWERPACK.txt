Erik,

There are a number of different possibilities which I'm still evaluating.
But if there is some significant reason for *not* subclassing Hits
(performance?), that will have a major bearing on whether the approach I'm
evaluating makes sense.

So, let me rephrase my question: Is the "final" nature of Hits due to some
performance reason, or simply because no one has previously expressed any
interest in subclassing it?  Or, putting it in reverse, is there any
technical problem likely to arise from removing the "final" attribute(s)?

Regards,

Terry
