SUBJECT: Slash Problem
DATE: 25 Nov 2002

I've got a Text field (tokenized, indexed, stored) called 'path' which contains a string in
the form of '1102\A3345-12RT.XML'.  When I submit a query like "path:1102*" it works fine.
 But, when I try to be more specific (such as "path:1102\a*" or "path:1102*a*") it fails.
 I've tried escaping the slash ("path:1102\\a*") but that also fails.

I'm using the StandardAnalyzer and the default QueryParser.  Could anyone suggest what's going
wrong here?

Regards,

Terry
