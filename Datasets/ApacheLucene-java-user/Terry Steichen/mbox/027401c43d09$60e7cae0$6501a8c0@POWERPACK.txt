Subject: Internal full content store within Lucene


> Per the discussion the other day about storing content external to 
> Lucene I think we have an opportunity to improve the lucene core and 
> bring a lot of functionality to future developers.
> 
> Right now Lucene allows you to have a 'stored' field which keeps the 
> content with a segment along with your inverted index.
> 
> While this is flexible for small indexes in production environments it 
> falls down because index merges take FOREVER.
> 
> A thread the other day opened up and suggesting storing just a pointer 
> to a file on the filesystem.  This got me thinking about a long term 
> mechanism I wanted for our cluster where we store content outside of the 
> index in a high performance flat-file database.
> 
> The Lucene index would only maintain FILENO-:OFFSET:LENGTH info within 
> the index and this would allow us to point to our flat file database. 
> 
> This would allow Lucene index merges to be FAST, support native field 
> storage, and allow the filesystem optimize contiguous blocks for the 
> flat content store.  Everyone wins.
