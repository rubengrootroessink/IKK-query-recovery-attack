Shiv,

Searching in Lucene is field-based.  Thus you must specify the field to be
searched - the only 'exception' is that one field is defined as default.  If
you want to search across multiple fields, I believe you must create a
concatenation of the individual fields into a single one during the indexing
process (eg. productName+" "+productDesc), and then use that as the basis of
your subsequent searches.

HTH,

Terry
