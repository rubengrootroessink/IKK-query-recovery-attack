SUBJECT: Computing Relevancy Differently
DATE: 25 Jan 2003

How would one go about altering the formula for relevancy?  (That is, which modules and which
code?)  I'm certain that the current algorithm is well founded in logic and probably works
well in many environments.  

However, I find that, as I index news stories, the current algorithm frequently doesn't produce
meaningful rankings.  In previous discussions in this list about relevancy, the algorithm
seemed to be very complex, possibly too complex for my poor brain to fully grasp.  But I'd
like to try some other options and see if they result in rankings more in line with what my
average viewer would expect.

Regards,

Terry
