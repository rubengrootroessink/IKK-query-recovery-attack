SUBJECT: Broken by Lock
DATE: 21 Sep 2003

About a month ago, timeouts were added to Lock (and they seem to make a lot of good sense).
 However, because of this enhancement, in using the latest CVS my application broke - I keep
getting the message "Lock obtain timed out".  I looked through the source in an attempt to
figure out a quick way to set something to provide backward compatibility, but it didn't leap
out at me.  

Does anyone know of a simple way to do this?

Regards,

Terry
