I confirmed that I can search properly when I replace all my backslashes
with forward slashes. (I had the terminology reversed in my last message.)
I now have to check if the Windows OS will accept the replacement or if I'll
have to do dynamic conversions when I use the content.

It appears that the '\' escape character isn't working (for me, at least).

Regards,

Terry
