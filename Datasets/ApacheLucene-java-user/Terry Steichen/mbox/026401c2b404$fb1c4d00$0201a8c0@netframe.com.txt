If, when you index your document, you concatenate the contents of A, B and C
into, say, a field called X, you can of course search for X:foo as well as
C:foo.  However, to the best of my knowledge, Lucene doesn't provide the
capability to nest fields (and, to tell the truth, I'm not sure what that
would buy you).

Regards,

Terry
