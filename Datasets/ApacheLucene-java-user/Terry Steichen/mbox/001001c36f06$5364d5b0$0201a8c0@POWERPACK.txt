Tatu,

My comments were not intended to be directed specifically toward you.  And I
don't think you worded your reply badly.

<soapbox>
Rather, it is my general observation, after participating in this list for a
year and a half, that there seems to be a consistently big gap between
Lucene newbies and "old hands".    Bridging that gap isn't simply a matter
of RTFM, because the available "manual" just scratches the surface of what
can be done.  It is my experience that you have to become immersed in the
details quite a bit before important aspects become evident.  Some will say
that's OK, because everyone is expected to "do their own homework."  I would
agree, if there was sufficient material available to study.  But simply
because Lucene is so powerful and capable and (IMHO) cutting edge, people
could use a bit more help not only in getting started, but in tapping some
of its more refined capabilities.
</soapbox>

Regards,

Terry

PS: If there is general interest in doing some documentation enhancement,
I'd be happy to participate/contribute.
