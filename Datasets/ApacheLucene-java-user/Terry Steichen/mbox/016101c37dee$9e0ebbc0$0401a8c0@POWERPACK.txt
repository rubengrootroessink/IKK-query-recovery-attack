Doug,

I just extracted a portion of the database, reindexed and found the scores
to come out much more like we'd expect.  Appears this may be an indexing
issue - I index new stuff each day and merge the new index with the master
index.  Only redo the master when I can't avoid it (because it takes so
long).  I probably merge 100 times or more before reindexing.  This evening
I'll reindex and let you know if the apparent problem clears up.  If so,
I'll keep track of it as I continue to merge and see if there's any issue
there.

Thanks for the input (and from Erik, pointing me to the Explanation - it's
pretty neat).

Question: The new scores for the test database portion mentioned above all
seem to come out in the range of .06 to .07.  I assume this is because they
never get normalized.  If this is the case, (a) would it hurt anything to
"normalize up" (so the scores range up to 1), and if so (b) is there an
easy, non-disruptive (to the source code) way to do this?

Regards,

Terry
