Pradeep,

I believe that using 'Suhas*' tells the search engine you're looking for a
term which starts with 'Suhas' and has 1 or more terms in addition.  Using
'Suhas' looks for a direct term match.

The '+' preceding the term tells the engine its mandatory that this term be
included.  The '-' says it's mandatory that this term not be included.

It's all in the docs, I think.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Terry
