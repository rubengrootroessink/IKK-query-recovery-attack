Samuel,

Not exactly sure of your question.  But, if the path is known at the time of
indexing, you just insert it in the Document that is created as part of the
indexing.  If you don't know the path till later, you might insert a partial
path at index time and add the exact location when you use it.  For example,
in my own system, I use a structure called "master_db", which has a standard
structure underneath it.  However, this whole database might be located
anywhere for any given deployment.  So, when I index, I define my document's
location within this "master_db" structure as the "path" field.  Then when I
retrieve it, I simply doc.get("path") and tack it on to the actual location.

As I said, I'm not sure this is exactly what you're looking for, but HTH
anyway.

Regards,

Terry
