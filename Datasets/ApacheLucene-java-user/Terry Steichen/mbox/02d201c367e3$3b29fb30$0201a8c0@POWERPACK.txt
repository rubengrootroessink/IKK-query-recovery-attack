Hi Peter,

I took a look at Mark's thesis and briefly at some of his code.  It appears
to me that what he's done with the so-called forward indexing is to (a)
include a unique id with each document (allowing retrieval by id rather than
by a standard query), and to (b) include a frequency map class with each
document (allowing easier retrieval of term frequency information).

Now I may be missing something very obvious, but it seems to me that both of
these functions can be done rather easily with the standard (unmodified)
version of Lucene.  Moreover, I don't understand how use of these functions
will facilitate retrieval of documents that are "similar" to a selected
document, as outlined in my original question on this topic.

Could you (or anyone else, of course) perhaps elaborate just a bit on how
using this approach will help achieve that end?

Regards,

Terry
