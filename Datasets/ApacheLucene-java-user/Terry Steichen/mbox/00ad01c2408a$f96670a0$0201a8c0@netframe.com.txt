Hi Karl,

I have discovered that with range queries you *must* ensure there is a space
on either side of the dash.

That is, [1971 - 1979] rather than [1971-1979].  If you don't, Lucene will
interpret it as [1979 - null].

To illustrate a bit more, here are some result totals that I get on my
index:
pub_mo:[07 - 08]  --> 8370 (note the spaces around the dash
pub_mo:[07-08]    --> 2133 (note the absence of spaces)
pub_mo:[08 - null] --> 2133
pub_mo:(07 08)    --> 8370 (note the use of parentheses, not brackets)

Just put the spaces in and all should be OK.

Regards,

Terry
