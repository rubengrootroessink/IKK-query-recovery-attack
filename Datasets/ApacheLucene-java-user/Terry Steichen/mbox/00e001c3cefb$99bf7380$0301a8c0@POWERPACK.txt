SUBJECT: Re: Error deleting a document when using the compound file index
DATE: 30 Dec 2003

Paul,

I just started using 1.3 final (labeled 1.4 RC1) and ran into a similar
problem (though I'm not using the compound file option).  My code ran just
fine all the way through 1.3RC3, but with the latest release, the
reader.delete() threw a "Lock obtain timed out" IOException.  What I finally
did was locate the place earlier in my code where the FSDirectory was first
created, and immediately followed it with a call to
IndexReader.unlock(fsdir).  So far, that appears to have done the trick (but
I haven't had much time to fully test it yet).

Regards,

Terry
