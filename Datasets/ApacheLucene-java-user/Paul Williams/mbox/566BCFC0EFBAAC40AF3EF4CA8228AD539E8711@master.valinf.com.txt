SUBJECT: Getting a field value from a large indexed document is slow.
DATE: 14 May 2004

Hi,

I hope someone can help!
I am using Lucene to make a searching repository of electronic documents.
(MS Office, PDF's etc.). Some of these document can contain a large amount
of text (about 500K of text in some cases) which is indexed to make it
searchable. 

Doing the search and getting the hits found is not effected by the size of
the document found.

But when I try and access a field (my document id) in the document

 i.e.

// Create Lucene Doc with value
Document doc = hits.doc(i);

String number = doc.get("Field10");


The creation of the Lucene document can take up to a second per hit. I don't
actually use any of the other fields apart from getting my ID value from
field10.

So my question is:-

Is there a smarter way of getting out the 'Field10' value without it
populating all the rest of the fields in the Lucene document and therefore
reduce the time taken for this action.


Paul
