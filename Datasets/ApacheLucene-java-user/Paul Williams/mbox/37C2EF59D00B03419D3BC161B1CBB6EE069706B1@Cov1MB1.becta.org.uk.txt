That was the approach I was planning to take but I've been asked to
provide a more intelligent implementation.  Basically I need to count
search phrases like 'x y z' and 'y z x' as being the same.

Hi,

You first save those search keywords entered by users into some kind
of storage like a database system or even into a dedicated Lucene
index. So it's a database and web issue, not a Lucene one.

And, as you know, Lucene does not provide this functionality out of the
box.

Good luck!
