Mats,

I believe when you call parser.parse with the Analyzer again you reset the
state of default operator
The following code should do what you want.


     QueryParser parser = new QueryParser( FIELD, service.getAnalyzer());
     parser.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
     Query query = parser.parse(queryString);

Regards,

Paul

Subject: status of AND as default logical operator for QueryParser


what is the status of the default operator feature of QueryParser?

i want to have a lucene enabled app using AND as it's default operator using
the code: 

  QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(FIELD, service.getAnalyzer());
  parser.setOperator(parser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
  Query query = parser.parse(queryString, FIELD, service.getAnalyzer());

results are however not as expected but rather the QueryParser still uses
OR.

is this not the way i am supposed to use the feature? 
why is it not working?
