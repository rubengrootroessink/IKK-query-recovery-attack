I'd checked that also.  Finally, I got it to work by creating a new empty
directory off the root.  But if I created an empty subdirectory off of that
directory it would not work.  Very strange.  Definitely a security issue
somewhere but for the life of me I can not figure it out.  At least it is
working for now.

Thanks,

Alex
