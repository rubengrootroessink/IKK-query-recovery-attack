SUBJECT: Books about lucene
DATE: 26 Nov 2009

Hi guys,

  I’ve read Lucene in Action and also implemented a general purpose FTP
search engine with lucene, you can find the source here: http://code.google.
com/p/askrosa/

I want to learn more about the implementation of lucene, e.g. index storing
structure, compression etc. 

Could anyone here recommend some books about these topics?

 

 

Best Regards!
