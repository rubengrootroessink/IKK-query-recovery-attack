to be detailed, I implemented a ftp search engine for campus students. I
have handle many different words including chinese words, as a result I
can't only use whitespaceanalyzer. My analyzer is now like this:

    StandardTokenizer tokenStream = new StandardTokenizer(reader,
replaceInvalidAcronym);
    tokenStream.setMaxTokenLength(maxTokenLength);
    TokenStream result = new StandardFilter(tokenStream);
    result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);
    result = new StopFilter(result, stopSet);
    result = new SnowballFilter(result,STEMMER);

StandardTokenizer is modified by me to split words like season09(like search
for friends season 09) to “season" and "09"。
word "c++" is analyzed as "c".

I know i can modify the standardtokenizer to achieve my goal. But are there
any other neat methods?
