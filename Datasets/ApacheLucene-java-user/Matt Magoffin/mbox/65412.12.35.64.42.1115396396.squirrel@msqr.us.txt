Here is a sample query that produces the error:

+dcode:123182 +cdate:[20050501 TO 20050531] +((+gn:m +sn:malen)
phone:3458345730 addr:345 hiller (+sn:malen +zip:34535))

I'll see about getting a test case, but like I said it doesn't happen
every time so I've had a hard time tracking down the problem.
