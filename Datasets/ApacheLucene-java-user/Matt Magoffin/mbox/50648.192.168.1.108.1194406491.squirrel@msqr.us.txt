SUBJECT: Can multiple JVMs search an index with one JVM writing to it?
DATE: 7 Nov 2007

Hello, I tried finding information about this from past mailing list
emails, but couldn't find anything. I'm using Lucene 1.4 series and
wondered if it is safe for two different JVMs opening and searching the
same physical index located on the local file system, with one of the JVMs
performing writes to the index?

All JVMs are long-running application servers, so I was wondering if this
would work at all or pose any problems for the search-only JVMs.
