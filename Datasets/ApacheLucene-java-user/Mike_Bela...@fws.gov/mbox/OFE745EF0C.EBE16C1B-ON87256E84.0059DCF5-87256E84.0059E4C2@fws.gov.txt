SUBJECT: Combining text search + relational search
DATE: 28 Apr 2004





I need to somehow aloow users to do a text search and query relational
database attributes at the same time. The attributes are basically metadata
about the documents that the text search will be perfomed on. I have the
text of the documents indexed in Lucene. Does anyone have any advice or
examples. I also need to make sure I don't garble up all the memory on our
server

Thanks
Mike
