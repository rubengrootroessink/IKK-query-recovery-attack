how can I filter my search to not include items containing a particular 
field and value?

I want effectively to add -myfieldname:myvalue to the end of  my search 
query, but I cant see how to do this via the api.
I have a complex query built up via the api and just want to filter it 
based on field name/value pairs.

I'm sure it must be simple - I just cant see how to do it.

thanks.
Jason.
