SUBJECT: Re: how can I filter my search to not include items containing a particular field and value?
DATE: 12 Jan 2007

Thanks Erick,
	this is what I ended up doing more or less but I'm not happy with it 
really,
						 hparser.setDefaultOperator(QueryParser.Operator.AND);
Query hideQuery =hparser.parse("properties@"+hideterm+":"+hidevalue); 

cquery.add(hideQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST_NOT);

what I was really looking for was a way to code the fields I wanted 
hidden without such a loose interface. I was expecting something like a 
fieldQuery object but couldn't find anything appropriate.

Thank you for your help.
