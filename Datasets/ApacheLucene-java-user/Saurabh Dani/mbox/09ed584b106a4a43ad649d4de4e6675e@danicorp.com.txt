Greetings All,

In the past week, we have released the first public beta of our first Lucene based product.

Minalyzer (Miner and Analyzer) is a unique product that combines search with data analysis.
We have found many scenarios where data analysis can be based on phrases / keywords in the
data and we are trying to target that market. Minalyzer also targets those lucene users who
are looking at quick deployment of full text indexing and search capabilities without any
programming required.

Minalyzer index server is "like" a database server, where one can create multiple datastores.
Datastores in Minalyzer world are similar to "databases", where one can creates multiple "index
collections" (like tables in databases). Each Index Collection within a datastore is a lucene
index, which can be created without any programming knowledge. We have provided GUI Wizards
to create index collections on log files (any delimited file), plain text files and relational
databases.

We will be adding several more Wizards to easily index information and templates to generate
reports. We do expect the application to have some minor bugs in Beta phase, and we plan a
monthly release to address those bugs and to add new features.

If you want to try it out, we have provided step by step instructions to download, install
and index a sample IIS log file. We have even provided a sample log file, so all you need
is about 10-15 minutes to try it out -> currently we are only supporting Windows platform
-> http://tinyurl.com/ybgeqx . You need a Windows machine with .net 2.0 installed to test
it.

We have provided some screen shots / demo of the End User Interface (Smart Client), report
designer interface and the interface for Administrative client to Manage the index server
here -> http://tinyurl.com/y6agap .

If you have any feedback / critique, we would love to hear that.

Thanks for your time.
Saurabh
