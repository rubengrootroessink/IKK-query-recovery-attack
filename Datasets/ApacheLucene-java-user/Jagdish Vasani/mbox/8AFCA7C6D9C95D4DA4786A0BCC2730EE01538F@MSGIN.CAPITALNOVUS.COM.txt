Yes..you can Store Text file content by saying that field store-Field.Store.YES.same time you
can also index it by saying Field.Index.ANALYZED as another parameter of Field class contructor.

Thanks,
Jagdish

Subject: Store the documents content in the index

HI, 

Currently my text source files (800 000) are stored in folder which make
retrieving it by many users some how slow. I heard it might be possible that
these files content can be stored in the index it self although I found this
unrealistic. 

Is it possible storing the source text files content in the index instead of
just “doc id” which is assigned with each term in the index?
