> Greetings All,
>
> We would like to introduce our java lucene based command line search tool,
> Minalyzer Lite.
>
> Minalyzer Lite ships with an indexing executable, which can index data
> from file system, databases,  by crawling web sites or an ARC file (output
> of Heritrix Crawler). The end user does not need any knowledge of lucene or
> java.
>
> The search executable takes the keywords and index collection name as
> inputs and returns the resultset as an XML which can be parsed and displyed
> by calling programs.
>
> For those of you who are aware of Solr, it is in no way a competitive
> product for Solr. Our target is primarily to provide "Site Search" for those
> web sites, which are hosted on low cost shared servers and do not have JAVA
> installed (as we are shipping an embedded version of Java and the calling
> program calls the search using exec / backtick / system commands).
>
> This page explains how site search works -
> http://www.minalyzer.com/documentation/minalyzerlite--how-site-search-works
>
> We have created some live examples to demonstrate the search features.
> Most of these are running on shared hosting accounts which cost less than 3
> USD a month.
>
> Php script hosted on Linux server
> http://demo1.minalyzer.com/minalyzerlite/search4.php
> Perl script hosted on Linux server
> http://demo1.minalyzer.com/minalyzerlite/perl/search.pl
> Aspx .Net running on Windows server
> http://www.minalyzer.com/mlitedemos/aspx/samplesearch.aspx
>
> We have done tests with close beta groups that we feel confident enough to
> announce the public availability, but we are still calling it beta until we
> upgrade to Lucene 2.1 and make the examples that we ship with the product
> more error proof and robust.
>
> Thanks
