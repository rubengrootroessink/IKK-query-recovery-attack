SUBJECT: Deleting from Index by URL field: is it safe?
DATE: 28 Nov 2008

Hi all,

I want to safely delete documents from my index. There is an URL field 
that specifies where the document came from.

I'm using something like this:

    indexwriter.deleteDocuments(new Term("URL", myURL));

(inspired by the Lucene in Action Book, page 35.)

I'm uncertain whether this is safe or not: is there a chance that I 
delete documents I would want to keep? How does the matching exactly work.

During indexing, I'm using a KeywordAnalyzer for the URL field in order 
to avoid tokenization.

Best,

    Niels
