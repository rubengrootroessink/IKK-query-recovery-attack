I tried different settings. Apart from the fact that my memory issue 
seems to by my own fault, I'm wondering what Lucene does in the 
background. Apparently it does flush(), but not commit()?

At least my index remains empty when I'm querying. If I call commit() 
every now and then (like every 500 documents), there are data I can query.

Best
