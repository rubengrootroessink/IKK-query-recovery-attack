Is there a built-in mechanism in the IndexReader to reload the index 
every now and then, after having checked that it has changed?

So there is no means to do this automatically? I mean, I can count 
documents while adding them and do commit() every now and then, or I 
could commit every time one hour of indexing has passed, etc...
