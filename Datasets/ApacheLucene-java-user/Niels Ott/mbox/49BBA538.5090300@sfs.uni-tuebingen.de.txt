SUBJECT: Speeding up RangeQueries?
DATE: 14 Mar 2009

Hi all,

I'm working on my prototype system and it turns out that RangeQueries 
are quite slow. In a first test I have about 80.000 documents in my 
index and I combine two range queries with a normal text query using the 
BooleanQuery.

On the long run I will need to enhance my index at indexing-time so that 
the range queries will be substituted by simple keywords.

For now, I'm interested in a possibility to speed up range queries. Does 
the performance of a range query depend on the length of contents in the 
field in question?

Best,

    Niels
