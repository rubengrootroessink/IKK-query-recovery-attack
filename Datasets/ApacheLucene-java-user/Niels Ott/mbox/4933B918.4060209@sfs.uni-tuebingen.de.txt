Is that also true if I simply use the KeywordAnalyzer?

The reason why I want to do it this way is that I have a special 
Analyzer that encapsulates the "knowledge" on how to treat each field. 
In a way something like the PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper but more 
specialized. I want to use the very same Analyzer for querying as well, 
so it appears to me that it is good to have the "knowledge" about the 
treatment of fields in that single place.

I think the URL is unique enough for my cases. The system is still a 
prototype so I can change that later, if it turns out that it doesn't do 
the job for me.

This looks like a good idea to me. Thank you for the hint.

Best,
