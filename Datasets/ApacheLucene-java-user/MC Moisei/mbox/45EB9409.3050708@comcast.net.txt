Daniel,

Thanks for replying. THe only reason I don't close my indexSearcher is
that I got the "Too Many File Open Exception" and I decided to make my
searcher static in the SearchService.

If I do go and close then open a new one I may expose myself to some
concurent access issues while people can update their files other can do
the searches for those files ( My searcheables are files entities)

Since the IndexSearcher has an underlying IndexReader I should use that
one to handle the reads in the Interceptor but that won't do me too much
good since I need certain methods that are no in IndexReader ( and  BTW
i thought I've mentioned that I use the IndexModifier that is a mixture
of the IndexReader and IndexWriter ).

Any ideas ?

MC
