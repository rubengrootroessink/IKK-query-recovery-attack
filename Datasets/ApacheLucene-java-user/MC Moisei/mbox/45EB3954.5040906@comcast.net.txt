SUBJECT: IndexSearcher cache

Hi to all members of the user group!

Let me get to my problem. I use Lucene in two different parts of the
application. One is the SearchService and one is an AOP interceptor that
intercepts any changes in the Searcheable entities. This last part is
removing the document from the index and add the document again.

That being said, here's my test case.

My searcheable item has in content "apple banana" if I search for apple
or banana I get it back amoung the results.
If I modify it and remove banana from content when I search for apple or
banana I get same results as above (!?)
If I restart my application so the IndexSearcher is recreated, I run the
test above I only get my document if I search for apple - that leads me
to conclude that the IndexSearcher caches the results.

Is there a way to clear IndexSeacher when I do the reindexing ( I use
IndexModifer for the AOP interceptor) ?

MC
