Hey Andre,

The reason the javadoc says the field should not be tokenized stems from 
the issue you point out. What you want to do is possible of course, but 
making the Lucene code change would complicate a process that can be 
quite memory and cpu intensive on large collections. Done right, it 
might make a good patch though.

A compromise that you can make outside of the Lucene code is to index a 
separate field with the same contents but untokenized. Sorting on this 
field instead, Lucene will treat "North Carolina" as one token and sort 
as you'd expect. The downside to this approach is that you will have to 
juggle the two fields in the future.
