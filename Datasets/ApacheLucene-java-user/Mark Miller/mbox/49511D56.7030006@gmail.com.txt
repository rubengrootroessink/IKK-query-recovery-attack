Norms are a byte value per field stored in the index that is factored 
into the score. Its used for length normalization (shorter documents = 
more important) and index time boosting. If you want either of those, 
you need norms. When norms are loaded up into an IndexReader, its loaded 
into a byte[maxdoc] array for each field - so even if one document out 
of 400 million has a field, its still going to load byte[maxdoc] for 
that field (so a lot of wasted RAM).  Did you say you had 400 million 
docs and 7 fields? Google says that would be:


    **400 million x 7 byte = 2 670.28809 megabytes**

On top of your other RAM usage.
