SUBJECT: Re: Can I do "Google Suggest" Like Search?
DATE: 13 Jul 2006

Another option is to use Sun's free and soon to be open source Java Studio
Creator2. It's a great way to do JSF and provides an AJAX google suggest
type component. You can hook this component up to a lucene search and
*BOOM*...google suggest.

Here is a link to a "did you mean" tutorial as well (it may give some hints
in the implementation of suggest as well):
