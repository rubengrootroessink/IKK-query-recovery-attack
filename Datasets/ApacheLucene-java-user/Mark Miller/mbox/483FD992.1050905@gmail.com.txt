I guess my test index was corrupted some other way...I can not duplicate 
my results today without breaking things with two lockless Writers 
first. Oh well.

I definitely saw it legitimately while playing with 
IndexReader.reopen...if I kept enough of the old IndexReaders around 
long enough I would get a mix of too many files open, filenotfound, and 
list returned null. Unfortunately, I don't have that code anymore.
