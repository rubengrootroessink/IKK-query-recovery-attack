You should use DateTools to break up your time stamp into multiple
fields. This can work a lot faster than using a field with so many
different terms.

Are you using a RangeQuery? If you are, ditch it and use a
ConstantScoreRangeQuery. The former will expand the query to a boolean
that contains each matching unique term while the latter will just score
1 for each matching doc.

I believe that Lucene is scoring docs, and as it scores them, dropping
them into a priority queue that sorts...normally by the score, but
optionally by fields as well.
