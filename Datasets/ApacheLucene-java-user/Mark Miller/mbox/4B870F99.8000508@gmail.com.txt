SUBJECT: Re: If you could have one feature in Lucene...

It's also not really the case that committers are mainly here to do work 
and push the project forward. It's an open source project - its up to 
the community to push the project as they see fit and have the time.

Committers are simply past contributers that have proven trustworthy and 
capable in the past - committers are here to commit code (not 
necessarily their own).

In an open source world, if you want something done, you do it yourself. 
Most committers have many other things going on at different points in 
time. This is the land of scratch your own itch most of the time - and 
once the itch is scratched, a committer will help you get the code 
commited. Some committers don't have the time to work with Lucene like 
they once did.

Some core committers have been off doing other things for some time now 
- others come and go. Some spend more time on Solr. Their time is not 
bound to Lucene in any way. Others spend an amazing amount of time on 
Lucene - it seems to me that Lucene has what appears to be 3 full time 
devs :) Uwe, Robert, and Michael are always hacking away at a frantic 
pace. They have done an amazing amount of work on the flex branch 
recently, a large move forward in the core code that will lead to many 
other large moves forward.

Committers come in all shapes and sizes. We should simply thank them for 
the time they put in and be happy with it. Lucene is developed by far 
more people than the committers - a committer is simply someone that has 
svn write access - anyone can (and many non committers do) drive Lucene 
core forward.

Not many are going to have the time and know how (and ridiculous genius) 
to match Mike McCandless' contributions. So it goes. If he is the bar 
for a committer, I quite.
