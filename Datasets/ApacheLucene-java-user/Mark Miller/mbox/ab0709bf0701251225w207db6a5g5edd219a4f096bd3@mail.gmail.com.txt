I have hammered over 2.5 million  5-10k docs into an index this way  (a
realtime system that I had not yet added a special load call to) and had 0
problems. One indexwriter of course. It's not recommended  (utterly dog slow
and man did Hibernate add to the loading problem until I addressed batch
loading...) but it sure did work flawlessly.
