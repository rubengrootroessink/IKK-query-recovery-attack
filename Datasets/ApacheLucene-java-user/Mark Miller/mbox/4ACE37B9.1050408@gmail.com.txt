The main thing to do is to copy the segments_N files last - thats what a
Reader will use to see there is a new index version. The segments.gen
files is a backup resort that shouldn't likely be used unless your on
NFS from what I know.

I think this was only necessary before IndexDeletionPolices - you didn't
want the IndexWriter removing the files before you were done copying
them out. You can manage that with a delete policy now though.
