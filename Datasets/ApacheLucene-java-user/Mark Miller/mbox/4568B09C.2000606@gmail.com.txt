SUBJECT: Re: Question about the "not" in lucene
DATE: 25 Nov 2006

Personally, I think of it as not a 'not' operator, but more a 'but not' 
or 'and not' operator. Thats not totally the case I believe, but gives 
you semantics that work. Truly I think that each part of the query 
creates a score and the NOT query scores 0. That gives a different 
result than a boolean system. More than a few times it has been 
mentioned that Lucene is a scoring system and not a boolean system.
