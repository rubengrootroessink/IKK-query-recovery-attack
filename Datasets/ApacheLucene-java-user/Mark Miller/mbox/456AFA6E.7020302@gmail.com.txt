SUBJECT: Re: Question about the "not" in lucene
DATE: 27 Nov 2006

Yes, I believe that it is entirely possible. You can nest and link 
boolean clauses all you want: your example query would be a boolean with 
two top level clauses, one required to be there and one required not to 
be there. The second top level clause would itself be a boolean query 
with two two clauses, both with a SHOULD. Now, what I think happens (I 
haven't looked myself) is that the type:product will score a document 
positively if found, but the NOT clause will score a document to 0 if 
either of it's sub-clauses are found. Those 0 scores will not return as 
hits. Now notice that if you just have "NOT(name:"toto" OR name:"tit")" 
ALL of the docs will score 0 one way or another- the docs not found will 
be 0 and docs found will be scored 0 by the NOT...so you will not get a 
result. Now if you use the special query that matches all docs, and then 
use a NOT query...the not query will work as expected...all docs will 
get a positive score, but the NOT query will 0 out those in the MUST_NOT 
clause.

I am an unclear kind of guy, so I hope that gives some help.
