DATE: 25 Feb 2007

I am a bit confused about what you are asking. Why do you need the 
Searcher to time out? That code should release your searchers at the 
appropriate times...when the index has been modified. The way that I use 
it is to make a synchronized map that keeps around an index accessor for 
each index that I open...from there the code should do the rest...when a 
writer or a writing reader is released the code waits for all searchers 
to be released and then clears the cache of searchers and new searchers 
are created when requested until another writer or writing reader is 
released...
