SUBJECT: Sorting from multiple indexes
DATE: 1 Oct 2006

I was browsing the sort javadocs and ran into this:

This class is not set up to be able to efficiently sort hits from more 
than one index simultaneously.

Does this mean sorting with a muiltsearcher is very slow? Anyone have 
any experience?
