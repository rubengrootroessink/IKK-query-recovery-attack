Not to step out of Lucene world, but I would love to know the truth of 
the matter on this...the first site that search brings up on google 
seems to claim that was the behavior back at 1.2 or so and it is not the 
case anymore.

The javadocs don't seem to mention it:


      lastModified

public long *lastModified*()

    Returns the time that the file denoted by this abstract pathname was
    last modified.

    *Returns:*
        A |long| value representing the time the file was last modified,
        measured in milliseconds since the epoch (00:00:00 GMT, January
        1, 1970), or |0L| if the file does not exist or if an I/O error
        occurs 
    *Throws:*
        |SecurityException
        <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityException.html>|
        - If a security manager exists and its
        ||SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)|
        <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityManager.html#checkRead%28java.lang.String%29>|
        method denies read access to the file
