Depending on the size of your index, the number of docs will matter
though. You have to store the unique terms in a String[] array, but you
also store an int[] array the size of maxdoc that indexes into the
unique terms array. Depending on your index, this could be as much or
more of a cost than the unique terms.

It doesn't matter how many documents you get back though for a
particular search - its just how many docs are in the index.
