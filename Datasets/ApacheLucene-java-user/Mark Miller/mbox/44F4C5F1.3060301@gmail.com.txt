1. I would need to know more, but it sounds like you should uncomment it :)

2. JavaCC 4.0 is fine.  If you look at the Lucene build.xml you will see 
that  it compile the javacc generated classes in a separate directory so 
that it can exclude the ParseException class from compilation. Check out 
the build file and copy that method.
