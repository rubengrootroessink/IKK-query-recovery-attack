SUBJECT: Re: Multiword Highlighting
DATE: 27 Jan 2007

Isn't it semi trivial if you are not interested in the fragments (I 
swear it seems that most people are not)? Isn't it you that suggested 
turning the query into a SpanQuery, extracting the spans and then doing 
the highlighting after a rewrite? This seems somewhat trivial so what am 
I missing? I have started a simple implementation of this, but stopped 
short of combining the highlight spans (seems like a nasty n^2 problem 
that I don't know a good algorithm around - every new highlight has to 
be compared against every previous highlight for overlap : I am sure 
your the man to ask about this). I plan on getting back into this soon. 
Not trivial? Or do you just mean with the fragments...you seem to be 
deeply interested in fragments but a lot of people seem to just want to 
highlight the source text.

Any words of wisdom would be sorely appreciated.
