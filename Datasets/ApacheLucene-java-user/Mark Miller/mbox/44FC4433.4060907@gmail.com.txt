SUBJECT: Re: How to combine multiple fields to a single field for indexing
DATE: 4 Sep 2006

How do you set the position increment gap between each addition to the 
same field name. Should you set it as high as possible to prevent 
proximity queries from crossing it? I have been looking for the code to 
find out how to put a gap between each same name field addition, but I 
have been unable to find what I am looking for. Also, when using a 
nearspan, things blow up if you look for something within 
Integer.maximum--sic :) -- Will this be the same case for setting the 
positional gap and if so is there a good max to use to keep a query from 
ever crossing it?

Thanks,

Mark
