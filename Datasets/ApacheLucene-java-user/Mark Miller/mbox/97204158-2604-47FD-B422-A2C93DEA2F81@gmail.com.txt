SUBJECT: Re: Difference between regular Highlighter and Fast Vector Highlighter ?
DATE: 11 Apr 2011

The general and short answer is:

Highlighter: highlights more query types, has a fairly rich API, doesn't scale well to very
large documents (though https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2939 is going to help
a lot here) - does not require that you store term vectors, but is faster if you do.

FVH: works with fewer query types and requires that you store term vectors - but scales better
than the std Highlighter to very large documents
