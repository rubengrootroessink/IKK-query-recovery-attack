I am not seeing the problem. One small thing is that you don't need to 
make another Reader...you can get the one from the IndexSearcher. But I 
dont see why your are getting that error...that is the type of error you 
would get if you were trying to use IndexReaders Protected constructor 
outside the index package...but you are correctly using the static open 
call...
