The ~ syntax can only be applied to a single phrase, i.e. "the greate
one"~3. This sets the slop allowed for the phrase to be 3. The defintion of
slop can be found by searching the archive, but it will not easily allow for
what you are looking for. The Lucene query language has not yet recived Span
systax support. You might want to check out Surround in contrib which is an
alternate syntax with support for Spans. I also have a parser that adds
proximity support...I am currently sitting on version 1.0 waiting for some
free time to release. My syntax consists of binary operators including a
proximity operator. Precedence works as expected (being a binary op sytax)
and a search for (alien ufo crash site ) ~10 (Roswell NM New Mexico ) would
make sure that each term on the left is within 10 of each term on the right
(if you default space operator was AND).
