SUBJECT: Re: Simple query API question
DATE: 30 Apr 2008

When using the API you will create a Term object that specifies the
field for each term...so visually its more like field1:x or field1:y or
field1:z
and then a rangequery set to field2, all joined using the BooleanQuery
object setting Occur.must Occur.should Occur.mustnot.

Take a look at the range of classes that extend Query. Start with
TermQuery and BooleanQuery.
