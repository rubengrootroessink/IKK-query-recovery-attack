SUBJECT: Re: index corruption with latest lucene
DATE: 5 May 2008

I am getting even more confused. I luckily found a copy of one of the
corrupted test indices that i had made on 4/28/08...lucky as its the
only one I have ever made :) It doesn't have the problem. This is very
interesting to me, because the other site that has the problem has been
in action for months now. Both were running with my previous version of
Lucene, which was a trunk build from around when 2.3 was released I
think. Just seems odd that the test index was corrupted so recently.


So I am a bit stuck...its probably my own problem though, so unless
someone else sees it, Ill just report back if/when I find out more.
