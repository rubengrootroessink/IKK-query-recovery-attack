SUBJECT: Re: Multi -threaded indexing of large number of PDF documents

It sounds like you might have some thread synchronization issues outside 
of Lucene. To simplify things a bit, you might try just using one 
IndexWriter. If I remember right, the IndexWriter is now pretty 
efficient, and there isn't much need to index to smaller indexes and 
then merge. There is a lot of juggling to get wrong with that approach.
