Nothing in the Highlighter per seh that will help you there. I see two 
options off the top of my head:

1. break the text before feeding it to the highlighter and feed all but 
the URL parts, and then stitch back together -- much as you might do if 
highlighting an XML doc. Ugly though.

2. Use an Analyzer that recognizes URL's. That way you wont get partial 
URL matches like .net. Each URL would be a full token, and would require 
a search matching the entire URL to match. Even if you already indexed 
with a different Analzyer, you could use this special Analyzer just for 
highlighting...it would act exactly the same as your indexing Analyzer, 
but would parse any URL as a single token. Of course, if you are using 
TokenSource, this is not an option.

when the field content is a URL which contains the query e.g. my search is for .net and fields
has value http://jkjsd.net. After applying highlighter, it becomes http://jkjsd<b>.net</b>,
which is a wrong URL. Can I filter it out?
