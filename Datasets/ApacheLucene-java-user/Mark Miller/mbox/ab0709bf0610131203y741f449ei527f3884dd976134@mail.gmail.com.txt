There is no need to go from DB -> XML -> Lucene. While you can write an XML
Document handler for Lucene (as is done in LIA), it would be just as easy to
write a simple DB handler...just extract your field name, value pairs from
the DB and add them as fields to a lucene Document. You can write a general
implementation or something more specific depending on your needs.
