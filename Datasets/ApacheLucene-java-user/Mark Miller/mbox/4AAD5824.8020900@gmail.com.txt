Okay, good point. That makes sense - how about an example of low card,
just for grounding? In the hundreds? Under 10,000? Only 10's?

Also, do you mean to use Integer.Max_VALUE as infinite?

My personal opinion is that we can make javadoc changes for the final
without doing an RC, as long as no code/build/scipts at all is touched.
Not sure how others feel though.
