SUBJECT: Re: Problem using wildcardsearch in phrase search
DATE: 13 May 2007

I do not know enough about PhraseQuery to say how hard it would be to 
add support for wildcards, but I am sure there is some method of doing 
it -- it has just not been done. From what I can tell it would be easier 
to stop using PhraseQuery and use SpanQuery's if you wanted to do this. 
Maybe someone more knowledgeable about PhraseQuery could elaborate on 
some of the difficulties of adding wildcard support...then again I think 
you may find discussion of this if you search the archives.
