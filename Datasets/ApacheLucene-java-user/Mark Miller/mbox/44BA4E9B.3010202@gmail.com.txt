SUBJECT: Hits syncronization
DATE: 16 Jul 2006

Does the Hits class need to use a Vector for it's cache? Is the cache 
somehow shared among threads or should this be an ArrayList to avoid 
synchronization costs? Also, I do not see any backing array size 
initialization. Is this because the default of 10 is optimal? Am I wrong 
all over the place?
