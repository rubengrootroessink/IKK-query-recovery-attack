Nice! An 8 core machine with a test ready to go!

How about trying the read only mode that was added to 2.4 on your 
IndexReader?

And if you you are on unix and could try trunk and use the new 
NIOFSDirectory implementation...that would be awesome.

Those two additions are our current hope for what your seeing...would be 
nice to know if we need to try for more (or if we need to petition the 
smart people that work on that stuff to try for more ;) ).
