SUBJECT: Re: Searching a untokenized field using SnowballAnalyzer
DATE: 21 Aug 2006

My guess? When you store those field untokenized, they are untokenized. When
you use the SnowBall analyzer with the query parser and search those
untokenized fields, you're query is tokenized. As you can imagine, a
tokenized search by not match un untokenzied field. Why does this not happen
with StandardAnalyzer? Most likely because StandardAnalyzer does not modify
ferrari during it's processing (in fact I know it does not) while
SnowBallAnalyzer probably does modify ferrari...perhaps to ferrar.

The results:

search query: ferrari
query parser /SnowballAnalyzer: ferrar
query parser /StandardAnalyzer: ferrari
