Am I the only one that gets back a string missing the final character 
when using the highlighter and the null fragmenter? I always have to add 
the last character of what I have asked to be highlighted to what the 
highlighter returns when trying to hit highlight an entire 
document...anyone else every run into this?

cheers ( don't I wish i was British),
