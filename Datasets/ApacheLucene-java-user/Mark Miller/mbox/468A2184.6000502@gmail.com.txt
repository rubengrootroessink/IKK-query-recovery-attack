I have used it extensively and I would say it is extremely stable. As I 
said, much of the code from it is literally the same compiled code from 
Contrib Highlighter (It is really just a new Scorer class for the 
Contrib Highlighter).

It is also the newest of the Highlighter issues in JIRA and I would say 
it is not even close to widely used in the industry.
