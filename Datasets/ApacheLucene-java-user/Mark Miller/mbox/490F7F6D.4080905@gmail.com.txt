Been a while since I've been in the benchmark stuff, so I am going to 
take some time to look at this when I get a chance, but off the cuff I 
think you are open and closing the reader for each search. Try using the 
openreader task before the 100 searches and then the closereader task. 
That will ensure you are reusing the same reader for each search. Hope 
to analyze further soon.
