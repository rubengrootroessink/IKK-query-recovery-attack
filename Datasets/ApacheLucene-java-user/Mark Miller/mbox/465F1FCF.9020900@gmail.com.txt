I think your looking at a limitation of using the "fulltext" approach. 
You are also loosing the boosting you would get for matching on shorter 
fields. Sometimes you just have to give in and query across all fields 
or take the compromise..Lucene does not have a concept of "meta-fields" 
within fields that I know of.
