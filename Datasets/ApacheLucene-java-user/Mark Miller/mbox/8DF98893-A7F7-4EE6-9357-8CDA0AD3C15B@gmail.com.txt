Positions are only collected for "position sensitive" queries. The Highlighter framework that
I plugged this into already runs through the TokenStream one token at a time - to highlight
a TermQuery, there is no need to consult positions - just highlight every occurrence seen
while marching through the TokenStream. Which means there is no need to find those positions
either.

If you are looking for those positions, here is a patch to calculate them for TermQuerys as
well. If you open a JIRA issue, seems like a reasonable option to add to the class.
