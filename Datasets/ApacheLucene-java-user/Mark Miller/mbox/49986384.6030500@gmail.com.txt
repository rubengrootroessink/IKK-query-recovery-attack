Up to 2.4 (current release), they do come in order though, right?

We should update the javadocs in BooleanQuery before 2.9 goes out:

   * Specifics: By setting this option to true, calls to
   * {@link HitCollector#collect(int,float)} might be
   * invoked first for docid N and only later for docid N-1.
   * Being static, this setting is system wide.
   * </p>
   */
  public static void setAllowDocsOutOfOrder(boolean allow) {

This implies they are normally in doc id order (which they were until 
2.9 right?)
