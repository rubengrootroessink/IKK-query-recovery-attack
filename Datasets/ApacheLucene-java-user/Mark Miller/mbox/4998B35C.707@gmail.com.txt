SUBJECT: Re: Upper limit on number of Fields
DATE: 16 Feb 2009

In my experience, the main issue to be concerned about with tons of 
fields is norms. You'll likely have to turn them off for most of the 
fields unless you have plenty of RAM to burn. They are stored in byte 
arrays of size maxdoc for each field (eg non sparse). Other than that, I 
don't think there is a pronounced penalty in my experience for tons of 
fields. 10,000 fields is probably more than I have ever seen though, so 
do report back how it goes.
