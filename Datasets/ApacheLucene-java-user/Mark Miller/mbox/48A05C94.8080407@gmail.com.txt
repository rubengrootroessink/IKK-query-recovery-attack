If I were feeling adventurous, and I wanted to help out Mark with 
Lucene-1001, I'd try this:

Get the trunk and apply Lucene-1001.

Index all of your docs with the highlight coords as payloads.

At highlight time, do something like the SpanHighlighter does - I've got 
a class called something like PayloadSpansUtil  to help out with this. 
You want to index the doc to be highlighted into a MemoryIndex, and then 
pass an IndexReader off that to the util class - like the 
SpanHighlighter, it will convert a Query into a SpanQuery approximation, 
but instead of getting positions for matches, it will collect all of the 
payloads for matches.

Now run through the payloads and make a nice yellow/orange translucent 
block over each hit in the original image using the coords from each 
payload.
