SUBJECT: sorting by per doc hit count
DATE: 16 Dec 2006

I have not really looked into this yet, but maybe you can save me some time
-- Is it feasible/simple to sort by the number of hits found per document?
Would this require changing the scoring system (remove idf etc etc) and
doing a normal relevancy search? Could it be done with functionquery? Any
Hints? If it is a lot of work I am not interested in doing it, but if it is
somewhat simple it would make a few customers feel fuzzy.

Thanks,

Mark
