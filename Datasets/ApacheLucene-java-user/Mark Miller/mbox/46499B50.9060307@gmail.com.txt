SUBJECT: Re: Memory leak (JVM 1.6 only)
DATE: 15 May 2007

I don't have much help to offer other than to say I am also using a 
tweaked version of the IndexAccess code you are, with java 1.6, with 
hundreds of thousands to millions of docs, at multiple locations, for 
months -- and I have not seen any memory leaks. Leads me to think the 
leak may be with your code and not any Lucene code...

I will mention that the IndexAccess code does not handle multi-searchers 
very well without some adjustments, but even that should not cause a leak.

Keep playing with the Netbeans profiler...if it really is a leak, you 
aught to be able to find it.
