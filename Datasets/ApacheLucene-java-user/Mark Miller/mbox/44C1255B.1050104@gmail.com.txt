from the lucene wiki:

Can Lucene do a "search within search", so that the second search is 
constrained by the results of the first query?

Yes. There are two primary options:

  *

      Use QueryFilter with the previous query as the filter. (you can 
search the mailing list archives for QueryFilter and Doug Cutting's 
recommendations against using it for this purpose)
    *

      Combine the previous query with the current query using 
BooleanQuery, using the previous query as required.

The BooleanQuery approach is the recommended one.

unquote:
seems to me that simply adding your drilled down query part to the 
previous query with a BooleanQuery should do the trick.
