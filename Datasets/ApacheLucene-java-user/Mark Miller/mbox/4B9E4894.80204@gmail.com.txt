You should lower that merge factor - thats *really* high.

You shouldn't really need much more than 50 or so ... and for search 
speed your going to want fewer segments anyway -
if your just going to end up optimizing at the end, there is no reason 
for such a large merge factor - you will pay for most of what
you saved when you optimize.

That is very slow by the way. Should be much faster - especially if you 
are using multiple threads.
