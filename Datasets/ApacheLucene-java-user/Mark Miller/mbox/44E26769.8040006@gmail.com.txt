SUBJECT: Re: Quotes dependent StopWords removal
DATE: 16 Aug 2006

This appears tricky to me. I may be completely wrong but I would start 
by looking at the Standard Analyzer. I would try and create a new token 
that matched an open parenthesis. I would then change the next() method 
in StandardAnalyzer.jj to mark when it recognizes an open parenthesis. 
Now you are in a quote. Somehow mark each token (might not be an obvious 
way to do this) until you find another close parenthesis. Now mark that 
you are not in a quote. When not in a quote do not mark the tokens 
coming out of Next(). ) Now in the Stop Filter, check the token for your 
marker and do not remove it if it is marked.

Bear in mind...this all may be worthless speculating...
