Ahhh....the reason the second Shapes is not highlighted is that the 
Highlighter highlights based on what caused the hit in Lucene...and 
Lucene does not look for every shape within 4 paragraphs of 
distribution...after it finds one such occurrence it says "sweet, a 
match" and moves on...it does not look for another such match. If there 
where another occurrence of distribution on the other side of the last 
Shapes, then it would cause its own match. This may be because of how I 
have implemented my WithinSpanQuery or it may be how Span queries in 
lucene work in general. I will investigate and let you know. I am 
thinking that Lucene just quits after finding the span its looking 
for...it says ok I found distribution, now find shape within 4 
paragraphs after distribution...okay found it...I don't think it then 
says ok...is there another shape after that shape within 4...and then 
another and another?

Ill look into it further. Certainly though , other than this possible 
oddity...everything is working.
