As Erick said, Term positions are kept regardless of whether you store 
term vectors. The positional information is needed for phrase queries, 
span queries, etc. You certainly don't lose the ability to use phrase 
queries if you do not store term vectors. If you check out the Posting 
class in DocumentWriter you can trace around and see how positions are 
stored at the same basic level as the term that is stored. Positions are 
first class citizens <g>.
