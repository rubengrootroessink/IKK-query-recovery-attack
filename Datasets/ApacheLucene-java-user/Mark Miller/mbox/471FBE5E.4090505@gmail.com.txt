SUBJECT: Re: Index Reader Writer - 2 JVMs
DATE: 24 Oct 2007

Lucene does provide locking so that two JVM's can access the same index. 
Check out the LockFactory to control how this is done.

There are a couple advantages of using IndexAccessor:

For one you could use a NoLockFactory and avoid Lucene's locking 
mechanism. Also, you would only need to run one JVM.

Indexaccessor also causes new Readers to be opened as soon as a Writer 
is done...this allows for a fairly interactive index rather than having 
to reopen readers periodically...rather new content was added or not.

Also, access to Writing Readers, Writers, and Reading Readers, is all 
handled behind the scenes for you...you dont have to worry about what 
threads are doing what based on Lucene's index access rules...just 
request the Writer/Reader you need, use it, release it, and your good.

Probably there is more...
