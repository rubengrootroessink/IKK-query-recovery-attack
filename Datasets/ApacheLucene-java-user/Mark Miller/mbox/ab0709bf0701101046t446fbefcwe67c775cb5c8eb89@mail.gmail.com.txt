Not quite. NOT oranges is not possible. Neither is  -Oranges. Both will make
a query that score each doc to 0  if oranges is not found...but  ever doc
will start with 0 also...non will return. You need a piece of the query to
generate a positive score for the NOT or - to take effect -- otherwise every
document scores 0 and does not return.
