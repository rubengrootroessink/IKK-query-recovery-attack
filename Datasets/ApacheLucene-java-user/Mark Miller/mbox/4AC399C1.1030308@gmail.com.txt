Way the heck better - Hits is horrible for that. It caches like 100 hits
and then keeps searching when you exhaust the cache (been I while since
I've looked at the exact numbers). Its horribly inefficient for checking
every hit.

Hits will end up using a Collector anyway - and then throw a speed trap
for what you want on top of it. Part of why we deprecated it. To much
misuse.
