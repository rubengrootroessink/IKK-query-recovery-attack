SUBJECT: Re: Counting hits in a document
DATE: 18 Jan 2007

Just threw together a highlighter that can handle spans (combining a 
rewrite with dumspans from LIA) and used this: 
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=15568

Nice spans extractor from Mark (not me <G>). Give it a query it will 
give you the spans.
