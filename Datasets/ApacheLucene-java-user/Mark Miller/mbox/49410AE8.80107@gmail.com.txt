I dont think its worth the effort Paul (though it sounds like a fun 
thing to try, as long as JavaCC sticks to GWT compatible core classes). 
Seems a lot easier to just run the queryparser server side though and 
move the results back and forth with rpc. As a side note, Mark Harwood 
worked on a cool GWT port of Luke.
