SUBJECT: Field Selector in Searcher interface
DATE: 2 Mar 2007

What are the odds (or reasons against) bubbling up doc(int, 
fieldSeclector) to Searcher? I would love to take advantage of the 
selective field loading but I am working with MultiSearchers and 
Searchers so I cannot count on getReader (in IndexSearcher) for access.
