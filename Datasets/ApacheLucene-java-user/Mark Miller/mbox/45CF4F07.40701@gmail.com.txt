SUBJECT: Re: about merge factor
DATE: 11 Feb 2007

Not sensible at all. First, a merge above something like 90 most likely 
never makes since. Second, I have done some testing and my results show 
that if you optimize the index after loading, the merge factor really 
doesn't matter so keep it at 10 (I never used a max merge docs below 50. 
100 worked best, 1,000 and 2,000 slowed things down even though the test 
had access to 600MB RAM and the docs where around 10-20k each). Setting 
up a test harness that automatically indexes a good amount of docs (I 
did 20,000) with a variety of settings will tell you a lot. Things will 
obviously bend based on your setup.

be indexed,I set the merge factor to 660,000 instead of  the default value 10 (...and this
means no merge while indexing) and  later after closing the index,I use the IndexWriter to
optimize/merge  the whole index file...
