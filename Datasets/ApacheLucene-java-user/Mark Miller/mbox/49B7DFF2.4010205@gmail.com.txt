Hmmm - you can probably get qsol to do it: http://myhardshadow.com/qsol. 
I think you can setup any token to expand to anything with a regex 
matcher and use group capturing in the replacement (I don't fully 
remember though, been a while since I've used it).

So you could do a regex of something like : >=([0-9]+) and have it 
expand to [$1 rng Integer.Max] or something. Then handle the other cases.

You also might come up with your own regex that you could apply to the 
standard Lucene query parser syntax, and pre-process using the same 
strategy.
