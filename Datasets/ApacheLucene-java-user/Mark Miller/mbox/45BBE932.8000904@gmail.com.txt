Had not explored the link yet. That is the code I found and am using. It 
will not extract spans in all cases then? I tried some basic tests and 
it seemed to work great...I implemented a simple highlighter that does 
not deal with highlighting overlap. I assume now that a complicated 
query will not properly be extracted then? I guess I have some testing 
to do.
