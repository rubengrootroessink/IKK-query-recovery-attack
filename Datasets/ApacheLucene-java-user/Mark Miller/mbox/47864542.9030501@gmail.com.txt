I don't think you would see much of gain. Shoving the TokenStream into 
the MemoryIndex is actually pretty fast and I wouldn't be surprised if 
it was much faster than reading from disk. Most of the computational 
time is spent in reconstructing the TokenStream, whether you use 
term-vectors or re-analyze. Also, if the Query does not have any 
position sensitive clauses, no MemoryIndex is created, so no worries there.

The great speed challenge of the current method (other than needing a 
TokenStream created) is that it runs over each Token and stitches the 
document together a piece at a time. This doesn't scale well on huge 
docs. There are ways to cut this down and to just analyze the pertinent 
Tokens as is done by a different patch. However, you'd need to have 
TermVectors stored, and the concept doesn't fit with the current 
Highlighter framework, which already has some significant functionality 
and robustness.
