Michaels got some great points (he the lucene master), especially  
possibly turning off norms if you can, but for an index like that i'd  
reccomwnd solr. Solr sharding can be scaled to billions (min a billion  
or two anyway) with few limitations (of course there are a few). Plus  
it has further caching options, indexreader refresh managment, etc etc  
etc
