SUBJECT: index corruption with latest lucene
DATE: 5 May 2008

Last message had a type...I reversed line numbers fields...trying
again:﻿

Any recent changes that would expose index corruption?

I am getting two new errors when trying to search:

nullpointer ﻿fieldsreaders line 185

indexoutofbounds on ﻿fieldinfo line ﻿260

I am kind of screwed, because reindexing fixes this, but I cant reindex!

Any ideas?

P.S.

I cant go back to other lucene due to index version.
