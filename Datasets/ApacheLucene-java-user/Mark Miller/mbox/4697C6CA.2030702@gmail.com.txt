DATE: 13 Jul 2007

This is certainly the case. StandardAnalyzer has a regex matcher that 
looks for a possible company name involving an & or an @. The 
QueryParser is escaping the '&' -- all of the affects described are 
standard results of using the StandardAnalzyer. Any double '&&' will 
break text, but 'sdfdf&dfsdf' will match as a company name. Escaping 
will not affect the matches that StandardAnalyzer tries to make, it will 
just keep the QueryParser from matching the escapee as an operator.

'sdfdf&dfsdf&sdfd' will match to company name: sdfdf&dfsdf and then 
token: sdfd...the second '&' breaks, the first causes a company match. 
Check out the regex in StandardTokenizer.jj.

Also, to point out, there is no 'real' literal search in Lucene. 
Anything in quotes gets passed to the Analyzer, so you will get similar 
results whether you use quotes or not.
