Yes - please share your test programs and I can investigate (ApacheCon
this week, so I'm not sure when).

And its best to keep communications on the list - that allows others
with similar issues (now or in the future) to benefit from whatever goes
on. You will also reach a wider pool of people that can possibly help or
add valuable input.
