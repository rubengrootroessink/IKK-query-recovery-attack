I found this:
Also it throws nullpointer if you do a toString() prior to rewriting the 
query. Perhaps thats the way it is? Didn't check it out. Just reporting 
before I forget about it.

When is a query rewritten? I build my query and then before using it, I 
would like to print it out to double check it. Not possible? Does the 
rewrite happen inside search?
