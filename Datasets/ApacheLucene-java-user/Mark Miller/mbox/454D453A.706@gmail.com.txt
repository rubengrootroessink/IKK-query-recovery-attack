The JGuruMultiSearcher from LIA appears to me to be outdated. Am I wrong 
or has anyone who is willing to share updated the code? I would attempt 
it myself but I have not played with this stuff before and I would like 
something without bugs :_ A quick look at when the search(Query query, 
Filter filter, int nDocs) method seemed to disappear suggests that 
JGuru's multisearcher may have been written even before sorting was 
added, so I am hesitant to get involved with it.

Please let me know if there is an easy solution that I'm missing (or I 
am just plain wrong) or if you have updated the code and are willing to 
share. If not I suppose I am off to dig into the MultiSearcher...

- Mark
