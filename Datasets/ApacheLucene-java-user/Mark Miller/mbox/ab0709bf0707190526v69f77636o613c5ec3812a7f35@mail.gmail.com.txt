SUBJECT: Re: question about flush(), optimize(), and deleted documents
DATE: 19 Jul 2007

All deletes should be removed after an optimize. Otherwise, I think you'll
have to call isDeleted before trying to access the document. numDocs does
not include deletes, but the document() call will retrieve deletes. You
might try using maxDoc() instead of numDocs().
