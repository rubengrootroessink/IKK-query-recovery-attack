I have only taken passing glances at Solr, so I am afraid I cannot be of 
much help. Certainly one of the Solr guys will be able to be of 
assistance though.

Since Qsol generates Query objects, you just need to find out how to 
bypass sending solr a query String and instead give it a Query object. I 
assume this must be possible.

Back in the day you might have been able to call Query.toString() as the 
Query contract says that toString() should output valid QueryParser 
syntax. This does not work for many queries though (most notably Span 
Queries -- QueryParser knows nothing about Span queries).
