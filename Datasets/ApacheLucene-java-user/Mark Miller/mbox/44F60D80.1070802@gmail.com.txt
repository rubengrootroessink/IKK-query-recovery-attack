SUBJECT: SpanRegex speed
DATE: 30 Aug 2006

 * An implementation tying Java's built-in java.util.regex to RegexQuery.
 *
 * Note that because this implementation currently only returns null from
 * {@link #prefix} that queries using this implementation will enumerate and
 * attempt to {@link #match} each term for the specified field in the index.

Is this another way to say im gonna be friggen slow? Say it aint so...

I want to use this as a multi-phrase query...a spannear with a term that 
could be the regex "term1|term2"

I need this. Pipe dream for speed on a huge index?
