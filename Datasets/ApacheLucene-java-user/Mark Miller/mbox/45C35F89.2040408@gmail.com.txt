SUBJECT: Re: Multiword Highlighting
DATE: 2 Feb 2007

I have been away from this for a week, but my interest has started 
building again. The whole spans implementation seems to work great for 
finding the actual hits but there is a somewhat annoying limitation: 
because I am using Spans it seems I can only either highlight the entire 
found span or just the first and last token of the found span. First and 
last token works great for any span involving two query tokens (the only 
type I am concerned with at the moment), but a 3 word span would not 
have the middle word highlighted (unless you highlight the whole darn 
span). Other than that, the implementation is pretty darn simple and 
seems to work well. It wouldn't be too hard to set the option of 
complete span highlighting or first and last token.

Still interested in considering this for Contrib? Perhaps you want to 
wait for someone to merge the idea with the current Contrib highlighter 
(add fragments) as Mark H. suggested in his last email on the subject. 
Or there just may not be much interest -- the other recent highlighters 
haven't really gone anywhere that I have seen (though I don't think they 
attempted 'actual' hit highlighting).

If there is interest, suggested package name?

nice).  I've had people ask me for this before, and I know I could use this functionality,
too.  Please contrib to contrib/ if you end up working on this.
