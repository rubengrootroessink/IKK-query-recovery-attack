Generally, people just throw out the request to the list and no one 
really complains, but I do think its frowned upon. I'm sure someone else 
can give the 'official' stance (since we are not a job board/list I 
assume its against).

You might instead limit your email to those that have agreed to be 
contacted at http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/Support
