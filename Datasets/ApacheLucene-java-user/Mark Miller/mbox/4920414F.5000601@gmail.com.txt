Check out the docs at: 
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/contrib-instantiated/index.html

There is a performance graph there to check  out.

The code should be fairly straightforward - you can make an 
InstantiatedIndex thats empty, or seed it with an IndexReader. Then you 
can make an InstantiatedReader or Writer, which take the 
InstantiatedIndex as a constructor arg.

You should be able to just wrap that InstantiatedReader in a regular 
Searcher.
