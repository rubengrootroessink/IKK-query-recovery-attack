SUBJECT: Re: Test new query parser?
DATE: 25 Aug 2006

I have received a few inquires about my new query parser. I apologize 
for making that announcement a little premature. My current 
implementation only allows simple mixing of proximity queries with 
boolean queries...complex mixing would result in an incorrect search. A 
reply to my first email made me consider this more (I had done that part 
a while ago) and I came to the conclusion that it was obviously 
unacceptable to release the parser to anyone in this hobbled form. The 
parser must support arbitrary mixing of boolean and proximity searchers.

I think I have cracked this. I would say I am at 90%  of the way to a 
solution and can see the light at the end of the tunnel. When I have 
resolved this issue, I will contact those that have expressed interest 
and provide them with the parser. With some feedback and improvements I 
will think about how to release it generally.
