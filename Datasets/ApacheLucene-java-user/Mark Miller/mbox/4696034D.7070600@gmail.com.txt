Sorry I was not clear on this. I just meant that you will not have any 
trouble opening a Reader on an index with a lock file. You may have 
trouble deleting with that Reader <g>

When you are using a Reader as a "Writing Reader" i.e. deleting, then 
you pretty much have to consider it as a Writer. I find it very 
convenient to separate my Readers from my Writing Readers. In fact, now 
that Writers can delete (by buffering and using an in internal Reader), 
I only use Readers for read-only operations. Either way, it makes sense 
to draw a separation between Reading Readers and Writing Readers. If 
your going to delete with a Reader, you might as well just consider it a 
Writer as you will have to coordinate it as such. I prefer the Writer 
delete approach as you don't have to close and then reopen the writer.
