Right. The IndexReader takes a Directory, and the IndexSearcher takes an 
IndexReader - there are sugar constructors though - An IndexSearcher 
will also accept a String file path, which will be used to create a 
Directory which is used to create an IndexReader. It will also take a 
Directory, which will be used to create an IndexReader. It will also 
just accept the IndexReader.

So you have to find how that IndexReader is being created (or where) and 
change the code so that you get to create it, and when you do, do it 
read-only. It should be easier than that roundabout info sounds.
