Test it out though. In some recent testing I was doing it was *way* 
faster than I thought it would be based on what I had been reading. Of

like 10 mil docs and a few hundred thousand uniques, either I was doing 
something wrong, or even on my 4200rpm laptop hd, it loaded like nothing 
(of course even a second load and then a search is much slower than just 
a warmed search though). Was hoping to see some advantage with a payload 
implementation with LUCENE-831, but really didn't seem to...
