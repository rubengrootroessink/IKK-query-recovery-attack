That is a good point. I was just thinking that it would be a pain for 
searchers to have to include the quotes when searching, but I guess 
there is little way around it. The best you could do is have an option 
that specified a quoted search...and you might as well make that option 
be to put the word in quotes :) I don't claim to know much, just trying 
to help. On the other hand, stripping the quotes would save you two 
characters of space per quote in the index...ha...
