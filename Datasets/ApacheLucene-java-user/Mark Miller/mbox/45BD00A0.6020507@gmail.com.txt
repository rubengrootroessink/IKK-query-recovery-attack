StandardAnalyzer should not be indexing punctuation from my 
experience...instead something like old:fart would be indexed as old and 
fart. QueryParser will then generate a query of old within 1 of fart for 
the query old:fart. This is the case for all punctuation I have run 
into. Things like f.b.i are handled differently though. Its indexed as 
fbi...ie the dots are removed...thats part of the acronym handling. 
There are a couple other special handlers as well...but in general 
punctuation is ignored...except that QueryParser will look for the words 
broken by the punctuation next to each other.

 It seems to index words with colons ":" and other punctuation by default.  Is there a simple
way to have the Analyzer not to index colons specifically and punctuation in general?
