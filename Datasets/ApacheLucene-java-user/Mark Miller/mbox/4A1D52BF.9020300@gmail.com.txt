SUBJECT: Re: Apache Lucene Crawler search
DATE: 27 May 2009

Lucene is more like a search utility library than a full blown Search 
Engine like FAST. The Lucene sub project, Solr is more comparable to 
FAST, but Solr does not have a built in crawler available either (though 
its easy enough to do basic crawls).

There are many open source crawlers you could use to pass documents to 
Lucene though.

There is droids as Michael mentions below, and that goes well with Tika 
http://lucene.apache.org/tika/.

There is also Heritrix http://crawler.archive.org/, the Nutch crawler 
http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/,
and aperture http://aperture.sourceforge.net/.

There are also commercial options of course.
