Heh. I suppose I'll defer to your judgment. In my mind, the simple 
system to make is to just buffer the adds, buffer the deletes - later 
apply the adds, apply the deletes (or the reverse). I am sure something 
in Solr would have a more sophisticated process, but my guess was about 
what the new Lucene user would throw together. But again, I'll defer to 
your judgment anytime.
