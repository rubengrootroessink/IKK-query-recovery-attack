Ok. How about some better answers:

1. this(new FastCharStream(reader)) does not refer to the parent class 
but the LogTokenizer class itself. There should be a constructor on the 
LogTokenizer that takes a CharStream:

  public StandardTokenizer(CharStream stream) {
    token_source = new StandardTokenizerTokenManager(stream);
    token = new Token();
    jj_ntk = -1;
    jj_gen = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) jj_la1[i] = -1;
  }

If you're LogTokenizer does not have this then something did not go right.

2. The ParseException that is generated when making the StandardAnalyzer 
must be killed because there is another ParseException class (maybe in 
queryparser?) that must be used instead. The lucene build file excludes 
the StandardAnalyzer ParseException so that the other one is used. You 
could prob just delete it as well but then of course you would have to 
remember to delete it every time you rebuilt the javacc file.
