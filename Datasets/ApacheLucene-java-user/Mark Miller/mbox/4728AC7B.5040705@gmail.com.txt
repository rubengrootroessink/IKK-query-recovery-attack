You have no stack trace? Come man...you must be able to get a stack 
trace :) There is no way to tell what is causing that very generic 
error. I would say though: certainly not the size of your index.

I suppose, out of curiosity, how big is it? I'll bet my two broken 
wrists thats not the problem though.

Many, many, people have worked with large websites and Lucene before. 
And they are all doing a jig and singing a song as we speak <g>
