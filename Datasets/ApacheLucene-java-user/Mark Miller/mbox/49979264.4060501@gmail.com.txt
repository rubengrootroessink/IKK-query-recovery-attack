SUBJECT: Re: Fragment Highlighter Phrase?
DATE: 15 Feb 2009

Sorry, I wasn't specific enough. I meant the SpanScorer in the contrib 
highlighter package - they are very different.

I assume the latest Highlighter package has been ported to Lucene .NET, 
but if not I know of a guy that ported the SpanScorer stuff
to C# a while back. I might be able to get my hands on that still, 
though it may be dated now. First check the highlighter contrib
and see if its there though.
