SUBJECT: Re: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space when sorting the fields
DATE: 18 Mar 2008

To sort on 13mil docs will take like at least 400 mb for the field 
cache. Thats if you only sort on one field...it can grow fast if you 
allow multi field sorting.

How much RAM are you giving your app?
