And actually - even 2.9, which took so long, didn't have to. A .9
release could be very fast and only done as a stepping stone to the next
major release. The pain of how long everything took was just self
imposed. We could have moved to 3.0 years ago easily if someone has
suggested so. The truth is, all the deprecation complain stuff only
recently reached a boil - so noone suggested moving to the next major
version faster long enough ago. When they did, we jumped from 2.4 to
2.9. And the 2.9 was a huge release - but again, it didn't have to be.
It could have been a formality - Grant was arguing at one point that it
should have been.
