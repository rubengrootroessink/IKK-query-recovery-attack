SUBJECT: Neuter fields in query
DATE: 20 Feb 2007

I need to make a query specified with fields to be field care free when 
used against a memory index (every part of the query will match all 
fields). I am not holding my breath, but any ideas? Is the only way to 
deconstruct and reconstruct the query?
