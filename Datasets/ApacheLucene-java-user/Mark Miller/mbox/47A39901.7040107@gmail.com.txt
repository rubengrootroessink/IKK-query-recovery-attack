DATE: 1 Feb 2008

You are not seeing the doc because you need to close the IndexWriter first.

To have an interactive index you can:

A: roll your own.
B: use Solr.
C: use the original LuceneIndexAccessor 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-390
D: use my updated IndexAccessor 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1026

I have actually just added the ability to warm searchers before putting 
them into to use for option D, but i havn't gotten around to posting the 
new code yet.
