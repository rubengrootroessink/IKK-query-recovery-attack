Generally, stemming is not a method for index size reduction even though
that might be a side effect. It is very useful in search however...you would
generally want a search for skiing to also hit ski and skier (I can't spell
so don't get caught up on that). There are lots of those examples...if you
are doing general search, stemming is great, if not quite as great as
lemmatization. Look at the Snowball stemmers in contrib. The stemming king
wrote them I believe.


Language recognition can be a pain in the ass. Do some google searching and
check out this:
