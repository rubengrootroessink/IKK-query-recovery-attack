SUBJECT: Re: help finding docs, creating analyzer objects

You sound like a man that wants a manual. Lucene In Action is the way to 
go. It targets 1.4 instead of 2.0, so I'm sure you will still have 
complaints, but if you want to get up to speed on Lucene fast, LIA is 
the way to go. LIA will give you the overview and important classes, and 
then the documentation you have seen so far will suffice to catch you up 
on the 2.0 changes. Like Grant mentioned, if you want to learn on the 
cheap there are plenty of articles that give a quick tutorial on the 
main Lucene classes and how to use them as well. Lucene is surprising 
simple to use and I think that has contributed to the non manual-ish 
style of documentation.
