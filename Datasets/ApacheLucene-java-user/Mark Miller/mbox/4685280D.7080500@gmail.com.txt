If your getting java.io.FileNotFoundException: 
/mnt/nfstest/repository/lucene/lucene-icm-test-1-0/segments_h75 within 2 
minutes, this is very odd indeed. That would seem to imply your deletion 
policy is not working.

You might try just using one of the nodes as the writer. In Michaels 
comments, he always seems to mention the pattern of one writer many 
readers on nfs. In this case you could use no LockFactory and perhaps 
gain a little speed there.
