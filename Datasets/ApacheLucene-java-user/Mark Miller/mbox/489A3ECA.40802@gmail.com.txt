Do a little research to learn the rules and you will figure out how to 
make those classes cooperate. You might start by looking at LUCENE-1026, 
which is a simple set of classes that allows for what you want. You can 
use it, use it to make your own, or even look at its father issue - the 
original LuceneIndexAccessor. (I might actually have updated code to 
LUCENE-1026 lying around - ill put it up soon if I do)

That will get you there quick and simple. If you have big plans in the 
future though, you might be better off checking out solr or embedded solr.

when concurrent add/delete/search happens. Is there any general guidelines that you can share?
