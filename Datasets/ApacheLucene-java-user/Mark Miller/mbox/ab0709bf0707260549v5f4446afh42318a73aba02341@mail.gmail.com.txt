This may not be very elegant, but if you are really in a jam, here is what I
would try:

Check out a copy of Lucene. Modify the isDeleted method on both MultiReader
and SegmentReader so that it returns true if the docid passed in is the id
in question (if it is not the id, then just have the method do what it
would). This will keep Lucene from looking in the deleted bitvector and
causing an arrayoutbounds exception...instead it will just return that the
bad id has been removed. Then run a full optimize. When the new segments are
created, your bad doc should be ignored and not make it into the new
generation.

Kind of a pain, but if you really cannot reindex...
