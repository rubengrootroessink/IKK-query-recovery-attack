We would all, I think, like Lucene 2.9 to release soon.

Unfortunately, there are 56 open issues assigned to 2.9. They won't all 
likely make it.

We have got to start pruning down the list.

If you are not going to be able to get to / finish an issue in a very 
near time frame, could you help us all out and move the issue to 3.0?

Trying to finish any issues that are close would also be great 
obviously, but as a beginning, if we could just get a better handle (eg 
less issues to consider)
on what we have to finish off, that would be great.

I'm going to go though a bit and see if their are any obvious candidates 
to push off soon.

I suppose, if there is something that you really want to be sure is in 
2.9, and its not likely to be finished shortly, you should probably 
speak up too.
