Yes...I constantly index with 8 threads on one writer while searching 
with many more threads. Then I let it run for like an hour and watch. 
The index is tiny to start and then grows to a moderate size...nothing 
crazy.

I am also reopening a lot on a real index of 3.5 million +  docs 
though...and I see no leak evidence there either.
