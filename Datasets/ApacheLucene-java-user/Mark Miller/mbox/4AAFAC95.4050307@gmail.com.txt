SUBJECT: Re: lucene 2.9.0RC4 slower than 2.4.1?
DATE: 15 Sep 2009

A few quick notes -

Lucene 2.9 old api doesn't appear much worse than Lucene 2.4?

You save a lot with the new Intern impl, because thats not a hotspot
anymore. But then,
RandomAccessFile seeks end up being a lot more of the pie. They look
fairly similar in speed overall?

It looks like the major bottleneck with 2.9 new api is that its using
NIOFSDirectory (your on unix I guess, and it now
defaults to that on non Windows os's), and that appears to be a real
killer for you. Its taking half the time for its
reads.  ???

No conclusions yet, but I'm looking it over. Some other guys will come
in with some ideas as well.

Do confirm that those profiling results are on a single segment though.
