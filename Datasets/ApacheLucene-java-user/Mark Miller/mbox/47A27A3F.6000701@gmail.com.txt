Agreed. Apparently the Solr guys are working on this now. Certainly not 
trivial to do right. You might want to check out that work.

I want to start a project for this functionality myself soon - but just 
with Lucene. Personally, I think the only way to go is to use Jini, but 
I am waiting for the first release of Apache River before getting 
started (*very* soon I hope). That gets you through the 8 fallacies of 
distributed computing with almost no work right off the bat. Self 
discovery, leasing, redundancy, etc with minimal effort. Hopefully I 
will be able to recruit some help with this. From what I can tell, there 
is a lot of roll your own for this type of thing out there...it would be 
nice to focus some work on a system that can be used by all.
