SUBJECT: Re: Optimizing index takes too long
DATE: 12 Nov 2007

For a start, I would lower the merge factor quite a bit. A high merge 
factor is over rated :) You will build the index faster, but searches 
will be slower and an optimize takes much longer. Essentially, the time 
you save when indexing is paid when optimizing anyway. You might as well 
amortize the cost with a lower merge factor.

Grant seems to think the numbers are off anyway, so you may have more to 
do -- just a suggestion about the merge factor. How much RAM are you 
giving your application?

With a machine with 8 cores and 15,000rpm, days does seem a little 
ridiculous.
