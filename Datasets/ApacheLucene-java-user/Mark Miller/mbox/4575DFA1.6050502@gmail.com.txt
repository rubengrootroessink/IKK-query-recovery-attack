Just took a quick peak at the MultiPhraseQuery toString() and it does 
indeed wrap the query in quotes (it also puts in the parenthesis). You 
are generating a MultiPhraseQuery. Is that not your intent?. The 
QueryParser will generate a MultiPhraseQuery when more than one token 
with different positions are emmited from the analyzer and at least one 
of the positions has multiple tokens associated with it. I believe this 
should be a pretty common phenomenon with a synonym analyzer.

I would look into your Analyzer...my guess is that it has not been 
perfected. You are indexing and searching with the same analyzer, correct?
