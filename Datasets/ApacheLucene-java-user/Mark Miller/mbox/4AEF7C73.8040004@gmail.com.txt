SUBJECT: Re: ComplexPhraseQueryParser highlight problem
DATE: 3 Nov 2009

Looks like its because the query coming in is a ComplexPhraseQuery and
the Highlighter doesn't current know how to handle that type.

It would need to be rewritten first barring the special handling it
needs - but unfortunately, that will break multi-term query highlighting
unless you use boolean rewrite mode with them.
