DATE: 15 Jan 2007

Depends on your environment...I think you need an SVN client to 
efficiently check out many files...ever try tortoise SVN? I use eclipse 
and the subclipse plugin...working with the latest version of Lucene is 
as easy as adding the Lucene svn browse url and then checking Lucene out 
as a new project...this grabs core lucene and all the contribs...then I 
can just do an update to get the latest stuff...
