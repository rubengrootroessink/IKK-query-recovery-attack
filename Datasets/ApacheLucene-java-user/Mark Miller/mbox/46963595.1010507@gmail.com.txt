While it is possible to alter the StandardAnalyzer, depending on more 
details of your source text, it may be better to use a different 
analyzer or make your own. The StandardAnalyzer is quite slow if you do 
not need all of its features, and modifying it will make it harder to 
keep up with bug fixes or improvements.

That said, StandardAnalyzer does split on commas, so you might want to 
check into whats really going on.

I suspect that 'word1,word2,word3,word4,word5' is being recognized as a 
NUM by StandardAnalzyer. A NUM match will keep a comma deliminated list 
intact as long as every other word contains a digit.

You might alter the <#P regular expression in StandardAnalyzer.jj by 
taking out the ','. This will take out certain matches (like the match 
your getting <g>), but will stop screwing up your matches.
