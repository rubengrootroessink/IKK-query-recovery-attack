Ignore that last question. I see that you said prefix wildcard query and 
not wildcard query. A quick look at the code seems to show it grabbing a 
prefix as well.

Do you think one would be any faster than the other? Should I used 
Wildcardqueries outside of spanqueries and the regexquery inside 
spanqueries or use regex both places?
