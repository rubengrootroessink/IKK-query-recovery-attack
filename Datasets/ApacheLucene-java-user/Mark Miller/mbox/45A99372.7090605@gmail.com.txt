Sorry Kay, I jumped in midstream...I should have read your first post 
more thoroughly. By the way, many of the experts rarely comment much on 
the weekend so you will probably get some good answers come Monday (lots 
of replies often attract their attention <g>).

I do have one more whack though:

I don't have anything to help with the first computation...but how about 
using a stale cache of the filter until the new filter is populated? A 
similar idea to warming up a Searcher for field based sorting? This 
would cause a slight lag, but would hide the filter building time from 
the user (after the first is built of course).
