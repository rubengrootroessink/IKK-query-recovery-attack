Didn't you say you where using a phrasequery? If you are, things will 
not work as expected. You need to leave the quotes out of your search as 
a phrasequery will not match what you are putting in your index. If you 
are not using a phrasequery then things should work as you would expect. 
Can you provide any other info?
