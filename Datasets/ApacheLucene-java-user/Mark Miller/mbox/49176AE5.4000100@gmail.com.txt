DATE: 9 Nov 2008

Their is definitely some stale javadoc in Lucene here and there. All of 
what your talking about has been shaken up recently with the deprecation 
of Hits. Hits used to pretty much be considered the non-expert API, but 
its been tossed in favor of the TopDoc API's.

The HitCollector stuff has been marked expert because a lot of people 
get into trouble using something that hits every doc in the index on a 
search, not just the matching docs from the search. If you don't 
understand whats going on, you can, and many have, make some pretty slow 
code. The expert stuff just means, understand whats going on before you 
start to play here ;) I don't necessarily think it doesn't belong in a 
tutorial - assuming the guy who wrote the tutorial understood what he 
was doing.

As for the stale java-doc though, I'm sure patches would be welcome ;) 
Its a group of volunteers all scratching their own itches here, so its 
likely you will find things like that. Best bet is to pitch in when you 
see it, and I'm sure one of the commiters will apply your patch if its 
appropriate.
