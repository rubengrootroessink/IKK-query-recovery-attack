Both actually produce SpanQueries...I think that Surround makes this 
compromise as well. Because the Phrase search must be able to
be in a span search and it is desirable to have the same type of phrase 
search in a Span search or not, both must produce a SpanQuery.
I just worry that after saying ~ is a binary proximity operator that it 
is confusing to say
"old horse"~3 cow
is different then
"old horse" ~3 cow
is dfferent from
"old horse"~3 ~3 cow

I hope that this will not be much of a problem...the ':' will only be 
recognized if it follows two sets of quotes and a series of digits 
follows it..."the search":4
if it does not fit that pattern here is no need to escape it. Also, no 
need to escape ~ unless its surrounded by spaces.



I'm most curious to hear what you think of the nested boolean query 
issue...will my scores be screwed up? behave in a usable fashion? Any 
insight to offer?
