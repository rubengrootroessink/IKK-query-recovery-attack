Prefix query is a bit more efficient - not sure what it turns into
realworld, but prefix just checks if the term's start with the prefix -
wildcard has a bit more complicated check to do (there could be a
wildcard anywhere in the term that must be checked for). I'd be
surprised if it was a huge difference, but if there are a lot of terms
to check, it could.
