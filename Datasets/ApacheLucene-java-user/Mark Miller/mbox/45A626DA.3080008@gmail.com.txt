It becomes a three clause boolean query...would there be a difference in 
scoring? I assumed not and it used to make a boolean that contained 
another boolean...these days it checks to see if its in a chain of the 
same operator and makes only one boolean.

Just a boolean right now. I will have to look at DisjuntionMaxQuery. 
Currently its just a boolean: +field1:foo +field2:foo

':' is for slop on a phrase query. "the car is burning so get out":2 
will allow for each word to be within 2.
'~' is a binary operator...mark ~4 postman...or say: (mark ~5 (horse & 
car) ~6 tom brady | "hard knocks dude":3) ~6 garbage

Phrase slop could be specified with the '~' op too: the ~2 car ~2 is 
~burning ~2 so ~2 get ~2 out : but that is a pain in the butt.

Also, '~'  is needed for paragraph and sentence prox searches:  (old 
crooner) ~3p johnny
