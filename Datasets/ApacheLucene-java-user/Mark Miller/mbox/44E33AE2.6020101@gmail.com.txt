The reason has already been posted in response to my initial inquiry. 
This problem bugged me last month. I did not know the particulars but I 
assumed it was a bug.

I inquired on the mailing list and someone responded with the following 
link:

Highligter fails to include non-token at end of string to be highlighted
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-645

That seemed to resolve the issue for me. It's a bug and it has not been 
fixed and may be slightly complicated. Thanks to that guy who gave the 
link, I don't recall who it was.

Case closed on this one from my end.
