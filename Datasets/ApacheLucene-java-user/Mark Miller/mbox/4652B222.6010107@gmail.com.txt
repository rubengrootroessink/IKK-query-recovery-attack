Sorry, didn't mean to imply that that whole spiel was a technical 
explanation...just a "how I like to think of it" to get my head around 
the BooleanQuery system. If your reading that, think high level overview 
more than technically accurate. I'll be more specific in the future -- 
as always, the javadocs are the best place to get down to the nitty gritty.

HitCollector:
  /** Called once for every non-zero scoring document, with the document 
number
   * and its score.

TopDocCollector (used by Hits and returned by a Searcher) does ensure 
scores are greater than 0. If you roll your own HitCollector, you 
shouldn't need my thoughts on how I think of BooleanQuery's.
