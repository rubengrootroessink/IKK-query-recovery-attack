Really depends - StandardAnalyzer is probably a slower analyzer. But for 
example, with my quad core desktop machine, indexing with 3 or 4 
threads, I can do at least a couple hundred wikipedia docs per second 
(though I'm not using StandardAnalyzer). I'm indexing 10,000 docs in 
about a minute.

Does depend on your analzyers, and the size of the docs, but that looks 
pretty slow to me. Giving the JVM enough heap?
