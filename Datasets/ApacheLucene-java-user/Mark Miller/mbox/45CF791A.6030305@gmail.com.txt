SUBJECT: Re: about merge factor
DATE: 11 Feb 2007

Found a mistake in my reponse...when I was talking about max merge docs, 
I meant max buffered docs. If your going to optimize anyway, the key 
setting appears to be max buffered docs, and I have yet to see the merge 
factor affect anything (again, only if you optimize). Oddly, performance 
seems to decrease as you up max buffered docs far before you are even 
close to running out of available ram. I do not know why this is, but 
you should certainly test to see what your prime settings are.

Also, the knew benchmarking stuff is awesome.
