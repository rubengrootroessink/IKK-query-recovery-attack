Lucene's storing functionality is just a simple storage mechanism. You 
can certainly and easily use your own storage mechanism. When you get 
your user created id back from Lucene due to a hit, just pass that id to 
your storage system to get the original text and then feed that to the 
Highlighter. Your storage system/code might be slower than Lucene, but I 
don't believe there is anything about Lucene's system that would give it 
an inside advantage.
