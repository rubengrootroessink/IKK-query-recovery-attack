You can use that Query in front of a NOT query clause.

with a Query of (-$#!+ AND -@#$% AND etc).  The problem I have run into is that, as a pure
negative query is not supported (a query for (-term) DOES NOT return the inverse of a query
for (term)), I believe the bit set returned by a purely negative QueryFilter is empty, so
no matter how many results returned by the initial query, the result after filtering is always
zero documents.

simply amending the query string submitted by the user to include a pre-generated String that
would exclude the query terms, but I consider this a non-elegant solution.  I had also thought
about creating a new sub-class of QueryFilter, NegativeQueryFilter.  Basically, it would works
just like a QueryFilter, taking a positive query (so, I would pass it an OR'ed list of profane
words), then the resulting bits are simply flipped.  I think this would work, unless I'm missing
something.  I'm going to experiment with it, I'd appreciate anyone's thoughts on this.
