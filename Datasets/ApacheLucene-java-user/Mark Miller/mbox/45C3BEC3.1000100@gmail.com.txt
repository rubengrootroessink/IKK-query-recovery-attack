Nothing super intense, but I haved look at some semi complex nesting and 
it all looks great if you use the full span highlighting...highlighting 
the first and last word of the span only works great if your limited to 
word to word proximity searching (like in my parser <G> works great for 
my sentence and paragraph proximity searching, though i had to add the 
option of hiding my index marker tokens from the output)

Perhaps you know of something that I haven't run into that may not 
highlight correctly ?

I certainly will.
