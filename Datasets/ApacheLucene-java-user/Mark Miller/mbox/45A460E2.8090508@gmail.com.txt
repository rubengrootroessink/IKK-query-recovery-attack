SUBJECT: Technology Preview of new Lucene QueryParser
DATE: 10 Jan 2007

I have released a Technology preview of my Lucene query parser Qsol. 
This is the first official release. The purpose of this release is to 
gather feedback for a 1.0 release.
If you have an interest in using this parser please lend a hand in 
testing it out and making suggestions.

A recap of the parser's features:

These where my goals in building Qsol:

1.Proximity Operators in the search syntax

 

2.Paragraph/Sentence proximity searching

 

3.Query abbreviation tokens

 

4.SuggestedQuery support

 

5.Very customizable search syntax

 

6.Easily replaceable Date Parser

 

7.A cleaner syntax without precedence issues
