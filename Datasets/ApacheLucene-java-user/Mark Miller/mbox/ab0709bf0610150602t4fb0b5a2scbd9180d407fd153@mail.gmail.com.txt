SUBJECT: Re: QueryParser Is Badly Broken
DATE: 15 Oct 2006

In a way that certainly needs more testing (haven't had the time), but here
is the gist:

I modified the SpanNotQuery to allow a certain number of span crossings--
making it something of a WithinSpanQuery. So instead of just being able to
say find "something" and "something else" and don't let it span a paragraph
marker span, you can say find this and it can span up to to 3 paragraph
marker spans. I then made a special standard analyzer that uses a standard
sentence recognizer regex to inject sentence marker tokens. Paragraphs seem
less detectable, so right now the analyzer just looks for the paragraph
symbol...perhaps a double newline might be better though. I still have not
worked out the best para/sent token markers to put in the index or the best
way to mark paragraphs in the input text. I also would like to make it so
that a paragraph marker also works as a sentence marker so that they do not
need to be doubled up.
