Hmmm...get more ram :)

Windows 64-bit upped the default file system cache size from 1 gig to 1 
terabyte. Your feeling the awesome effects of that upgrade I think.

There is an API call ( SetSystemFilecache() ) to override this - so 
perhaps code up a C app to set it before running your Lucene app?
