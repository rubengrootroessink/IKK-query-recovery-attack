An EJB container will generally not give you better performance than a non
EJB container (other than it might be a more efficient...but that will not
be because it is an EJB container). The main difference is that you will be
able to use EJB's and the other Java EE goodies that a J2EE container
provides, like persistence and distributed transaction management. Unless
you are going to go with Glassfish (there may be one or two other obscure
ones) you will not be using EJB 3.0 and it is generally not recommended to
use < EJB 3.0--see Rod Johnson's J2EE without EJB as well as tons of other
books. You are better off going with tomcat and combination of Spring and
Hibernate or something. There is an RMI searcher in Lucene and you should be
able to easily use it with a servlet container. Apaches XML-RPC 3.0 java
extension also has a remote object proxy system and will allow you to pass
serial objects back from remote methods although it does not seem to support
dynamic remote loading of implementations. Jini might also be worth looking
into, although it seems that it is not possible to use Jini in tomcat
securley without modifing both Jini and Tomcat. Glassfish is supposedly
better suited to this.

In the end, a million documents is nothing to lucene if you have even
remotley decent hardware (probably even if you don't). Lucene will spit
around a million documents in her sleep. I'd develop in Tomcat (or similiar)
and check out solutions like Spring and Hibernate as you need J2EE (or JEE)
solutions.
