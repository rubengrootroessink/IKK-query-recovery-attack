Oh wouldn't we all. I want this too. Unfortunately, it's an elusive 
beast at best. As I am sure you know, JavaCC generates code based on the 
grammar and so it is very hard to alter the grammar after JavaCC'ing it. 
If you relax the 'add' part then you might be able to do something with 
QueryParserConstants.java. This holds an int for each string in the 
grammar which indexes into a String array...check it out and you will 
see what I mean. So replacing may be as easy as modifying the 'and' and 
'or' and whatnot in that String array. You might make a conditional 
build file that includes the correct QueryParserConstants.java or 
something. I have not explored this too deeply so if you find something 
better or this is a dead end, please let me know.
