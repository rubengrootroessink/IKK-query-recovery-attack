Not to get off topic, but I was curious Yonik, what does solr do if many 
updates come in at a time opening and closing a writer each 
update...does the first update kick off a warm operation, then before 
that warm is done the second updates kicks off a warm operation, and 
then before that warm is done a third update kicks off a warm 
operations... etc.

Is that what happens? Is that fine behavior? Does it wait to see if more 
updates are coming quickly so that it can batch them somehow?
