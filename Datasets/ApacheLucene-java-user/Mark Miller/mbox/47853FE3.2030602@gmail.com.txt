SUBJECT: Re: Highlighting + phrase queries
DATE: 9 Jan 2008

It works exactly the same as the standard contrib Highlighter except 
that it tries not to highlight spurious results for a positional query. 
This is exact with Span queries, but more approximate for phrase 
queries. The approximation is pretty darn good, but let me know if you 
find a case that doesn't work. The Highlighter attempts to mimic the 
PhraseQeury with a SpanQuery.
