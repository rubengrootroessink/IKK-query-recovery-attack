You need to make sure your storage does not lie in response to an fsync 
command. If it does (most commercial stuff does), you cannot guaranty no 
corruption. Search google for "your harddrive lies to you" or something.

It shouldnt be that hard to take the patch from the issue and apply it 
to a checked out version of 2.3 right? I don't think it relies on other 
2.4 stuff as there isnt much of it yet.
