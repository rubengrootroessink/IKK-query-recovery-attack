SUBJECT: Index Merging Space Requirements
DATE: 13 Mar 2008

If I use LogByteSizeMergePolicy#setMaxMergeMB, can I clamp down on the 
space needed for optimize/merge? My thought is, if a segment is maxed 
out, it will never need to be copied for a merge right? So you could 
significantly reduce merge/optimize space requirments (now at like 2x-4x 
if readers can still open)?
