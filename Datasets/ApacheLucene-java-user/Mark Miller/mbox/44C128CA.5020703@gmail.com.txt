> Provides a new api, IndexReader.document(int doc, String[] fields).  A document containing
only the specified fields is created.  The other fields of the document are not loaded, although
unfortunately uncompressed strings still have to be scanned because the length information
in the index is for UTF-8 encoded chars and not bytes.  This is useful for applications that
need quick access to a small subset of the fields.  It can be used in conjunction with or
for some uses instead of ParallelReader.

Does this mean that you must be compressing the fields to really take advantage of this? Or
does 'scanned' not infer a load.
