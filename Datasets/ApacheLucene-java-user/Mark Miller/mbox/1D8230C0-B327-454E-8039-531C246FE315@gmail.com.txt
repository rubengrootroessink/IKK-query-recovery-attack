DATE: 1 Oct 2009

Per segment over many segments is actually a bit faster for none sort  
cases and many sort cases -but an optimized index will still be  
fastest - the speed benifit of many segments comes when reopening - so  
say for realtime search - in that case you may want to sac the opt  
perf for a segment tail that is faster on update turnaround time. But  
for straight search speed - optimized is still the the way to go.
