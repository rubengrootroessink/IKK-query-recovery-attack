I do use the NullFragmenter now. I have no interest in the fragments at 
the moment, just in showing hits on the source document. It would be 
great if I could just show the real hits though. The span approach seems 
to work fine for me. I have even tested the highlighting using my 
sentence and paragraph proximity search queries from my query parser. 
These use a modified NotSpan (I call it WithinSpan) within an unbound 
NearSpan. I did a few queries that combine that structure with wildcard 
and boolean queries...everything appeared to work grand -- I got all the 
correct highlights. I just have to combine the highlights (spans) and 
refine my code (and that color comment Otis made is something I am 
interested in well -- it would be great to have the words found in a 
single spanquery be the same color, or a similar shade).
