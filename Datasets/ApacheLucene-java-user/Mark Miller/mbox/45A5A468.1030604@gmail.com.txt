Hey Hoss,

I didn't realize that I had left out the field stuff...I really am still 
working on a lot with the parser's documentation and I apologize.

Perhaps I am not being completely accurate with that statement, I'll let 
you be the judge.
It works like this: "A -B -C" would be expressed as "A ! B ! C"
By binary, I mean that each operator must connect two clauses...in that 
case A is connected to B and C is connected to A ! B.
I avoid the single prohibit clause issue, -query, by not really allowing 
it in the syntax. The operators are: AND, OR, ANDNOT, and PROXIMITY.
A ! B ! B = A ANDNOT B ANDNOT C

I will add this...a field search is: field1,field2(foo) | field3(foobar)

I have to update that documentation...field search was '[ ]' but is now 
'( )'.
Thanks for pointing this out to me.

This is a glaring omission eh? I have to plead laziness...I havn't 
needed it  yet in my work so it is not there...I will add it before a 
1.0 release but was hoping for some syntax suggestions -- though I'm 
betting people are happy with Lucene's syntax for this.
