SUBJECT: Re: bad index by batch indexing
DATE: 7 Aug 2008

Only one Writer should be active on an index at any given time. You  
don't want to batch unless you need to see the docs in the index as  
you build it. - it's slower overall. You can add from multiple threads  
at the same time, but use the same Writer.
