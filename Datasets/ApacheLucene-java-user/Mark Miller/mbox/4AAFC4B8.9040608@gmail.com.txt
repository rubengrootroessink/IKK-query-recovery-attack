Indeed - I just ran the FileReaderTest on a Linux tmpfs ramdisk - with
SeparateFile all 4 of my cores are immediately pinned and remain so.
With ChannelFile, all 4 cores hover 20-30%.

It would appear it may not be a good idea to use NIOFSDirectory on ramdisks.

Even still though - it looks like you have a further issue - your Lucene
2.9 old-api results don't use it, and are still not good.
