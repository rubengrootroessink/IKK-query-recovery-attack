Doing everything for this yourself for something simple is probably not 
that much work - but in the end your probably going to want _more_. I 
would recommend you set yourself up with solr and check  out 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-469.

If you decide to roll your own, you basically just want to use 
jdbc/object mapper to get the data to be indexed and index that data 
with the db key in Lucene - then you just juggle things around (reindex 
on db change, etc).

If your using java and hibernate, there is a Lucene/Indexing annotation 
package that helps with this type of thing as well.
