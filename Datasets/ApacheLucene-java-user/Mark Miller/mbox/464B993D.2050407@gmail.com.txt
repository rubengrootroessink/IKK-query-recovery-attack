There are quite a few ways to do this...you just read in the file to 
create a list of the words and when your query parser sees the right 
keyword either use a TokenFilter that expands to each word or just add 
each word to a BooleanQuery as a Should clause (or expand to a proper 
Lucene syntax string). This is basically just a thesaurus and you 
shouldn't find it too terribly difficult to implement.
