Okay, this is easy then. As long as you are using an analyzer that 
breaks up terms when it encounters a space, you just add all of the 
attributes as a single Field entry to the document (attribute field="big 
large black bulky"), with each attribute separated by a space. This will 
result in a hit on that document for every search query that searches 
the attribute field and that contains a term thats listed in the space 
separated attribute field.
