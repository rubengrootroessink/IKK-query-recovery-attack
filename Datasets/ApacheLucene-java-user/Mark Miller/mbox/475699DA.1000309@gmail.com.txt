Doh! Even after careful scanning I missed that. Of course your right 
though....scores with:
 
/** Computes the amount of a sloppy phrase match, based on an edit distance.
   * This value is summed for each sloppy phrase match in a document to form
   * the frequency that is passed to {@link #tf(float)}.
   *
   * <p>A phrase match with a small edit distance to a document passage more
   * closely matches the document, so implementations of this method usually
   * return larger values when the edit distance is small and smaller values
   * when it is large.
   *
   * @see PhraseQuery#setSlop(int)
   * @param distance the edit distance of this sloppy phrase match
   * @return the frequency increment for this match
   */
  public abstract float sloppyFreq(int distance);
