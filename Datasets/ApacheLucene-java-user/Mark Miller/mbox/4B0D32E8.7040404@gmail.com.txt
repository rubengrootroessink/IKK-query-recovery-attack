(and then in subsequent fixes by Mark) that we ultimately decided, due to the way Unordered
is implemented, that it was too difficult to put the payloads in order, so we more or less
punted and decided that perhaps it would be fine to deal w/ them in the aggregate anyway.
 Perhaps this needs to be revisited.

Right - we would have had to sort them - but not every case needed them
sorted, so it didn't make sense to always pay for that - so we decided
if a user needed it, they could encode the order in the payload and sort
themselves externally.
