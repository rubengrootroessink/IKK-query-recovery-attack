If you haven't heard, there is a Lucene/Solr meetup in New York next 
week: http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Apache-Lucene-Solr-Meetup/calendar/13325754/

The scheduled talks are (in addition to lightening talks):

Solr 1.5 and Beyond:

Yonik Seeley, author of Solr, co-founder, Lucid Imagination Topics will 
include new faceting functionality, new function queries, increased 
scalability, field collapsing, and spatial search. There will also be a 
discussion about the recently announced Lucene/Solr merge, the 
rationale, its implications, and plans for its completion. The talk will 
span features already included in trunk, features slated for the next 
release, as well as incomplete features under consideration for future 
releases.

Cool Linguistic Tricks to Apply to Search Results:

A source code level demonstration using LingPipe Breck Baldwin, Founder, 
LingPipe: The talk will cover post-processing options for Twitter 
searches. I will cover clustering and classification with some potential 
for conceptual indexing at the level of persons/orgs/locations. There 
will be a demo available for download that runs the examples and 
contains the source.
