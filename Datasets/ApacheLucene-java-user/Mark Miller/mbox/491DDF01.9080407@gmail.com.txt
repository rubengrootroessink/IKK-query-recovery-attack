DATE: 14 Nov 2008

Its hard to predict the future of LUCENE-831. I would bet that it will 
end up in Lucene at some point in one form or another, but its hard to 
say if that form will be whats in the available patches (I'm a contrib 
committer so I won't have any real say in that, so take that prediction 
with a grain of salt). It has strong ties to other issues and a 
committer hasn't really had their whack at it yet.

Having said that though, LUCENE-831 allows for two types for dealing 
with field values: either the old style int/string/long/etc arrays, or 
for a small speed hit and faster reopens, an ArrayObject type that is 
basically an Object that can provide access to one or two real or 
virtual arrays. So technically you could use an ArrayObject that had a 
sparse implementation behind it. Unfortunately, you would have to 
implement new CachKeys to do this. Trivial to do, but reveals our 
LUCENE-831 problem of exponential cachkey increases with every new 
little option/idea and the juggling of which to use. I havn't thought 
about it, but I'm hoping an API tweak can alleviate some of this.
