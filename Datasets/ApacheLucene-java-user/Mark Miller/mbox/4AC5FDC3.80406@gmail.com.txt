Actually, it may not be the TimeLimitedCollector thats keeping those
open. Since its a daemon thread, it shouldn't prevent shutdown even if
its not interrupted.

See that java.util.Timer way below? It's probably that. Know where it
comes from? By default they are not daemon threads, so its a likely
candidate ...
