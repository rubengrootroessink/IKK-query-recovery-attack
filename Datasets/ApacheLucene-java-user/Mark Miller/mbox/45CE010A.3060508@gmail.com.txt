SUBJECT: Re: Merge factor problem,
DATE: 10 Feb 2007

 From my experience: if you are going to optimize your index after 
loading (a good idea for making search as fast as possible) than it does 
not matter what you set the merge factor to during the load. If you have 
a healthy max buffered docs set, the merge factor will not affect the 
speed at all - 10, 50, 90, 120, it does not matter. Whether that is 
because a high max buffered causes all of the merges to occur in RAM or 
the optimize causes you to pay the dues you got from the altered merge 
factor, I do not know. I do know that max merged docs is generally the 
biggy for batch loading. Watch out though, setting max merged docs too 
high will cause you to miss the speed sweetspot.
