DATE: 22 Sep 2008

Agreed. I am always diving into that analyzer too fast <g> Possibly
premature optimization thoughts as well. But scanning the token after in
a filter and breaking/skipping if you find a number will be much easier
and possibly not too much slower. Depends on how involved you are/want
to get I suppose. Personally I would prefer to start a new analyzer for
such a significant change, but for the average Lucene user, pre/post
processing is always going to make more sense. Plus there is enough
overlap in the code that I can see plenty of people preferring not to
split off.
