This patch is likely to change quite a bit soon. A lot of what it was 
doing has been taken care of by a separate issue. Whats likely to remain 
is just the API change, but even that is likely to change (an iterator 
api was discussed). So thats a volatile patch at the moment.

The original intent of this patch was almost to do the opposite if I am 
understanding you right. In any case, I am not sure why you think this 
will help?

I wouldn't combine them. Wouldn't this give less granularity to your LRU 
cache anyway? That code is likely to change drastically, and I'm not 
sure what advantage you would see. Do you have an index so large that 
you can't supply the necessary RAM for the fieldcaches?

How is your custom cache implementation working? Since you are trying to 
tweak things, it sounds like you are still having issues? I am not sure 
how combining arrays would help you, but I don't understand what you are 
trying to solve yet.
