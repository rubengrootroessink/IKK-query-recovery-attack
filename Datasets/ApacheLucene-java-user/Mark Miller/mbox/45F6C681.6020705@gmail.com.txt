Depends on the work you want to do. If you want to highlight a simple 
XML doc the approach would be to extract all of the text elements and 
run them through the highlighter and then correctly update them. That 
would be mostly simple DOM manipulation. The same approach should work 
with any format but the difficulty in modifying the text may increase. 
If you can pull the text out appropriately it would seem you could put 
it back in though, or modify it in place as you might with the DOM.
