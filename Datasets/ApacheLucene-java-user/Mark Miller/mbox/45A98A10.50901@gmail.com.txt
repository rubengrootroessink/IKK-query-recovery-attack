First, have you looked at SwarmCache? Cluster aware caching for java...

Second...does it matter that you cannot share the same cache across 
multiple servers? How about a separate cache on each server? When a 
request hits a particular server for the first time it builds the filter 
and caches it. I do a lot of filter caching that way with EHcache.

There must be some way to cache that filter...
