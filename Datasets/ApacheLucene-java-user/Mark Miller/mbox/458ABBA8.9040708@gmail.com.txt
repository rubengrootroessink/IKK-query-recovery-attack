SUBJECT: Re: Merge Index Filling up Disk Space
DATE: 21 Dec 2006

When Lucene optimizes the Index (which it semi does naturally as the 
index grows) it creates a copy of the index, so you can expect the space 
requirements for an index to be double the index at an absolute minimum. 
If you are adding 20,000 docs a day and working with an index that is 
already 20 G than your just playing with fire sitting on a 50G 
partition. With the price of disk-space these days I would recommend 
throwing a lot more storage at your appserver. I would hate to keep 
dancing around as I gave it the few more Gig it needed to keep from 
crashing.
