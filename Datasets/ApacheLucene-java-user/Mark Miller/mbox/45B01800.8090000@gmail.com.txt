Dont return 1 for tf...just return the tf straight with no 
changes...return freq. For everything else return 1. After that 
OMIT_NORMS should work. If you want to try a custom reader:

public class FakeNormsIndexReader extends FilterIndexReader {
    byte[] ones = SegmentReader.createFakeNorms(maxDoc());

    public FakeNormsIndexReader(IndexReader in) {
        super(in);
    }
    public synchronized byte[] norms(String field) throws IOException {
          System.out.println("returning fake norms...");
        return ones;
    }

    public synchronized void norms(String field, byte[] result, int 
offset) {
          System.out.println("writing fake norms...");
        System.arraycopy(ones, 0, result, offset, maxDoc());
    }
}

The beauty of this reader is that you can flip between it and your 
custom similarity and Lucene's default implementations live on the same 
index.
