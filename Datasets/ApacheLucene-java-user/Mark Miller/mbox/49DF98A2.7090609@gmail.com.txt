Another point is that he may not have such a nasty set of segments - Raf 
says he has 24 indexes, which sounds like he may not have the 
logarithmic sizing you normally see. If you have somewhat normal term 
distribution for all 24 segments, the problem is not exasperated nearly 
as much (along with not being so bad as its not using all of the terms 
for the field).

24 segments is bound to be quite a bit slower than an optimized index 
for most things - also 24 segments of similar size may also be worse 
than the normal 24 segments with log dropping size.
