DATE: 26 Oct 2007

XimpleWare is proud to announce the the release of version 2.2 of VTD-XML, 
the next generation XML parsers/indexer/slicer/editor. This release 
significantly expands VTD-XML's ability to slice, split, edit and 
incrementally update the XML documents. To this end, we introduce the 
concept of namespace-compensated element fragment. This release also adds 
VTD+XML index writing capability to the VTD Navigator class. Other 
enhancements in this release include index size pre-computation, support for 
HTTP get, and some bug fixes.
