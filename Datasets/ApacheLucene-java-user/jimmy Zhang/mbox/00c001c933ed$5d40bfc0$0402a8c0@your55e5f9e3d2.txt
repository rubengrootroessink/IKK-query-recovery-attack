SUBJECT: [ANN] VTD-XML extended edition released
DATE: 22 Oct 2008

The Java version of extended VTD-XmL is released and available for download.
This version supports 256 GB max file sizes and memory mapped capabilities.
The updated documentation is also available for download. In short, you can
basically do full XPath query on documents that are bigger than memory space
available on your machine.

A special thanks to Duane May who provided value suggestions and inputs and
helped refine the VTD specs to make this happen.
