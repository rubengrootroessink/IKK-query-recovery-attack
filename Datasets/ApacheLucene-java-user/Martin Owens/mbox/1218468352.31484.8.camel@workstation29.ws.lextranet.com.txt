Very interesting, and it fills in a few missing bits.

Historically we've not been able to access the TermPositions object
because it seemed to require that the original text was stored and not
just indexed (although I can't see why) Perhaps I am mistaken?

We're not storing the text context because a) there is rather a lot of
it, b) we have the text files stored on special storage boxes mounted to
the webservers and they're using directly and c) It didn't seem worth
it.

Thoughts? So can I use the TermPositions object without the stored text?
