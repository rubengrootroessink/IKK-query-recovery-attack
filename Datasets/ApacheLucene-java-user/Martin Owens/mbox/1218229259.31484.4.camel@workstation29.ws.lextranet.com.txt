DATE: 8 Aug 2008

Dear Lucene Users and Tricia Williams,

The way we're operating our lucene index is one where we index all the
terms but not store the text. From your SOLR-380 patch example Tricia I
was able to get a very good idea of how to set things up. Historically I
have used TermPositionsVector instead of TermPositions because of that
data is available without storing the text in the index.

Is it possible to translate code which uses TermPositions to using
TermPositionsVector with regards to payloads?

Best Regards, Martin Owens
