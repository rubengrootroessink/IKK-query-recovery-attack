Thanks everyone in this group for helping me in integrating pdfbox with lucene.Now I am able
to integrate pdf box with lucene by writing small code in the IndexHTML.java file

that is
else if(path.endsWith( ".PDF" ))
     {
            System.out.println( "Indexing PDF document: " + file );
            doc = LucenePDFDocument.getDocument( file );
            writer.addDocument(doc);
     }
