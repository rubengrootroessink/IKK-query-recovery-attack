SUBJECT: modifying existing index
DATE: 23 Nov 2004

I am using lucene for indexing, when I am creating Index the docuemnts are added. but when
I want to modify the single existing document and reIndex again, it is taking as new document
and adding one more time, so that I am getting same document twice in the results.
To overcome this I am deleting existing Index and again recreating whole Index. but is it
possibe to index  the modified document again and overwrite existing document without deleting
and recreation. can I do this? If so how? 

and one more question.
can lucene will be able to do stemming?
If I am searching for "roam" then I know that it can give result for "foam" using fuzzy query.
But my requirement is if I search for "roam" can I get the similar worlist as output. so that
I can show the end user in the column  ---------------   do you mean "foam"?
How can I get similar word list in the given content?
