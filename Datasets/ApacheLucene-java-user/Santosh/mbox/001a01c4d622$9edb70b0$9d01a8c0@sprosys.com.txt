SUBJECT: Help for alternatives for search words
DATE: 29 Nov 2004

I am using lucene for searching. It is working fine but I have a problem with alternate words.If
I am searching for "fooddy" the lucene will give the result for "food" also .

how can I trace these alternate word "foam" in these documents. How lucene will support this
feature? how can I get alternate words list. I need three alternate words for each search
word. when each time a user enters roam I need to show "are you searching for ?" (food,foods,foody)
