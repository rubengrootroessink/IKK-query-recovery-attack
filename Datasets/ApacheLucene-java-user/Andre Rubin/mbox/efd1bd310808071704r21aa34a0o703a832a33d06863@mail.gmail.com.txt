SUBJECT: Searching Tokenized x Un_tokenized
DATE: 8 Aug 2008

Hi all,

When I switched a String field from tokenized to untokenized, some
searches started not returning some obvious values. Am I missing
something on querying untokenized fields? Another question is, do I
need an Analyzer if my search is on an Untokenized field, wouldn't the
search be based on the full String rather than its tokens?

Thanks,


Andre
