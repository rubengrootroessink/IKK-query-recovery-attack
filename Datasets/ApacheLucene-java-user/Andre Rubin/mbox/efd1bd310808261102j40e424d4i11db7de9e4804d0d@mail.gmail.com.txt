Thanks again Daniel,

It's working now. But for some reason, TermQuery is not working for me (i
think because I have special characters in the query). I replaced the
TermQuery with the query below and I got the results I was expecting.

Thanks!!!!

String escapedType = QueryParser.escape(type);
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(TYPE_FIELD, ANALYZER);
Query tq = parser.parse(TYPE_FIELD + ":" + escapedType);
