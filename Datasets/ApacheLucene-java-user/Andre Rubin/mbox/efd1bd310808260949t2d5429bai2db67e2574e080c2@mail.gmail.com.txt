Now I was the one who didn't follow: How do I add a query to an existing
query?

Let me be more clear on my use case:

I have two documents:
1)
label:One Two Three
type:sequence

2)
label:One Two FOUR
type:other


I want to be able to make the same kind of search as you described earlier
using PrefixQuery, but I want to filter the results using the other field.
Like:
label:One Tw*
type:sequence

And I only want to get document 1 as result.

At first glance, it seems that your answer may fit, but I'm not sure what
you meant by adding another query to an existing query.

Thanks again,


Andre
