That worked great! Thanks Daniel.

I just have one more use case. I want the same prefix search as before, plus
another match in another field.

I was using MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(), but then I have the same problem
with the "One Tw*" query, cause MultiFieldQueryParser.parse() returns a
BooleanQuery.

Thanks again,


Andre
