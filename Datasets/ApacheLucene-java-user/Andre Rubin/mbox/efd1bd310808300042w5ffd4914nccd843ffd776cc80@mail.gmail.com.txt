SUBJECT: Merging 2 indexes
DATE: 30 Aug 2008

Hey all

I have 2 indexes. Both have an ID field and one or more String fields... I
want to merge these indexes by merging the documents on each index that
match their IDs.

For exmaple:

Index 1:
Doc1:
id: 1234 (*)
text:bla bla
text:abcd


Index2:
DocA:
id:1234 (*)
text:xyz

(*) ID's match

So I wanna merge these documents in a new (or add it to an existing) index,
like this:


New Index:
Doc1:
id: 1234
text:bla bla
text:abcd
text:xyz

Is there a way to do that in an efficient way, like not having to manually
traverse each?

Thanks,


Andre
