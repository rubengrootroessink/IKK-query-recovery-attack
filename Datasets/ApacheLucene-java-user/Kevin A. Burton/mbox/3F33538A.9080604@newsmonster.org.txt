SUBJECT: Default sort order with identical scores.
DATE: 8 Aug 2003

I want to run a query where all the results would have the identical 
score of 1.0 (all documents of type X with a date > D)

The trick is that i need to get the result set BACK sorted by the date.  
The Lucene filter mechanism is optimized to use the index but the only 
problem is that I want to get the results back by date. 

It appears that Lucene will return the result set back by date but I 
assume that since the scores are identical it isn't doing a sort by 
score so I am getting my results back in descending order.  Would this 
be a correct assumption?  Is this behavior something I can depend on?

Thanks!

Kevin
