>     Having launched the much-awaited Version 1.0 of the Firefox
>     browser yesterday (see story), The Mozilla Foundation is busy
>     planning enhancements to the open-source product, including the
>     possibility of integrating it with a variety of desktop search
>     tools. The Mozilla Foundation also wants to place Firefox in PCs
>     through reseller deals with PC hardware vendors and continue to
>     sharpen the product's pop-up ad-blocking technology. 
>
> I'm not sure this is a good idea. Maybe it is though. The technology 
> just isn't there for cross platform search.
>
> I'd have to suggest using Lucene but using GCJ for a native compile 
> into XPCOM components but I'm not sure if GCJ is up to the job here. 
> If this approach is possible then I'd be very excited.
>
> One advantage to this approach is that an HTTP server wouldn't be 
> necessary since you're already within the brower.
>
> Good for everyone involved. No bloated Tomcat causing problem and 
> blazingly fast access within the browser. Also since TCP isn't 
> involved you could gracefully fail when the search service isn't 
> running; you could just start it.
