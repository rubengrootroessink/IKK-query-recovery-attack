SUBJECT: DbDirectory and Berkeley DB Java Edition...
DATE: 7 Feb 2005

I'm reading the Lucene in Action book right nowand on page 309 they talk 
about using the DbDirectory which berkeley DB for maintaining your index.

Anyone ever consider a port to Berkeley DB Java Edition?

The only downside would be the license (I think its GPL) but it could 
really free up the time it takes to optimize() I think.  You could just 
rehash the hashtable and then insert rows into the new table.

Would be interesting to benchmark I think though.

Thoughts?
