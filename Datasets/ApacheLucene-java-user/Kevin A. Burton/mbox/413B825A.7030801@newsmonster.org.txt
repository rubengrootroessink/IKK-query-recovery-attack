Hope no one considers this spam ;)

We're hiring either someone full-time who has strong experience with 
Java, Lucene, and Jakarta technologies or someone to act as a consultant 
working on Lucene for about a month optimizing our search infra.

This is for a startup located in downtown SF.

Send me an email including your resume (html or text only) and I'll 
respond with full details.

Kevin
