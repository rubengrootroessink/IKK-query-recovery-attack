SUBJECT: Possible to mix/match indexes with diff TermInfosWriter.INDEX_INTERVAL ??
DATE: 24 Feb 2005

I finally had some time to take Doug's advice and reburn our indexes 
with a larger TermInfosWriter.INDEX_INTERVAL value.

The default is 128 but I increased it to 256 and then burned our indexes 
again and was lucky enough to notice that our memory usage dropped in 1/2.

This introduced a bug however where when we try to load our pages before 
and after we're missing 99% of documents from our index.  What happens 
is that we have a term -> key mapping so that we can pull out documents 
based on essentially a primary key.  The key is just hte URL of the 
document.  With the default value it works fine but when I change it to 
256 it cant' find the majority of the documents.  In fact its only able 
to find one.

Is this setting incompatible with older indexes burned with the lower value?
