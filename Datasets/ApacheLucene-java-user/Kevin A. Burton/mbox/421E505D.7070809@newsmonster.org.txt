SUBJECT: 1.4.x TermInfosWriter.indexInterval not public static ?
DATE: 24 Feb 2005

Whats the desired pattern of using of TermInfosWriter.indexInterval ?

Do I have to compile my own version of Lucene to change this?   The last 
API was public static final but this is not public nor static. 

I'm wondering if we should just make this a value that can be set at 
runtime.  Considering the memory savings for larger installs this 
can/will be important.
