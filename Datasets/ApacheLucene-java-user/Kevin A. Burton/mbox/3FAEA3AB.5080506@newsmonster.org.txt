SUBJECT: Objection to using /tmp for lock files.
DATE: 9 Nov 2003

When I first read this changelog entry:

 > 2. Changed file locking to place lock files in
 >    System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), where all users are
 >    permitted to write files.  This way folks can open and correctly
 >    lock indexes which are read-only to them.

I just assumed that this was an optional feature.

I think this is a dangerous change and should be disabled by default (or 
only enabled with lock files can't be used due to read only media).

Regardless... it doesn't break our use of Lucene but it seems like a 
pretty drastic decision.

I think it's a good feature but I just feel it shouldn't be enabled by 
default.
