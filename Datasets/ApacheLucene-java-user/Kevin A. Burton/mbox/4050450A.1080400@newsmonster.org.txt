SUBJECT: int vs long and document ids on 64bit machines.
DATE: 11 Mar 2004

A discussion I had a while back had someone note (Doug?) that the 
decision to go with 32bit ints for document IDs was that on 32 bit 
machines that 64bits weren't threadsafe.

Does anyone know how JDK 1.4.2 works on Itanium, Opteron (AMD64)? 

How hard would it be to build a lucene64 that used 64bit document 
handles (longs) for 64bit procesors?!  Is it just a recompile?  Will the 
file format break and need updating?!

Also ... what are the symptoms of a Lucene build using 64bit ints on 
32bit processors.  Right now we're personally stuck on 32bit machines 
but I would like to see us migrate to 64 bit boxes over the next 6 
months...

Anyway... thinking out loud.

Kevin
