You know... it looks like the problem is that TermInfosReader uses 
INDEX_INTERVAL during seeks and is probably just jumping RIGHT past the 
offsets that I need.

If this is going to be a practical way of reducing Lucene memory 
footprint for HUGE indexes then its going to need a way to change this 
value based on the current index thats being opened.

Is there anyway to determine the INDEX_INTERVAL from the file?    It 
looks according to:

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/fileformats.html

That the .tis file (which according to the docs the .tii file "is very 
similar to the .tis file" ) should have this data:

So according to this:

TermInfoFile (.tis)--> TIVersion, TermCount, IndexInterval, 
SkipInterval, TermInfos

The only problem is that the .tii and .tis files I have on disk don't 
have a constant preamble and doesnt' look like there's an index interval 
here...
