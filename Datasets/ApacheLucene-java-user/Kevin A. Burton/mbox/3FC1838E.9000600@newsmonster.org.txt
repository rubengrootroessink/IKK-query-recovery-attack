On machines with multiple users /tmp files this could potentially be 
used to DOS a machine.  It isn't a HUGE issue but is one regardless.

My major issue was to change behavior. I'm sure a lot of existing code 
depends on the current locking mechanism.

Since this is only for a RARE occasion (read only indexes) my suggestion 
is to keep the indexes where they were and have people enable this when 
they want readonly indexes.
