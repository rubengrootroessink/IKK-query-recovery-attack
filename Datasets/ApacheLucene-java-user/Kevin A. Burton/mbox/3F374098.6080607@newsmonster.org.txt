SUBJECT: 2,147,483,647 max documents?
DATE: 11 Aug 2003

Why was an int chosen to represent document handles?  Is there a reason 
for this?  Why wasn't a long chosen to represent document handles?  64 
bits seems like the obvious choice here except for a potentially bloated 
datastore.... (32 extra bits)

I guess one possible solution is to use multiple indexes.  This way you 
could run the search on each index and build a 64bit handle with the 
first 32bits being the index handle and the second 32bits being the 
local handle.
