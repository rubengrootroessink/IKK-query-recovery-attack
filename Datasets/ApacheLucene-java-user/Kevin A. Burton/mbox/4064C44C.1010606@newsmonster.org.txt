Just an FYI... I've noticed a fatal bug that was introduced in 1.3rc2 -> 
final.  I've had to use 1.3rc2 in our application.  The problem is that 
during an index merge Lucene will get stuck in an infinte loop and never 
terminate.

I haven't had much time to debug it but I just reverted back and we were 
fine.

I'll yield to whatever decision you guys make as I don't have a patch or 
a better diagnosis of the problem.

Thanks!
