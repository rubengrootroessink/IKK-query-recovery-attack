SUBJECT: disable locks on read only indexes (performance improvement?)
DATE: 1 Dec 2003

Would there be any performance improvement in query throughput and 
latency if locking were disabled for readonly indexes?

It doesnt' seem like it makes sense to worry about locking if you know 
for SURE that the index will NEVER be updated again. 

I'm noticing this problem now.  We are running a live indexer which does 
a commit every N documents (right now 100,000) and then swaps the new 
index into the system live.  This index is never again updated and we 
use a multisearcher.  We then do index merges after a while into new 
indexes to keep performance high and reduce the number of indexes.

I would assume that removing this lock could increase performance 
especially to allow multiple concurrent searches on the same data.
