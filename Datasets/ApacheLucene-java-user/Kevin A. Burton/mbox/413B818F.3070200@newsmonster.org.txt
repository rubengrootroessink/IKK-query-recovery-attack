My problem is that I have two machines... one for searching, one for 
indexing.

The searcher has an existing index.

The indexer found an UPDATED document and then adds it to a new index 
and pushes that new index over to the searcher.

The searcher then reloads and when someone performs a search BOTH 
documents could show up (including the stale document).

I can't do a delete() on the searcher because the indexer doesn't have 
the entire index as the searcher.

Therefore I wanted to group by the same document ID but this doesn't 
seem possible.  This should suppress the stale document and prefer the 
newer doc.
