Bring up one machine as a master Index.  All index updates should be 
performed here.  You can then take machines out of service, rsync the 
index, then bring them back online.

Also the IndexSearcher can work with multiple indexes and you can just 
keep syncing mulitple indexes over instead of updating one monolothic 
index.  In this situation you wouldn't need to take machines offline but 
you would have to swap in the new index once the rsync is complete.  A 
simple dir rename could make this atomic.
