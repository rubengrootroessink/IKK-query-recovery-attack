This should probably be a wiki page.

Anyway... two thoughts I had on the subject a while back:

You maintain two disk (not RAID ... you get reliability through software).

Searches are load balanced between disks for performance reasons.  If 
one fails you just stop using it.

When you want to do an index merge you read from disk0 and write to 
disk1.  Then you take disk0 out of search rotation and add disk1 and 
copy the contents of disk1 to disk two.  Users shouldn't notice much of 
a performance issue during the merge because it will be VERY fast and 
it's just reads from disk0.
