Great... Damn... looked at the source of CachingWrapperFilter and it 
makes sense.  Thanks for the pointer.  The results were pretty amazing.  
Here are the results before and after. Times are in millis:

Before caching the Field:

Searching for Jakarta:
2238
1910
1899
1901
1904
1906

After caching the field:
2253
10
6
8
6
6

That's a HUGE difference :)

I'm very happy :)
