SUBJECT: Does a RAMDirectory ever need to merge segments...  (performance issue)
DATE: 20 Apr 2004

I've been benchmarking our indexer to find out if I can squeeze any more 
performance out of it.

I noticed one problem with RAMDirectory... I'm storing documents in 
memory and then writing them to disk every once in a while. ...

IndexWriter.maybeMergeSegments is taking up 5% of total runtime. 
DocumentWriter.addDocument is taking up another 17% of total runtime.

Notice that this doesn't == 100% becuase there are other tasks taking up 
CPU before and after Lucene is called.

Anyway... I don't see why RAMDirectory is trying to merge segments.  Is 
there anyway to prevent this?  I could just store them in a big 
ArrayList until I'm ready to write them to a disk index but I'm not sure 
how efficient this will be.

Anyone run into this before?
