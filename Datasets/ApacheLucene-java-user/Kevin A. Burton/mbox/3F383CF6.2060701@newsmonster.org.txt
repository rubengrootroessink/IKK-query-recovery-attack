SUBJECT: Providing my own scoring.
DATE: 12 Aug 2003

I don't see this documented anywhere and before I start ripping apart 
Lucene I wanted to find out if anyone has done this before.

I want to provide my own scoring of Lucene results based on my own score 
algorithm.  It isn't JUST based on word frequency but also a lot of 
other metrics (think PageRank).

The problem is that i think I am going to have to do this with my own 
subqueries or integrating directly into IndexSearcher while doing my own 
scoring.  Hits.doc() is expensive to say the least (I am assuming it 
fetches all fields?) and it doesn't seem that there is a straight 
forward way to add a visitor that will be called to develop my own 
custom score.

Anyone have any advice here?

Kevin
