I'll do some more testing tonight and get back to you

Or you can do what I do and recompile ;)

Right now we are merging to the same disk...  I'll perform some real 
benchmarks with this var too.  Long term we're going to migrate to using 
to SCSI disks per machine and then doing parallel queries across them 
with optimized indexes.

Also with modern disk controllers and filesystems I'm not sure how much 
difference this should make.  Both Reiser and XFS do a lot of internal 
buffering as does our disk controller.  I guess I'll find out...
