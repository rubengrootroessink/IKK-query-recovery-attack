SUBJECT: FSDirectory should have getFile() (patch)
DATE: 9 Mar 2004

Another patch... when using FSDirectory it makes sense to be able to get 
the file it was created with.  It's a private member anyway... I just 
added a getter.

This way you don't have to move around two lists or maintain maps...
