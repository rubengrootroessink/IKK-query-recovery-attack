How about this as a compromise...

No copy on constructor... use a Set but in the documentation summarize 
this conversation and point out that the user should use a HashSet and 
NOT any other type of set and that it will result in a copy..

I think Doug's comment about a potentially faster impl in the future was 
a good point...
