SUBJECT: Field.java -> STORED, NOT_STORED, etc...
DATE: 11 Jul 2004

I've been working with the Field class doing index conversions between 
an old index format to my new external content store proposal (thus the 
email about the 14M convert).

Anyway... I find the whole Field.Keyword, Field.Text thing confusing.  
The main problem is that the constructor to Field just takes booleans 
and if you forget the ordering of the booleans its very confusing.

new Field( "name", "value", true, false, true );

So looking at that you have NO idea what its doing without fetching javadoc.

So I added a few constants to my class:

new Field( "name", "value", NOT_STORED, INDEXED, NOT_TOKENIZED );

which IMO is a lot easier to maintain.

Why not add these constants to Field.java:

    public static final boolean STORED = true;
    public static final boolean NOT_STORED = false;

    public static final boolean INDEXED = true;
    public static final boolean NOT_INDEXED = false;

    public static final boolean TOKENIZED = true;
    public static final boolean NOT_TOKENIZED = false;

Of course you still have to remember the order but this becomes a lot 
easier to maintain.
