SUBJECT: Preventing duplicate document insertion during optimize
DATE: 30 Apr 2004

Let's say you have two indexes each with the same document literal.  All 
the fields hash the same and the document is a binary duplicate of a 
different document in the second index.

What happens when you do a merge to create a 3rd index from the first 
two?  I assume you now have two documents that are identical in one 
index.  Is there any way to prevent this?

It would be nice to figure out if there's a way to flag a field as a 
primary key so that if it has already added it to just skip.
