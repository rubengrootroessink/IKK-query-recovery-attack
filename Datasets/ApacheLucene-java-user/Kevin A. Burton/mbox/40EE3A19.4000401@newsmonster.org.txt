SUBJECT: Increasing Linux kernel open file limits.

Don't know if anyone knew this:

So while root you can allocate as many file handles without any limits 
enforced by glibc you still have to fight against the kernel

Just doing a echo 1000000 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max works fine.

Then I can keep track of my file limit by doing a

cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr

At least this works on 2.6.x...

Think this is going to save me a lot of headache!
