SUBJECT: Lucene shouldn't use java.io.tmpdir
DATE: 8 Jul 2004

As per 1.3 (or was it 1.4) Lucene migrated to using java.iot.tmpdir to 
store the locks for the index.

While under most situations this is save a lot of application servers 
change java.io.tmpdir at runtime.

Tomcat is a good example.  Within Tomcat this property is set to 
TOMCAT_HOME/temp..

Under this situation if I were to create two IndexWriters within two VMs 
and try to write to the same index  the index would get corrupted if one 
Lucene instance was within Tomcat and the other was within a standard VM.

I think we should consider either:

1. Using out own tmpdir property based on the given OS.
2. Go back to the old mechanism of storing the locks within the index 
basedir (if it's not readonly).

Thoughts?
