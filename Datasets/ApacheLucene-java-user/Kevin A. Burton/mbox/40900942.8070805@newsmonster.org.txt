Actually this is exactly the problem... I ran some single index tests 
and a single process seems to read from it.

The problem is that we were running under Tomcat with diff webapps for 
testing and didn't run into this problem before.  We had an 11G index 
that just took a while to open and during this open Lucene was creating 
a lock. 

I wasn't sure that Tomcat was multithreading this so maybe it is and 
it's just taking longer to open the lock in some situations.
