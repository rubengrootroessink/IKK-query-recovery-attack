SUBJECT: Why doesn't Document use a HashSet instead of a LinkedList (DocumentFieldList)
DATE: 5 Sep 2004

It looks like Document.java uses its own implementation of a LinkedList..

Why not use a HashMap to enable O(1) lookup... right now field lookup is 
O(N) which is certainly no fun.

Was this benchmarked?  Perhaps theres the assumption that since 
documents often have few fields the object overhead and hashcode 
overhead would have been less this way.
