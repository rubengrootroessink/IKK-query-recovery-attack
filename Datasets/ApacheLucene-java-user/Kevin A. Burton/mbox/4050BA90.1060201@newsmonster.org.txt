Yes... agreed.

Weill ... the refactor should at LEAST be pretty easy... just start 
changing int->long and follow up until the code compiles.  Not sure if 
it's that easy.

At some point I might take a look at the code and see how hard it would 
be... Thanks for you notes... I'll probably use these in the future.

The main problem that with indexes that have lots of SMALL documents you 
could see yourself running out of ints.
