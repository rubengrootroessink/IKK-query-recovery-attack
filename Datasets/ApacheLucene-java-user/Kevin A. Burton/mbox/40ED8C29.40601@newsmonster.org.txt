SUBJECT: Way to repair an index broking during 1/2 optimize?
DATE: 8 Jul 2004

So.. the other day I sent an email about building an index with 14M 
documents.

That went well but the optimize() was taking FOREVER.  It took 7 hours 
to generate the whole index and when complete as of 10AM it was still 
optimizing (6 hours later) and I needed the box back.

So is it possible to fix this index now?  Can I just delete the most 
recent segment that was created?  I can find this by ls -alt

Also... what can I do to speed up this optimize?  Ideally it wouldn't 
take 6 hours.

Kevin
