I'm worried about duplicate or missing content from the original index. 
I'd rather rebuild the index and waste another 6 hours (I've probably 
blown 100 hours of CPU time on this already) and have a correct index :)

During an optimize I assume Lucene starts writing to a new segment and 
leaves all others in place until everything is done and THEN deletes them?

The only settings I uses are:

targetIndex.mergeFactor=10;
targetIndex.minMergeDocs=1000;

the resulting index has 230k files in it :-/

I assume this is contributing to all the disk seeks.

This is what I did for this last round but then I ended up with the 
highly fragmented index.

hm...

Thanks for all the help btw!
