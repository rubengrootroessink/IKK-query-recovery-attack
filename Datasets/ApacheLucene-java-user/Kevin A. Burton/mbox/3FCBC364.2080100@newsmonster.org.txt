Looking at the source of FSDirectory it seem easy enough to add a 
property to disable indexes. 

This way if you wanted to search a directory and you new it was 100% 
necessary to search it readonly you could go ahead and do it without 
having to write lock files. 

I will write some unit tests to see what the performance is here.  It 
should be trivial to create an index of a few hundred megs and then run 
about 200k queries across it with 30 threads or so... then disable locks 
and see what the total time spent was...

If it's substantial I think it makes sense to make this contribution :)
