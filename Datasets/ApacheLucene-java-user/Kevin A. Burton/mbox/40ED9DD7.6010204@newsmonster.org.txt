Most people won't do this or won't even understand WHY they need to do 
this :-/.

Yes... I realize that you shouldn't use more than one IndexWriter. That 
was the point. The locks are to prevent this from happening. If one were 
to accidentally do this the locks would be in different directories and 
our IndexWriter would corrupt the index.

This is why I think it makes more sense to use our own java.io.tmpdir to 
be on the safe side.
