SUBJECT: Large InputStream.BUFFER_SIZE causes OutOfMemoryError.. FYI
DATE: 13 Apr 2004

Not sure if this is a bug or expected behavior. 

I took Doug's suggestion and migrated to a large BUFFER_SIZE of 1024^2 
.  He mentioned that I might be able to squeeze 5-10% out of index 
merges this way.

I'm not sure if this is expected behavior but this requires a LOT of 
memory.  Without this setting the VM only grows to about 200M ... As 
soon as I enable this my VM will go up to 1.5G and run out of memory 
(which is the max heap).

Our indexes aren't THAT big so I'm not sure if something's wrong here or 
if this is expected behavior.

If this is expected I'm not sure this is valuable.  There are other uses 
for that memory... perhaps just doing the whole merge in memory...

Kevin
