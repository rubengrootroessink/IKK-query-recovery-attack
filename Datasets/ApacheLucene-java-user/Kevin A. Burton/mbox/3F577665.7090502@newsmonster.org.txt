It's just two source files + Lucene plus I didn't do all the work to 
make it into an OSS package.  99% of OSS work isn't technical but 
political, maintenance, etc..

If someone wants to start an OSS project for this and do all the grunt 
work I will do the coding :)  I don't know what parser I wnat to use to 
tokenize the source but a Doclet would be perfect for this....  The only 
problem is that this wouldn't allow full differential builds and would 
slow down the generation....

Also it just dawned on me that the Emacs compile-internal function 
parses stdout in the form of file:line# so this would make a great way 
to integrate for us Emacs geeks.
