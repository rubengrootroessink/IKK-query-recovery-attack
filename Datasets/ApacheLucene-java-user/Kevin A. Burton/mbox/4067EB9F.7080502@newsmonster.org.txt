SUBJECT: Is RangeQuery more efficient than DateFilter?
DATE: 29 Mar 2004

I have a 7G index.  A query for a random term comes back fast (300ms) 
when I'm not using a DateFilter but when I add the DateFilter it takes 
2.6 seconds.  Way too long.  I assume this is because the filter API 
does a post process so it has to read fields off disk.

Is it possible to do to this with a RangeQuery.  For example you could 
create a "days since January 1, 1970" fields and do a range query from 
between 5 and 10... and then add the original field as well.

I have to make some app changes so I figured I would ask here before 
moving forward.

Kevin
