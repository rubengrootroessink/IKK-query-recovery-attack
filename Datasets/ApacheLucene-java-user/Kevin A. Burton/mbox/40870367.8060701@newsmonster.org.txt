Yes... actually I was thinking of increasing these vars on the 
RAMDirectory in the hope to avoid this CPU overhead..

Also I think the var you want is minMergeDocs not mergeFactor.  the only 
problem is that the source to maybeMergeSegments says:

So I guess to prevent this we would have to set minMergeDocs to 
maxMergeDocs+1 ... which makes not sense.  Also by default maxMergeDocs 
is Integer.MAX_VALUE so that will have to be changed.

Anyway... I'm still playing with this myself. It might be easier to just 
use an ArrayList of N documents if you know for sure how big your RAM 
dir will grow to.
