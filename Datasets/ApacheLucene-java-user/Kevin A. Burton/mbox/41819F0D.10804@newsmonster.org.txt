SUBJECT: Ability to apply document age with the score?
DATE: 29 Oct 2004

Lets say I have an index with two documents.  They both have the same 
score but one was added 6 months ago and the other was added 2 minutes ago.

I want the score adjusted based on the age so that older documents have 
a lower score.

I don't want to sort by document age (date) because if one document is 
older but has a HIGHER score it would be better to have it rise above 
newer documents that have a lower score.

Is this possible?  The only way I could think of doing it would be to 
have a DateFilter and then apply a dampening after the query.
