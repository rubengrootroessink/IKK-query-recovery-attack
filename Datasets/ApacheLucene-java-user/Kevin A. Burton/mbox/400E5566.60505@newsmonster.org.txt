SUBJECT: Vector -> LinkedList for performance reasons...
DATE: 21 Jan 2004

I'm looking at a lot of the code in Lucene... I assume Vector is used 
for legacy reasons.  In an upcoming version I think it might make sense 
to migrate to using a LinkedList... since Vector has to do an array copy 
when it's exhausted.

It's also synchronized which kind of sucks...

I'm seeing this being used in a lot of tight loops so things might be 
sped up a bit by using Collections ...

Kevin
