Also... MySQL full text search isn't perfect. If you're not a java 
programmer it would be difficult to hack on. Another downside is that FT 
in MySQL only works with MyISAM tables which aren't transaction aware 
and use global tables locks (not fun).

I'm sure though that MySQL would do a better job at online index 
maintenance than Lucene. It falls down a bit in this area...
