After thinking about it I guess 1.5% of memory per index really isn't 
THAT bad.  What would be nice if there was a way to do this from disk 
and then use the a buffer (either via the filesystem or in-vm memory) to 
access these variables.

This would be similar to the way the MySQL index cache works...
