This problem can be solved by using multiple indexes...  One problem is 
that a result set can only return 2^32 documents though but this is 
totally acceptable for me.

I wonder what the JVM implementation is like for Itanium... Can this 
allocate transactional 64bit longs?

If to it might make sense to distribute a lucene-long.jar with all the 
document handles being longs instead of ints.  If I'm correct it is just 
a recompile...
