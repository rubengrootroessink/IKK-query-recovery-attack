SUBJECT: Most efficient way to index 14M documents (out of memory/file handles)
DATE: 7 Jul 2004

I'm trying to burn an index of 14M documents.

I have two problems.

1.  I have to run optimize() every 50k documents or I run out of file 
handles.  this takes TIME and of course is linear to the size of the 
index so it just gets slower by the time I complete.  It starts to crawl 
at about 3M documents.

2.  I eventually will run out of memory in this configuration.

I KNOW this has been covered before but for the life of me I can't find 
it in the archives, the FAQ or the wiki. 

I'm using an IndexWriter with a mergeFactor of 5k and then optimizing 
every 50k documents.

Does it make sense to just create a new IndexWriter for every 50k docs 
and then do one big optimize() at the end?

Kevin
