Actually... Erik.. I don't think your Hashtable constructor will work...

By default Hashtable.keySet returns a SynchronizedSet. (on JDK 1.4.2). 
so were're back to where we started:

You need do make it a HashSet:

   table = new HashSet( stopTable.keySet() );

Also... while you're at it... the private variable name is 'table' which 
this HashSet certainly is *not* ;)

Probably makes sense to just call this variable 'hashset' and then force 
the type to be HashSet since it's necessary for this to be a HashSet to 
maintain any decent performance.  You'll need to update your second 
constructor to require a HashSet too.. would be very bad to let callers 
use another set impl... TreeSet and SortedSet would still be too slow...

Anyway... I had this feature in my patch ;)

Thanks!

Kevin
