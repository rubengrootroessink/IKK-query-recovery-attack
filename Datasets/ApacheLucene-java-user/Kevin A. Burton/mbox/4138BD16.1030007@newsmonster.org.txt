SUBJECT: Patch for IndexWriter.close which prevents NPE...
DATE: 3 Sep 2004

I just attached a patch which:

1. prevents multiple close() of an IndexWriter

2. prevents an NPE if the writeLock was null.

We have been noticing this from time to time and I haven't been able to 
come up with a hard test case.  This is just a bit of defensive 
programming to prevent it from happening in the first place.  It would 
happen from time to time without any reliable cause.

Anyway...

Thanks...

Kevin
