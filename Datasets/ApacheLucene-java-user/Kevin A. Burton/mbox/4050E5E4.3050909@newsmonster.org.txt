An interface isn't just the concept of a Java interface but ALSO the 
implied and required semantics.

TreeSet, etc are too slow to be used with the StopFitler thus we should 
prevent their use. 

We require HashSet/Map...

HashSet is not always the most efficient... if you need to do runtime 
inserts and bulk removal TreeSet/Map might be more efficient.  Also if 
you need to sort the map then you're stuck with a tree.
