Hi folks,

I would like to know if people are interested in the OpenRelevance project (http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/OpenRelevance).


I've done quite a few experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk using TREC and INEX data sets,
so one approach would be to use crowdsourcing for such task.

Regards,

Omar
