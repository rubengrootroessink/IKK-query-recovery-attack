Hi all,

Apologies for being slightly off-topic, we are looking at novel visualization approaches for
rendering results from Lucene queries. I was wondering if you have any recommendations for
visualization toolkits (Java) for displaying heat-maps, dendrograms, cluster maps etc. (preferably
free/OSS)

Thanks in advance!
Shashi
