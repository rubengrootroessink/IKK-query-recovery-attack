Yes, thanks, initially we won't do this until we understand more  
about the profile of usage, and how the IndexSearchers are being aged  
out of the cache.  We have a mirror index server kept in sync, and  
plan to put Apache in front of them (as long as we can prove the 2  
parts of the mirror stay in sync, initially we'll just set apache to  
favor 1 server, with manual failover until we're completely sure).   
We have plans to be implemented eventually that include an Index  
partitioning such that not all projects sit on each server, and they  
broadcast what project contain to clients.
