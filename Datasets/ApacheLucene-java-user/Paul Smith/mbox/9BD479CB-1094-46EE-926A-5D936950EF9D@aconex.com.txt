Neither in our case, a central broker (albeit we plan to have a  
backup plan with ActiveMQ installed on all servers with the same  
config ready to roll, using zeroconf for discovery).

Ideally, reality is different.  We're going to be monitoring  
consistency of the pair closely, and should the fall out of sync with  
regularity, then one of them is just going to be the hot-spare for  
failure purposes only.

In this case we will manually mark the node via Apache worker configs  
to be be disabled until it has caught up.
