If you look at the man page for 'ps' you'll see a switch that shows  
all the threads too (it's different on different unix flavours, so  
best to do look in the man page).

Once you've shown the threads in 'ps' you'll see that the process  
that is appearing in top, and I'll bet it's parent is your original  
java process.

I wouldn't panic, each thread is almost certainly sharing the same  
memory pool, so while top reports that the thread has X Mb of memory,  
it's really the same physical block as all the others.

You see this all the time in a Tomcat app server box, where each Http  
Connector is a thread, and appears as it's own process.

cheers,

Paul Smith
