SUBJECT: RAID Stripe sizes - suggestions?
DATE: 22 Feb 2009

I'm just wondering if anyone can share with us their learnings on  
optimizing their storage configurations for relatively large indexes  
(millions of documents, 10+Gb in size).  Is there a 'suggested best'  
Stripe size for RAID-10 configurations?

I did some Googling, and surprised I couldn't find much out there.  
Anyone able to share their benchmarks/experience ?

cheers,

Paul
