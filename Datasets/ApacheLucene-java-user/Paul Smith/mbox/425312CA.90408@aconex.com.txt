This is where using something like JMS to store persistent messages of 
items for indexing in a JMS queue is useful. 

We are about to go down this road using ActiveMQ 
(http://activemq.codehaus.org, very nice product, Apache licensed), that 
way notifications of change are never lost, and you can disconnect the 
indexer from the application itself (it could be a seperate process or 
in-process, it just needs to be able to read the JMS queue).  With 
ActiveMQ you can even embed the JMS server instance inside the VM of 
your application too, which is very useful for a single instance, and 
can be easily broken out to be used in a clustered environment.

cheers,
