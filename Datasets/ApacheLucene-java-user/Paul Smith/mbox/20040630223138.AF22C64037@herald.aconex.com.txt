SUBJECT: RE: Running OutOfMemory while optimizing and searching
DATE: 30 Jun 2004

Wow, I have say that those sort of numbers are concerning to me... Now I
know 3.5 million documents is a lot, but still... What would be causing a
query to require and hold that much memory?  I could understand that it
surely would be doing a lot of memory work, but why would it need to hold
onto/grab that much memory for the length of the query?  (this is getting
into the internals a bit, but it's always good to know what's going on under
the hood from a design decision point of view and how I would have to
structure an App to handle this sort of load).
Cheers,
Paul Smith
