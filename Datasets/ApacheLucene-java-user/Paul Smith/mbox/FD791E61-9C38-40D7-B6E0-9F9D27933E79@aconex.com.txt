I'm working on just such a thing over on my Apache Lab project called  
"Pinpoint":

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/labs/pinpoint/trunk/

It is designed to process log4j environments, soaking from network- 
based appenders, of by importing log files based on a pattern.  It's  
relatively early days but the pinpoint-service layer recently ran  
through a production load test environment soaking 500-1000 events  
per/second no problems at all.

The pinpoint-search layer provides an API to query a  
'context' (usually a days worth of logs) to find matching events, and  
then to be able to view the temporal context of specific matching  
events so you can see them inline with their related logs (either by  
the Thread that created the original matching event, +/-10 minutes,  
or by showing all logging events around that time +/- 10 minutes).

Really good for production triage.  I'm trying to work on a Web-based  
app that allows a dynamic sort-of-OLAP analysis of log files (charts,  
trends, etc).

cheers,

Paul
