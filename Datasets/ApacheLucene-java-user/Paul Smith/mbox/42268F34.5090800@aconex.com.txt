SUBJECT: Use of In-like query and performance implications
DATE: 3 Mar 2005

If I had a query of the form (assuming this gets converted to Lucene-speak)

Org=X or Folder In(g,h,i,j,.....) or Public=true

Having a field for Org, and Public is easy, but the Folder field In-like 
clause (which would be converted into OR's) could potentially have quite 
a few in the clause.

my question is, is there any performance concerns here if 
("...In(g,h,i,j,....) ") starts getting longer and longer?  Can Lucene 
handle this in an optimal manner, without a serious scalability issue ? 
(memory/cpu/io etc).  Or would it be better that a different design is 
used gor this?
