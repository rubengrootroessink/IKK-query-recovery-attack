The rate of updates is actually quite low in our environment, so we  
are lucky, however we will be monitoring consistency closely.  Each  
node exposes statistics about the last item indexed etc so we can  
tell when things are out of sync.  Should a node consistently be out  
of sync we'll just remove it as a worker from Apache for searching  
purposes (still leaving it ready to be used as a hot spare).

We are fortunate that the volume of updates is relatively small (as  
fast as a human can upload things), so we are in a fortunate position  
in our case. Our guarantees are in the order of minutes rather than  
seconds.
