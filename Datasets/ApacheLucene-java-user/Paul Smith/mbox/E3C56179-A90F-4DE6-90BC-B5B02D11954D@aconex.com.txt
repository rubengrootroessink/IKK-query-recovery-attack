I'm not so sure I agree with that.  If you have, say, 4 threads  
concurrently starting a search on a cold index, they will _all_  
effectively do a warm of the searcher, chewing up CPU and disk, which  
may be better utilised by other threads.  Wouldn't it be better for 1  
thread to do the warming while the others block waiting?

The option to warm-up the index before making it available to  
concurrent searches is effectively the same thing as this.  I would  
have thought it would be nicer to have it part of the search  
mechanism rather than rely on coders to constantly build that warm- 
ing thread into their application.
