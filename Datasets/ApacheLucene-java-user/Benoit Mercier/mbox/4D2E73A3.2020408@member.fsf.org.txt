SUBJECT: "or" as a search term
DATE: 13 Jan 2011

Hi,

I am happily using Lucene for several years to offer French lexical 
analysis tools to university researchers.   Today, one of them decided 
to analyze the use of the French word "or" (meaning "gold" in French) in 
one of my corpus powered by Lucene...  And, as you probably already 
guessed, no results...

I tried not using the default QueryParser implementation and building 
programmatically a simple BooleanQuery with the "or" term (surrounded or 
not by double quotes) : no results.  I also played a lot with Luke to be 
sure that my code is not responsible for this behavior.  By the way, my 
corpus contains a lot of "or" occurrences and everything else is working 
perfectly well for many years.

I first thought that modifying the QueryParser JavaCC lexical grammar 
would help (desactivating the OR operator and just keep || ), but the 
problem seems wider since even without using the QueryParser I am unable 
to find the word "or" in my indexes...

Do you have any clue?

Thank you very much in advance!

Best regards,

Benoit (mercibe)
