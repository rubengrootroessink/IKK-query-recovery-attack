SUBJECT: Anyone used Zilverline?
DATE: 18 May 2006

Dear all,

I am a PhD student working on a text-mining project and I have a 
literature collection in a Postgres database. I now need to make this 
rapidly searchable for users through a web-interface so I have been 
looking at Lucene.

I have been looking at the Zilverline search tool 
(http://www.zilverline.org/zilverlineweb/space/home) which seems quite 
nice, particularly that you can use PDF, HTML or text collections. Does 
anyone have experience of this system or could someone recommend an 
alternative for fast database searching? If it would be better I could 
store the collection as  text files rather than in a database.

Thanks for your help, any hints appreciated!
