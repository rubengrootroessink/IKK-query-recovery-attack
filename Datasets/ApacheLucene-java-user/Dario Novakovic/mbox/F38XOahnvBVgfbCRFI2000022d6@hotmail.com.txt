SUBJECT: searching with wild cards ignoers analyzer?
DATE: 4 Jun 2002

i index/search with anlyzer which converts all characters to lowercase. it 
works corectly until i use "*", then i must use query strings with exact 
capitalization. why is that, am i doing something wrong?

thanks for any answer

dario
