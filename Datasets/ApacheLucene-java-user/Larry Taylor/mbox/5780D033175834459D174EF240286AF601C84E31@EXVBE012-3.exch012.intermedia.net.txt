SUBJECT: Searching by bit masks
DATE: 9 Nov 2006

Hello, 

I am currently evaluating Lucene to see if it would be appropriate to
replace my company's current search software. So far everything has been
looking great, however there is one requirement that I am not too
certain about. 

What we need to do is to be able to store a bit mask specifying various
filter flags for a document in the index and then search this field by
specifying another bit mask with desired filters, returning documents
that have any of the specified flags set. In other words, we are doing a
bitwise OR on the stored filter bit mask and the specified filter bit
mask and if it is non-zero, we want to return the document. 

Before I started toying around with various options myself, I wanted to
see if any of you good folks in the Lucene community had some
suggestions for an efficient way to implement this. 

We currently need to index ~8,000,000 documents. We have several filter
flag fields, the most important of which currently has 7 possible flags
with any combination of the flags being valid. The number of flags is
expected to increase rather rapidly in the near future. 

My preemptive thanks for your suggestions,
