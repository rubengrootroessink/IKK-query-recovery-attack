SUBJECT: How to use Lucene for getting tags for tagcloud?
DATE: 6 Sep 2010

Hello

I'm a Lucene newbie and I have it working where I can create an index from a column of a database
table storing
tags, and search this index for a particular tag and display the results and their scores.
I'm looking at this as an
alternative to a MySQL fulltext index which I've heard mixed comments about.

But, what I want is to get from the most popular tags in the index along with their counts
and then use this data to
create a tagcloud.

Does anyone know if and how Lucene can be queried to get the most popular tags in an index
and their counts at all?

Thanks

Mr Morgan.
