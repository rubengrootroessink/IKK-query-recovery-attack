SUBJECT: Re: multiple small indexes or one big index?
DATE: 2 Jun 2011

No worries, I'll keep that in mind now.
In addition I am going to switch to another collector as well. ATM I 
collect the results and then sort them using the std. Collections.sort 
approach... I have to look what Lucene offers and switch to something else.

Thanks,
Alex
