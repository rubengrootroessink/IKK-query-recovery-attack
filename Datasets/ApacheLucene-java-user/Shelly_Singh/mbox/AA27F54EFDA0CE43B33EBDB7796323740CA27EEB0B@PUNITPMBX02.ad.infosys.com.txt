DATE: 27 Aug 2010

Hi,

I have a lucene index of 100 million documents. But the document size is very small - 5 fields
with 1 or 2 terms each. Only 1 field is analyzed and others are just simply indexed. The index
is optimized to 2 segments and the total index size is 7GB.

I open a searcher with a termsInfoDivisor value as '10'. I have warmed my searcher by executing
10 random termQueries (on the field that is analyzed). After this, when I do a search on the
same field, I get a response time of over 2 seconds. 
I am executing with a RAM of 1.5G. Is it possible to bring the search time down to few milliseconds
in this configuration.

Any tips would help.


Thanks and Regards,
