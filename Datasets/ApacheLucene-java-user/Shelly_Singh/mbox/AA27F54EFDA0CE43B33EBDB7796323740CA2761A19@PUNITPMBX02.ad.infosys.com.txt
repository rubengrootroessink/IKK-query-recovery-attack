DATE: 25 Aug 2010

I have 1 bln documents to sort. So, that would mean ( 8 bln bytes == 8GB RAM) bytes. 
All I have is 8 GB on my machine, so I do not think approach would work.

Any other options?

You haven't yet told us how many documents you're talking about here, so
it's
hard to have a good idea of what solutions are. That said, I'd just try
sorting first.
The sorting cache size will be something like (sizeof(int or long)) *
(number of documents).
Measure (remember to measure the response after query warmups, the first
few will be slower because they fill up the cache) THEN fix iff there's a
problem.

And just forget the idea of inserting your documents in the correct order
<G>. You
stated that the documents come in in random order. Document IDs are assigned
internally to Lucene, and monotonically increasing. I sure don't see how you
can
reconcile those two things...

But again, just try it with sorting on the numeric field and only fix things
if you have a
problem. Lots of work has been put into making Lucene fast, by very bright
people. See
if they've already solved your problem for you...

Best
Erick.
