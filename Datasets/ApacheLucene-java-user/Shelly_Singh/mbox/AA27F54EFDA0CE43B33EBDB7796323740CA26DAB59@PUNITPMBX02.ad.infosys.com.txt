SUBJECT: TermQuery and ConstantScoreQuery on TermsFilter
DATE: 18 Aug 2010

Hi,

In my index lucene index, I want to search on a field, but the score or order of returned
documents is not important. What is important is which documents are returned.

As, I do not need score or even default sorting(order  by docid), what is the best way to
write a query.

I compared performance of two options - TermQuery and ConstantScoreQuery on TermsFilter. I
was expecting smaller search time with ConstantScoreQuery with TermsFilter, but it has turned
out otherwise.
Please help me understand this behavior.

Thanks and Regards,
