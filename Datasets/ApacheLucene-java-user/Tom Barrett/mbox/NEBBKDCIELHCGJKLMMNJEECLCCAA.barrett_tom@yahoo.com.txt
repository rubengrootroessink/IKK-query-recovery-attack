SUBJECT: prefix query with multiple words
DATE: 3 Dec 2001

Hey all-

Wondering if it's possible to a prefix query, but with multiple words;
basically trying to get

+artist:"eric clap*"

to return documents with artists "eric clap", "eric clapton", "eric
claptonean", etc.

You can get close by parsing into multiple words first and prefixing the
last word (i.e. "Eric Clap" -> +artist:eric +artist:clap*), but this also
gives you results that have the phrase in the wrong order (i.e. returns
results with artist "clap eric")

Is there any way to do this right?

Thanks,

Tom
