SUBJECT: io exception on recreating an index
DATE: 16 Nov 2001


Hello all-

I'm currently having a problem overwriting an old index. Every night, the
contents of a database I'm using get updated, so the lucene indexes are also
recreated every night. The technique I'm currently using is just to start a
new index on top of the old one (IndexWriter writer = new
IndexWriter(filePath, new StandardAnalyzer(), true) ) but sproatically I get
an IO exception: couldn't delete _2oil.fdt or something to that effect.

I'm pretty sure nothing is using the index (but then again I am querying it
using a COM+ wrapper, so who really knows what's going on behind the
scenes)...anyone have any ideas how to avoid this? Worst case senario I
would at least like the old index to still be usable (the one from the night
before). Is there a way to transactionally update an index or something to
that effect?

Thanks for the help,

Tom
