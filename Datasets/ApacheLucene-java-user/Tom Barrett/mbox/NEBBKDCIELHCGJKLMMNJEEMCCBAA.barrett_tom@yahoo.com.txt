SUBJECT: ordering of results (alphabetical?)
DATE: 19 Oct 2001


I am wondering if it is possible to change the ordering of results from
search. Specifically, we need to sort results alphabetically by a given
field, rather then by term frequency. I assume there is a way to do this
with HitCollector, but given the warning about performance in the javadoc
I'm not sure of the best way to approach this. Any help would be
appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom
