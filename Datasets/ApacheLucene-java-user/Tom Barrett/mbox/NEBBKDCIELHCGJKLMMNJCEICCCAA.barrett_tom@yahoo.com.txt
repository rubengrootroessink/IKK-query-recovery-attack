SUBJECT: Strange NullPointerException error
DATE: 1 Feb 2002

Hi all-

Ran into a problem when searching a Lucene index using the latest version of
the code. I tried to do a phrase query (something like +field:"day tripp")
and got a NullPointerException. This construct works fine when there is
something matching in the index, but seems to blow up when there is not.
Attached is a small test case...let me know if I'm doing something wrong
here...

Thanks,

Tom
