SUBJECT: Use Lucene for "Frequent Itemset" computation
DATE: 18 Jun 2006

Just curious, has anyone tried to use Lucene  to do "frequent itemset" computation for auto-clustering.
For a given pair of items/words we can use lucene and do a conjunctive search from those items.
Only if we can figure out a way to minimize the number of possible itemsets. 

Thanks,
Prasen
