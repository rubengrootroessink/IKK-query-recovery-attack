SUBJECT: Introduction to flexible indexing?
DATE: 14 Jun 2010

Hi,

I've heard about flexible indexing in the talk Simon Willnauer and Uwe 
Schindler at BerlinBuzzwords.de last week.
Now I'd like to get into this flexible indexing thing, but don't find any 
documentation about it. Reading all three issues (1458, 2111, 2354) with all 
comments would take a long time and it wouldn't be clear, which information 
stated there is still current.

Could sb. with more insights please create a Wiki page on flexible indexing 
and copy all text from the three issues that are still current over to this 
wiki page? 
I'd then read and try to understand this page and help to get it in shape.

Best regards,

Thomas Koch, http://www.koch.ro
