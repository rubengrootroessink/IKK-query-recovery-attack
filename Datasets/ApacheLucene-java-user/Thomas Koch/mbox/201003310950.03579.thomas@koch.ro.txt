SUBJECT: [ANN] Eclipse GIT plugin beta version released
DATE: 31 Mar 2010

GIT is one of the most popular distributed version control system. 
In the hope, that more Java developers may want to explore the world of easy 
branching, merging and patch management, I'd like to inform you, that a beta 
version of the upcoming Eclipse GIT plugin is available:

Maybe, one day, some apache / hadoop projects will use GIT... :-)

(Yes, I know git.apache.org.)

Best regards,
