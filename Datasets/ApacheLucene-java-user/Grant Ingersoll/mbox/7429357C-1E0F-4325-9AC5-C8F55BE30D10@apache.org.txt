I think it makes sense to store these as payloads.  You might even  
look at the 2.9-dev trunk version for the new AttributeSource  
capabilities that allow you to, essentially, strongly type payloads  
and provide custom serialization capabilities.

As for the "experimental" phase of payloads, I'd say they are here to  
stay, it's just that the exact methods may change.

How do you plan to search using the info?  Note, that the new  
AttributeSource stuff is not yet searchable, whereas the Payload stuff  
is.  Performance, I would think, should be roughly equivalent to using  
Spans, but don't quote me on it.

HTH,
Grant
