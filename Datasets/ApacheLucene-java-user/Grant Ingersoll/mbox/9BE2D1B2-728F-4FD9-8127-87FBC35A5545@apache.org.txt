If you like term vectors, using the latest Trunk version of Lucene  
and are willing to be a guinea pig.  :-)  See https:// 
issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-975

Of course, you can always reanalyze the document as well and keep  
track of the positions as you go.  Maybe take a look at how contrib/ 
highlighter does things.

Or maybe I am misunderstanding things...
