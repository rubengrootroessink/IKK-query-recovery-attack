SUBJECT: Re: boosting different parts of the same field

If you are up for _BLEEDING EDGE_ stuff, have a look at the Payload  
addition to the trunk.  With this, you can set payloads on individual  
terms (i.e. the title tokens) and then use the BoostingTermQuery when  
searching to factor in the payload in the scoring. This is very much  
"buyer beware" at this point as it is not even officially released  
yet.  While it isn't overly complicated to use or anything, I just  
wouldn't recommend it for production yet.
