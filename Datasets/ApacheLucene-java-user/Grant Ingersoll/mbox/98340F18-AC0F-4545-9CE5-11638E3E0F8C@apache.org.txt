I can understand your hesitation, but good documentation of what you  
are doing and lots of comments should help :-)

I guess the question becomes what is the nature of your fields?  Do  
you have some really large fields that you want to avoid loading b/c  
they are not shown initially?  That is the main use case, I guess.

Have you actually done some profiling to see that you are hitting a  
bottleneck?

I wouldn't recommend it, but if it was really important to you, you  
could modify FieldsReader to be more intelligent about your fields,  
but again this would be fragile, too.
