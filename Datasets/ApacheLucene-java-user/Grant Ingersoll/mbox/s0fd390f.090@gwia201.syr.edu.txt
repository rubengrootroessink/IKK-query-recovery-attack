Hi,

Was wondering if anyone uses java.text.BreakIterator#getWordInstance(Locale) as a tokenizer
for various languages?  Does it do a good job?  It seems like it does, at least for languages
where words are separated by spaces or punctuation, but I have only done simple tests.

Anyone have any thoughts on this?  What am I missing?  Does this seem like a valid approach?

Thanks,
Grant
