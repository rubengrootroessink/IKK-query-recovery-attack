SUBJECT: Re: Creating document fields by providing termvector directly (bypassing the analyzing/tokenizing stage)
DATE: 2 Nov 2005

Not sure if this is feasible, but is there someway you could use a 
"fake" analyzer that you constructed using your hashtable/termvector and 
then have it output the tokens directly from the hashtable via the 
TokenStream?  Maybe you would have to pass in an empty/dummy string to 
the field constructor.   At least you wouldn't have to create the string 
of your term vectors

Just a thought,
Grant
