We don't publish SNAPSHOTs to the central Maven repo as they are not  
official releases.  You have to add the ASF snapshot repo to your POM  
(see the Maven docs for how to do this).  Also note, because these  
snapshots are _not_ official releases, they are subject to change,  
including removal.  That being said, we don't often remove them or  
change them.

The URL for the snapshots repo is http://people.apache.org//maven-snapshot-repository/org/apache/lucene

.  I'm not sure where you got that other URL from or who maintains that.

Hope this helps,
Grant
