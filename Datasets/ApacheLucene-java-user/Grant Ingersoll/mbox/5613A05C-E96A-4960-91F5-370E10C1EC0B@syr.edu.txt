Hi Amit,

This is definitely something you can do.   What are your goals for  
it?  Do you want to search by word and POS or do you just want POS  
available for post processing?

You could just append the POS tag onto the end of your token as it  
gets indexed, something like foo_NN or foo_ADJ.  This approach may  
mean you have to use prefix query when you want to search against  
just "foo".    You could also have a parallel field to your main  
field that stores the POS.  Then you could access it via the term  
vectors array.

Also, we have been discussing on the developers list on how to add  
payloads to a posting (i.e. store related information at a position  
in the index) similar to what Google discusses in their original  
paper.  Unfortunately, this isn't implemented yet, but if you feel  
like helping out, check out the discussion on the developer's list  
(see Flexible Indexing).
