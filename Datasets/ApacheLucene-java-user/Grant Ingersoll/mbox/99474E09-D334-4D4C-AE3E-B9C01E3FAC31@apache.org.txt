Perhaps you can explain in what way you want to make it more  
powerful?  There are possibilities to do:
1. Change the Similarity class (a call back mechanism)
2. Implement or extend Queries, Scorers, etc.
3. Others???

See http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html for some insights.

In other words, it can be as complex as you want it to be...
