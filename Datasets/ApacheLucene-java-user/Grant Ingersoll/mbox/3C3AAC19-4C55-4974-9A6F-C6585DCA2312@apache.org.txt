Perfectly reasonable as well.  I've seen some people who only care about P@5 and even P@1
and others who do much more.  The important thing is to think about what makes sense for your
application and users.  Much of this can be found through basic log analysis (assuming an
existing system) or some reasoning about use cases (new system) and users (how sophisticated
they are, etc.)
