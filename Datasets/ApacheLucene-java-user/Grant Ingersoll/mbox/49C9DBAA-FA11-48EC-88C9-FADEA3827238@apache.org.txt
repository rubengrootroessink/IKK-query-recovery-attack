I wouldn't say no chance...  TermVectorMapper would be good for this,  
as you can watch the terms as they are being loaded.  Just keep track  
of your last term and see if it is "foo", when you hit "bar"

What kind of special term are you looking for?  There may be other  
ways of solving your problem...
