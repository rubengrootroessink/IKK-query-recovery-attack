You'll have to tokenize the filename in order for it to match anything  
other than an exact query.  I believe the Lucene demo shows adding  
other fields.  Lucene doesn't have a concept of "metadata".  It only  
has a concept of Document and Fields.  It's up to you to put in your  
metadata, just as you have suggested here.  Try just making that  
filename Field a tokenized field and see what happens.

If you're looking for tools to get metadata from files, then have a  
look at Tika or Aperture, which can easily be paired with Lucene.   
Aperture, I believe, even comes with a Lucene example.
