Hi Kapil,

I am not sure exactly what you asking, could you give an example of  
the correct response?  Also, are you truly using numbers or are they  
just substitutes for text?  And are they part of a bigger problem  
requiring Lucene? If it is just numbers, maybe a DB might be the  
better way to go, since you would have SET operations that may make  
this easier.  Not saying Lucene can't do what you want, just thinking  
there are other ways
