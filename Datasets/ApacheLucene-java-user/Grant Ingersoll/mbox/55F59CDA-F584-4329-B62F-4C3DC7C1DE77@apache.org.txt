Hi Eric,

I'm sorry you are not finding what you need.   The snowball analyzers  
come in a separate jar, in the release zip, under the contrib/ 
snowball directory.  You may also want/need the analyzers in contrib/ 
analyzers for other languages.  The README delivered w/ the release  
probably should be updated to state that this is where you find the  
additional analyzers.  I will do that shortly (which doesn't help  
you, but should help others going forward)

Have you gone through the demo and the "Getting Started" section:  
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/gettingstarted.html ?

There are a number of articles, presentations and books available,  
many of which are listed at http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/ 
Resources

Additionally, the "Lucene In Action" book is quite good and most of  
it still applies to 2.0 (I think the URL is www.lucenebook.com).

Also, please add an issue or two for any specific places you feel are  
unclear or are lacking and hopefully they can be addressed.  Patches  
are always welcome, especially for documentation and the Wiki only  
requires a username password to edit.

-Grant
