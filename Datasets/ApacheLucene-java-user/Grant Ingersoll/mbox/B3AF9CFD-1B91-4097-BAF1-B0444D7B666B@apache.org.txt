SUBJECT: Re: Storing payloads without term-position and frequency
DATE: 3 Feb 2011

Payloads only make sense in terms of specific positions in the index, so I don't think there
is a way to hack Lucene for it.  You could, I suppose, just store the payload for the first
instance of the term.

Also, what's the use case you are trying to solve here?  Why store term frequency as a payload
when Lucene already does it (and it probably does it more efficiently)
