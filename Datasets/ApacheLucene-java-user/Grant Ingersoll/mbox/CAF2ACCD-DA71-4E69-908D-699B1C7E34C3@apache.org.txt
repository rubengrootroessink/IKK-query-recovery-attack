SUBJECT: Re: How to generate TermFreqVector from an existing index
DATE: 6 Nov 2007

You would have to take the original input and re-analyze it and put it  
into the TermFreqVector format.  It's just a list of terms and their  
frequencies for a given doc, so it should be pretty straightforward to  
do.  Just extra runtime computation.
