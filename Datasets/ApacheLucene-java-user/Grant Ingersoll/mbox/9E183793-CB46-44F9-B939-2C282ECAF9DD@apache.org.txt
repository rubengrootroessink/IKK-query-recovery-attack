They are "using" it, they just aren't sharing it.  Many companies out  
there do that, they use Lucene but you would never know it unless you  
dug in deep.  It's probably one of the big diffs between the Apache  
license and some of the "other" licenses.  But, having read more about  
it, I don't think Wikia is keeping it closed, but that doesn't mean  
they are contributing back to us, either.  They certainly could host  
the repository themselves and make it available.  Some people host  
Lucene improvements elsewhere b/c they want different licenses.  As  
long as they include the ASF license and give proper credit to it, I  
believe they are fine.

I would think so, but there are no rules against doing stupid things,  
right?
