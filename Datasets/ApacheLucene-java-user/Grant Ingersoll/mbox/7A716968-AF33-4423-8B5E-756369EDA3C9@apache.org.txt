I think I'm missing something here...

Spell checked in what sense?  Sounds to me like you need dictionary  
based spell checking during index, not index based spelling during  
search, right?

How about hooking up something like the Jazzy spell checker into a  
TokenFilter?  Then, as the tokens stream by, you lookup the spelling  
and then add a 1 byte payload to all words that are misspelled.

As for Highlighter, hmmm...  Not sure if there is a way to make a  
Fragmenter/Scorer that was payload aware, such that it would only  
produce fragments (and scores) for sections of the file that have  
these payloads.  Definitely pushing my area of expertise, but maybe  
one of the Highlighter experts can chime in.

HTH,
Grant
