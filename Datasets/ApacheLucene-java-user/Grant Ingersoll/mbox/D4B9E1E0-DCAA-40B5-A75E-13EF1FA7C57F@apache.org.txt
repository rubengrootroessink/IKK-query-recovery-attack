You should be able to get the clauses from the BooleanQuery: http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/BooleanQuery.html#clauses()

And, from there, you can do instanceof to determine the query type,  
eventually getting to a TermQuery, where you can do: http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/Query.html#getBoost()

Every Query has a boost, thus, you can call Query.getBoost().
