SUBJECT: Re: MoreLikeThis for multiple documents
DATE: 26 Jul 2007

I have some sample code for doing relevance feedback across multiple  
documents at http://www.cnlp.org/apachecon2005

It could be modified to provide more of the MoreLikeThis  
functionality (i.e. determining important terms via tf/idf) for now  
it just takes the top X terms
