Not directly, I don't think.  Mark Miller contributed some  
highlighting code that converts phrase queries to SpanNearQueries, I  
believe, but this isn't general purpose.    We probably need a  
QueryParser that produces SpanQueries instead of regular Queries, I  
suppose, but they aren't always 1-1.  Ideally, there would be no perf.  
penalty for SpanQueries and everything would be a span query, but  
until someone figures out that magic, I don't know.

What is it that you are trying to do?
