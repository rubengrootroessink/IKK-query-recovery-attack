Are both in the index?  I would think this is going to take some  
application specific logic, since Lucene doesn't inherently track  
these relations.  You might be able to string something together  
using some of the regular expression/wildcard queries, but it is  
going to take some work on your part.

Another approach might be to put some mechanisms in place during  
analysis that track this information.

Have a look at Luke if you just want the info as part of a UI.  Also,  
I _believe_ Solr has added a LukeRequestHandler (see http:// 
wiki.apache.org/solr/LukeRequestHandler), not sure if it does  
everything you are looking for, but it might be a place to start.   
You might ask your question on the Solr mailing list.
