SUBJECT: Overriding Similarity
DATE: 18 Aug 2006

Hey Luceners,

I am doing some documentation on scoring and I am interested in use  
cases people have for overriding the DefaultSimilarity.  If you can  
share what you did and why you did it, it would be much appreciated.

For example, Daniel Naber posted his at: http://www.gossamer- 
threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/38967?search_string=Similarity;#38967

Thanks,
Grant
