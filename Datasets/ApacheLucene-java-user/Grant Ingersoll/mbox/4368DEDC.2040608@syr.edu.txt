Others can correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think a "pure" Rochio 
feedback loop is possible in the current state, since Lucene doesn't 
currently support negative boosts 
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html).  Having 
said that, what we do, in a nutshell is similar to what you describe:
For the positive examples, store the terms and a boost factor.  The 
boost factor is the frequency of the term across all the positive 
examples multiplied by beta.
Then for the negative examples, decrement the boost factor by gamma 
times the frequency of the term in all the negative examples.  Remove 
any terms that have a boost of zero or less.

In the end, you construct a new query out of the terms and boosts that 
you can submit.  I think it is more of an approximation of Rochio, but 
have had good results from it.  You also probably want to limit the 
number of terms per document you add, at least if you are concerned 
about performance.
