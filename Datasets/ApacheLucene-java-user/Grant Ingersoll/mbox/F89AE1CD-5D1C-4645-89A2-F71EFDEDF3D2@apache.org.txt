Yes and no.  You can have a look at More Like This in the contrib  
package.  Additionally, you can just get the TermVectors out of Lucene  
and write your own.  You could use a MemoryIndex which contains one  
document and represent the other document as a query and the "search".

But, no, there isn't a MethodName(Vector1, Vector2) option.
