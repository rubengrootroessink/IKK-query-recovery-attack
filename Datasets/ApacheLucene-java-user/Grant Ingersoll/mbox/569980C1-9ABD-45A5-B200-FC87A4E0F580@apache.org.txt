Can you explain more of what you are trying to do?  Lucene just works  
with text, it is up to you to extract the text from whatever format it  
is in.  That being said, you can try searching the archives of this  
list as a starting point.  You might also check out Aperture (http://aperture.sourceforge.net

) for connectors/extractors.  I am pretty sure they have email and  
calendar connectors, but I don't think they have IM.
