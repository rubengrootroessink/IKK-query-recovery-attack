SUBJECT: Re: Help in Arabic Analysers with Lucene on Windows
DATE: 29 Dec 2008

Hi Girish,

Can you provide some sample code and info about what isn't working?   
All you have said so far is that the Arabic Analyzer doesn't work for  
you, but you have said nothing about how you are actually using it.   
Are you getting exceptions?  Do the tokens not look right?  Are no  
results coming back?  Have you looked at your index in Luke?

I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark and guess that you are not  
reading in the input in the right encoding.
