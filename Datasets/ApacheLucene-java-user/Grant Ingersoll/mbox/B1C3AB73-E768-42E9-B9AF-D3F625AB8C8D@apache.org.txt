But can I do this in Lucene to

Yes, you should be able to do all of this.  Note, Solr's DataImportHandler easily handles
RSS into Solr/Lucene and then you can either use the TermsComponent (which uses Lucene's TermEnum,
etc.) to get at the frequencies.  You might also need to do some stuff with Spans and SpanQueries
to properly incorporate your length of time requirement.
