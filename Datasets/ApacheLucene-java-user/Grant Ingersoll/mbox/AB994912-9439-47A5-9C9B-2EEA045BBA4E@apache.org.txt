You will likely need to write your own TokenFilter that can do the  
extraction.  It is feasible to plug in something like OpenNLP or other  
extraction toolkits into the Analysis stream and then provide these  
capabilities.  That, combined with the Tee/Sink Tokenizer/TokenFilter  
capabilities can make for some lightweight, but still powerful  
extraction capabilities.  You might also look at UIMA, which is in the  
Apache Incubator.
