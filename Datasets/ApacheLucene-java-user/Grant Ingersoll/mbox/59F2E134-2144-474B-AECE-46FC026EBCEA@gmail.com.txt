SUBJECT: Re: In which position of a document a word was found?
DATE: 14 Jun 2007

Have a look at the SpanQuery (starting at page 161 in LIA or in the  
javadocs).  I also have some info in my ApacheCon talk at http:// 
www.cnlp.org/presentations/slides/AdvancedLuceneEU.pdf and http:// 
www.cnlp.org/apachecon2005

Incidentally, the SpanQuery functionality does not require  
TermVectors, so if you don't need them otherwise, you would get a  
smaller index size.

Cheers,
Grant
