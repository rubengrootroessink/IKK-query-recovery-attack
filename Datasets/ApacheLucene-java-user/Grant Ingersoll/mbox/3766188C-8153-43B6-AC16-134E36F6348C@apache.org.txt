Hmmm, I think you should be able to rely on the fact that Fields are  
stored in order of indexing and then read back in that same order.   
Thus, index your documents making sure that the documentType is the  
first Field on the Document (and for performance reasons, the other  
fields you want to load are next).   Then, in your FieldSelector, you  
can, upon seeing the documentType, set the appropriate flags for when  
the other Fields are read..

Otherwise, the reading twice approach makes sense.
