SUBJECT: Re: Confidence scores at search time
DATE: 26 Feb 2009

I don't know of anyone doing work on it in the Lucene community.   My  
understanding to date is that it is not really worth trying, but that  
may in fact be an outdated view.  I haven't stayed up on the  
literature on this subject, so background info on what you are  
interested in would be helpful.

Digging around in the archives a bit more, I come up with some more  
relevant emails: http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/?q=comparing+scores+across+searches#/

p:lucene,solr/s:email

What is the bigger problem that you are trying to solve?  That is, you  
imply that score comparison is the solution, but you haven't said the  
problem you are trying to solve.

Cheers,
Grant
