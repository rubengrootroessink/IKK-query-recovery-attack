SUBJECT: Re: Calculating Precision and Recall
DATE: 29 Dec 2007

http://trec.nist.gov/trec_eval/trec_eval.8.0.tar.gz is a program that  
takes in the a results file and a set of judgments and spits out  
precision and recall.  If you want more info, have a look at the TREC  
program.  Also, the Lucene contrib/benchmark section has some tools  
for doing Quality benchmarks.   My talk at http://people.apache.org/~gsingers/apachecon07/LucenePerformance.ppt

  has a _little_ bit of info on precision/recall, but there is  
certainly more to be had out there than that.

Do you have relevance judgments?
