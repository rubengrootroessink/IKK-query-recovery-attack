See Mahout (http://lucene.apache.org/mahout).  In the utils module, is  
a class called LuceneIterable that the o.a.mahout.utils.vectors.Driver  
program can use to convert a Lucene index into a Mahout Vector  
representation, which can then be used to create a d-d similarity  
matrix.  It uses Hadoop, so you can go as big as you want.
