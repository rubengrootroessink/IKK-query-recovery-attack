Matt,

Perhaps you could add this to the Wiki somewhere?  May want to also add a bug report on this,
so that it is captured, especially the stuff in 2.).

Well, as one would expect most of the problems were me.  Here is what I
learned... (please comment on the accuracy of these statements).

1.) Setting storeTermVertor to true does nothing if store is false, i.e. 
   you must store the contents of a filed in order to retrieve TermVectors 
   for it later.  This may seem obvious to everyone else, but to a new user 
   this is anything but obvious as it is not documented anywhere that I have
   seen.  I think it would be very helpful to include this tidbit in the 
   Field class JavaDoc if not in the FAQ or some other place.

   I also think it would be helpful to prevent the user from combinations 
   of store and storeTermVector that don't make sense, namely store = false 
   and storeTermVector = true.  Maybe an exception or something.

2.) The following methods...

   Field.Text(String name, Reader value, boolean storeTermVector) 
   Field.UnStored(String name, String value, boolean storeTermVector) 

   DO NOT store the contents of the field and (based on my assumption in 
   point 1 and through observation) consequently DO NOT store TermVectors
   despite the value of their storeTermVector value.  If this is accurate,
   why do these methods exist?  This is very misleading to the new user.

3.) I am also new to Java so if you look at my earlier sample code you
   will see that I used "reader.toString()" where reader is a buffered file
   reader.  This of course is not the desired effect.  I have since rewritten
   the code to reflect the a string that contains the content of the file
   instead of some vector address thing.  This doesn't affect Lucene or
   term vectors, just my ego.

Once you understand that stor=true is ALSO a prerequisite for TermVectors (in
addition to storeTermVector=true) then everything works great.

Thanks for the help,

Matt Galloway
