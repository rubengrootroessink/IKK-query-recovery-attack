SUBJECT: Re: Restricting the number of docs per search field
DATE: 28 Feb 2006

Do you want the first 2 docs, regardless of score, with the same 
property or do you want the 2 highest scoring docs with the same property?

You might look at the HitCollector search method on IndexSearcher.  Btw, 
the Filter that is required can be null.  The HitCollector interface 
allows you to apply business rules to a document as it is being scored 
and store them how you see fit.

I am not sure you will see much performance gain, as Lucene is pretty 
fast. Have you done profiling, etc. to determine that Lucene is actually 
the bottleneck?
