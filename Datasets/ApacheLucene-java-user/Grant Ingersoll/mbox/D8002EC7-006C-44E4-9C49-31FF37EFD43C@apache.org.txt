        ApacheCon Celebrates the ASF's 10th Anniversary in Oakland,
        California,
        2-6 November 2009

        Call for Papers Opens for ApacheCon US 2009

        The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) invites submissions to its
        official
        user and developer conference, taking place 2-6 November 2009 at
        the Oakland
        Convention Center and Marriott Hotel. ApacheCon serves as a
        forum for
        showcasing the ASF's latest projects, members, and community
        initiatives.
        Offering unparalleled educational opportunities, ApacheCon's
        presentations,
        hands-on trainings, and sessions address key technology,
        development,
        business/community, and licensing issues in Open Source.

        The wide range of activities offered at ApacheCon promotes the
        exchange of
        ideas amongst ASF Members, committers, innovators, developers,
        vendors, and
        users interested in the future of Open Source technology. The
        conference
        program includes peer-reviewed sessions, trainings/workshops,
        and select
        invited keynote presentations and speakers.

        Conference Themes and Topics

        Building on ten years of success, ApacheCon returns to the Bay
        Area for the
        10th anniversary of the Apache Software Foundation. Comprising
        some of the
        most active and recognized developers in the Open Source
        community,
        ApacheCon provides an influential platform for dialogue between
        Open Source
        developers and users, traversing a wide range of ideas,
        expertise, and
        personalities.

        ApacheCon welcomes submissions across many fields, geographic
        locations, and
        areas of development. The breadth of the Apache community lends
        itself to
        conference content that is somewhat loosely-structured, with
        common themes
        of interest addressing groundbreaking technologies and emerging
        trends, best
        practices (from development to deployment), case studies and
        lessons learned
        (tips, tools, and tricks). In addition, ApacheCon will continue
        to offer its
        highly popular, two-day intensive trainings; certifications of
        completion
        will be distributed to those who fulfill all the training
        requirements.

        Topics appropriate for submission are manifold, and may include
        but are not
        restricted to: Apache HTTP server (installation, configuration,
        migration,
        and more); ASF-wide projects (including Lucene, Hadoop,
        Jackrabbit, and
        Maven); Scripting languages and dynamic content (such as Java,
        Perl, Python,
        Ruby, XSL, and PHP); Security and e-commerce (performance
        tuning, load
        balancing and high availability); New technologies (including
        broader
        initiatives such as Web Services and Web 2.0); ASF-Incubated
        projects (such
        as Sling, UIMA, and Shindig); and Business/Community issues
        (Open Source
        driven business models, open development, enterprise adoption,
        and more).

        successes.
        Proposals that highlight overcoming interesting challenges in
        application
        design and developing innovative frameworks using multiple ASF
        projects are
        particularly encouraged. NOTE: Marketing-oriented submissions

        technology
        development, industry leadership, hot or emerging trends,
        opinions on
