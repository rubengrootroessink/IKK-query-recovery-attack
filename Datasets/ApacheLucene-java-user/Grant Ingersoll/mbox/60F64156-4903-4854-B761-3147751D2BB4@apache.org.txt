SUBJECT: Re: Is Lucene Java trunk still stable for production code?
DATE: 15 Mar 2007

Well, I think the standard disclaimer applies here:  The trunk is not  
guaranteed to be stable (but, hey, what really is, right?).  Releases  
are meant to be "production ready" to the best of our knowledge at  
the time.

That being said, we do make efforts to keep the trunk stable.  I  
guess the answer ultimately depends on your business needs.  If I  
were doing it, I would move to 2.1, but that's just me!
