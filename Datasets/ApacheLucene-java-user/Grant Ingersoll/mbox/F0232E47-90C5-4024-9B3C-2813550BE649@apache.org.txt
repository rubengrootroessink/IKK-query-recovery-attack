Not sure what you mean here.  What do the doc ids have to do with the  
content?

It is possible if you use Term Vectors (see  
IndexReader.getTermFreqVector).  You will need to store (when you  
construct your Field) and load the term vectors and then calculate  
the similarity.  A common way of doing this is by calculating the  
cosine of the angle between the two vectors.
