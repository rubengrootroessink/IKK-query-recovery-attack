SUBJECT: Re: How many documents in the biggest Lucene index to date?
DATE: 29 Jan 2007

It is a 64-bit JVM and a pretty good size machine, but I don't think  
I am anywhere near pushing the limits on it either, so don't read too  
much into my numbers other than as a raw statement of how many  
documents I've indexed.

When using the Hits API, documents aren't loaded until you ask for a  
specific document.  Even then, if you use the FieldSelector mechanism  
checked into trunk, you can choose to control which fields get  
loaded, which can help w/ memory issues.
