Document boosts do not have much granularity due to the limited number  
of bits in the norm.  I seem to recall Yonik publishing a list of  
values at one time on the mailing list, but I can't for the life of me  
conjure the keywords to find it at the moment, as it was one a related  
topic.  Perhaps his memory is better than mine...
