TF gives you the importance in a single document.
IDF gives you the inverse of importance across the collection

Also, Lucene can also normalize by length, which is often a part of these things too.  

This information can be retrieved from TermDocs, TermEnum, etc.

Also, as a related item, you may be interested in important phrases, which can often be more
helpful.  Check out https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAHOUT/Collocations for one
way of doing that.
