You probably can skip the QueryParser part and just construct a  
TermQuery with your term and field.  That will save you a few ticks.   
I'm betting you have just included the code below for example, so  
this may not apply, however, you want to make sure you aren't  
creating the IndexSearcher every time you want to run the query.  See  
the list archives for info on warming/caching the searcher.

What kind of runtimes are you experiencing?
