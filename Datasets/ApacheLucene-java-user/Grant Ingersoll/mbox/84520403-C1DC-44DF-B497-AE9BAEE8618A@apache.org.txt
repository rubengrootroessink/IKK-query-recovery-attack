Hi Alex,

This seems like a pretty small setup, so I think we may need some  
more info.  I don't know a lot about EJBs, but what I wonder is if  
your bean is opening an Index Searcher for every connection.  Perhaps  
you could describe your architecture a little bit more and that will  
help us figure out what is going on?

I wouldn't think you would need RMI or anything like that.
