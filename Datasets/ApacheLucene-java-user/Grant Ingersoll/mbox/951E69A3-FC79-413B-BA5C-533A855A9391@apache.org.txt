I was looking at the SimpleFragmenter in contrib/Highlighter and was  
wondering about the fragmentSize value.  It says the value is the  
number of bytes, but looking at the code it's using the String offset,  
right?  So it should be the number of characters, right?

I can fix it, just wanted to confirm my understanding.

Thanks,
Grant
