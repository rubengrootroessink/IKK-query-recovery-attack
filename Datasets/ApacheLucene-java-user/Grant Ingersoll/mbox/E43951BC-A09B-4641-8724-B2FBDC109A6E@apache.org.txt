SUBJECT: Re: Using Lucene to find duplicate/similar names
DATE: 16 Apr 2008

I believe there were some posts on this about a year ago.  Try  
searching in the archives for duplicate names, as well as "record  
linkage" or any other various synonyms that you can think of.  The  
short answer is Lucene is reasonable to attempt this with, but you may  
need some help.  The long answer is to dig into those archives and see  
the other recommendations.
