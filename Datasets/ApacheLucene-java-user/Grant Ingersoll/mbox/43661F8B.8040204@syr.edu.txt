Right, I was think providing it as a package of code that would store 
the tokens needed on indexing, etc, probably by extending the 
StandardTokenizer/Analyzer. The Span classes would need to take in the 
appropriate information and create the underlying SpanNotQuery, etc. as 
discussed in the previous email.

I have added a fair amount to the current Lucene Demo for my ApacheCon 
talk in December, which will be available freely then that I might 
consider putting in a proof of concept/demo of how to do such a thing.  
I will try to write it up when I get the chance.
