What you are trying to do is called record linkage.   There is a fair  
amount of info in the Lucene archives on this, see http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/?q=record+linkage

As Erick says, you will need more info than just the name to do  
this.   I doubt you will be able to get completely automated, but you  
should be able to obtain good results such that the outliers are easy  
for a human to handle.
