SUBJECT: Re: Create and populate a field when indexing
DATE: 29 Oct 2007

When you are indexing the file and adding the Document, you will need  
to parse out your filename per your regular expression, and then  
create the appropriate field:

Document doc = new Document()
String cat = getCategoryFromFileName(inputFileName)
doc.add(new Field("category", cat, ...)
//do the rest of your adds

Just locate where in the demo the Document add is taking place (I  
forget the exact spot) and then add in the appropriate stuff from  
above.  Obviously, you need to implement the method I stubbed called  
getCategoryFromFileName.
