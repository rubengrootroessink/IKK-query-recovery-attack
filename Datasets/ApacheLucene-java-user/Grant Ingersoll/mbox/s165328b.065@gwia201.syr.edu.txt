Someone posted an Arabic analyzer about 1 year ago, however, I don't
think the licensing was very friendly and we no longer use it.

We have a cross language system that works w/ Arabic (among other
languages).  We have written several stemmers based on the literature
that perform pretty well
and were not too difficult to implement (but are not available as open
source at this point).  Light stemming seems to work much better in IR
applications then aggressive stemmers due to the problems with roots
discussed earlier.

Hmm. This brings up a question: the algorithmic stemmer package from 
Egothor works quite well for Polish (http://www.getopt.org/stempel), 
wouldn't it work well for Arabic, too?

I lack the necessary expertise to evaluate results (knowing only two or

three arabic words ;-) ), but I can certainly help someone to get 
started with testing...
