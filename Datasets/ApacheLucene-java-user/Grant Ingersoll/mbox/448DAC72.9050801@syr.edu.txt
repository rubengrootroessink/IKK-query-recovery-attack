See http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html for the 
Query Parser syntax

(Query Parser doesn't care about the index, but I assume you mean how to 
generate queries when you don't know what fields you have available on 
each index)
This is generally up to your application to manage.  I think most people 
end up storing some metadata about each index that contains what fields 
are available, etc.  Either that or they use conventions to know that 
every index has the same fields available.  I believe there is also a 
method or two on IndexReader that lets you recover what fields are in 
the index.
