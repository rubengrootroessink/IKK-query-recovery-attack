Have a look at the Similarity class and also the Scoring section of  
the website (Documentation-> Scoring on the left hand side)  This is a  
classic problem of dealing with TF/IDF and length normalization.   
Lucene makes general assumptions about what is best, but does allow  
you to tune as well (which can be an abyss one never returns from if  
one isn't careful).
