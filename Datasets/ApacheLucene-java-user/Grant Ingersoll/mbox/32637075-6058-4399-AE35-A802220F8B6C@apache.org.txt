The "formal" name for this stuff is "document filtering" or just  
"filtering".  You can start on it, by looking at TREC, which had a  
filtering task for a number of years: http://trec.nist.gov/tracks.html

At any rate, one approach is to store your queries as Lucene  
documents, albeit short ones.  Then, as others have said, you index  
new, incoming docs into a Memory Index.  From that, you can extract  
the key terms which can then be used to come up with a Query to be run  
against your "query" index.  The MoreLikeThis functionality should  
help in determining the important terms.  Then, you need to decide how  
to handle dealing with the results.  You probably don't want to route  
the document to each and every query that matches.
