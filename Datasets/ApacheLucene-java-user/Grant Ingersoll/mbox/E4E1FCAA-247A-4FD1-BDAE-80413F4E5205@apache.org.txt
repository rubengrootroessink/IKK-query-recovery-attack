Assuming you want to handle the vectors yourself, as opposed to  
relying on the fact that Lucene itself implements the VSM, you should  
index your documents with TermVector.YES.  That will give you the term  
freq on a per doc basis, but you will have to use the TermEnum to get  
the Doc Freq.  All and all, this is not going to be very efficient for  
you, but you should be able to build up a matrix from it.

What is the problem you are trying to solve?
