I'm not aware of any query technique to score based on proximity that  
doesn't, itself, use proximity information.

I suppose you could precompute the proximity associations by indexing  
n-grams (in this case, called Lucene calls them shingles), such that  
there is a single token in your index containing cheese_sandwich  
(effectively)

BTW, what's your concern about using a Phrase Query?  What requirement  
do you have that would prevent that particular query?  Or is there  
something in the way it is implemented that doesn't work for your  
needs (assuming your example here is for discussion purposes)
