SUBJECT: [ApacheCon US] Travel Assistance
DATE: 22 Jul 2009

The Travel Assistance Committee is taking in applications for those  
wanting
to attend ApacheCon US 2009 (Oakland) which takes place between the  
2nd and
6th November 2009.

The Travel Assistance Committee is looking for people who would like  
to be
able to attend ApacheCon US 2009 who may need some financial support in
order to get there. There are limited places available, and all  
applications
will be scored on their individual merit. Applications are open to all  
open
source developers who feel that their attendance would benefit  
themselves,
their project(s), the ASF and open source in general.

Financial assistance is available for flights, accommodation,  
subsistence
and Conference fees either in full or in part, depending on  
circumstances.
It is intended that all our ApacheCon events are covered, so it may be
prudent for those in Europe and/or Asia to wait until an event closer to
them comes up - you are all welcome to apply for ApacheCon US of  
course, but
there should be compelling reasons for you to attend an event further  
away
that your home location for your application to be considered above  
those
closer to the event location.

More information can be found on the main Apache website at
http://www.apache.org/travel/index.html - where you will also find a  
link to
the online application and details for submitting.

Applications for applying for travel assistance will open on 27th July  
2009
and close of the 17th August 2009.

Good luck to all those that will apply.

Regards,

The Travel Assistance Committee
