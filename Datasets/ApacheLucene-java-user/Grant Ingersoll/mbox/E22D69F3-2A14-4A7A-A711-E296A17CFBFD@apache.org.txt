First off, I would start by using Lucene's explain functionality to  
see why one result appears before the other. The explain method will  
tell you all the factors that go into scoring each of your results, as  
it goes beyond just term frequency.

Finally, you might find http://www.lucidimagination.com/Community/Hear-from-the-Experts/Articles/Debugging-Relevance-Issues-Search

  helpful.  One of the things I often tell people is that if you know  
a certain result needs to be in a certain place for a certain query,  
just put it there.  Otherwise, don't sweat relative position too much  
unless you have a result that you think is good buried (i.e. page 5)  
deep down in your results.
