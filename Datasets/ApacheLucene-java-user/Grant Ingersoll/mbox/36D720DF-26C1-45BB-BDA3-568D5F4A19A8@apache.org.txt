SUBJECT: Re: Indexing/Querying Annotations and Fields for a document
DATE: 18 Mar 2008

You would parse the XML (or whatever) into separate strings, and put  
each piece into it's own Field in a Lucene Document

For instance:

Document doc = new Document();
String body = getBody(input);
String people = getPeople(input)
Field body = new Field("body", body);
Field people = new Field("people", people);

writer.addDocument(doc)


Essentially, you just need to implement the getPeople and getBody  
methods to extract the appropriate content from your text.
