SUBJECT: Re: how to query against payload
DATE: 22 Apr 2008

Hmmm, sounds like you need a new Query.   I _think_ it could be  
something as simple as MutliplicativeTermQuery or something like that  
whereby instead of adding the score of the payload callback, you would  
multiple.  That way, if the document with the term does not have the  
payload of interest, then multiply by 0, or wait until you have seen  
all payloads for that document and if any are the right one, then  
return a score of 1, otherwise return 0.  I think this would be  
relatively easy to do using the BoostingTermQuery as a template.

Other thought:  Could you put the "payload" as a regular term at the  
same position and do a no-slop phrase query?  Or a slightly modified  
phrase query that requires both terms to be at the same position?

Just thinking out loud,
Grant
