Sorry, about the mispelling, Erik!

Thanks for the insight.

Explain is my friend as an end user, but it, too, is confusing at the code level!  At some
point I will have time to dig deeper and step through the scoring code.

I computed the angle between two vectors.  The vectors are obtained 
from IndexReader.getTermFreqVector(docId, "field").

It would be quite compute-intensive to do something like this.  This 
could be done through a custom sort as well, if applying it at the 
scoring level doesn't work.  I haven't given any thought to how this 
could work for scoring or sorting before, but does sound quite 
interesting.

No doubt that it is confusing - to me also.  But Explanation is your 
friend.
