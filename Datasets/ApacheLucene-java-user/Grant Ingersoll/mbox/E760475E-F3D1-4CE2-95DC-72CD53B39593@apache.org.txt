DATE: 7 Aug 2009

There are several free Language Detection libraries out there, as well  
as a few commercial ones.  I think Karl Wettin has even written one as  
a plugin for Lucene.  Nutch also has one, AIUI.  I would just Google  
"language detection".

Also see http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/?q=language+detection,  
as this has been brought up many times before and I'm sure there are  
links in the archives.
