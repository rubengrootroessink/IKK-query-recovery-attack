SUBJECT: Re: How to say Thank You ?
DATE: 17 Dec 2007

I don't consider sending this kind of message to the list pollution.   
It's good to take a step back from time to time and remember that  
almost all of us volunteer here, even if we get paid to work w/  
Lucene.  I am constantly amazed at the Lucene community and what it  
has to offer in the way of ideas, support and for, lack of a better  
word, niceness.  The sentiment is definitely appreciated and it is  
good to know we have happy users.

FWIW, other ways to say thanks include:
1. Contributing docs, patches, help to others when possible.  See http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/HowToContribute
2.  The ASF gladly accepts donations, since it is a non-profit.  See http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html

Of course, neither of these are requirements for participation, but  
since you asked, I thought I would offer.

Cheers,
Grant
