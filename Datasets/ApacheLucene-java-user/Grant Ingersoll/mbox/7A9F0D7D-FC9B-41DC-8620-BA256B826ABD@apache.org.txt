SUBJECT: Re: Can POI provide reliable text extraction results for production search engine for Word, Excel and PowerPoint formats?
DATE: 13 May 2008

I've used POI, as well as commercial providers.  As always, it  
depends :-)  I wasn't particularly impressed with the commercial  
providers given the amount of money they wanted for it.   PDF was  
particularly tricky, but you weren't asking about that.   At least w/  
POI, you have the opportunity to fix things that don't work based on  
your priorities.  I don't know what the failure rate is for the  
commercial providers, but my experience is they will all fail at least  
once, so you better plan on it.  I'd look to use a framework like Tika  
or Aperture, where you can easily upgrade or plug in new or different  
libraries (including commercial providers) as needed w/o rewriting  
your code.  Additionally, with something like Tika or Aperture, you  
could easily mix and match your solutions, such that you use one for  
Word and a different one for PPT or PDF.

One issue with any of them is how you plan to use them.  If you need  
more than bag of words, they all get less reliable, especially when it  
comes to PDFs and Office docs.  Dealing with things like tables,  
columns, captions, labels, etc. has always been problematic in my  
experience when one wants to do higher level processing (beyond  
keyword search).
