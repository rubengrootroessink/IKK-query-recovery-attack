This question is best asked on java-user.  However, my guess is that  
it is related to your Locale and that you need to set the character  
encoding to Greek on Ubuntu when reading in your files.

Something like:  Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(new  
FileInputStream(file), "GREEK Char Encoding here");
