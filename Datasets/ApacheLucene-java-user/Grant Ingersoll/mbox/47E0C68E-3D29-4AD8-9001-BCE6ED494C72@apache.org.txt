Index time boosting is used to say Document A is more important than  
Document B.  Thus, if all else being equal between the two, Doc A will  
score higher.  Sorting on other
values has no bearing on the scoring.  Thus, if you sort by mod time,  
you may see doc B higher in the list b/c of it's mod time, but it's  
score would still be lower than A's.

One side note based on your example, below:  Index time boosting does  
not have much granularity (only 255 values), in other words, there is  
a loss of precision.  Thus, you
want to make sure your boosts are different enough such that you can  
distinguish between the two.   Maybe 1/(2*depth) or something like  
that.   You can alter how these 255 values are encoded, but that is  
fairly advanced stuff.
