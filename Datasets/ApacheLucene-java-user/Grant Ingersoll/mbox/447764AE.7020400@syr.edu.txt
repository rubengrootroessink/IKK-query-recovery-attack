It kind of sounds like those files are corrupted, but I can't say for 
sure.  When you look in Luke at your index (the one with all the files, 
not the new one) do you see all the documents you would expect to see 
with values that seem reasonable?  Also, in Luke, you can see a listing 
of all the files it thinks are in the index, do they match with what you 
see via a file listing on the command line?

Also, you may want to see if you have any stale locks or the like that 
is preventing you from doing an optimize.
