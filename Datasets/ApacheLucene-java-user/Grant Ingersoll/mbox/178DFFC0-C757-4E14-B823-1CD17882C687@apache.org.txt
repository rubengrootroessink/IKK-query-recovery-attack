Also, from the javadocs, check out the explain method on Searcher:   
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/ 
Searcher.html#explain(org.apache.lucene.search.Query,%20int)

As for the state of the documentation, If you have concerns about the  
javadocs, please write up an issue in JIRA and, even better, submit a  
patch with your improvements.  We are always looking for help,  
especially in the documentation department.  Lucene will only get  
better by having people make quality contributions based on their  
knowledge of Lucene and IR.
