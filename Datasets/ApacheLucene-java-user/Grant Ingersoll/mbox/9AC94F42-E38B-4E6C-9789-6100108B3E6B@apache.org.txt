See http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/7fe40486bc935ce4/get_term_neighbours 
  (although I think you can do better than the code in the third reply  
by using a TermVectorMapper such that you can process the TermVector  
as it comes from disk.)

Essentially, you need to use a combination of SpanQuery, TermVector  
and TermVectorMapper.
