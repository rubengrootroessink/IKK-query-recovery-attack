I have implemented (more or less)  Rochio rel. feedback.  You have to
make some minor modifications b/c Lucene doesn't support boost values
less than 0, but other than it is pretty straightforward using the
TermVector support.  At feedback time, get the TermVector for the top X
documents and construct a new query using the frequencies of the terms
for boosting (maybe multiplying by the alpha, beta, gamma parameters if
you want).  I seem to recall others posting that they have implemented
similar things, so you may want to search the archive of this list.

I used the description in "Modern Information Retrieval" by Baeza-Yates
and Ribeiro-Neto for the algorithm.
