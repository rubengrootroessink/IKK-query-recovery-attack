So, the piece I'm missing is how do you know what field for which  
terms.  In other words how do you know xyz goes against organization  
and abc against name.  Your wording implies that you don't know this  
before hand, yet you are somehow suggesting that Lucene should be able  
to do it.  Correct me if I'm wrong.
