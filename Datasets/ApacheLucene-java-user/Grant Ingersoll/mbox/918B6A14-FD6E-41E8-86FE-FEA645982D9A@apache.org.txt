Hi Tod,

Lucene doesn't know anything you don't tell it about your documents/ 
metadata.  You would need to create fields for the metadata for a  
document and then index them.  You could just do something like a  
document with fields:
text
author
createDate
...

These all can be "separate" when it comes to searching by creating the  
appropriate query against the fields.

So, I think the answer to your questions is yes, there is a way to  
query documents for metadata, but it isn't any different from querying  
anything else.  After all, Lucene has no clue what a word document is  
to begin with anyway.
