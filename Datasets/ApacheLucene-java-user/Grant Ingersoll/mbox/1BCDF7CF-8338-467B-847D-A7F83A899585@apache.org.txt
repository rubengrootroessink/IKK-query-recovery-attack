FYI: The Wiki has a fair number of resources on IR: http:// 
wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/InformationRetrieval  (I have added a  
link to this conversation, which contains a lot of useful information)

Karl, if you are so inclined, please feel free to add any of the  
references you have found that have been helpful that aren't already  
on this page (anyone can edit the Wiki with an login)
