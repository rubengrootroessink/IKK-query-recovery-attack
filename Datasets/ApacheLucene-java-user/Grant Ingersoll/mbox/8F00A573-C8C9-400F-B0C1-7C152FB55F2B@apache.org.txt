SUBJECT: Re: get term neighbours
DATE: 5 May 2009

There isn't a very clean way to do this just yet, but it is doable.   
Index with positions (you might find offsets useful too) and then use  
the TermVectorMapper and TermVector API call on the IndexReader (not  
the termPositions).  Then, you will need to implement a  
TermVectorMapper that takes in your position and then reads in the  
term vector and gets just those positions around the interested  
position.  Once you are outside of your window, you can then short  
circuit out of the TermVM (I think).
