I don't think you are still considering this, but I wanted to note  
that Similarity.scorePayload() is a call back function, just like the  
other methods on Similarity.  The only query that currently makes that  
callback is the BoostingTermQuery.  Essentially, the only queries that  
can use payloads are those that use position information when scoring,  
i.e. the SpanQuerys, of which the BoostingTQ is one.

The takeaway here, being, you can't retrieve the payload from the  
Similarity class.  You can only get payloads via the TermPositions  
object.
