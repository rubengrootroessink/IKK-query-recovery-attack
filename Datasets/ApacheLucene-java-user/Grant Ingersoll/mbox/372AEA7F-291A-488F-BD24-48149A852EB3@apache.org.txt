SUBJECT: Re: How to restore corrupted index
DATE: 26 Sep 2008

There is the CheckIndex tool included in the distribution for checking/ 
fixing bad indexes, but it can't solve everything.

The bigger question is why it is happening to begin with.  Can you  
describe your indexing process?  How do you know the index is actually  
corrupted?  Are you seeing exceptions when opening it?
