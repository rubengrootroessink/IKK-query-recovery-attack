Hi, (apologies for the cross-post)

Just a quick update on Lucene Revolution - coming up in Boston, October 7-8 (see http://lucenerevolution.org).

- Marten Mickos, CEO Eucalyptus Systems, ex-MySQL CEO will be giving a keynot on "How Open
Source Leads Infrastructure Innovation"
- Bill Press from Salesforce.com has been added to the  Cutting Edge of Search panel (joining
LinkedIn, Twitter, and eHarmony)
- We've added several new talks, including Jon Gifford (Loggly), Erik Arnold (Lucene in Goverment/Search.USA.gov).
 I'll be doing a session comparing Apache Lucene, Solr and NoSQL
- Submit your tough Solr challenges for the "Stump The Chump" session (send email to stump@lucenerevolution.org)

There's still a limited number of seats available for the Lucene and Solr two-day trainings
preceding the conference. If you're interested please register now. Also please be aware that
the early bird rate expires September 10.

Hope to see you there.

Cheers,
