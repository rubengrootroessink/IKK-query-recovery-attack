Hi Sergi,

Take a look at TermEnum and TermDocs in the API.  You will have to

You could also, during indexing, store these counts external to Lucene 
as you come across the term during the Analysis phase.

count the times that a word appears in the whole corpus with a simple query, but it seems
to be not so easy. Somebody knows how to do it?
