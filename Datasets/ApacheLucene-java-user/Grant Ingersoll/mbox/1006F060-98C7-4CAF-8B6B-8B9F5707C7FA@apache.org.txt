SUBJECT: Re: Payload basic query
DATE: 6 Feb 2008

Payloads are added during analysis onto the Token.  Have a look in the  
contrib/analyzers module in 2.3 or the trunk version of Lucene.  There  
are a couple of examples in there that add payloads to tokens (see the  
payloads package at
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_0/api/contrib-analyzers/org/apache/lucene/analysis/payloads/package-summary.html)

.    You can use the BoostingTermQuery to use the payload as a factor  
in scoring, or, you might be able to write your own custom Sort, but I  
haven't thought that all the way through just yet.

Michael B. also has an excellent talk from last year's ApacheCon that  
covers payloads at http://people.apache.org/~buschmi/apachecon/AdvancedIndexingLuceneAtlanta07.ppt
