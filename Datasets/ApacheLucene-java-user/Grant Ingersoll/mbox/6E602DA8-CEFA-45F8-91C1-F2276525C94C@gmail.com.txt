Gotcha.  I guess I just rely on IntelliJ built in versioning to  
provide similar capabilities, plus, maybe checking out multiple  
copies of the source.  Also, I try to avoid making changes in open  
source libraries unless absolutely necessary.

I'll wait for some of the others that are closer to the Foundation to  
contribute (maybe one of the PMC members).  Like I said, I don't know  
if it is an issue at all.  I just don't want people to be confused  
about it.  I think you could propose a DRCS to infrastructure and  
make a case for it.  Personally, I'm fine with SVN, but then again I  
used to think I was fine with CVS and I don't think I would want to  
go back to that!

I am curious, how many custom changes are you making to the code that  
this is even an issue?  Perhaps submitting patches and working to get  
them committed would be a more efficient strategy.
