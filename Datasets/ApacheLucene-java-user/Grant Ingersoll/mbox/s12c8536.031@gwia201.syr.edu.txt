Avi,

I may be confused, as I understand it you said you were interested in
the last document indexed, Berhnard's code does that.   Lucene adds
documents sequentially, so counting backwards from the maxDoc() should
get you the last indexed document pretty quickly.  If all documents were
deleted, then this would go through all documents, otherwise, it is
going to find it pretty quickly.  It doesn't have to traverse through
all of the documents, it just has to find the "first" document that is
not deleted (since we are starting at the end of the list and going
backward)

No, in _all_ cases this would be linear.

Then you don't understand what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to find the

document with the biggest value for the field. That would involve 
checking the field's value in every document to ensure this.
