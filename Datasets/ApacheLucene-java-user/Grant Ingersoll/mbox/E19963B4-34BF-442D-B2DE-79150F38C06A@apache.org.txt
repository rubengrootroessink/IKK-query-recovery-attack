Yes, offsets and positions can be associated with a term vector.   
When you ask the IndexReader for a term vector, you give it the  
document number and, optionally, a field, which it uses to go look up  
in the tvd file the document location in the tvd file.  The tvd file  
then looks up the specific information in the tvf file.  Have a look  
at the TermVectorsReader for details on implementation.

Payloads have a variety of uses.  Search the java-dev archive for the  
word Payload and you will find lots of discussion.  I also have a few  
slides on it in my ApacheCon Europe presentation at http://cnlp.org/ 
presentations/slides/AdvancedLuceneEU.pdf  See also http:// 
wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/Payload_Planning

Essentially, it can be used to store information on a term by term  
level, things like font weight, or XML enclosing tag, or Part of  
Speech.  The sky really is the limit (that and your disk space) on  
what can be stored in a payload.

Not quite sure what you are asking, but I will take a stab at it.   
Have a look at the section on the Term Dictionary, specifically the  
relationship between the tis file and the tii file.  The storage  
mechanism makes it very easy to find where the keyword is in the file  
so that the rest of the information can be easily looked up.
