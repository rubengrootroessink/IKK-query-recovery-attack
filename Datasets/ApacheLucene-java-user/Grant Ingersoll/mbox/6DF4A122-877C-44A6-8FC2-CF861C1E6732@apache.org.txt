SUBJECT: Re: Different levels of negative boosting
DATE: 1 Feb 2008

Hi Prabin,

Can you give an example of what you would like a query to look like?   
Lucene doesn't do negative boosts (ok, w/ a patch, I think it can,  
but...)  At any rate, the boosts are relative, so perhaps you just  
lower the boost to be very small for the "bad" terms and raise it  
higher for the good terms.

What is the end goal of what you are trying to find?  Perhaps there  
are some alternatives.
