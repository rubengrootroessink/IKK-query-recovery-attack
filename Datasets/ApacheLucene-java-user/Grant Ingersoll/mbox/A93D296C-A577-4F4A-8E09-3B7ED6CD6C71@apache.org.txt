http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/HowToContribute is the best place  
to start.  Usually, I just tell people to scratch their own itches.   
Fix or add to things that you use.  Also, we are nearing 2.9 release,  
so it would
be great to have as many eyeballs as possible on that.  There is a lot  
of new goodness coming in 2.9, so it will be particularly important to  
get good feedback, as this will help set the stage
for us to finally drop JDK 1.4 support as well as add in more flexible  
indexing/search capabilities (new analysis capabilities, etc.)   
Additionally, it has some cool new per segment stuff that should help  
people
with near real time needs have better performance.  Finally, there are  
a few back incompatible changes, so feedback on them would also be  
great.
