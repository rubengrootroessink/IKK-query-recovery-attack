Hi Eric,

Take a look at http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/releases.html

Clicking through to the appropriate mirror, download/unzip  
lucene-2.0.0.zip.  In it you'll find the jars, contrib, README, demo,  
etc.   It really should contain everything you need outside of the  
actual Lucene source to get started.

I appreciate your comments on the docs.  You have many good  
suggestions for improvements, especially the definitions, etc.  Some  
of your questions can best be answered by searching for those terms  
(on Google/Yahoo/Search Engine of Choice) and maybe doing a little  
reading on Information Retrieval, but I agree a definitions page  
would be useful as well as some info on what pieces are important to  
Lucene.   One of my hopes/intents/goals for Lucene in '07 is to  
increase the level of documentation, both at the lower level for  
developers/committers and at the higher level for end users.  As with  
all open source, however, this takes time and a group effort.

Please contribute back any suggestions that you think will clear  
things up.  See http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/HowToContribute  
for info on how to give back to Lucene.

As always, search this list and ask questions.

-Grant
