I don't believe it does.  Is there anyway you can mount the drive where 
the index lives?  Can you copy the index to someplace that allows you to 
run Luke?

Otherwise, you could write a simple standalone program that dumps the 
terms and their freqs from the command line.  I don't think it would 
take too many lines of code.  I believe somewhere in the contrib package 
there is some code named HighFreqTerms.java that will dump out the 
highest n occurring terms.
