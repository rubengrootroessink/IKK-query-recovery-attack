SUBJECT: Mahout Machine Learning Project Launches

(Apologies for cross-posting)

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the creation of the Mahout  
Machine Learning project, located at http://lucene.apache.org/mahout.   
Mahout's goal is to create a suite of practical, scalable machine  
learning libraries.  Our initial plan is to utilize Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org 
) to implement a variety of algorithms including naive bayes, neural  
networks, support vector machines and k-Means, among others.  While  
our initial focus is on these algorithms, we welcome other machine  
learning ideas as well.

Naturally, we are looking for volunteers to help grow the community  
and make the project successful.  So, if machine learning is your  
thing, come on over and lend a hand!

Cheers,
Grant Ingersoll
