Hi Boris,

Readers are never stored, so I don't believe you can do it that way.   
Of course, you can always read the values into a String and then  
access the appropriate String based constructor.

Storage is a separate mechanism from indexing, so my _guess_ is that  
if you want Readers to be stored, it would result in having to use  
the Reader twice (once for indexing and once for storage), which  
isn't possible, I don't believe, since not all Readers support the  
mark() and reset() functionality.  Besides, you will get better  
performance reading once...
