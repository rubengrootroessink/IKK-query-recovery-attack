Sure, why not try it?  Is it not working?

Instead of telling you the answer, I'm going to suggest you add:

System.out.println("Query: " + q);

after each of the parses and take a look at what gets printed.  That  
should tell you what you need to know.

You should have documents that contain the two words, plus the phrase.

I guess the question back is, do you know you have those documents and  
are not getting results?

Or, are you asking how to submit and run the query?  If that is the  
case, have a look at http://www.lucidimagination.com/Community/Hear-from-the-Experts/Articles/Getting-Started-with-Lucene/
