DATE: 9 Oct 2006

Hi Michael,

I think there are a number of good resources on this:

1.  http://lucene.apache.org/java/scoring.html covers the basics of  
searching.  The bottom has some pseudo code as well.

2. Lucene In Action

3.  Search this list and other places for information on the Vector  
Space Model.  The Wiki also has a number of links, etc. that may  
prove useful, including a variety of talks and articles.

4.  Last of all, and probably best of all, the code!  Have a look at  
how TermQuery and BooleanQuery work, as well as the Searchers, etc.

Hope this helps,
Grant
