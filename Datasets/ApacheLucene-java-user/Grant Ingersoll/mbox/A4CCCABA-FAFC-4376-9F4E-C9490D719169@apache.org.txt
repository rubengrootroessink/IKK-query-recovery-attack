I think if you are using bigrams, then you would only match on one,  
but if you do the prefix/wildard approach you could match on either.   
I'm not sure if you will be able to pull off doing the individual term  
boosting and the bigrams.  You will likely need to write your own  
Query classes to do that.

If you don't mind me asking, what is the problem you are trying to  
solve?  I know the solution you want (I think, namely boosted bigrams  
of some sort), but I'm still clueless on the problem and I think that  
is really hindering me helping.  It sounds like it is some type of co- 
occurrence problem, but I'm not sure.  Is there a bigger category that  
what you are doing fits in?  If you can't say, that is fine, too.  It  
may be some proprietary thing.
