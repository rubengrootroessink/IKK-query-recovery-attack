Can you share some code here?  What's the reasoning behind using it  
(not saying it's wrong, just wondering what led you to it)?  Are you  
just loading it up from a file, string or something or do you have  
another reason?

By exactly the same, do you really mean exactly the same?  What's the  
point of that?  What are the "querying reasons"?

You may want to look at the TeeTokenFilter and the SinkTokenizer, but  
I guess I'd like to know more about what's going on before fully  
recommending anything.
