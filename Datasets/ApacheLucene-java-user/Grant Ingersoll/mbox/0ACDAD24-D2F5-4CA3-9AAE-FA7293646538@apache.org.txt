I believe these lists exists out on the Internet, just google for  
something like "most common first names" or "common  
nicknames" (yields: http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~trobb/nicklist.html  
for instance)

If you want to dig deeper, you might look into named entity  
recognition research, and also co-reference resolution research, as  
those problems often have to deal with this problem.

HTH,
