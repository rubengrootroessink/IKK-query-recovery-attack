Lucene does not provide this out of the box.  You will have to write a 
program to do it and feed the results to Lucene. 

If I remember right, these files are in XML, so you can probably use SAX 
or a pull parser. 

I think a number of TREC participants, in the past, have used Lucene, so 
you may be able to find someone on the web who is generous enough to 
have shared their implementation.
