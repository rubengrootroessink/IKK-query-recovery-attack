Do you know which subqueries this should happen for or is it just any  
three subqueries out of X number of queries?  And how do you know it  
showed up in the three queries?  Are you running the queries separately?

Could you provide an example or two of your queries?

Sounds that way to me, but maybe if you got creative you could create  
your own Query, but don't hold me to that.  Do try to fill us in with  
more info on what you are doing, as there might still be a solution  
out there...
