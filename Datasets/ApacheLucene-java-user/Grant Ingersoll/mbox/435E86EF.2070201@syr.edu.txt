 From what I can see, you are only passing volume.xml to your parser.  
If I understand your code and questions correctly, the Volume file 
simply points to the actual articles that you want to parse.  Seems like 
you need to parse the Volume file, get the name/location of the article 
file and then parse that for entry in Lucene.  Or am I mistaken?  What 
does the volume file look like?

in the field of history do not always present the work of the authors themselves (though we
welcome pioneers to give us their own stories, as in the case of the 1935 article by John
McPherson in this issue); thus, answering the question &ldquo;is it accurate?&rdquo;
is not always easy. In fact, we ask our referees to answer the following questions about each
manuscript, and their responses determine whether we accept the manuscript &ldquo;as is&rdquo;
or whether we ask the author(s) to revise the material:</p>
