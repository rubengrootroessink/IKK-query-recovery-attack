DATE: 27 Aug 2008

See http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BackwardsCompatibility

Generally speaking 3.0 will be the same as 2.9 minus the deprecated  
methods (and, in this case, the upgrade to JDK 1.5).  That is not to  
say that the file formats, etc. under the hood won't change and that  
there won't be new methods and capabilities (there certainly will be,  
otherwise what's the point?).  For instance, we have _DISCUSSED_  
changing Document/Fieldable into two separate concerns based on index  
time use and search time use.  This has not been committed to, though.
