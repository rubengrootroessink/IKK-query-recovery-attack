Don't have experience with those particular languages, but I can tell you that dealing with
UNICODE is just a matter of making sure you read in the input using the correct encoding.
 Java will take care of the rest.  If you are using a Reader for your Field, you probably
have to do something like:

new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file), "UTF-8")

assuming your files are stored in UTF-8.  If they are a different encoding, then you will
have to pass that in place of UTF-8.

I would do a google search for stemmers and tokenizers for the languages you are interested
in.  I also believe someone had a "generic" stemmer that performed very well.  I believe they
posted to this list a week or so ago w/ a topic of "Writing a stemmer" or something along
those lines.
