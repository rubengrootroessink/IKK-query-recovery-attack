SUBJECT: Re: How about adding a new paramer  to  Similarity.scorePayload( ) ?
DATE: 24 Jun 2008

Not sure, but would a CustomScoreQuery (or an extension of it) work  
for you?  This way, you could try to combine the BoostingTermQuery  
with a ValueSourceQuery (i.e. FunctionQuery)

Another option is to just extend BoostingTermQuery and implement your  
own scorer that takes into account the field.

Of course, that isn't to say your idea is wrong.  We could add the  
method and add a new Payload Query that calls it, or just change it  
all together.  Of course, things may change, too, if and when we want  
to do things like add payload phrase queries.  A patch would be good.

Just trying to brainstorm some alternatives that don't involve API  
changes.
