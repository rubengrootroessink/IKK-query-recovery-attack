SUBJECT: Re: concise definition of Lucene score?
DATE: 3 Sep 2008

What's not concise about a complex math formula?  :-)

The basic Term Vector approach to IR, that Lucene more or less  
implements, says that the score for a document given a query is the  
cosine of the angle formed between the query vector and the document  
vector.

I like to draw a standard x-y axis graph and then draw two vectors,  
one being the query and the other the document and then draw in the  
angle between them (w/ their tails at the same point).  The score is  
the cosine of that angle (more or less).  That is usually sufficient  
for "most people".  People who like math can read the formula.
