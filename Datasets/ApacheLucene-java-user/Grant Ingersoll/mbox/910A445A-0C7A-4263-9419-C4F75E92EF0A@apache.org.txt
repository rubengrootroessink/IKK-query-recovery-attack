Not without some extra work.  This kind of thing requires post (or  
pre) processing.  You can use SpanQuery to know where in a document  
you matched, and then do the sentence calculations.  Another option is  
to index each sentence as a separate document and then post process to  
combine.

If you search the archives on this list and java-dev you'll see  
several discussions on the topic.   See:

and
