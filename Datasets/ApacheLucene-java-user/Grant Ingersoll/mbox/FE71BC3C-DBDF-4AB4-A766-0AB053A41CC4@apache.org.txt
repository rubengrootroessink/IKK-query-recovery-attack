I will try to take a crack at these, but not sure I know exactly what  
you are looking for, so maybe others can chime in too.

At any rate, MultiSearcher has been around a lot longer (2001 versus  
2004, or at least that is what the changelog seems to indicate) and  
it works over Searchables, including RemoteSearchable.  So you could  
use it to combine results from remote searches as well, MultiReader  
can only work over IndexReaders and I am not aware of any way that it  
can do remote index reading, so there are different viable use cases  
for the two.

I suppose subDoc might make sense, but subSearcher does not for a  
Reader.  Perhaps the private readerIndex() method on MultiReader is  
something you are interested in?  Is that getting at what you want?   
Maybe you can submit a patch that makes readerIndex public if that is  
what you are interested in?


Hope this helps,
Grant
