SUBJECT: Re: where is the proper place to report lucene bugs?
DATE: 12 Jan 2007

 From the resources section of the website, the Issue Tracking link  
is: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE

Also, it is helpful if you have done a preliminary search on the  
topic and some reasonable investigation to confirm that it is in fact  
a bug.  If your not sure, please ask on this list.
