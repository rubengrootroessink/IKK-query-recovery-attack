This is likely one of the many subtleties of the Porter stemmer.  Dr.  
Porter has chosen a particular way of doing things, but it isn't  
necessarily right for everyone.  You really have to measure the net  
benefit across all your searches, not specifically just one.  If you  
can't live with this particular case, you can implement a protected  
words approach or try some other stemmers.

If you go to the snowball site and peruse their archives you will find  
much discussion of these kinds of issues.

Sorry I can't offer more in terms of a solution.
