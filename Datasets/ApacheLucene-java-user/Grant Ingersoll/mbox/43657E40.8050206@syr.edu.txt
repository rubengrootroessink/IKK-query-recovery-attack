Actually, I was thinking of writing something along the lines of 
Span*BoundaryQuery where it would be more explicit than what was 
described below.  You could say SpanSentence and say you want the terms 
to occur w/in two sentences.  Do you guys think it is worthwhile to 
codify what is discussed below into a few convenience Span queries, or 
maybe we should just write it up better and put on the wiki or something...

Any preference?
