Why does what I suggested require instantiating a new writer for every  
document?  It uses the analyzer you pass in w/ the method:

IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, defaultAnalyzer,....)

while adding docs
    Document doc = ...
    Analyzer analyzer = getAnalyzer(language)
    writer.addDocument(doc, analyzer)

writer.close()
