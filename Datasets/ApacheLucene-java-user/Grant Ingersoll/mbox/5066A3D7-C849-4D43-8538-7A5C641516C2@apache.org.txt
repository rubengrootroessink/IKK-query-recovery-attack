SUBJECT: Re: Use case for term vector's token position/offset?
DATE: 21 Nov 2006

Hi Jong,

I think these are useful for things like highlighting (I think  
contrib/highlighter can use them); other post processing algorithms  
such as: question answering, calculating co-occurrences (find the 6  
terms to the left and right of the term at position 16).  Perhaps you  
want to give higher scores to documents where your terms occur in a  
certain part of the document (like the beginning)

Really, any application where you need to know the relationships  
between the terms in a document or the document and the original.

HTH,
Grant
