SUBJECT: Re: adding term information to Index
DATE: 9 Jun 2006

Hi Patricio,

As of now, I don't think this is possible.  However, we are slowly but 
surely working on similar problems.  Please feel free to add your two 
cents to http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/FlexibleIndexing as we 
are considering several new ideas related to making indexing more 
flexible. 

For now, I guess you need to store them elsewhere. Or, if you have 
thoughts on what to do you could come up w/ an implementation and submit 
a patch.
