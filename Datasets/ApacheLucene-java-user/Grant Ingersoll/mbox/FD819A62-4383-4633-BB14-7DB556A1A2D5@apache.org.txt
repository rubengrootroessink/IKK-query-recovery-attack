Not exactly, Term Vectors only could tell you how many times foo  
occurs in a particular, known document.  If you are looking for  
general information on a Term and the documents it occurs in (i.e.  
the inverted index) have a look at the TermEnum and TermDocs.

No, you only could find out about doc 0 or doc 2 separately using  
TermVectors.
