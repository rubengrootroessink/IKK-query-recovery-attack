With new advances in the flexibility and customizability of Apache Lucene/Solr open source
search, the ubiquity of location-aware devices and vast amounts of spatial data, tremendous
opportunities open up to deliver more powerful and effective geo-aware search results.
 
We'll hear from Grant Ingersoll, co-founder of Lucid Imagination and chairman of the Apache
Lucene PMC, for an in-depth technical workshop on the potential and application of the newly
released Lucene and Solr geo-search functions. Grant will be joined by thought leaders: Ryan
McKinley, co-founder of Voyager GIS and Apache Lucene PMC member; and Sameer Maggon, of AT&T
Interactive, which manages and delivers online and mobile advertising products across AT&T's
media platforms.
