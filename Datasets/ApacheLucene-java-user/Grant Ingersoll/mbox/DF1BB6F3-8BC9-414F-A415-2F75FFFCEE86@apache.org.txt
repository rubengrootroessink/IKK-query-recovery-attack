SUBJECT: Re: Using Lucene for Moderate Similarity Check..
DATE: 9 Jun 2009

Hi Ravi,

Lucene can enable this, but you will have some work to do on top of  
it.  If you search the archives for record linkage (http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/?q=record+linkage

) you will find a fair amount of discussion on this.  Also, in  
somewhat shameless marketing mode, my co-author, Tom Morton, is just  
putting the finishing touches on a chapter in our book called Taming  
Text (http://www.manning.com/ingersoll) which discusses some of the  
techniques involved in making this stuff happen.  That chapter should  
be released in the next few weeks.

You likely can get a basic system working pretty quickly with what is  
in Lucene, but then the next level is often more difficult.  You often  
end up with a rules system that can become brittle with this  
approach.  An alternative is to apply some type of machine learning  
approach.  You could also look at this as a clustering problem, which  
Mahout (or other clustering tools) could be helpful in solving.

Finally, just know there will be a human in the loop with any  
approach.  The goal is to minimize the number of matches that a person  
has to check.

Hope this helps,
Grant
