Agreed, but probably not too different from manipulating the arrays.

I was thinking something along the lines of (really thinking out loud  
here)
IndexReader.getTermFreqVector(int docid, String fieldName,  
TermVectorLoader tvl)

where TermVectorLoader is an interface that has something like:

void loadTermVector(String term, int frequency, int offset, int  
position);

Then, you could implement this however you wanted.  We could provide  
an initial implementation that is backed by a SortedMap.
