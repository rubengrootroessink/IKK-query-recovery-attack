Is there anyone out there using the GData implementation in Lucene?  
(under the contrib module)

If so, please let us know, as we are considering archiving it and not  
including it future releases of Lucene (we won't throw it away), per https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1055

.

Thanks,
Grant Ingersoll
