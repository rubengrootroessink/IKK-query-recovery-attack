SUBJECT: Re: bzr branches for Apache Lucene/Nutch/Solr/Hadoop at Launchpad
DATE: 22 Mar 2007

Nice idea and I can see the benefit of it to you and I don't mean to  
be a wet blanket on it, I just wonder about the legality of it.   
People may find it and think it is the official Apache Lucene, since  
it is branded that way.  I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know for sure.   
I think you have the right to store and use the code, even create a  
whole other search product based solely on Lucene (I think), I just  
don't know about this kind of thing.  In some sense it is like  
mirroring, but that fact that you can commit w/ out going through the  
Apache process makes me think that others coming upon the code will  
be mislead about what's in it.  The site _definitely_ makes it look  
like Launchpad is the home for Lucene with the intro and the bug  
tracking, etc, even though we all know this site will rank further  
down in the SERPs than the main site.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding?
