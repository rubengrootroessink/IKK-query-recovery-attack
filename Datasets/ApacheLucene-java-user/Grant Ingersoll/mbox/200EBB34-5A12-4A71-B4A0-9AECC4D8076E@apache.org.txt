Depends on whether you want fuzzy matches on Customer or not.   
Assuming this value contains things like first and last name, I would  
think you would want to tokenize so that you can search for those  
separately.  If it truly contains something that is a single token,  
then this should be fine.  You only need to Store items if you want to  
recover the value afterward for display or something like that.
