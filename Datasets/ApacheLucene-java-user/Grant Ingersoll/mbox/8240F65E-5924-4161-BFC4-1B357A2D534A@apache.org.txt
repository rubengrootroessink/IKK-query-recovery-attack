SUBJECT: Re: Field.lazy setter method?
DATE: 4 Apr 2007

Lazy loading is handled through the FieldSelector interface on  
IndexReader.doc() and some variations.  There is nothing special that  
need be done during indexing to mark a field as lazy.  The isLazy  
method merely lets you know later, after loading a Document, if the  
field is, indeed, lazy.  One caveat, lazy fields become undefined if  
the underlying IndexReader is closed before accessing the field.   
Once a lazy field is loaded, however, this is no longer an issue, as  
the field value stays in memory.
