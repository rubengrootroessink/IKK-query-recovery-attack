SUBJECT: Re: Term Frequency vector consumes memory
DATE: 30 Jun 2009

In Lucene, a Term Vector is a specific thing that is stored on disk  
when creating a Document and Field.  It is optional and off by  
default.  It is separate from being able to get the term frequencies  
for all the docs in a specific field.  The former is decided at  
indexing time and there is no way to remove it w/o reindexing.   
Furthermore, it is not loaded into memory by the IndexReader.  Term  
Frequencies are accessed via the TermDocs.

Can you clarify a bit more what you are looking to do?  Perhaps some  
sample code will help demonstrate what you'd like to turn off, as I am  
not clear on your question.

Cheers,
Grant
