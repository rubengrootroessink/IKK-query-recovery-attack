SUBJECT: Re: making hudson available on port 80
DATE: 5 Jul 2007

I know this doesn't completely solve your problem, but if you are  
dealing with a specific release, as opposed to a nightly build, you  
can see the javadocs for a specific build by choosing the specific  
version of Lucene you are working on under the "Site Versions" menu  
on the left hand menu of the main Lucene Java page.  From there, you  
can get to javadocs for a specific version.
