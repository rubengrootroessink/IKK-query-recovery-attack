See the Similarity.coord() method.

/** Computes a score factor based on the fraction of all query terms  
that a
    * document contains.  This value is multiplied into scores.
    *
    * <p>The presence of a large portion of the query terms indicates  
a better
    * match with the query, so implementations of this method usually  
return
    * larger values when the ratio between these parameters is large  
and smaller
    * values when the ratio between them is small.
    *
    * @param overlap the number of query terms matched in the document
    * @param maxOverlap the total number of terms in the query
    * @return a score factor based on term overlap with the query
    */
   public abstract float coord(int overlap, int maxOverlap);

Cheers,
Grant
