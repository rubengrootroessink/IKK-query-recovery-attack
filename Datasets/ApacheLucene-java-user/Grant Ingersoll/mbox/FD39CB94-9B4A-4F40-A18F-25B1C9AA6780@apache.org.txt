Your best bet is to look into the explanations of each of these  
documents in the context of your query via the explain() method on the  
Searcher (IndexSearcher).  If I had to venture a guess, the docs w/  
only one term have a higher TF/IDF value (I would even venture to  
guess that they contain the word "transference" and not "bank").  It  
is also entirely possible that those docs are shorter or have a boost  
value.  The explain method should tell you why.

For a broader view of how to debug ranking issues, you might find http://www.lucidimagination.com/Community/Hear-from-the-Experts/Articles/Debugging-Relevance-Issues-Search

  to be helpful.
