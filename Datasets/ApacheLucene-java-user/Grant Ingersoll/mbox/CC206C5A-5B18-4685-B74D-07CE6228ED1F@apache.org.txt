(sorry for the miss post yesterday, this is what should have been sent)

Registration is now open for Apache Lucene EuroCon - Prague, Czech Republic, 18-21 May, 2010.
To sign up, please visit: http://lucene-eurocon.org/register.html. Sponsored by Lucid Imagination;
all net proceeds benefit the Apache Software Foundation.

Come join us as we explore Lucene and Solr in-depth, including keynotes, user talks, audience
interaction, and training. Meet other members of the community, and learn from their experience.
See solutions from ecosystem partners. Get answers to your questions - and tips & tricks
to help with your projects. 

Oh, and did we mention that the Czech Beer Festival is also happening that week?

Early Registration for the conference starts at â‚¬395 and runs until April 18, so sign up
soon.

Two-day Solr and Lucene Bootcamps will be held on 18-19 May. These will be in-depth, hands-on
classes targeted at developers who want to build Lucene and Solr-based search applications.
The two day tutorials will cover key concepts, along with code examples, documentation and
resources - and will help solve most common search application problems. Participants will
gain practical hands-on experience with Lucene & Solr and the know-how to develop killer
search code.

Lastly, a reminder: the Call for Participation is still open, accepting submissions until
April 13th. 

Hope to see you there!
