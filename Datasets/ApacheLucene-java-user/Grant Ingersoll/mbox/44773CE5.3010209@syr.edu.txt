It seems odd to me that if you are using the CFS format, why you would 
have the .fdt, .frq and .prx files in addition to the .cfs files.  My 
understanding is all files (except deletable and segment) get put inside 
of the CFS file.  Looking at my indices, I only have the CFS file.  Are 
you optimizing your indices after you are done indexing?  Are you 
turning off compound file format?

Can you try a smaller sample in a clean directory and see what size it 
is (so that it doesn't take as long to index)?
