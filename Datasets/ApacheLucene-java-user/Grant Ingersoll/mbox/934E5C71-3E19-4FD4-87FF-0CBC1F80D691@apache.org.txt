SUBJECT: Re: an alternative to optimize?
DATE: 1 Dec 2006

Are the search statistics the same for the MultiReader?  That is,  
would a search on a MultiReader over several small indexes  
necessarily return the same ranking as a single IndexReader on an  
optimized reader?  Would they return the same actual scores?

Just curious, I haven't tried MultiReader, but the code seems like it  
should, at least based on my quick glance at it.
