Interesting.

This stuff is all done in the Scorer for a specific query (see TermQuery/TermScorer for an
example).  

Just thinking out loud here, but I think you will need to write your own Query to do this.
I'm not entirely certain on what that means for you, though.  Seems like a FunctionQuery might
help, too.   Seems like, just possibly, Lucene is a bit of overkill here other than using
it to get IDF values.  Can't you just create a big matrix (maybe w/ Hadoop and HBase or something
similar) of your precomputed similarities and then just lookups on the document?
