SUBJECT: Re: Looking for a way to customize how StandardAnalyzer handles punctuation
DATE: 11 Dec 2008

Let's take a quick step back and see if it helps.  Why do you feel you  
need the StandardAnalyzer to solve your problem?  What else are you  
gaining from it?  Would you be better served by a WhitespaceTokenizer?

That being said, hacking up the grammar isn't as bad as you might  
think.  There are actually two examples of the "grammar" in Lucene,  
one is the StdTokenizer and the other is the WikipediaTokenizer.  They  
are similar, but maybe by looking at two examples it might also help.
