Anyone have any recommendations on a decent, open (doesn't have to be  
Apache license, but would prefer non-GPL if possible), extractor for  
MS Exchange and/or PST files?  The Zoe link on the FAQ [1] seems dead.

For mbox, I think mstor will suffice for me and I think tropo (from  
the FAQ should work for IMAP).  Does anyone have experience with  
http://aperture.sourceforge.net/
