You might also be interested in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ 
LUCENE-755 (aka the Payloads patch) which will enable storing  
information at the token level and allow for plugging in more scoring  
options related to it.

There has been a variety of discussions over on java-dev related to  
topics that would enable things like PageRank, etc. at a lower level  
in Lucene.  Search java-dev for "Flexible Indexing", "Payloads", etc.

You will also find additional Lucene scoring information at http:// 
lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html
