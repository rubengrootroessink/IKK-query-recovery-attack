Yes.  Basically, you should index/query w/o stopwords and then you can  
issue a phrase query for "a ball" without any slop.  You could also  
try ngraming the words, such that you produce tokens like "a_ball",  
"the_ball" etc.  Just make sure your index time analysis matches up w/  
your query time analysis.  There are ngram Analyzers in the Lucene  
contrib/analyzer package.
