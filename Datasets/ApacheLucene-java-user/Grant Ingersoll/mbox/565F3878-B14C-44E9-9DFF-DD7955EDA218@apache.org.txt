A quick search (http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/?q=snowball+back+compatibility 
) yields that Snowball was updated in LUCENE-1142 (http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1142

) and that we discussed a little bit about back compatibility with  
regards to contrib.

In all likelihood, the change is actually due to the Snowball project  
changing how it stems those particular words.  In which case, you  
could take it up w/ them, but it will come down to whether they view  
it as a bug (in which case it will be fixed) or whether they think it  
is the correct choice to make for most situations.
