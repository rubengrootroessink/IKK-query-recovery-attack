SUBJECT: Re: Strategy for date based searching and indexing
DATE: 19 Aug 2007

Have a look at the DateTools utility class.   Also, the Wiki has some  
HOWTOs on Dates: http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/HowTo

Search this archive for Date handling, plus I believe the Lucene In  
Action book covers dates as well, although it might be a bit dated.

Lucene also comes with sort functionality that can handle dates.   
Have a look at the search API methods that pass in a Sort object.
