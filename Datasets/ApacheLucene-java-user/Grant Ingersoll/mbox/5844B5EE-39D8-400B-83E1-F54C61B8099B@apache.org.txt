> he Travel Assistance Committee is now taking in applications for those
> wanting to attend ApacheCon North America (NA) 2010, which is taking place
> between the 1st and 5th November in Atlanta.
> 
> The Travel Assistance Committee is looking for people who would like to be
> able to attend ApacheCon, but who need some financial support in order to be
> able to get there. There are limited places available, and all applications
> will be scored on their individual merit.
> 
> Financial assistance is available to cover travel to the event, either in
> part or in full, depending on circumstances. However, the support available
> for those attending only the barcamp is smaller than that for people
> attending the whole event. The Travel Assistance Committee aims to support
> all ApacheCons, and cross-project events, and so it may be prudent for those
> in Asia and the EU to wait for an event closer to them.
> 
> More information can be found on the main Apache website at
> http://www.apache.org/travel/index.html - where you will also find a link to
> the online application and details for submitting.
> 
> Applications for applying for travel assistance are now being accepted, and
> will close on the 7th July 2010.
> 
> Good luck to all those that will apply.

> You are welcome to tweet, blog this as appropriate.
