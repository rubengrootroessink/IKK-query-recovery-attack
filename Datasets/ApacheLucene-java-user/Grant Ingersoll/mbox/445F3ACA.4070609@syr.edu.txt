SUBJECT: Re: Subject indexing and seraching documents with multiple languages
DATE: 8 May 2006

We wrote our own MultiSearcher type class that manages this problem.  It 
takes in a query in the user's native language and then feeds it to the 
searcher for that language, which uses a machine translation component 
to create a query for that index using that language's Analyzer.
