Bob - Andy provided thorough information on the StandardAnalyzer  
issue (in short, it deals with Unicode directly not encodings).  As  
for the Lucene demo - you will have to adjust it to read the files in 

the proper encoding.  The IndexFiles program indexes files using the  
default encoding which won't be sufficient for your purpose.  The two 

files to check are HtmlDocument and FileDocument.  These files read  
the HTML and text files that the demo indexes.
