Seems reasonable to me, but I guess I wonder what kind of control you  
have that you don't in Nutch?  Maybe worth asking on Nutch.  Also, it  
is fairly easy in Nutch to separate the crawling aspect from the  
indexing aspect, such that you could use all of Nutch's power for  
crawling and extracting content, and then index in Lucene or Solr on  
your own.
