SUBJECT: Fieldable anyone?
DATE: 30 Jul 2008

Is there anyone out there that actually implements their own Fieldable  
instance?  Just curious, as we are thinking of making some changes to  
it, but it would (very slightly) break our fairly strict back- 
compatibility rules (http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BackwardsCompatibility 
) so I would like to get a feel for the "damage".  I suspect it is  
quite small.

Thanks,
Grant
