Lucene In Action is a great book, but you can also have a look at  
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html for more info on  
scoring and how to change the similarity and other details of  
scoring. Also, search the archives for things you are interested in,  
there is a lot of information stored there.

As for JavaCC, not sure what you are looking for there.  The site at  
https://javacc.dev.java.net/ looks fine to me.
