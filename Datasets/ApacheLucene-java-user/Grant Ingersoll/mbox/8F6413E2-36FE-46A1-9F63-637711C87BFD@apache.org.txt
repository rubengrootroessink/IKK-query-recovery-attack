Hi All, (sorry for the cross-post)

For those in NYC, there will be a Lucene ecosystem (Lucene/Solr/Mahout/ 
Nutch/Tika/Droids/Lucene ports) Meetup on July 22, hosted by MTV  
Networks and co-sponsored with Lucid Imagination.

For more info and to RSVP, see http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Apache-Lucene-Solr-Meetup/ 
.  There is limited seating, so get your spot early.   Note, you must  
register with your first and last name so that security badges can be  
printed ahead of time for access.

Cheers,
Grant
