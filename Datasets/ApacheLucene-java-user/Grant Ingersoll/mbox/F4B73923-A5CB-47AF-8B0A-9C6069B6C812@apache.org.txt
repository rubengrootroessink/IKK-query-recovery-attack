I'd also add that the Document keeps a pointer to the spot in storage where that value can
be loaded from.  It can result in a performance saving in the typical search use case where
one is displaying just "metadata" fields on a page, but not the full content.  In this case,
the full content page is loaded lazily while the smaller metadata fields are loaded as usual.
