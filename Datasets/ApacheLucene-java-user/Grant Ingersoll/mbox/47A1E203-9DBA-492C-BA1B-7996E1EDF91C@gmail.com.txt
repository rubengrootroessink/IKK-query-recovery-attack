Have you used Luke to see what is actually in the index?  Or written  
some test cases for your analyzer to know that the appropriate tokens  
are coming out of your analyzer?

Also, could you give more details about the filters you are using?  I  
am not familiar w/ ExactTokensConstructorFilter, etc.

The formatting is a little hard to read, but I think it says you are  
passing the ArabicStemmer to the SnowballFilter, correct?  I assume  
you are dealing w/ mixed content, correct?  That is, you have Arabic  
and English in the same token stream? I know when I was working on  
our Arabic/English project, we had to be careful about mixed content  
like this.
