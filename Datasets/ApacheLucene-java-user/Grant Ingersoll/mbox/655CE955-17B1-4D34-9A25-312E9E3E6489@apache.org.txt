Since all our dynamically named fields are of the same type, it isn't  
an issue for us at the moment.  Then again, though, we only have in- 
house users and don't have the same issue that you have.

It doesn't happen.  The tags are based on the output of some other  
processes and are unique and the tag/field name has semantics  
attached to it that is meaningful to the application.  I suppose,  
technically, they are known ahead of time, but there are potentially  
hundreds of them such that it doesn't make sense to populate them  
into our Field schema ahead of time as maintenance would be a nightmare.
