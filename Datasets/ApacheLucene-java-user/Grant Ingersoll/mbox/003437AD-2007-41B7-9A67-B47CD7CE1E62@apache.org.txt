Not sure I am understanding what you are asking, but I will give it a  
shot.   See below

Are you wondering if there is a way to score all documents regardless  
of whether the document has the term or not?  I don't quite get your  
statement: "In that model, “tf” is multiplied with Idf for all terms  
in the index, but in Lucene “tf” is calculated only for terms in the  
given Query."

Isn't the result for those documents that don't have query terms just  
going to be 0 or am I not fully understanding?  I briefly skimmed the  
paper you cite and it doesn't seem that different, it's just  
describing the Salton's VSM right?

In the end, you may need to implement some lower level Query classes,  
but I still don't fully understand what you are trying to do, so I  
wouldn't head down that path just yet.
