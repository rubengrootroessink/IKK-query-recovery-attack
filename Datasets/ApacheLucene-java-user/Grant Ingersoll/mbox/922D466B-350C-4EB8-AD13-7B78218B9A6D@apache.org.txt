SUBJECT: Re: Multi -threaded indexing of large number of PDF documents
DATE: 23 Oct 2008

Can you describe your process a bit more?  Are you measuring just the  
Lucene part or the whole ingestion part as well?  If it's the latter,  
how do you know the issue is in Lucene?  PDF extraction is annoying at  
best and highly problematic at its worst.  Not saying it isn't Lucene,  
but I've seen PDFBox and other extractors fail a lot more than I've  
seen Lucene fail.

Are there any exceptions that you are seeing anywhere in your log files?

If you do have extraction as part of the process, what happens if you  
separate out extraction from indexing?   Does it fail when you just  
index raw text in this manner?

Cheers,
Grant
