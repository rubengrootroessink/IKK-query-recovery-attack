Not sure about WordExtractor, does it also take a Reader?  I would try:

Reader input = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file),  
"ENCODING");
WordExtractor extractor = new WordExtractor(input);
content = extractor.getText();

Note: ENCODING is whatever encoding the file is in, as in "UTF-8", if  
that is what your files are in.  If you don't know the encoding, you  
will need to add in some type of character encoding detection tool.   
Search the web for that, as I know there are some out there (I don't  
know any names off hand).

Bottom line, it sounds like you need to figure out how to load your  
files based on their encoding.  That problem is not really core to  
Lucene, but you should be able to search the archives here to find  
others with similar questions.
