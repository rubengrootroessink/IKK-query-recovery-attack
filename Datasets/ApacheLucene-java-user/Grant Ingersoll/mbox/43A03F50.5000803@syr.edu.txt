I have successfully used term vectors for both the TREC English and 
Arabic collections.  Take a look at the code I posted at 
http://www.cnlp.org/apachecon2005 or Erik and Otis' book, "Lucene In 
Action", which both have good examples of term vectors.  Perhaps there 
is something with how you are creating your fields.
