Hmmm, something doesn't sound quite right.  You have 10 million docs,  
split into 5 or so indexes, right?  And each sub index is 150  
gigabytes?  How big are your documents?

Can you provide more info about what your Directory and IndexWriter  
settings are?  What version of Lucene are you using?  What are your  
Field settings?  Are you storing info?  What about Term Vectors?

Can you explain more about your documents, etc?  10 million doesn't  
sound like it would need to be split up that much, if at all,  
depending on your hardware.

The wiki has some excellent resources on improving both indexing and  
search speed.
