SUBJECT: Re: updating payloads
DATE: 2 Jan 2009

I don't think there is any API support for this, but in theory it is  
possible, as long as you aren't changing the size.  It sounds like it  
could work for you since you just plan to do it offline after indexing  
and presumably you don't have anything else going on, right?  I think  
hacking it is the only way for now.  Someone else might have a better  
idea, but I confess I haven't thought too much about it.
