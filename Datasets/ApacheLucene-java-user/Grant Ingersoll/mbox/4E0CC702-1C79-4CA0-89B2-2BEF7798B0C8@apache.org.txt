http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/IndexingOtherLanguages is slightly  
out of date, but still has some tips.  You may also want to consider  
starting with Solr, as it has many features a search engine needs.

In the past, I have written Arabic Analyzers for Lucene (sorry, can't  
share them) but I can tell you that you can also find some by  
searching for it on Google.

And, as Karl said, the "Lucene In Action" book is excellent, even if  
it is a bit out of date.  Most of the concepts still apply.
