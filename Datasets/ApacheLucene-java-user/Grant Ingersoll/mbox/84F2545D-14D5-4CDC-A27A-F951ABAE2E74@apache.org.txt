I'm curious, can you elaborate more on the deeper use case for this?

Perhaps just implementing faceting on doc type would be sufficient?   
That way users can drill in on doc type.  Alternatively, I suppose you  
could implement a hit collector that accesses a field cache on the doc  
type field and promotes lesser seen doc types until they are evenly  
represented.  Could also likely write a Function query that does a  
similar thing.  I'd imagine you need to be careful to control your  
memory.
