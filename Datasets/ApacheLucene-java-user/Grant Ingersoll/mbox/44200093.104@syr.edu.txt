I am not sure why you are getting all 60k docs at a time.  If you use 
the Hits object, it caches the top 50 or so, but doesn't retrieve all 
the documents at once.

Also, what are the size of your fields and how many fields do you have 
per document? 

Have you done any profiling to find the bottlenecks?  An index size of 
50mb is actually pretty small for Lucene, perhaps you can share more 
about your setup.
