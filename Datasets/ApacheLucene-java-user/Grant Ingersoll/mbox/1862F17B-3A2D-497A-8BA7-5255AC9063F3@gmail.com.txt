nearly 150 Top-Level Projects and new initiatives in the Apache Incubator and Labs. This year's
ApacheCon celebrates how Apache technologies have sparked creativity, challenged processes,
streamlined development, improved collaboration, launched businesses, bolstered economies,
and improved lives.

developers and users-- are responsible for the success and popularity of our products.
