And what field(s) should "xyz" be searched against?  Again, I ask, how  
do you know what fields "xyz" should go against and why does abc go  
against the default_field?  You've said it shouldn't go against all  
fields (b/c there are thousands of them), and you've said it shouldn't  
go against a catch-all field, but otherwise I still have no clue your  
criteria for what fields xyz should search.  Are you saying that you  
want it to intelligently know that when "xyz" comes in that it should  
search the organization field?

Other than seconding Umesh's or Dino's suggestions of using machine  
learning or heuristics or using some type of templating system, I'm  
not sure what else to offer.  You might look at Solr's Dismax Query  
Parser, which allows you to specify the field structure of queries in  
a multi-field way, but again, I doubt that is wholly what you are  
looking for.
