Have a look at http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/ 
38880?search_string=compression;#38880

The upshot is that you should compress the data yourself and then  
store it as a binary field (Field Constructor: public Field(String  
name, byte[] value, Store store)   ).  This way you can choose  
whatever compression model you think is best.  I guess I would start  
by trying the zip functionality in Java to see if it gives you the  
level of compression you desire and then go from there.
