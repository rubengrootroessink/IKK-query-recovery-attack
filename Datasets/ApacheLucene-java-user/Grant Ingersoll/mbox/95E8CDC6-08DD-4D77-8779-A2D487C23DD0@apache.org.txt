Has anyone thought about integrating the contrib/benchmark Quality  
stuff into the "algorithm" framework that's used for timings, etc.?   
For instance, I would like to write an algorithm file where my rounds  
consist of doing various runs with different similarities all on the  
same index.

It would probably need a new Task for setting the similarity (and the  
ability to modify the index using the setNorms functionality).  Anyone  
else (Doron :-)  ) have any thoughts on going about this?
