SUBJECT: Re: lucene 3.0 feature list?
DATE: 28 Aug 2008

We haven't even begun working on 3.0 other than the planning to say it  
will be on JDK 1.5.  There may be a few tickets in JIRA that are  
marked as 3.0, though, but that doesn't even mean they will make it.   
And, the API will not necessarily be 2.4 compatible.  That is not in  
our back compat. requirements.  Having said that, we try to make  
upgrades as painless as possible, but for major releases, we reserve  
the right to change things more so than minor releases.
