One other thing to note, you can definitely see Lucene in action (or  
Nutch, that is) by clicking on the score returned for a given document  
(try searching for Lucene) and you see, in all it's glory, the Lucene  
explain results...  It even displays the Nutch logo, which makes me  
wonder if they are misusing an ASF trademark (but, IANAL, so I don't  
know) since they don't state that Nutch is a trademark of the ASF.   
But, that is a discussion for somewhere else...
