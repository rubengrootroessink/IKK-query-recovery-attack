Yeah, unfortunately, they are two distinct things, completely  
unrelated in terms of storage, access, etc.  I've often felt the  
access to position/offset information is hard in Lucene, which makes  
it harder to do things like highlighting, co-occurrence analysis, etc.

LUCENE-1001 (which Mark Miller has revived a bit after I lost time on  
it: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1001) is one step  
towards remedying this.  By using Span Queries and (a working  
version)  of that patch, one should be able to get at payload info  
related to the matches.  Still not perfect, but better.

Purely wondering out loud here, but it may be possible to use the  
TermVectorMapper in conjunction with TermPositions to correlate the  
too, but I am not sure.  The tricky part is you somehow need to  
optimize access to the TermPositions.

Another thought is to add payloads storage to TermVectors.  Now we  
have offsets and positions, it's conceivable to also store payloads in  
a doc. centric way.  The tradeoff being more storage space required.   
Still, if it's what you need, then it's what you need.
