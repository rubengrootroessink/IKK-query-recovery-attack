You can use the explain() method or you can use the Highlighter, but  
both aren't perfect in this regards.  You can also look into using  
SpanQueries, which give you positional information about where matches  
take place.  This would require you switching how you generate queries.

There is also a lot of discussion in the archives on this at http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/p:lucene?q=field+match

  and probably with other queries as well.
