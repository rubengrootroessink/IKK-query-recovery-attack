DATE: 16 May 2008

Do you want search result clustering or document clustering?  My  
understanding of Carrot2 is it isn't designed for the latter.  The  
difference being it is designed to work off of shorter snippets of  
text, as opposed to the whole document.  FWIW, you _might_ find some  
help over on the Mahout project (http://lucene.apache.org/mahout) in  
terms of different approaches.  We have a couple of clustering  
approaches implemented there, but they just work off a matrix and it  
is up to you to fill the matrix (presumably with some distance  
calculation.)  The Carrot2 list may also help clarify if it is the  
appropriate place.
