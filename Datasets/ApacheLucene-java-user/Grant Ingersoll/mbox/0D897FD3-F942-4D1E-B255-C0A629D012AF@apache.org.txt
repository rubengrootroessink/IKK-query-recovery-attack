No, I think I was thinking along the lines of the SynonymAnalyzer in  
Lucene In Action whereby you add the nicknames as tokens at the same  
position as the original, that way searches on the nicknames would  
still match.  Don't know that it solves your need for "weight" in the  
relevance, but maybe it would.
