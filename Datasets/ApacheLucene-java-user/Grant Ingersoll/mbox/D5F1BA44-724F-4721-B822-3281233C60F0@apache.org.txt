SUBJECT: Re: How to build your custom termfreq vector an add it to the field ?
DATE: 6 Nov 2007

My guess is you want to look into the Scorer implementations.  I am  
not sure Lucene's term vector storage is needed, you could just store  
the terms as they always are and implement your own Query/Weigh/Scorer  
combo that ignores TF and uses your new approach.

See http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html for more info.

Otherwise, if you really want to use the TermVectors just for scoring,  
you may find the TermVectorMapper addition on the trunk to be useful  
for extracting the info you want.

Might be able to offer more suggestions if you can provide more detail  
about what you are trying to do.

HTH,
Grant
