Hi Tim,

 From the StandardAnalyzer code, the TokenStream looks like:

/** Constructs a {@link StandardTokenizer} filtered by a {@link
   StandardFilter}, a {@link LowerCaseFilter} and a {@link  
StopFilter}. */
   public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
     TokenStream result = new StandardTokenizer(reader);
     result = new StandardFilter(result);
     result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);
     result = new StopFilter(result, stopSet);
     return result;
   }

Whereas StopAnalyzer looks like:
/** Filters LowerCaseTokenizer with StopFilter. */
   public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
     return new StopFilter(new LowerCaseTokenizer(reader), stopWords);
   }

So, I think the answer is that StandardAnalyzer already has what you  
state you want.  Is it, perhaps, that certain stopwords that you are  
interested in are not currently being stopped?
Also, there is a whole section of examples on how to write Analyzers  
in the contrib/analyzers section of the source code.
