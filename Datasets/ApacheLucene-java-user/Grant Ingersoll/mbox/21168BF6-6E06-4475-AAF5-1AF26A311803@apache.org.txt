It's called Solr  ;-)

Solr has controls for all of these things.  I know that isn't  
necessarily satisfactory and that you may not want to switch, but you  
can always go look at the code for how it is implemented.  Otherwise,  
Lucene-wise, you have to manage the lifecycle of the readers,  
committing, etc..
