Yeah, these classes are a bit weird in that they are configured via  
properties, and not setters.  They really are designed to run inside  
the benchmaker and not much attention was paid to using them elsewhere.

However, one can co-opt them for the purposes you are doing:

Something like:
TrecDocMaker docMaker = new TrecDocMaker();
     Properties properties = new Properties();
....
     properties.setProperty("doc.maker.forever", "false");
...
     docMaker.setConfig(new Config(properties));

(not I was using the EnWikiDocMaker in the above example, but it  
should work for Trec, too.

I often also do something like:

while ((doc = docMaker.makeDocument()) != null && i < numDocs) {
...

where numDocs is the max. docs I want.
