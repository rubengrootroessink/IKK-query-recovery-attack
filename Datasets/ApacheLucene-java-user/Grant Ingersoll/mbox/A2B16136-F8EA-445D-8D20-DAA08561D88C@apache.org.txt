SUBJECT: Re: short documents = help me tweak Similarity??
DATE: 5 Apr 2007

It is the right forum, silence just means either no one knows the  
answer or no one who knows the answer has read it...  Such is the  
nature of the community.

Have you looked at overriding similarity with your own  
implementation?  Have you done explain() calls on the docs to see  
where the scores are coming from?  You may be seeing other factors at  
play.

You might also try searching the archives for length normalization.   
I seem to recall someone talking about the opposite problem, calling  
it "fair" similarity, so maybe you could use that as a basis for your  
implementation (by doing the opposite).
