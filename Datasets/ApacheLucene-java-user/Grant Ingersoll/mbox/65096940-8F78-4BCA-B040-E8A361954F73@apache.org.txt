Hi Mathieu,

You can't add TokenFilters to an existing Analyzer.  However,  
implementing an Analyzer that acts just like the StandardAnalyzer  
plus your Stemmer is pretty straightforward.   
StandardAnalzyer.tokenStream() looks like:
/** Constructs a {@link StandardTokenizer} filtered by a {@link
   StandardFilter}, a {@link LowerCaseFilter} and a {@link  
StopFilter}. */
   public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
     TokenStream result = new StandardTokenizer(reader);
     result = new StandardFilter(result);
     result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);
     result = new StopFilter(result, stopSet);
//ADD your Stemming Filter here, or one line above if your Stop word  
list works off of stemmed words
     return result;
   }

So just create a new Analyzer that has these same filters, plus your  
stemming TokenFilter.  Looking at the source of SnowballAnalyzer  
(contrib/snowball) may also be useful.

FWIW, it is not that hard to make a "configurable" analyzer similar  
to what Solr does, if you find you need to change the filters in your  
analyzer a lot.

Cheers,
Grant
