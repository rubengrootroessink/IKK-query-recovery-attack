SUBJECT: Re: RAMDirectory vs FSDirectory
DATE: 27 Nov 2007

RAMDirectory has a constructor that takes in another Directory and  
loads it into memory.  No Serialization necessary.  Just index to a  
FSDirectory using Lucene's normal indexing methods (it takes care of  
buffering them internally) and then load the FSDirectory into a  
RAMDirectory.  Have a look at the Javadocs for RAMDirectory to see how  
to do this.
