SUBJECT: Re: Best way to get payloads
DATE: 22 May 2008

Unfortunately, I haven't had time to work on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1001

There is a _HALF BAKED_ patch up there, but I got stuck on it at the  
time due to not being sure how to handle NearSpans and haven't had a  
chance to go back to it.  I do believe it is possible to expose it via  
the Spans, so if you are so inclined, it is definitely something that  
needs to be implemented.
