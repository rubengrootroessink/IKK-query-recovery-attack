That depends whether you tell Lucene to create a new index or not.   
See the IndexWriter API for your options.

I don't know if it will be corrupted, but probably won't be all that  
useful, either. You may find the PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper to be helpful.

I should think so.  I don't recall running across this case too much,  
but do remember the reverse, Arabic files w/ some English and the  
Arabic analyzer usually just skipped over the English leaving it  
intact, thus searching those English terms in the Arabic index worked  
just fine.

They are valid, just not sure how useful, but that is for your app to  
decide.  I guess if your users know both Arabic and English, it  
probably isn't a big deal.  Lucene just tries to match up what is in  
the query w/ what is in the index, so if you have validly analyzed  
tokens in both the query and the index then Lucene should find them.
