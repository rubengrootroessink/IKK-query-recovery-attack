Hi,

I was wondering if boosting a grouping of terms has any meaning?
For example, (A^2  OR B^3 OR C^1.5)^5.0

I didn't see it in the query syntax documentation (but the query parser seems to accept it).
 If it is meaningful, what are the semantics of it?  Is the boost factor distributive?  That
is, is the above query equivalent to (A^10.0 OR B^15.0 OR C^7.5) ?

Thanks for the help,
Grant
