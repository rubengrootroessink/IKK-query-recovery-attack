SUBJECT: Re: Get the preceding and following terms
DATE: 19 Oct 2007

Have a look at the SpanQuery and it's derivitives.  I have some  
examples in my ApacheCon Europe talk http://cnlp.org/presentations/ 
slides/AdvancedLuceneEU.pdf

You will most likely have to do some post processing.  Using Term  
Vectors and the new TermVectorMapper may help facilitate this.

Cheers,
Grant
