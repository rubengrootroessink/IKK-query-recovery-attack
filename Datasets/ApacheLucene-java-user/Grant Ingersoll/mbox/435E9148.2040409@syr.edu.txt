Sounds like you need to make your articles XML or stop trying to use an 
XML parser to process the file, whichever is easier for you.  I don't 
think your issues are Lucene related.  I think you need to get a better 
handle on the XML processing.  As I suggested on your Digester thread 
before, I would separate the handling of the XML from Lucene until you 
can get a better handle on the XML processing.  I would also write 
myself some Unit Tests using some very small Volume examples. Can you 
write a small app that simply reads in the Volume file, then loads an 
article and prints it out?
