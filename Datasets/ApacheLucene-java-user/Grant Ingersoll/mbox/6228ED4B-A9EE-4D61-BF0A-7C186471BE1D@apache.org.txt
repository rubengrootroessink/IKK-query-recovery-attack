SUBJECT: Re: Retrieving the term vectors of a document in Nutch
DATE: 8 Jun 2009

I'd ask on the nutch-user@lucene.apache.org mailing list.  While  
Lucene can do all of these things, it is not clear how Nutch exposes,  
if at all, any of this information.  You should be able to get results  
there.

Note, however, that Term Vecs must be created during indexing by  
creating the Field properly.  You could likely modify the Nutch code  
where it creates the Lucene Document and Fields to add in Term Vector  
capabilities.
