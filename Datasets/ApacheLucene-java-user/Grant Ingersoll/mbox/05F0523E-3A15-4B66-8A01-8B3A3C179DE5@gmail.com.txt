OK, gotcha.   I now see what you mean.  StandardAnalyzer uses the  
StandardTokenizer, whereas StopAnalyzer uses the LowerCaseTokenizer,  
which divides text at non-letters.  What you most likely will need to  
do is create a Tokenizer that outputs the original token, and outputs  
the parts of it based on the LowerCaseTokenizer.  Have a look at the  
TokenStream API.  Essentially, you need to implement the next()  
method for your new Tokenizer.  You probably could just have your  
tokenizer wrap the other two, by using StandardTokenizer to get your  
first level tokens, then, given a Token, run it through the  
LowerCaseTokenizer to see if it has any values for next(), which can  
be added to the stream.

Once you have your Tokenizer working you can wrap them into your new  
Analyzer to use the other filters as you see fit.

If you have "Lucene In Action", have a look at Chapter 4 for more  
details on how Tokenizers and TokenFilters work.

HTH,
Grant
