Hi Mohammad,

The typical use cases are:
1. You have several small fields used in a results display and one or  
two large fields (i.e. the original document) and you don't want to  
pay the cost of loading the large fields for results display because  
most of them won't be chosen.  When a result is chosen, the lazily  
loaded field will be retrieved.

2. You only want to load certain fields, or the first field, or you  
just want to know the size of a field.

Basically, it gives you control over how fields are loaded from disk  
in Lucene.

See my ApacheCon Europe presentation http://cnlp.org/presentations/ 
slides/AdvancedLuceneEU.pdf for a few slides (towards the end) on  
FieldSelector.
