What kind of documents do you have?  Are they very similar to the TREC docs (i.e. news articles)?
 There can be a fairly wide difference in performance between real docs and TREC docs, especially
given real queries.  Doing well at TREC does not necessarily equate to doing well in your
own system.  You might be better off just doing something like taking the top 50 queries from
your logs plus some random ones from the tail and judging the top 10.   See http://www.lucidimagination.com/Community/Hear-from-the-Experts/Articles/Debugging-Relevance-Issues-Search
