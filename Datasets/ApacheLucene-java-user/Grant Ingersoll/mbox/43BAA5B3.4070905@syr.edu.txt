SUBJECT: Re: boosting results with a field from the index
DATE: 3 Jan 2006

Hi Klaus,

You might want to just set the boost value of the Document using your 
importance number, then Lucene will factor that in automatically when 
scoring.  See the Document#setBoost javadoc for info.

You could also sort on the field, I think, so that the more important 
docs come to the top.

text and importance is a field where I manually give a number between 1 and 5 for the related
document. When I search the index I find the documents with the highest revelancy weighted
automatically by lucene. I'm just wondering if I can boost the results with the importance
field I already have stored in the index. As I result I expect the same search results just
weighted differently. Something like relevancy multiplied by importance.
