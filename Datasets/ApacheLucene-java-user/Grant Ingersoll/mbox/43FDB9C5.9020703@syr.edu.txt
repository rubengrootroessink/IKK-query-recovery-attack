SUBJECT: Re: How can I get a term's frequency?
DATE: 23 Feb 2006

You need to make sure you are indexing with Term Vectors in order for
IndexReader.getTermFreqVector to return anything meaningful. You do not
need to implement it.

QueryTermVector is meant to provide similar information to the Document
side for Queries.

For an example demo of indexing and using term vectors, go to
http://www.cnlp.org/apachecon2005. All the examples are under Apache
license and there is some documentation too.
