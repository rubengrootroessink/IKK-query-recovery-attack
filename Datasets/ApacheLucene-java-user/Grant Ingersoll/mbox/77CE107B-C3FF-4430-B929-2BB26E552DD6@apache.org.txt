SUBJECT: Re: Using Lucene with Jarowinkler
DATE: 7 Jan 2008

FuzzyQuery uses EditDistance, you probably could create a  
JaroWinklerQuery that mimics FuzzyQuery but calculates the JaroWinkler  
score instead of the edit distance.  As for dealing with phrases, that  
would get a bit more complex, but you may be able to use PhraseQuery  
as an example and then implement a JaroWinklerPhraseQuery or something  
like that.
