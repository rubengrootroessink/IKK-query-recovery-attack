What's the full exception?  We don't even know that the exception is  
in Lucene from what you've described.  So, w/o more info, it will be  
pretty hard to help, but if I had to guess, it sounds like you've got  
some threading problems, but who knows.

Also, no need to send the exact same email 5 minutes apart.
