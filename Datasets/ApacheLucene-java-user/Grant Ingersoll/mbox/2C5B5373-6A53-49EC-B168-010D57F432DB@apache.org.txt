That is off of the TermSpans class.  BTQ (BoostingTermQuery) is  
implemented to extend SpanQuery, thus SpanNearQuery isn't, w/o  
modification, going to have access to these things.  However, if you  
look at the SpanTermQuery, you will see that it's implementation of  
Spans is indeed the TermSpans class.  So, I think you could cast to  
it or handle it through instanceof.

I am not completely sure here, but it seems like we may need an  
efficient way to access the TermPositions for each document.  That  
is, the Spans class doesn't provide this and maybe it should  
somehow.  Again, I am just thinking out loud here.

Thus, if we modified Spans to have the following methods:

byte[] getPayload(byte[] data, int offset)

boolean isPayloadAvailable()

I think this would be useful.  Perhaps this should be discussed on dev.

Cheers,
Grant
