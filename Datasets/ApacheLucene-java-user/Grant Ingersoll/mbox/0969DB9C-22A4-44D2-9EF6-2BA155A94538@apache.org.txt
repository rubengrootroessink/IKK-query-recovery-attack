SUBJECT: Re: How Lucene Search
DATE: 26 Jun 2008

The index is opened via the IndexReader and then it is a variety of  
places that factor into scoring, such as the Query, Weight and Scorer  
classes.  Probably the easiest place to start is the TermQuery and  
TermScorer.

You might also have a read through http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_2/scoring.html

You might also try stepping through the path of a simple TermQuery via  
a debugger as it enters the searcher and then expand to try  
BooleanQuery and some of the other queries.

Cheers,
Grant
