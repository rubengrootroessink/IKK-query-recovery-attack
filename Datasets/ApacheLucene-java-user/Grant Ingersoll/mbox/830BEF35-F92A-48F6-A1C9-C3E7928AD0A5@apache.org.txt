Hey Luceners,

There have been several changes to the website (http:// 
lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html) that may or may not affect  
how people use Lucene documentation.

Previously, the website was, more or less, static since it was based  
on the latest official release.  Sometimes it was updated for news or  
when committers were added.  That has all changed now.  The main  
website is now based on the nightly build of the documentation.   
Additionally, the API documentation is based on the nightly build and  
reflects what is in the trunk of SVN.  Nightly builds of the source  
(binary distributions) can now be located on the "Developers" page  
via the Resources left-hand menu.

For those of you looking for documentation of a specific release, you  
can find it under the "Site Versions" section in the left-hand menu.   
Docs as far back as 1.4.3 are supported.  File a JIRA issue if you  
would like to see a prior release to that.

For those looking to start contributing, the Resources-> Developers  
page has some helpful starting points.  Notably, the Clover test  
coverage reports show where we are lacking in test coverage.  Writing  
tests is a good way to get an understanding of what is going on  
inside Lucene and are always welcome.
