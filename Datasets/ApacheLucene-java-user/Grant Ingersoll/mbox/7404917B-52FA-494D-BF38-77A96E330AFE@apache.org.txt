I am now pretty sure it is an encoding issue.  I'm guessing that  
however you are getting the page, it is not in the right encoding.   
How do you obtain the Page object?  I'm guessing you are crawling.   
You need to make sure you are getting the encoding of the file and  
opening it with that encoding.

Something like:
Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(file),  
encoding);

where encoding is the encoding of the file.

What version of Lucene are you using and what version of Luke?  This  
usually happens, I believe, when the Luke version is older than the  
Lucene version used to create the index.
