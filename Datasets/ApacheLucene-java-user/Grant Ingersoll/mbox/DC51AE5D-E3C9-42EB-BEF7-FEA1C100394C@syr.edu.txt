People are working on this.  Search the java-dev archives for  
Flexible Indexing or Payloads.  See http://issues.apache.org/jira/

Take a look at Term Vectors.  Search the list.  Read about them at  
http://www.cnlp.org/apachecon2005 or in "Lucene In Action".  There is  
also a contribution called "More Like This" that you may find useful
