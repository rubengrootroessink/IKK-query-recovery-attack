I probably should have said you will access at least one of those 4  
fields, otherwise why load the document.

Yes, but is this the case for all Fields on the Document?  This is the  
most often use case.  You have some fields for display, some for  
searching and some for sorting.  If there all small, you really aren't  
going to pay too much cost for getting them all, b/c they are next to  
each other in the index, so you might as well load them.  If one or  
more are really big, then it might make sense to lazily load just  
those fields.  I don't see much value in loading all the fields  
lazily, but it certainly is easy enough to do w/ the  
SetBasedFieldSelector or a trivial implementation of FieldSelector  
where the accept method returns Lazy no matter the input.
