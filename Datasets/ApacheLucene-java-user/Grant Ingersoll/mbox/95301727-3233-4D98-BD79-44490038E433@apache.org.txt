SUBJECT: Re: indexing performance issue
DATE: 30 Nov 2006

http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/contributions.html lists several  
PDF alternatives, but I can't speak to their performance.  I am sure  
if you googled PDF converters you could find a fair number of hits.

Perhaps w/ some more details about your app we might be able to find  
a workaround.  We often convert PDFs as a one time offline task  
(which doesn't get around the fact that you need to do it) so that  
they don't get in the way when indexing (and reindexing), but we  
generally deal w/ fixed collections, which may not be your case.
