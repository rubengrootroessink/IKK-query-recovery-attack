Have a look at the FieldSelector stuff, assuming you are using trunk  
or some recent nightly build.  It _may_ help w/ what you are doing.   
Also, I would think you could calculate the median at indexing time  
(or just after), but I'm not sure I fully understand what you are  
trying to do, so take that w/ a grain of salt.

You may find https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-762  
useful.  It hasn't been committed, but will be before 2.1 (so you  
will have to apply the patch too)  Also, don't worry about the  
discussion of the internals, the patch as submitted by Chuck is good

You will have to calculate your deviations separately, but the field  
size info should help.
