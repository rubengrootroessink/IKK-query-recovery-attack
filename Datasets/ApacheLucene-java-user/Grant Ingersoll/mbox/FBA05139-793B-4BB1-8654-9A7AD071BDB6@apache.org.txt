I don't believe there is any b-tree strategy in Lucene.  I would say  
that it is segment based, I guess, in that it indexes documents in  
memory based on your merge factors and then flushes to disk, at then  
end you can choose to merge the segments together via optimize().  I  
find it to have a structure similar to that described in section 8.2  
of "Modern Information Retrieval" by Baeza-Yates, et. al with a fair  
number of improvements for storing terms, positions and frequency  
info, etc. in compact form.

References you might find useful:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/fileformats.html

If you feel like helping w/ this part of the docs, I would love some  
help on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-765

Probably the best way to know at this point is to trace through the  
code.
