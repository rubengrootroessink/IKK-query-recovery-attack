You will have to use some sort of XML Parser (SAX or a pull parser)  
to extract the content you want and create Lucene Documents.  Have a  
look at the tutorial on the Lucene home page for examples

You will have to write your own, more than likely.  There are some  
Arabic analyzers out there, perhaps you could use them as a starting  
point.

This really is up to you, but essentially you need to setup an  
IndexSearcher and create queries to do searches.  Again, have a look  
at the tutorial as a way of getting started.
