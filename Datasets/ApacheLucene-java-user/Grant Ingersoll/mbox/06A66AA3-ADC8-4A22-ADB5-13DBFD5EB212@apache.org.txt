It can be safely ignored (in fact the warning has been removed in  
later versions) so I suspect your other issues are unrelated.

It sounds like you are somehow not properly indexing term vectors, but  
would have to see some code to know for sure.

Big question, what requirement is forcing you to use 1.4.3?
