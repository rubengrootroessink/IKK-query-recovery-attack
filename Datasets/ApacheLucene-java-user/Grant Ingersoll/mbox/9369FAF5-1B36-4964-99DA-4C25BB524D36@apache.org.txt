The collector uses a Priority Queue to store doc ids and scores as  
they are collected.  All the collector knows is the document id and  
the score and, presumably what it has seen so far, to some extent.   
Ordering is not defined until all the candidate docs have been scored.

If you expect to do a lot of paging on a given set of results, I could  
imagine using an approach whereby you don't bother to insert entries  
if you've already seen them and could maybe save on some queue  
operations, but not sure how well it would work.

The other thing to do is just ask for slightly more than you think you  
will need in the first query, but it depends on your users.  Most  
users, in my experience, don't go beyond page 2 or 3 at most, so you  
could consider paying the cost to get the top 30 or 50 and caching  
that for your paging.  If you have other application specific  
knowledge, you can then adjust as appropriate.
