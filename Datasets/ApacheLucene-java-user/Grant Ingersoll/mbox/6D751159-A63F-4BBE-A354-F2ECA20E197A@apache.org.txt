You can benchmark with Lucene, see the Quality work in the contrib/ 
benchmark code.   I've done a fair number of TREC experiments with  
Lucene, as have others, but they usually aren't all that practical in  
terms of deploying a real system.  If your interested in pure theory,  
by all means do the TREC stuff, if you want practical evaluations, I  
recommend gathering queries from your logs and ranking them.
