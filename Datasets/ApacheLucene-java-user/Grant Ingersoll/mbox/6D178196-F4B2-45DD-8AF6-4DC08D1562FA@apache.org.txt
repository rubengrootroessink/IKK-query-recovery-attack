SUBJECT: Lucene Boot Camp Training at ApacheCon Europe
DATE: 18 Feb 2009

Hi Lucene Users,

For those who don't already know, I will be offering a two day Lucene  
Boot Camp training at ApacheCon Europe on March 23 and 24.  The two  
day class covers a lot of detail on how to use Lucene to build search  
applications, including the basics of searching, indexing and  
analysis, along with Lucene best practices and performance tuning.  No  
prior knowledge of Lucene is required, but it is recommended that you  
have basic Java programming skills and that you bring a laptop.

Also, if you come to the training, stay for the conference, as there  
will be several talks on the Lucene ecosystem:   See http://lucene.apache.org/#09+February+2009+-+Lucene+at+ApacheCon+Europe+2009+in+Amsterdam

    The ApacheCon conference is the official conference of the Apache  
Software Foundation and is a great place to learn and interact with  
the developers of your favorite Apache projects.

If you have questions or aren't sure if the course is appropriate for  
you, you can email me at trainer@lucenebootcamp.com

Cheers,
Grant
