Somewhat arbitrary, I suppose, but I think someone way back did some tests and decided it
performed "best" in general.  More importantly, the point of the Similarity class is you can
override these if you desire.

Should be.  You can run the explain() method to confirm.

The queryNorm is an attempt at making scores comparable across queries.  Again, I'd try the
explain() method to see the practical aspects of how it effects score.

See http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/scoring.html for more info on scoring.
