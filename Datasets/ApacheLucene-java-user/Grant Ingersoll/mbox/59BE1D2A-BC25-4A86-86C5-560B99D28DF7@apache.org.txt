SUBJECT: Re: Retrieving Top Terms for a subset of the index (or for all results of a query)
DATE: 12 Oct 2008

How large of a subset are you talking?

You might look at the FitleredTermEnum class, but you will probably  
have to do some work on it to extend it to what you want

If you are talking a smallish subset (say, at most a couple hundred  
docs), then you could store Term Vectors and use the TermVectorMapper,  
I suspect.
