SUBJECT: Re: Does Lucene support on-disk search?
DATE: 8 Mar 2006

Lucene _can_ load the index into memory, but it doesn't have to, if you 
want further details see the Javadocs on RAMDirectory versus 
FSDirectory.  I think you will find it has good performance on a few 
gigs of data.  Results, of course, vary based on what you are asking it 
to do and what kind of hardware you have.

index memory to do the search, which I think would have scalability problem.
