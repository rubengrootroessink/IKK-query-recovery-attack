Would IndexReader:
/**
    * Reads version number from segments files. The version number is
    * initialized with a timestamp and then increased by one for each  
change of
    * the index.
    *
    * @param directory where the index resides.
    * @return version number.
    * @throws CorruptIndexException if the index is corrupt
    * @throws IOException if there is a low-level IO error
    */
   public static long getCurrentVersion(Directory directory) throws  
CorruptIndexException, IOException {

do what you are looking for?  Also, why does it have to be in the  
index if you are concerned about loading the whole IndexReader?  That  
is, if your application is versioning the application, why not just  
store it in the same location or something like that?
