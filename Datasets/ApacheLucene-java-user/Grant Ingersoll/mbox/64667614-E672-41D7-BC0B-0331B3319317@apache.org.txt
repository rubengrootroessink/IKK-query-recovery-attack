DATE: 26 Jun 2008

Because there are no matches?  Have you checked your index, etc?  Do  
you get matches for that query normally in Greek against your index  
(nevermind highlighting)?  Are your analyzers the same?  Are your  
English Fields stored and the Greek ones not?  Does field "f" contain  
Greek?  It could be a whole host of reasons and that snippet of code  
is not enough to go from.  Check your index with Luke, etc.  See the  
FAQ for more help, too.

Also, please don't repost the same exact question 45 minutes later b/c  
you didn't get an immediate response at 3:48 AM East Coast US time.   
It just clutters email and makes it less likely that you will get a  
response.
