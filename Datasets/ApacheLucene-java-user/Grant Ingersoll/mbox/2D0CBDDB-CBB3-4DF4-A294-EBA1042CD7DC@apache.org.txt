SUBJECT: Re: memory leak during Lucene Search
DATE: 9 Sep 2008

Just chipping in that I recall there being a number of discussions on  
java-dev about ThreadLocal and web containers and how they should be  
handled.  Not sure if it pertains here or not, but you might find http://lucene.markmail.org/message/keosgz2c2yjc7qre?q=ThreadLocal

  helpful.

You might also consider asking on java-dev in this case, which usually  
isn't recommended, but this is pretty low-level stuff and seems more  
appropriate there.  It does seem like a problem though and I'm not  
sure of the alternative just yet.
