We use boosts that are calculated based on the frequencies and the 
standard alpha, beta, gamma multipliers from Rochio.  Non-relevant terms 
decrement the frequency.  If a term is <= 0, we remove the term (someone 
has posted a contribution for dealing with negative weights, we just 
haven't adopted it yet).  I am sure there are more things you could do, 
we just haven't investigated too much.  We also give different weights 
to things we think are more important based on our NLP analysis.
