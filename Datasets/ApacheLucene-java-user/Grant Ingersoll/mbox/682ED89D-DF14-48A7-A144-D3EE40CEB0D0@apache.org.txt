Assuming delete-by-DocId means IndexReader.deleteDocument(int) right?   
That is, you mean the internal Lucene doc id, right?

If you already have the docId, would you need to/want to do delete-by- 
Query or even delete-by-Term?  Isn't delete-by-id a lot lighter weight  
since it only marks the the doc as deleted, where as d-b-Q can  
potentially force a flush, etc?
