For those attending ApacheCon in New Orleans next week, the Lucene  
Search and Machine Learning Birds of a Feather (BOF) will be held  
Wednesday night.  Please indicate your interest at: http://wiki.apache.org/apachecon/BirdsOfaFeatherUs08

Also, note there are a number of Lucene/Solr/Mahout talks on  
Wednesday, and, of course, it's not to late to sign up for Lucene or  
Solr training.  See the ApacheCon website for more info: http://us.apachecon.com/c/acus2008/

See you there,
Grant
