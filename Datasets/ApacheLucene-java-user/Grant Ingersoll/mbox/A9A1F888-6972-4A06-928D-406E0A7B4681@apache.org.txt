You might also have a look at the quality package under contrib/ 
benchmark, as it works w/ trec files, etc.  I am not sure what the  
similarity parameter is you are referring to, but if I recall (and it  
has been a while), in the rel. files the last number is either 1 or 0,  
depending on whether your system thinks the document is relevant or  
not.  Thus, you could do something like score > 0 ? 1 : 0 for  
outputting that value, or some variation of that.

If that isn't right, I would dig into some of the TREC papers,  
especially the overview paper published each conference, my guess is  
one of them will explain it in more detail, or perhaps any docs for  
the trec_eval program will.
