SUBJECT: Re: Could search results give an idea of which field matched

See the explain functionality in the Javadocs and previous threads.  You can ask Lucene to
explain why it got the results it did for a give hit.

I search the index on multiple fields. Could the search results also
tell me which field matched so that the document was selected? From what
I can tell, only the document number and a score are returned, is there
a way to also find out what was the field(s) of the document matched the
query?
