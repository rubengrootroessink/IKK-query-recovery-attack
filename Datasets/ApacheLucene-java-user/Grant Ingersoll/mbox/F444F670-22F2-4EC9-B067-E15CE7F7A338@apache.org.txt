Can you give us more info on what they are searching for w/ 2 letter  
searches?  Typically, prefix queries that short are going to have a  
lot of terms to match.  You might try having a field that you index  
using a variation of ngrams that are anchored at the first character.   
For example, encountering the term Lucene, you would index "lu",  
"luc", "luce" all at the same position (this has limits, b/c you will  
need an upper bound cutoff too).  This way, you would get exact  
matches and you don't need to use prefix queries.  Then, you just need  
to recognize these searches and generate the appropriate queries.

Alternatively, you may consider requiring a minimum number of  
characters in a query, but this depends on your application.
