The odds increase significantly in correlation to patches  
submitted!  :-)  The odds increase slightly by at least filing an  
"enhancement" issue in JIRA.  They increase a tiny bit by bringing it  
up here!  I may have some time in the not too distant future for  
this, but we always appreciate the help.

Looking briefly at the Searchable interface, it does seem to make  
sense, but that is just my quick glance take on it.
