I presume that the image field is a binary field, right?

I can think of a couple of things that _may_ work for you:

1. You create a dummy token on the "image" field, and then store the  
image data as a payload on that token.  Then you can use the payload  
mechanism to score the field by overriding the scorePayload (I think  
that's the name) method in the Similarity class.  You may have to  
implement a new Query for this similar to BoostingTermQuery (but  
maybe not)

2. You could implement scoring of binary fields in Lucene.  I've had  
in my mind that a binary field is the same as a payload, more or  
less, so it seems like it would be relatively easy to create a query  
mechanism for it, just not sure of the loading part of it at this  
time (but that should be easy enough to figure out)

I don't know how the performance of either of these approaches would  
be.  If you have large images, it could be a significant overhead.   
The other option, of course, is to do postprocessing on the results  
by first narrowing down on the text fields and then scoring the images.
