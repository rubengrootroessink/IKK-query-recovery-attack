I think you could override all the Similarity factors except tf() with  
1, such that the term frequency is the only factor in the scoring.   
Then you just submit the term as a query.  Note, I think you will need  
to override the similarity during indexing, too, so that norm length  
is turned off, too.  Note, I haven't tried it :-).  Use the explain()  
functionality to double check.  At any rate, it should be quick to test.

See http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_2/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html
