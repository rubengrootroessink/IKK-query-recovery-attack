Anton,

Please don't cross post "How do I..." questions to the dev list, it 
doesn't get you anywhere and just annoys those most likely to help you.

See below.

SpanQuery can give you information about where matches take place.  If 
you are looking for a more basic answer, then refer to the demo on how 
to do a search that returns Hits or the well-written "Lucene In Action".

Use the Highlighter contrib package.

Not sure.  You probably need some way of keeping track of where the 
sentences occur.  See my previous answer to a similar question you asked 
about how to index and search sentences.  I, personally, think you need 
to have a Document per sentence, with some metadata fields about where 
that sentence takes place, but others may have alternate ideas.  You 
_could_, instead of having each field be named "sentence", have the 
field name reflect which sentence it is, along with a catch all field, 
but this would make querying a lot harder.
