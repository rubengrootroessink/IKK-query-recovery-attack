Hi Ghinwa,

A Term is simply a unit of tokenization that has been indexed for a  
Field, produced by a TokenStream.   In the demo, on the main site,  
this can be seen in the file called IndexFiles.java on line 56:
IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(INDEX_DIR, new  
StandardAnalyzer(), true, IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.LIMITED);

The key being that the StandardAnalyzer is used to get a TokenStream.   
The TokenStream.next() method returns a Token.  All a Term is, is a  
Token that has been indexed for a given Field.  In a nutshell, though,  
a Term is whatever you want it to be, based on your Analyzer.  It  
could be a whole document as a single string or it could be a string  
containing a single character.  In reality, it usually corresponds to  
a single word.

Have a look at the wiki, also, as there are many talks and articles  
explaining all of this.  Lucene In Action, while outdated, is also an  
excellent book for explaining this stuff (with the exception that some  
of the code examples no longer work on the latest Lucene version)

Getting beyond that, you will need to look into adding spell checking  
(in Lucene's "contrib" area) and other features like stemming and  
synonyms to handle the various issues you bring up.

Hope that helps,
Grant
