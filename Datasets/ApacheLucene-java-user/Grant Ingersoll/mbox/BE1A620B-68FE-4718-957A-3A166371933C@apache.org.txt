Try using the explain() method to see why the documents that were  
returned scored the way they did.

If I am understanding correctly, you are saying that Luke shows that  
those words aren't actually in your index?  Can you elaborate on what  
your analysis process is?  Are you searching using the same Analyzer  
as you are indexing with?  I would try to isolate the problem down to  
some unit tests, if possible.

Cheers,
Grant
