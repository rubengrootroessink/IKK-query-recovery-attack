Anil,

I suppose it depends on how complex the language is and what is acceptable for your program.
 I have written a couple of stemmers that are fairly straightforward based on papers that
I have read and work well for the langs. we are using.  Your best bet is probably to do a
literature search for the languages you are interested in and go from there.  

I am, of course, assumming stemmers for your languages don't already exist.  If your languages
are common, there probably is a stemmer available in some form that you can use or adapt.
You'd be suprised at what you get by doing a simple google search for "<lang X> stemmer"
where lang X is the language you are interested in and no quotes.

Hooking them into Lucene is straightforward and there are several examples of this available
in the docs and code.

Hi,

Can anyone provide some help on writing a stemmer for non-english languages?
How proficient must I be in a language for which I wish to write the stemmer?

Regards,
Anil
