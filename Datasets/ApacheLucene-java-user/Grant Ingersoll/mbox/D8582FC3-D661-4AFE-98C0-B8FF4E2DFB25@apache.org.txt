I'm using the TypeAsPayloadTokenFilter, however I'll change this soon as it's not really what
I'm after.

 next() returns a boolean as to whether there is a valid entry, so you need to check that.
 You may not actually have a match for that term.

What does your Analysis process look like?  Many of Lucene's analysis pieces don't bother
setting type.  Have you looked at the index with Luke?  That should show you the payloads.
 Also, have a look at the SpanTermQuery.  You can use the Spans object to step directly through
the position matches and get the payloads, if they are available.
