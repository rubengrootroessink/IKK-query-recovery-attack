SUBJECT: Re: Suggested number of fields limit per Index

Another issues is how to generate queries.  If you have hundreds of  
fields, you may have to generate queries (e.g. using the  
MultfieldQueryParser) across all those fields just to find documents  
that _could_ have those fields.  This can lead to the dreaded  
TooManyClausesException.

That being said, Lucene can handle that many fields; I doubt, though,  
that many would consider it a best practice and I don't think there  
would be any indexing performance issues.  Number of fields can be a  
search issue, but I don't know what your requirements are to say for  
sure.

I would say that if you have alternative approaches that you think  
will work for your other requirements, and use less fields, then give  
that a try.  I don't know if I would go so far as say all fields  
should be in common, but that is a good thing to approach, as it makes  
things easier.  Are you sure you can't just map your fields into a  
common set?  Perhaps if you described the problem a bit more, we can  
help.
