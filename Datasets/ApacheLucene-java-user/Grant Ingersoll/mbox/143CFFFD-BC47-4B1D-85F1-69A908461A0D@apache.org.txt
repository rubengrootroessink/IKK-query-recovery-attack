Hi Shardul,

I just was w/ a client who pretty much had the exact same scenario and  
Lucene (actually Solr) was just fine.  In fact, I think you could have  
a prototype of this up and running in Solr (Lucene-based Search  
Server) in a day or two.  As for performance, given each record is  
likely quite small, I don't think 5M records will be that big of a deal.

Of course, every situation is different, so I'd recommend spending a  
few days w/ Solr on it, or just setup some simple indexing/search  
tests with Lucene.
