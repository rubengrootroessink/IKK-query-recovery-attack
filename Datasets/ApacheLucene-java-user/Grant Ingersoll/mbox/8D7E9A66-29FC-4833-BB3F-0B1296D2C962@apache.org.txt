Yes, with a little bit of work, as there is nothing out of the box  
for it.

If you store term vectors (or re-analyze the document) you can use  
the sample code from my ApacheCon 2005 talk (http://www.cnlp.org/ 
apachecon2005/, which also covers how to use TermVectors) OR you can  
try implementing the new TermVectorMapper functionality in the trunk  
version of Lucene.

Cheers,
Grant
