Lucene-java's source is available through its revision control system (Subversion) - details
are here:

   <http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/HowToContribute>

Here's the URL to access the 2.4.0 version of the Lucene Snowball sources:

<http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/tags/lucene_2_4_0/contrib/snowball/>

FYI, there is also a browsable view of the Lucene-java repository here:

<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/>
