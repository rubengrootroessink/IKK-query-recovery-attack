http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-295

I found this by looking up the issue number in the map of Bugzilla -> JIRA issue numbers
I put into the changes2html.pl script[1], so that linkification of old Bugzilla issues would
continue to work in the Changes.html[2] it generates from CHANGES.txt[3].  Bug 31841 is mentioned
(and now linked to LUCENE-295 in Changes.html) as item #4 under the "Changes in runtime behavior"
section of the release notes for Release 1.9 RC1 - see [2].
