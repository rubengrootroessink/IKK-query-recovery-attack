It's still not clear to me what you want, since as far as I can tell you should be able to
look for documents using a range query like [index04 TO index08].  Why do you think you can't?
 That is, what happens when you try?  What exactly are you doing?  (Code might help.)

Are you sure that the "index<d><d>" terms are in the index in the form you expect?
 Have you used Luke <http://getopt.org/luke> to look at your index yet?

What analyzer are you using at index time?

What analyzer are you using at query time?
