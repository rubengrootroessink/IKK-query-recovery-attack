Can you give an example of what you mean?

An inverse query would require rewriting, too, I think.

You say you have 10-ish prefixes.  Can you turn those prefixes into field names, and index
a token like EMPTY when there are no values for a particular prefix?  Then your query would
be (F1:EMPTY OR F2:EMPTY ... OR F10:EMPTY).
