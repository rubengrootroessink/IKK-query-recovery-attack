Have you tried searching for terms without digits, e.g. 'f(df)+'?  It is possible that the
analyzer you're using at index time is not including digits.  As Erick suggested, look inside
your index with Luke.

In Java's regular expression language, '*' is a repeat operator, and must follow the regular
expression to be repeated (like '.' or 'a' or '[a-z]') -- probably what you mean is: '.*4343.*'
