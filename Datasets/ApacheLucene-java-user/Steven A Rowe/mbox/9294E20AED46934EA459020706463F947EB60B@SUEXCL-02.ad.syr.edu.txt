Hi Chris,

Looks like the ElisionFilter handles the French problems you mentioned:

<http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_0/api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/fr/ElisionFilter.html>

See the code for the list of /X'/ constructions it handles:

<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/analyzers/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/fr/ElisionFilter.java?revision=552111&view=markup>

You may also be interested in the French stopword list in the FrenchAnalyzer in the same contrib
package: o.a.l.analysis.fr .

This sounds really ambitious, but interesting - have you considered doing this?

You asked about "what is planned" -- I'm afraid the plan is something like "enlightened self
interest": if you want it to happen, you do the work yourself, or you find a way to encourage
others to do so (e.g., give them money :) ).  But that's not really so bad - in the end, what
gets done are the ideas that people care enough about to turn them into reality.

Steve
