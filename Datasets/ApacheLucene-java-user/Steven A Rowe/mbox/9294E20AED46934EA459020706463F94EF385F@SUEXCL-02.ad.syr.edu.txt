Are you sure that this only occurs after you change the stopword list?

I assume you're using the GermanAnalyzer in contrib/; it constructs an analysis pipeline consisting
of StandardTokenizer, StandardFilter, LowerCaseFilter, StopFilter, and then  GermanStemFilter,
which invokes GermanStemmer <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/tags/lucene_2_3_2/contrib/analyzers/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/de/GermanStemmer.java?view=markup>,
which is an implementation of the stemming algorithm described in the paper linked from here:
<http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/pubs/tr-b-99-16.abstract.html>.

A basic question to get out of the way: Are you aware that the stemming operation removes
letters from the end of some words?

Steve
