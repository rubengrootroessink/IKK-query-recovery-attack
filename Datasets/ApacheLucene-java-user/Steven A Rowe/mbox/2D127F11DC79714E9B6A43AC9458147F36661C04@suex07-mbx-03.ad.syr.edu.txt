Hi AlexElba,

The problem is that Lucene only knows how to handle character strings, not numbers.  Lexicographically,
"3" > "10", so you get the expected results (nothing).

The standard thing to do is transform your numbers into strings that sort as you want them
to.  E.g., you can left-pad the "rank" field values with zeroes: "03", "04", ..., "10", and
then create a RangeFilter over "03" .. "10".  You will of course need to left-zero-pad to
at least the maximum character length of the largest rank.

Facilities to handle this problem are available in NumberTools:

<http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/document/NumberTools.html>

(Note that NumberTools converts longs to base-36 fixed-length padded strings.)

More info here:
