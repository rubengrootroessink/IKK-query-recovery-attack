DATE: 18 Aug 2008

Hi Bill,

A simpler suggestion, assuming you need to test for the existence of just one particular field:
rather than adding a field containing a list of all indexed fields for a particular document,
as Karsten suggested, you could just add a field with a constant value when the field you
want to test for is present for a particular document.

For example, if "foo" is a field you want to test for, and a document contains:

   foo:bar

you could add a new field "foo.present", with a constant value, to the document:

   foo.present:true

and then when querying:

   +foo.present:true
