Hi Sudha,

There is such a tokenizer, named NewStandardTokenizer, in the most recent patch on the following
JIRA issue: 

   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2167

It keeps (HTTP(S), FTP, and FILE) URLs together as single tokens, and e-mails too, in accordance
with the relevant IETF RFCs.
