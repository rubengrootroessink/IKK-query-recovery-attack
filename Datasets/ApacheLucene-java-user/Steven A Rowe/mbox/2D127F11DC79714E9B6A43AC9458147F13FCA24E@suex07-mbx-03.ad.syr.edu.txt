Can you give an example of what you want to do?

I suspect what you want is to look at a range of terms that appear in the collection (that
is, across all documents) - if this is so, then you may be interested in IndexReader.terms(Term):

http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#terms(org.apache.lucene.index.Term)
