The ShingleFilter is designed to generate tokens from token *sequences* in an input token
stream, but you want to match against cases where they are separated by other tokens, so even
if you generated shingles at index and query time, many of the documents you would want to
match would not match, since the intervening tokens would block a match.  (But maybe you were
thinking of some other scenario?)
