DATE: 4 Mar 2009

When I initially tried an hour or so ago to access <http://www.getopt.org/luke/>, I was
able to see the site.  But now, I'm not able to get anything.  

Here's the response I see using curl:

  PROMPT$ curl http://www.getopt.org/luke/
  curl: (52) Empty reply from server

Looks like you can get an older version (0.9) here:

<http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Text-Editing-Processing/Indexing/Luke-35595.shtml>

Version 0.9.1 is the latest.
