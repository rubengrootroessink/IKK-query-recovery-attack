Hi Siraj,

Lucene's MemoryIndex can be used to serve this purpose.

>From <http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_1/api/contrib-memory/org/apache/lucene/index/memory/MemoryIndex.html>:

	[T]his class targets fulltext search of huge numbers
	of queries over comparatively small transient realtime
	data (prospective search). 

MemoryIndex can only hold one document at a time.

See also Lucene's InstantiatedIndex, which can hold more than one document at a time:
