It works because you've set all of the shingles to be at the same position - probably better
to change the one instance of .setPositionIncrement(0) to .setPositionIncrement(1) - that
way, MultiPhraseQuery will not be invoked, and the standard disjunction thing should happen.

The issue is not directly related to whether a unigram is involved, but rather whether or
not tokens that begin at the same word are given the same position.  The option thus should
be named something like "coterminalPositionIncrement".  This seems like a reasonable addition,
and a patch likely would be accepted, if it included unit tests.
