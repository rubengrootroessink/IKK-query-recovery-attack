Hi Manjula,

It's not terribly clear what you're doing here - I got lost in your description of your (two?
or maybe four?) classes.  Sometimes things are easier to understand if you provide more concrete
detail.

I suspect that you could benefit from reading the book Lucene in Action, 2nd edition: 

   http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/

You would also likely benefit from using Luke, the Lucene index browser, to better understand
your indexes' contents and debug how queries match documents:

I think your question is whether you're using Analyzers correctly.  It sounds like you are
creating two separate indexes (one for each of your classes), and you're using SnowballAnalyzer
on the indexing side for both indexes, and StandardAnalyzer on the query side.  

The usual advice is to use the same Analyzer on both the query and the index side.  But it
appears to be the case that you are taking stemmed index terms from your index #1 and then
querying index #2 using these stemmed terms.  If this is true, then you want the query-time
analyzer in your second index not to change the query terms.  You'll likely get better results
using WhitespaceAnalyzer, which tokenizes on whitespace and does no further analysis, rather
than StandardAnalyzer.

Steve
