Hi Martin,

StandardTokenizer and -Analyzer have been changed, as of future version 3.1 (the next release)
to support the Unicode segmentation rules in UAX#29.  My (untested) guess is that your hyphenated
word will be kept as a single token if you set the version to 3.1 or higher in the constructor.
