Ranjit,

The problem is definitely the analyzer you are passing to QueryParser or MultiFieldQueryParser,
and not the parser itself.

The following tests succeed using KeywordAnalyzer, which is a pass-through analyzer (the output
is the same as the input):

  public void testSharpQP() throws Exception {
    Analyzer analyzer = new KeywordAnalyzer();
    QueryParser qp = new QueryParser
        (Version.LUCENE_30, "default_field", analyzer);
    assertEquals("+c# +.net", qp.parse
        ("c# AND .net").toString("default_field"));
  } 

  public void testSharpMFQP() throws Exception {
    Analyzer analyzer = new KeywordAnalyzer();
    String[] fields = { "one", "two"};
    MultiFieldQueryParser mfqp = new MultiFieldQueryParser
        (Version.LUCENE_30, fields, analyzer);
    assertEquals("+(one:c# two:c#) +(one:.net two:.net)", 
                 mfqp.parse("c# AND .net").toString());
  }
