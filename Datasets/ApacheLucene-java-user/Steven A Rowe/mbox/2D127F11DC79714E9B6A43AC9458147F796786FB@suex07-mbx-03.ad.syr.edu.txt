Hi Christoph,

There could be several things going on, but it's difficult to tell without more information.
 

Since excluded terms require a non-empty set from which to remove documents at the same boolean
clause level, you could try something like "title:(*:* -Datei*) avl", or "-title:Datei* avl".

Another possible problem is case.  If you downcase indexed terms, "Datei*" will not match
any of them by default, since no analysis is carried out on wildcard terms.  QueryParser has
a static method setLowercaseExpandedTerms() that you can call to turn on automatic pre-expansion
query term downcasing:
