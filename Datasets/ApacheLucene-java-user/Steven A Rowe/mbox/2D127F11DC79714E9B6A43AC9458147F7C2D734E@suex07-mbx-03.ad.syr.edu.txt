Yes, even for IW.getReader() - from <http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/NearRealtimeSearch>:

	Now Lucene offers a unified API where one calls getReader
	and any updates are immediately searchable.

I.e., the reader returned by getReader doesn't track updates; it too represents a shapshot
in time.  It's just less costly to reopen.
