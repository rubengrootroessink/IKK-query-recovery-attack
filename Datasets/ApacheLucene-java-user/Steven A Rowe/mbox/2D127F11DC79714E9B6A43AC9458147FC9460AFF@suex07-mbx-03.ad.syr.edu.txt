Ant is the official Lucene/Solr build system.  Snapshot and release artifacts are produced
with Ant.

While Maven is capable of producing artifacts, the artifacts produced in this way may not
be the same as the official Ant artifacts.  For this reason: no, the artifacts should not
be built with Maven.

Sorry, I know nothing about OSGI.

Hi.... I'm looking inside the jenkins maven repository. For example the package in https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-Solr-Maven-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/maven_artifacts/org/apache/lucene/lucene-misc/4.0-SNAPSHOT/lucene-misc-4.0-20110705.223250-1.jar
seems to be built with ant instead of maven. It is visible from the MANIFEST.MF

Is it correct? should not be built with maven? Actually maven has the OSGI support respect
to the ant version
