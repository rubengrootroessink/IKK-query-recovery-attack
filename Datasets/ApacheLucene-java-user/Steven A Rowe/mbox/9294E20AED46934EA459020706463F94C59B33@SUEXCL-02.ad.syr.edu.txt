You could guess at the useful range, though, and then have ((max n)-(min n)+1) fields, scaling
the boost for each with the corresponding value of n.  

Just using 2-grams could be good enough, since the longer the sub-phrase match, the more matching
2-grams.

In terms of your requirements, though, I think you're stuck with this inefficiency, no matter
what solution you end up with; you need to do some form of term combination in your queries.
 And the ShingleFilter approach doesn't compare badly here, since positions for phrase queries
don't have to be looked up during scoring.  

If index space efficiency is a concern, though, the one-field-per-value-of-n solution I mentioned
above could pose a problem.
