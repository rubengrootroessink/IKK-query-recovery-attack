Two things: a) This Jenkins job builds both Lucene and Solr; and b) the above non-recursive
invocation with the 'bootstrap' profile is used to install the non-mavenized dependencies
to the local repository -- the other two following invocations actually perform the build:

	>>> Installing non-mavenized deps into the maven local repo
	.../mvn --batch-mode --non-recursive -Pbootstrap install
	[...]
	>>> Clearing the Ant build output
	.../mvn --batch-mode --fail-at-end clean
	[...]
	>>> Running the Maven build without tests
	.../mvn --batch-mode --fail-at-end -DskipTests install

There is an open JIRA issue to do this - while it's nominally a Solr issue, the fix would
apply to both Lucene and Solr:

	https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2634

FYI, in addition to exercising the Maven build using 'mvn install' and 'mvn test', the nightly
Jenkins Maven jobs also run 'ant generate-maven-artifacts', and then publish the results.
 See this wiki page for details, including how to refer to these published snapshot artifacts
from your POM:
