Can you expand on this too? What kind of "incredible bugs" did you see? Without feedback there
is little progress, so bug reports count.

Sorry, I'll withdraw that. I was getting all kinds of stacktraces and exceptions when I tried
to do searches but the problem was my fault. Because I wanted to use my own analyzer  I had
a shells script that added it to the classpath when I ran luke, however I had put it before
the ant jar and my jar built with maven also included lucene 3.0.3 and because luke 1.0.1
is packaged with 3.0.0 it was confusing it, but I didnt realize this until I notice done exception
complained a lucene method was missing.

But having got it working I cannot see anything to help me work out why the queries are taking
too long, is it useful for this or just for refining your queries ?
