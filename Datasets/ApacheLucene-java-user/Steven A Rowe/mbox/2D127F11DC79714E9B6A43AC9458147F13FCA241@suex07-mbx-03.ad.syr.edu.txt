As long as you don't want any transformation performed on the phrase or its components, you
can add your phrase as a "keyword", i.e. a non-analyzed string that will be indexed as-is.

Unless your phrase field will be the only field on this document (pretty unlikely), you'll
want to use PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper[1] over KeywordAnalyzer[2] for the phrase field, and whatever
other analyzer you like for the other document field(s).

AFAICT, you don't need ShingleFilter.
