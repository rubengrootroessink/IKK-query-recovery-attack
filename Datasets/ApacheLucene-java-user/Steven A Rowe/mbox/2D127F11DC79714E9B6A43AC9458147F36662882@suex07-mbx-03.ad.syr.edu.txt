SUBJECT: RE: Lucene query with long strings
DATE: 23 Mar 2010

Hi Aaron,

Your "false positives" comments point to a mismatch between what you're currently asking Lucene
for (any document matching any one of the terms in the query) and what you want (only fully
"correct" matches).

You need to identify the terms of the query that MUST match and tell Lucene about it ("+"
syntax is understood by QueryParser to mean a required term).

If your queries come from sources that don't reliably match the indexes values, you may need
to use synonyms to map between e.g. "California" and "CA", and then require that at least
one of the synonyms matches (e.g. "+(California CA)").
