You might consider, instead of performing reverse search, just querying all of your locations
against one document at a time using Lucene's MemoryIndex, which is very fast: 

<http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_0/api/all/org/apache/lucene/index/memory/MemoryIndex.html>

If you decide to go the reverse search route, Lucene's InstantiatedIndex is also very fast,
and unlike MemoryIndex, can handle more than one document at a time:|

<http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_0/api/all/org/apache/lucene/store/instantiated/package-summary.html>
