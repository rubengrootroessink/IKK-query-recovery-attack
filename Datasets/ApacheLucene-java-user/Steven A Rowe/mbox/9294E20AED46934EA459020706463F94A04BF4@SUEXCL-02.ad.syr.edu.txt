I was unable to follow your link -- I get the message "The page cannot be found" -- but Google's
cache came to my rescue:

<http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:vJo1ye09MzYJ:www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/Languages/persian_not_farsi.htm+persian+farsi+site:cais-soas.com&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a>

The article makes fine logical arguments against the use of "Farsi", but clearly does not
take a balanced point of view on the controversy.

I count myself among the ignorant - I had not realized that "Farsi" was a politically charged
term.  That said, I don't plan on refusing to use the term.  I'll just think about the impact
of the choice (now that I'm aware there is one) before I do use it.

Thanks for the pointer.  Knowledge is good.

Steve
