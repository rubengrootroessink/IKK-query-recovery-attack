Hi Esra,

Caveat: I don't speak, read, write, or dream in Farsi - I just know that it mostly shares
its orthography with Arabic, and that they are both written and read right-to-left.

How are you constructing the queries?  Using QueryParser?  If so, then I suspect the problem
is that you intend the range you supply to be read entirely right-to-left, but Lucene instead
reads it left-to-right.  Have you tried using e.g. "د-ژ" instead of "د-ژ"?  (That is,
placing the lower valued term on the left instead of the right.)

AFAICT, RangeFilter (called from ConstantScoreRangeQuery, which is called from QueryParser)
does not test whether lowerTerm is in fact lower than upperTerm.  If it turns out that the
problem is simply one of order, it might make sense to modify RangeFilter so that it flip
them when lowerTerm > upperTerm.
