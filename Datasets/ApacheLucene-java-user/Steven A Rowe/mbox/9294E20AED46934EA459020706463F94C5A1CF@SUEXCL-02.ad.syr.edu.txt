Hi Dino,

The Lucene KeywordTokenizer is about as simple as tokenizers get - it just outputs its entire
input as a single token:

<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KeywordTokenizer.java?revision=687357&view=markup>

Check out the source code for other Tokenizer descendants in the Lucene source for more hints.
 Warning: a few of them are generated by scanner generator tools (JavaCC and JFlex), so the
code is a bit impenetrable in places.

To set the position for a Token, call its setPositionIncrement() method.  From the javadocs:

    Set the position increment.  This determines the position of
    this token relative to the previous Token in a TokenStream,
    used in phrase searching.

(Read the rest of the javadoc for that method.  Go on, you know you want to.)

Good luck,
Steve
