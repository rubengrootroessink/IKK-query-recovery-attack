Which version of Lucene are you using?  Is it the same on both machines?

I ask because Lucene recently switched StandardTokenizer lexer generation from JavaCC to JFlex,
for performance reasons (increased throughput).

Also, my email viewer displays the word in question as the following sequence of characters:

 1. Capital "C"
 2. Capital "A" with a tilda ("~") above it
 3. Left parenthesis
 4. Lowercase "c"
 5. Right parenthesis
 6. Lowercase "s"
 7. Lowercase "a"
 8. Lowercase "r"

Is this the correct character sequence? (Sometimes UTF-8 can look similar to this when it's
interpreted as Latin-1.)

Steve
