ShingleFilter has nothing to do with phrase queries (other than the fact that it can be used
to replace them in some circumstances).

I'm not an expert on Solr query parsing, but there *must* be a way to submit a query that
is not turned into a phrase query.  Really.  

And if you have configured an analyzer that includes a query-time filter, it should be invoked,
regardless of whether a phrase query is constructed.
