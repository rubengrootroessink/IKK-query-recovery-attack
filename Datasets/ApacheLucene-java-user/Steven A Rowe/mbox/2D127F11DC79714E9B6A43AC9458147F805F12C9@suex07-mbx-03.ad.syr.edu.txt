Sorry, releases are not scheduled.

There is a general feeling that a 3.1 release could happen fairly soon, though.

Currently, there is a push to improve test coverage and fix bugs that shake out as a result.

As another measure of how close the release is, you can check here to see how many issues
remain targeting the 3.1 release - once these go to zero, a release is likely imminent:

Lucene open/reopened fix for 3.1: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?sorter/field=priority&resolution=-1&pid=12310110&fixfor=12314822>
 
Solr open/reopened fix for 3.1: 
<https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?sorter/field=priority&resolution=-1&pid=12310230&fixfor=12314371>

My estimate of when a release will occur: sometime in the next two or three months.

The 3.X branch (where the 3.1 release will be cut from) is quite stable - you should consider
using it even pre-release.
