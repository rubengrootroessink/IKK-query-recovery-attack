Hi Andy,

From the API docs for IndexWriter <http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_2/api/all/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html>:

	[D]ocuments are added with addDocument and removed
	with deleteDocuments(Term) or deleteDocuments(Query).
	A document can be updated with updateDocument (which
	just deletes and then adds the entire document).
	When finished adding, deleting and updating documents, 
	close should be called.

	These changes .... are not visible to IndexReader
	until either commit() or close() is called.

So you gotta call commit() or close().  Once you've done that, you can reduce the (expensive)
cost of opening a new IndexReader by calling reopen():

<http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_2/api/all/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#reopen%28%29>
