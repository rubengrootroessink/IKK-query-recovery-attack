Hi Ryan,

I'm not sure Lucene's the right tool for this job.

I have used regular expressions and ternary search trees in the past to do similar things.

Is the set of keywords too large for an in-memory solution like these?  If not, consider using
a tool like the Perl package Regex::PreSuf <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Regex-PreSuf/>
- it can convert a list of strings into a compact set of alternations, which you can then
import into a Java program.  (I'm not aware of any similar Java tools.)
