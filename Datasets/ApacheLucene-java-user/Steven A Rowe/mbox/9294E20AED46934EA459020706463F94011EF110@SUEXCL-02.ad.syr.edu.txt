"Shingle" is not a Lucene-specific term - here's an entry, e.g., from an
IBM "Glossary of terms for enterprise search" at
<http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/discover/v8r5m0/index.jsp?topi

shingle

    A string of consecutive tokens (words) that are taken from a
sentence. For example, from "This is a very short sentence.", the 3-word
shingles (or trigrams) are:

    This is a
    is a very
    a very short
    very short sentence

    Shingles can be used in statistical linguistics. For example, if two
different texts have a lot of common shingles, the texts are probably
related somehow.

The earliest usage I can find is Andrei Broder et al.'s 1997 report
"Syntactic Clustering of the Web":

I first saw the term in Broder's 2000 paper "Identifying and Filtering
Near-Duplicate Documents":
