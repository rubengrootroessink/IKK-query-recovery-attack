Andy, it sounds like you're doing the right thing.

Maybe you aren't using the IndexReader instance returned by reopen(), but instead are continuing
to use the instance on which you called reopen()?  It's tough to figure this kind of thing
out without looking at the code.

For example, what do you mean by "singleton"? (You mentioned this in reference to both IndexWriter
and IndexReader.)  Is it possible that some part of your code is maintaining a reference to
the original IndexReader instance and using it, rather than using the newly opened instance?

Steve
