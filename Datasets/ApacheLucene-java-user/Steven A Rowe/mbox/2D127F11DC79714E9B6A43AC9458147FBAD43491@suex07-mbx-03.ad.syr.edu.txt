Hi Ivan,

You do have rights to submit fixes to Lucene - everyone does!

Here's how: http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/HowToContribute

Please create a patch, create an issue in JIRA, and then attach the patch to the JIRA issue.
 When you do this, you are asked to state that you grant license to your work; this is very
important for Apache software projects.  All JIRA issue creation and modification events are
automatically posted to the dev@lucene.apache.org mailing list, so all Lucene developers will
see your work.

Thanks,
Steve
