FROM: Steven A Rowe <sar...@syr.edu>
SUBJECT: [RESULTS] [POLL] Where do you get Lucene/Solr from?  Maven?  ASF Mirrors?
DATE: 9 Feb 2011

I tabulated responses to this poll.

See the attached Excel spreadsheet or .csv file for details (they both contain the same info).

Results:

    # Respondents: 77*
      ASF Mirrors: 39 (51%)
       Maven Repo: 45 (58%)
Build from source: 35 (45%)
            Other:  4  (5%)

*Lance Norskog responded, but with none of the four standard responses, and so was excluded
from the respondent count; the attached spreadsheet nevertheless includes his comment.
