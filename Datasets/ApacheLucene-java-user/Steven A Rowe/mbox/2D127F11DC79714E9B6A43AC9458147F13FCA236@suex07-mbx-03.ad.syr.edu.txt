Yes, though it is the tokenizer and previous filters in the chain that will be the (potential)
source of difficulties, not ShingleFilter.

ShingleFilter just pastes together the tokens produced by the previous component in the analysis
chain, in a sliding window.  As currently written, it doesn't provide the sort of functionality
you seem to be asking for.

What do your documents look like?  What do you hope to accomplish using ShingleFilter?  It's
tough to give advice without knowing what you want to do.
