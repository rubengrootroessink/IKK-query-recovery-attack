SUBJECT: RE: Question: Using Shingle Analyzer NGramAnalyzerWrapper in Lucene
DATE: 26 Feb 2008

Hi Stanley,

I modernized the files in LUCENE-400 a bit - you can see the details in comments I made on
the issue.  The results, including all files needed to address the issue, are in the file
attached to the issue named "LUCENE-400.patch".

I can tell you aren't using the modernized version because I changed the file names, from
NGram* to Shingle*, to avoid conflict with the pre-existing ngram* stuff.

I don't know, however, whether the new patch will apply and build cleanly in the 2.2.0 code
base, since it was targetted at the trunk circa version 2.3.

Take a look at ShingleAnalyzerWrapperTest.java in the new patch - like you did, the tests
there wrap WhitespaceAnalyser.

If switching to the new code doesn't fix the issue for you, could you add a comment to the
issue describing your inputs, and expected and actual outputs?  Or, even better, write a unit
test to cover your case.

Thanks,
Steve
