This is only true on a per-feature basis.  For example, if feature A is deprecated in v3.1,
and feature B is deprecated in v3.2, then v3.3 will be "compat" with v3.2 only as far as feature
B is concerned; feature A will no longer be present in v3.3.

Under these circumstances, saying "v3.3 will be compat with v3.2" with no caveats sounds to
me like false advertising.
