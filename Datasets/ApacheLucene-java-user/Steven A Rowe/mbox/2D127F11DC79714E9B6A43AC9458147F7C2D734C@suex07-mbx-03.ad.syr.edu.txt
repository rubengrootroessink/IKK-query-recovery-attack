> Hi all,
> 
> The JavaDocs do not appear to mention that only stored fields persist
> IndexWriter.updateDocument. When opening new readers, from either
> IndexWriter.getReader or IndexReader.open, neither TermDocs nor
> IndexSearcher
> will find terms in fields which weren't stored.
> 
> Existing readers, however, do continue to find such terms after
> updateDocument
> has been called. At best, this is confusing. Is this a defect?
