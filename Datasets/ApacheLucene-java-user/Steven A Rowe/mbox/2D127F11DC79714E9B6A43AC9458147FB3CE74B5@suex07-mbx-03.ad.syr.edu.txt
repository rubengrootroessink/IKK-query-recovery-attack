Hi Cheng,

Lucene 3.3 does not exist - do you mean branches/branch_3x ?

FYI, as of Lucene 3.1, there is an Ant target you can use to setup an Eclipse project for
 Lucene/Solr - run this from the top level directory of a full source tree (including dev-tools/
directory) checked out from Subversion: 

   ant eclipse

More info here:
