Hi Gaurav,

To which mime types are you referring?

I can't think of a tool designed for this, but one thing you might try is checking whether
the input is compressed/packed, and if so first decompressing/unpacking it, and then using
the "strings" program (available on Linux and Cygwin) to extract string data.
