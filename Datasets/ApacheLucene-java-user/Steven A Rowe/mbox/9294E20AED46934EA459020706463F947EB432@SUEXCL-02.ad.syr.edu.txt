Thanks, Grant, you're absolutely right.

I stand corrected: Lucene does, in fact, store per-field boosts at index-time[1], and then
uses them at query-time to score documents.  As Grant indicates, the Field.setBoost() method
is how to set them.

(It would be nice if Lucene had a facility to set a global field boost for all the documents
in an index.)

Itamar, the details of how field boosts are used are worth checking out (the link below is
to the 1.4.3 version):

<http://lucene.apache.org/java/1_4_3/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html#setBoost(float)>

In particular, this part is less than obvious:

    If a document has multiple fields with the same
    name, all such values are multiplied together.

So if you were to add multiple Field instances with the same name to a document, as you do
in your example, the field boost for the document is the *product* of the boosts set on each
Field instance added to the document.  One way to get around this problem is to call setBoost()
just once on each document for each of the different field names.  This works because the
default boost assigned to the other instances is 1.

[1] It's worth noting, as the above-linked documentation for Field.setBoost() does, that field
boosts are not stored independently of other normalization factors in the index.
