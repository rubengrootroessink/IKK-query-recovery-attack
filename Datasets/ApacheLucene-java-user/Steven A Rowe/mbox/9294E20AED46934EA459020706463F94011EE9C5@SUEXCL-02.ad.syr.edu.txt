Hi Nitin,

Lucene in Action 2nd edition <http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/> is a
good place to start.

If you want free stuff, check out the Lucene wiki Resources page:
<http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/Resources>.  Also, some basic code
on the wiki: <http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/TheBasics>.
