The java.util.regex.Pattern implementation (the default RegexQuery implementation) actually
uses Matcher.lookingAt(), which is equivalent to prepending a "^" anchor to the beginning
of the pattern, so if Huntsman84 is using the default implementation, then I agree with Ian:
I'm surprised it matches either.  

However, the Jakarta Regexp implementation uses RE.match(), which does *not* require a beginning-of-string
match.  

Hunstman84, are you using the Jakarta Regexp implementation?  If so, then like you, I'm surprised
it's not matching both :).

It would be useful to see some real code, including how you index your records.
