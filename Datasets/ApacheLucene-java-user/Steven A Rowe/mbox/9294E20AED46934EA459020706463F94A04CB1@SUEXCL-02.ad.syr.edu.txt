DATE: 11 May 2008

Hi Esra,

Did you try the new version of the patch?

In the latest verson, I have taken the code that was in CollatingRangeQuery and put it into
RangeQuery.

I also put the same functionality into RangeFilter, and provided code to call it from ConstantScoreRangeQuery
and QueryParser.  Note that ConstantScoreRangeQuery doesn't have the clause limit restriction
that RangeQuery has (1024 max clauses, IIRC).
