Hi Dragon Fly,

You could split the original document into multiple Lucene Documents,
one for each array index, all sharing the same "DocID" field value.

Then your queries "just work".  But you'd have to do result
consolidation, removing duplicate original docs when you get matches at
multiple array indexes from the same original doc.
