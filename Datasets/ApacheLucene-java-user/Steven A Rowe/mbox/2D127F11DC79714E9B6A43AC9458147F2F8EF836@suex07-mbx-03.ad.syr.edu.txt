Alex,

That's right, you'll have to roll your own if you want to do cross-language search in Lucene.
 But some of the components you need are available.

Two possible cross-language search strategies don't scale well when the document collection
size is non-trivial: a) translating all documents into all possible query languages; and b)
requiring all documents and queries to use "controlled vocabulary", with fully mapped correspondences
between languages.

The most commonly chosen strategy is to translate the query into the language(s) of the documents.
 Typically, because queries are so short, machine translation is overkill, since it depends
on larger context for accuracy than is available.  So people generally use bi-lingual dictionaries,
sometimes combined with stemming and/or stopword removal, to convert queries into the language(s)
of the documents.

Lucene does have analyzers (some or all of: tokenizers, stemmers and stopword lists) for several
languages, but these are monolingual in nature.

Lucene does not have bi-lingual dictionaries.  You would have to supply these.

You didn't directly say so, but if you're unsure of the language of any of your content, you'll
also need to be able to identify it.  Nutch, a Lucene sub-project, has language identification
code.
