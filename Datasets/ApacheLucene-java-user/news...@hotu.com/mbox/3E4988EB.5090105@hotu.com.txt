Can BooleanClause be made serializable?

I am constructing a compound query object in a servlet, and sending it 
to my back-end server which performs a lucene search and returns the 
results.  All of the classes I need to construct my query are 
serializable (i.e., Term, Query, BooleanQuery, RangeQuery...) except for 
BooleanClause.  In fact, I'm not even creating BooleanClause, so I 
assume Boolean Query (which _is_ tagged as serializable) is creating it 
internally.
