I did this just yesterday (on Linux, but that shouldn't matter).  First, 
I'd like to suggest to whomever, that the documentation be updated to 
say JavaCC 2.1, since I've confirmed it works.

Emma, you must unzip the zip file.  It contains a Java executable 
(.class) file, which you must run to install the JavaCC application (a 
la:  "java ClassName").  This initiates a graphical install process. 
 Once you've done that, note the directory that you've installed the 
application into, and specify that in your property file.
