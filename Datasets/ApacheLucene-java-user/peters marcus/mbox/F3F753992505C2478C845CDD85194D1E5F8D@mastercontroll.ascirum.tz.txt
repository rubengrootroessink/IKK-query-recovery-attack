Doug thanks for your answer,

I currently use the .NET implementation of lucene 1.3 and we want to
enable some semantic retrieval features. To create any associations
between words and documents we need to know all words in a given
document. 

Cause I don't know how fast the .NET implementation of lucene 1.4 will
come out... is it possible to run a method like getTermFreqVectors on a
lucene
1.3 implementation ?

Thanks for any response,

Marcus

Yes, in the 1.4 release:

eader.html#getTermFreqVectors(int)
