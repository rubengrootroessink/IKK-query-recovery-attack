There is one situation where comparison is viable. When the input is an
existing document (ie - using the mlt function or doing a simple query using
a document's title/body). In such cases, the score of the document to itself
(which will hopefully be the max score in the result set) is the scaling
factor. With this approach we can answer the question "are docs A and B more
similar than docs C and D".

This may even be the approach used by carrot for clustering, though I
haven't looked into how it generates its similarity matrix. (note - it's
also possible that the scores between two docs aren't bi-directional,
meaning A is more similar to B than B is to A)

Perhaps treating each query as a document would allow lucene to return the
max score possible for that query (the match to itself), and then scale
documents from there. Yes, there are lots of challenges to actually doing
this since you wouldn't want to actually add a temporary doc to the index.

I know this topic usually morphs into assessing if a percentage-match is
useful. While I agree that scaled/normalized scores are prone to misuse, we
need a way to know if there are any good results, not just what the best
results are. One use case is when users submit content similar to existing
content and you'd like to alert them to the near-duplicate before
proceeding. Obviously you only want to prompt them if there are close
matches, and currently lucene only offers a way to get the most similar
docs, not a way to determine if any are actually similar.
