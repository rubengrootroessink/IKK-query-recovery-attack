SUBJECT: Re: Where to find drill-down examples (source code)
DATE: 26 Sep 2006


I there a link to a zip file where I can get the entire package of source
files (version 2, please).  I know I am able to view them in the Source
Repository (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/trunk/), but I do not
really feel like going through each of those to download them all.  I am
looking for a one stop shop here.
