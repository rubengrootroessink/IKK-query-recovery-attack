DATE: 20 Jan 2010

Hi, I am using Lucene for the same purpose since years.
I import an XML files with records, and in Lucene there is a special
field, which stores the original XML (this used for displaying
with XSLT), the other fields are for searching. There is a webform,
where the users can modify the data. If users click "submit"
the application re-creates the XML and the normal fields.
I have an 'exporter' utility, which can dump the XML fields into
one file - this is used for creating a backup of data.

(I prefer to store the non binary data for archival purpose, than
an older Lucene index (or MySQL table) - I got very wrong
experience with incopatibily issues of MS Word, PDF etc.
formats.)
