SUBJECT: Lucene to index OCR text
DATE: 25 Jan 2008

I've been poking around the list archives and didn't really come up against
anything interesting. Anyone using Lucene to index OCR text? Any
strategies/algorithms/packages you recommend?
 
I have a large collection (10^7 docs) that's mostly the result of OCR. We
index/search/etc. with Lucene without any trouble, but OCR errors are a
problem, when doing exact phrase matches in particular. I'm looking for
ideas on how to deal with this thorny problem.
