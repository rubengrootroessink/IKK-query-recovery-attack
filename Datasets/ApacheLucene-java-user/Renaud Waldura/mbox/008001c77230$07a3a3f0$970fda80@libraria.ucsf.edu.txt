SUBJECT: RE: More Precise Highlighting (MY SOLUTION)
DATE: 29 Mar 2007

After much head-scratching and re-reading of posts around this issue, I
found a solution by writing my own QueryTermExtractor. Thanks for the help
everyone. 

To recap, I wanted to get more "precise" highlighting by having just the
"right" fields highlighted. My original example was a field named "metadata"
which is the concatenation of some metadata about the document (author,
title, etc.) This field is indexed and not stored. Users are able to run
queries such as "metadata:myauthor", and expect the "title" field to be
highlighted in the search results when it contains "myauthor".

With the stock highlighter, I had 2 choices: a- highlight all occurrences of
"myauthor" in all the fields (not good) or b- highlight occurrences of
"myauthor" in just the "metadata" field. This field doesn't exist per se in
the document, and no highlighting was produced at all. Not good either.

Basically I needed to map "index-only" fields (indexed, not stored) to the
actual (stored) fields that make up this field. Mark gave my the key by
mentioning the QueryTermExtractor just produces a list of strings. 

I wrote a custom QueryTermExtractor (copy, paste, hack) that has knowledge
of my indexing schema and knows how to map index-only fields to actual
fields, therefore generating the right set of WeightedTerm[] passed to the
QueryScorer constructor. 

I hope this will make sense to the (future) reader who ran into this problem
also.

I think the solution is fairly simple.
Pass the "metadata" fieldname to the QueryTermExtractor - not the fieldname
"author". QueryTermExtractor effectively provides just a list of strings (no
fieldnames) which are then matched against strings found in the tokenStream
which represents your content.
Because your query did not contain any "author:apple" clauses
QueryTermExtractor produced no strings for highlighting when you asked for
the field.

Cheers
