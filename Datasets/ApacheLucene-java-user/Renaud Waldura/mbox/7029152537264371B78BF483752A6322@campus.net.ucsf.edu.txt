There is quite a bit of litterature available on this topic. This paper
presents a summary. Nothing immediately applicable I'm afraid.

Retrieving OCR Text: A survey of current approaches

It lists a number of other papers that are easy to find online. Let me know
what you find, I'm interested in this too.

Subject: Use of scanned documents for text extraction and indexing


Hi All:

Is there any study / research done on using scanned paper documents as
images (may be PDF), and then use some OCR or other technique for extracting
text, and the resultant index quality?


Thanks in advance,
