Read my own complaints about QueryParser here:

You're in for a surprise. As alluded by Erick, the stock QP doesn't quite do
what one (legitimately IMO) expects.

for an exposition by Chris about how these operate. This may change what you
expect to come back from the parser... If it doesn't, then maybe someone
else can chime in <G>...
