The author of the presentation I linked to earlier pointed me to this:

Which is implemented by:

Thanks everyone for their ideas and suggestions! Some had occurred to us but
were discarded because we feel our solution needs to be automated --
45 million pages are a lot of thrust on any human-driven effort.

I like Itamar's idea of doing "competing" OCR, and keeping the best result.
Unfortunately OCR software is far from cheap, and the cost of 2 different
product licenses may be too high for the project.

I've also looked into the Tesseract/OCRopus, but while the ideas are good it
ain't there yet.
