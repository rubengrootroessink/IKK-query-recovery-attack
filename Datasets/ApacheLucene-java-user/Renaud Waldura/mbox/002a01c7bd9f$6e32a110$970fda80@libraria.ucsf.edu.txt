SUBJECT: Lucene Wiki Editing Guidelines
DATE: 3 Jul 2007

Regarding the Lucene Wiki, is there an editing policy or should I feel free
to change stuff as I see fit? E.g. I've added a page LuceneCaveats, and now
I want to edit http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ConceptsAndDefinitions and
add a "Core Classes" section, and refactor that page.
