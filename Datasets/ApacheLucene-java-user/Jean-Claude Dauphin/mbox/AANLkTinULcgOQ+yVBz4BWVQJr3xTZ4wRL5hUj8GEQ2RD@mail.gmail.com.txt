SUBJECT: Indexing a date from a POJO
DATE: 7 Feb 2011

Hi,

I would like to know if the code below  is correct, because the date is not
well displayed in Luke

I have a POJO with a date defined as follow:

public class SolrPositionDTO {

  @Field
  private String address;

  @Field
  private Date beginDate;

And in the schema config file the field is defined as:
<field name="beginDate" type="date" indexed="true" stored="true" />

Thanks in advance for yr help

JCD
