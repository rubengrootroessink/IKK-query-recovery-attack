DATE: 1 Mar 2005

I'm also interested in knowing what can change the doc numbers.

Does this happen frequently?  Like Stanislav has been asking... what sort of
operations on the index cause the document number to change for any given
document?  If the document numbers change frequently, is there a
straightforward way to modify Lucene to keep the document numbers the same for
the life of the document?  I'd like to have mappings in my sql database that
point to the document numbers that Lucene search returns in its Hits objects.

Thanks,
