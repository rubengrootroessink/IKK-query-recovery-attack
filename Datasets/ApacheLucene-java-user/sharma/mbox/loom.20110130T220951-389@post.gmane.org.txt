 With a little logic on your size to count, you can use SpanQueries to do that.

 Hi ,
 
       I have started to use Lucene for searching in HTML files. Is it
 possible to get Hits per document, when we search for phrases like "Hello
 World" and wild card searches like "te?t"?
 
 I managed to return the number of hits per document if there is only one
 term using termfrequency vector.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Sharma
