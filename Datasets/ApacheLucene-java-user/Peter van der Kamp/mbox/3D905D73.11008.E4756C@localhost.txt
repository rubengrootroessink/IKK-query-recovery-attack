SUBJECT: Searching for all occurrences of a word in document
DATE: 24 Sep 2002

Hello,

We are currently investigating if Lucene can be used 
for our indexing purposes.
One of the requirements is that we can retrieve all 
the occurrences of a word in a document.
When searching for 'water' we want output like:
document X: water 100
document X: water 250
document X: water 300
document X: water 416
document X: water 617

document Y: water 30
document X: water 4118
document X: water 4170
 
where the number after 'water' represents the 
position within the document. We need this kind of 
indexing because its not the document thats 
important, but the context of the word is important
for our purposes.
Is this kind of indexing c.q. searching possible 
with Lucene?

Peter van der Kamp
