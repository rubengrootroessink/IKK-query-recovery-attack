Hi John,

I am not sure about the way Solr implements range query.
But it looks like, that Solr is using 
org.apache.lucene.search.ConstantScoreRangeQuery
which itself is using
org.apache.lucene.search.RangeFilter

So Solr do not rewrite the query to a large Boolean SHOULD, but it is
reading all terms for the "range"-Field.
This could be slow. 
If the RangeFilter is used many time a CachingWrapperFilter would speed up
the search.
You also could (try to) read the terms from memory instead of hard disk.
Because a timestamp is only a long = 64bit, a appropriate solution would
also to store the timestamps in main memory for a fast RangeFilter
implementation.

Best regards
   Karsten
