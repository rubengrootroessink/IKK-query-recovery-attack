Hi John,

I intended to compare xtf with hierarchical facet browsing in browseengine
(selection expansion).
I found PathFacetCountCollector/PathFacetHandler#getFacetsForPath, and I
think that the implementation in xtf has a lot of advantages. 
So I suggest you to reuse the xtf-source for that (GroupCounts.addDoc in
package org.cdlib.xtf.textEngine.facet).

Best regads
  Karsten
