DATE: 31 Jul 2008


Hi Ganesh,

in this Thread nobody said, that lucene is a good storage server.
Only "it could be used as storage server" (Grant: Connect data storage with
simple, fast lookup and Lucene..)

I don't now about automatic rentention.
But for the rest in your list of features I suggest to take a deep look to
 - Jackrabbit (Standard jcr jsr170 implemention, I like the webDAV support)
 - dSpace (real working content repository software, with good permissions
management)

Both use lucene for searching

Best regards
    Karsten
