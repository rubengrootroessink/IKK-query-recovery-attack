Hi A.

starting point of xtf was the TEI format. I am very curious, if you find a
missing point for your needs.
(I already used it with cocoon.)

I never saw a better implementation of searching xml-aware: Each hit knows
his exact position inside the indexed(=source) xml-file :-)

I you dive into xtf, feel free to ask your questions:

Best regards
