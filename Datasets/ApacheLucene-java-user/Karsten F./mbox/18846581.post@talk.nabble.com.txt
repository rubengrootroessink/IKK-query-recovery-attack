Hi,

I want to agree with the advice of using only one index.

And I want to add two reasons:
1. Sorting and caching are working with the lucene-document-numbers.
In case of lucene "warming up" means that a lot of int-Arrays and bitsets
are stored in main memory.
If you using different MultiReader for each user all caching is also
seperately.

2. you should think about what happened, if you get new users:
Most possible you will get a user "with the same permissions as XY".
So you don't want to copy a index-file or insert a new value in an existing
document-field.
But you can easly copy the filter of an existing user.
(Which also means that I suggest not to use a field "userids with
read-permission". It is better to decouple userids and index).

But this reasons are only good for my thinking of amount of users, ratio of
deleting and adding documents and period of valid documents. 

So I again agree with Erick, that you should tell more about your use case.

Best regards

  Karsten
