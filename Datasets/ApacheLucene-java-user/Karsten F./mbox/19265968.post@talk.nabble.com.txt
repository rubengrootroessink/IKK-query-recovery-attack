Hi Markus,

hopefully someone will tell you the predefined Filter for this.

I only want to agree, that filter is the correct place for this, and that
you should be aware of the Token positions (after your filter you must have
two Tokens on the same position).

I think "WordDelimitierFilter" is a good starting point, if you have to
write this filter by your own.

best regards
  Karsten
