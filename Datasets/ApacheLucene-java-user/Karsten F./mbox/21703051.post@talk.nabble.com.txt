Hi Murali,

I think a search with 4 * 5 = 20 Boolean Clauses will not be a performance
problem 
(at least if you have only one optimized index-folder).

You also could use one Field which contains content of all other fields with
a boost factor for each term (different boost for content from different
fields).
You can do this with payloads and the BoostingTermQuery.
See e.g.
http://www.nabble.com/Newbie-Question-on---Multi-valued-Keyword-field-search-td20987615.html

But this has the drawback that you loss the original frequencies of the
fields, so possible the scoring will not show want you want.

Best regards
  Karsten
