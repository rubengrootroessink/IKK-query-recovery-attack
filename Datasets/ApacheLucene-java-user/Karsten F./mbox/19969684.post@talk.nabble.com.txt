Hi spring,
unit of retrieval in lucene is a document.
There are no joins between document sets like in sql.

What you can do is to collect all hits for each term query on level of
folders and than implement the logical „and“ or „or“ by your own.
For this you could reuse the existing implementations of „faceted browsing“
or „drill down“.

Best regards 
  Karsten
