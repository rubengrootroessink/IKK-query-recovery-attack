Hi Dave,

searching and sorting in lucene are two separate functions (if you not want
to sort by relevance).
You will not loss performance if you first search with BitSet as
HitCollector and then sort the result by DateField.
But more easy is to extend TopFieldDocCollector/TopFieldCollector to a
Collector with facet count.

Sujit Pal's implementation of facet count is a good idea if you have a small
amount of facets and a lot documents for each facet.

I know half a dozen of implementations of facet browsing.
To choose the best you have to know:
 - How many different values have the facet? Which kind of value (Integer,
small String, huge String)?
 - More then one value of the facet per document/how many in average?
 
Possible

is also interesting for you.

Best regards
