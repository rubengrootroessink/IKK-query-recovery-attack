SUBJECT: Sort results by number of document fields
DATE: 31 Jan 2011

Hi,

How can I use Lucene to sort search results by the number of fields each
document has? (highest to lowest - documents with more fields in my index
are better results)

Also my fields are named as URI's i.e. "<
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>", how should I form queries with
field names containing such syntax? How shall I pass them in, escaped?

Thanks
