DATE: 10 Oct 2005

Sorry about that, "download" was a poor word choice.

By download, I meant that after the applet opens an input stream to the
URL, it will need to read from the stream to get all the index data from
the web server to the user's machine so the applet can perform the
search. Whether the index files are downloaded and written to disk or
whether they're downloaded and cached in memory, it's still a bandwidth
consideration. As you mentioned earlier, the index files could live on
the server as zipped files, and the applet could unzip them on the fly.

Signing the applet would make things somewhat easier. But then you have
the potential problem of users who have been trained by their IT
departments (or have learned the hard way) to not accept any content
that requires specific permissions to run.
