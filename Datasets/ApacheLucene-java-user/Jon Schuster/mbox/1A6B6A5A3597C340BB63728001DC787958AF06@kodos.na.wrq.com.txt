I ran into this problem as well. I just added the throws IOException to the
constructor and to the setStemExclusionTable method and everything seems to
work fine.

The FrenchAnalyzer has dependencies on the GermanAnalyzer, and from the cvs
history, it appears that the throws clauses were added to the GermanAnalyzer
at the end of March, but the current version of the FrenchAnalyzer was
checked in a couple of weeks before the edits to GermanAnalyzer.

I get compile time errors with FrenchAnalyzer in the constructor with file
name and the method setStemExclusionTable.
Unhandled exception type IOException

How do I fix these errors? Should I just throw IOException or catch the
exception in the method and ignore.

I am using lucene 1.4 final.
