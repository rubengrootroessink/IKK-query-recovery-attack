SUBJECT: Tomcat : Indexing Sample ?
DATE: 9 Aug 2006

Hi All,

I'm a newbie to Lucene and would like to use thread instance to index my
office document I've uploaded within web application.  Is Lucene can face
concurrent indexing issue ? Is there any jsp/servlet sample that can show me
how to do that ?

Regards,

Feris
