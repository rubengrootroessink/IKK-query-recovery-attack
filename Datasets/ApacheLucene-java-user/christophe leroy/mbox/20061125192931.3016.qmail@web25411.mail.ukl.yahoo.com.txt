SUBJECT: Question about the "not" in lucene
DATE: 25 Nov 2006

Hello,

I don't understand how to use "not" with Lucene. I
think that it is not a boolean not. I read the
documentation but it is not clear enough on how the
"not" works.

For example, I tried to do this request:
type:product
--> I got 100 responses. It is normal. Then, I tried
this request:
type:product AND name:test 
--> I got 1 response. It is normal too. And when I
tried this request:
type:product AND (name:test OR NOT name:test)
--> I got 1 response only. I should normally get 100
responses if the "not" was a boolean not.

Could you explain me how the "not" works?

Thank in advance,

Christophe
