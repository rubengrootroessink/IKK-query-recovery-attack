DATE: 30 May 2003


Here is my problem:
I'm currently working on a free search engine on books;
The point is that the files are very big: a book takes about 300ko 

So when you make a query on a word it doesnt takes sense to have only the 
name of the document, but it would be more useful to get a short context: 
sentence, paragraph, 10 words before & 10 after... 

Do you know if one has an example of program that show the position of the 
words found in a text? I mean, a better solution than having to parse the 
text again. 

text:
it is raining. The cat is slepping. 

query: cat 

answer: cat, 5th word OR
   cat, 2d word of the 2d phrase AND a fonction that returns "the cat is 
raining" when we ask for the 2d phrase. 

If those functions are not main in Lucene they could be quite useful for 
research in large texts.
