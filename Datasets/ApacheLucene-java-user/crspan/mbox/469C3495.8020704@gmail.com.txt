Are we sure about KeywordAnalyzer here? Which suppose to  "Tokenizes" 
the entire stream as a single token. (useful for data like zip codes, 
ids, and some product names.)

In the scenario we are discussing,  U.S. is  just a  token within the 
text and we still would like to leverage from StandardAnalyzer for all 
other goodies. I am sorry for the incomplete set up in previous message.

More or less, I expect somewhere we can instruct StandardTokenizer.jj 
that U.S. is a special token (even it is indeed an ACRONYM) and we 
prefer to index it as U.S. as is. Can we do that?
