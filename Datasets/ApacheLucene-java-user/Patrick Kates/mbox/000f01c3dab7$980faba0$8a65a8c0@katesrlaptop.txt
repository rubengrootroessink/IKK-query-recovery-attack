Thanks for the responses everyone.  They helped lead me to my real problem.
Which I suspect is the typical uber newb mistake.  I was indexing with
SimpleAnalyzer and searching with StandardAnalyzer.

So we are now indexing AND searching with StandardAnalyzer and things are
working beautifully.

Thanks again,

pdk
