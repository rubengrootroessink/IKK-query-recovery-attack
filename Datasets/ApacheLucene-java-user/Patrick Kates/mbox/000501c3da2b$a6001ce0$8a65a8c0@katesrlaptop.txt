Hi all,

I have a text field called ACTIVE_YEAR that stores (of course) a year like
2003.  When I index this field I can see the number in my index (using Luke)
but I can't search it.  If I add a text character to the end of the field
and index it (200x) I can then search and find 'x', but not any portion of
the number.

One finally piece of info, when using Luke to view the terms contained in
the index I can find my 'x' term, but none of the years are listed as terms.

Any ideas on how to fix this?

Thanks

pdk
