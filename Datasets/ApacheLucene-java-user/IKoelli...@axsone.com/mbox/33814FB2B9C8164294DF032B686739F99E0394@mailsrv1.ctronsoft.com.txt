Would it matter if an IndexReader was opened while an index merge is in
progress?

Thanks

When you open an IndexReader, Lucene effectively takes
a "snapshot" of the index and searches it until you reopen
your reader. So the timing of when the merged index gets
used is up to you, so you should be fine.
