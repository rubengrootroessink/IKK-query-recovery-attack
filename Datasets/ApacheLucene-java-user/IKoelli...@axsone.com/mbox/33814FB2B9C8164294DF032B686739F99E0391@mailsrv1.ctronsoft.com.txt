SUBJECT: Index merge question
DATE: 10 Aug 2010

Hello,

Is there any point during a merge operation where the index cannot be
searched or is unstable? We want to create a bunch of smaller indexes in
parallel and then merge them into a single index that may have searches
running against it.

 

Thanks,

Ian Koelliker
