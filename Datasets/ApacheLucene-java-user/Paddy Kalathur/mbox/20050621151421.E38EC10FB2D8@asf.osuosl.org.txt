SUBJECT: First time user Question
DATE: 21 Jun 2005

I want Lucene to search as well as sort data . What I am not sure is, how to
index my data so that I can sort and search.

For example :  I have a 3 rows in the database with name field value
"Geoffrey Rush" , "Will Smith", and "Eva Smith" . 

I want to index these names so that :
1.If a user searches for "Smith" I get "Will Smith" and "Eva Smith" . 
2.If a user searches for "Eva Smith" I get only "Eva Smith". 
3.When I list all the names available in my Index I sort them in alphabetic
order.
4.The searches should be case insensitive.       

How should I index the data so that I can achieve the above.
