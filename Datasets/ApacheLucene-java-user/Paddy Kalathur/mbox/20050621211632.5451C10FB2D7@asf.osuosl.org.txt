If I use Field.Keyword("name", "Will Smith") to index the name, will I be
able to search for it if a user searched for just "will" or "Smith" ?  I
think Field.Keyword does not tokenize and hence I should be able to sort it
also .

Hi Paddy,

Just make sure you index the sortable fields without tokenizing them.
