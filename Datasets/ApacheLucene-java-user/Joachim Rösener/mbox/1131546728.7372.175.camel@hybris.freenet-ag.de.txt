What else?! :-)

Hmm, when I catched Throwable t (instead of IOException e) around
IndexSearcher.search() I realized the stackTrace created by
org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses in my log ...
Thanks for your hint, this was really helpful!

Improvement suggestion:
Maybe TooManyClauses should not extend RuntimeException
(so that it has to be catched)?

Yours sincerely,
Joachim Roesener.
