SUBJECT: Release schedule?
DATE: 4 Mar 2003

Hi,

We are incorporating Lucene in a CMS.  It does some quite fancy matching and searching of
documents and uses Lucene as one of its components.  We would like to influence the scoring
of search terms for some fields.  This is possible with the new Similarity class that is implemented
after release 1.2.

Is there a next release scheduled?  And so, when (approximately will that be)?

We would like to run the cms with tested code and not with the code from the lucene cvs...

Greetings, 

Marc Worrell
