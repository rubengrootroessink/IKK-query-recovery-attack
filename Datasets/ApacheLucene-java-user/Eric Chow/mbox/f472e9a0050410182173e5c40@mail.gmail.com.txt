Hello,

If I don't know the language of the input terms, how can I use
different analyzer to search it ?

For example, the input box accepts UTF-8 search text, they can be
anything, such as Chinese, Japanese, English, Russian, Deuch, etc. How
can search any of them or all of them with Lucene?

Any example, please?


Best Regards,
Eric
