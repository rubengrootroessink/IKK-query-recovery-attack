SUBJECT: Lucene internal document number?
DATE: 6 Aug 2004

hi there,

a have a short question it's regarding lucene internal document numbers: 
can you give me an idea where they are written into the index and how 
they are generated?
i looked around through the source but i dont get it. i also read the 
faq and i know that numbers are incremental for each index and start by 
0 and change when optimizing and so one...

i looked at the doc writers in lucene, but i dont get the point where 
numbers are given and written (i assume by using writeVInt() or 
something like that).

it would be very kind if anyone can tell me what line in which file i 
had to look for.

thanks in andvance and kind regards from berlin, germany.

bastian
