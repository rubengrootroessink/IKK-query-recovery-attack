SUBJECT: How not to show results with the same score?
DATE: 25 Aug 2004

hi there,

i browsed through the list and had some different searches but i do not 
find, what i'm looking for.

i got an index which is generated by a bot, collecting websites. there 
are sites like www.domain.de/article/1 and www.domain.de/article/1?page=1
these different urls have the same content and when u search for a word, 
matching, both are returned, which is correct.

they have excatly the same score because of there content an so one, so 
i would like to know if its possible "to group by" (mysql, of course) 
the returned score, so that only the first match is collected into 
"Hits" and all following matches with the same score are ignored.

it would be great if anyone has an idea how to do that.

thanks and have a nice day.
bastian
