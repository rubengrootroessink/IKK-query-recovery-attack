Thanks, for posting the "more like this" code.  I just began coding my 
cosine similarity and need some help.  Can anyone tell me in which file 
are the methods of the DefaultSimilarity methods called?

For example, looking at the tf method i see that it takes in a float for 
freq instead of int. So i'm curious to see how this method is invoked.

Thanks.
