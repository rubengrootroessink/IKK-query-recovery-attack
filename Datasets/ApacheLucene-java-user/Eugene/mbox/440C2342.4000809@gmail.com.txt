Hi,

Since i'm using a boolean OR query i figured it must be related to the 
BooleanScorer (though there's a more complicated BooleanScorer2 which 
I'm not sure when it's use).

Looking at the BooleanScorer code it's probably a little over my head as 
I'm still a beginner to Lucene.

But, I would appreciate if someone could point me to the method where 
the searcher iterates over all query terms and outputs the score. I grep 
  both the Searcher classes and the BooleanScorer classes but can't find it.

Also, I would like to know whether will the sloppyFreq "kick in" if I'm 
just using a Boolean OR query or is this only for phrase queries? And 
how do I disable this so that it'll always be 1.0 without overwriting 
the method?

Thanks for all the help so far.
