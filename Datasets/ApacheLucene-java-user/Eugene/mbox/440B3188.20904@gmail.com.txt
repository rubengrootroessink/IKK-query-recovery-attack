I was wondering if anyone has any idea how i can start to implement my 
own similarity. I wanna use the cosine similarity measure instead. I was 
looking through the past forums posts and saw that quite a few people 
have also discussed this, but no real method of doing it was mentioned.

Any good links on extending the similarity class? A lot of posts 
discusses David Spencer's "More Like This" but i can;t find this anywhere.

Thanks.
