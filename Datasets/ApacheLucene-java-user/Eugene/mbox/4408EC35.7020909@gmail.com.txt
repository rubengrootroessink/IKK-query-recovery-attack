I was looking at the new 1.9 api and can't seem to find this expert mode 
of searching.
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/IndexSearcher.html#search(org.apache.lucene.search.Weight,%20org.apache.lucene.search.Filter,%20org.apache.lucene.search.HitCollector)

Can you tell where i can find it?

thanks.
