SUBJECT: sumOfSquaredWeights for lengthNorm
DATE: 6 Mar 2006

Hi,

I would like to override the Similarity class lengthNorm(String 
fieldName, int numTerms) so that it behaves similar to queryNorm(float 
sumOfSquaredWeights).  So the method signature becomes lengthNorm(String 
fieldName, float sumOfSquaredWeights) where sumOfSquaredWeights = sum of 
the squares of doc term weights.

Looking at the way sumOfSquaredWeights was used in 
org.apache.lucene.search.Query weight method, I would like to have a 
weight method in org.apache.lucene.document.Field (or may be in 
org.apache.lucene.document.Document) which returns the weight based on 
the terms in the Field. Can anyone tell me how to start?

Thanks.
