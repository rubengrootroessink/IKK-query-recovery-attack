Thanks, Chris for your clear explanations, it seems there are a lot info 
on using Lucene but info for the internal workings of Lucene is hard to 
come by.

I got some more questions which I'll ask in-line.

1) I'm using the default QueryParser to parse and return a query so it's 
a Boolean-OR query. So does this mean it uses the DisjunctionSumScorer 
or something?

2) Just wondering looking at the API for BooleanQuery i saw this: "Using 
setMinimumNumberShouldMatch will force the use of BooleanWeight2, 
regardless of wether setUseScorer14(true) has been called."
What is the method setUseScorer14 about?
