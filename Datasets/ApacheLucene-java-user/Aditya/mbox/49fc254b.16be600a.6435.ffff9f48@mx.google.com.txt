SUBJECT: REPOST from another list: Question related to improving search results
DATE: 2 May 2009

Hi,

 

New to this group.

 

Question:

 

Generally sites like wikipeadia have a template and every page follows it.
These templates contains the word that occurs in every page. 

 

For example wikipedia template has the list of language in the left panel.
Now these words gets indexed every time since they are not (cannot be) stop
words. 

if user for example search for "Galego", every wikipedia page will be in the
search result which is wrong as every wikipedia page does not talk about
"Galego" 

 

Any takes on this one for how to solve this problem?

 

Best Regards,

Aditya
