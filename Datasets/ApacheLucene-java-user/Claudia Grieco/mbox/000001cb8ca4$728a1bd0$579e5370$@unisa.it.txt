SUBJECT: R: Retrieve found keywords from document
DATE: 25 Nov 2010

What I call "profile" is free text (extracted from a pdf) and not the result
of the user listing hobbies in a form
So to store hobbies in a field called "hobbies" I have to extract hobbies
from text first...is it possible to do it using Lucene?

Can't you just store the hobbies as standard stored fields
(Field.Store.YES), or as a single field, call doc.get("hobbies") and
do what you want with them?

This sounds rather like faceting - if so you might want to consider
using Solr.  http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrFacetingOverview
