There are no plans to do this. It's essentially impossible, given (1)
the reverse nature of text indexes and (2) Lucene's write-once segment
architecture.

I know this has been asked before, but I'd like to ask once more for
peace of mind.

 

Is there a way to do single field inserts/updates without deleing and
reinserting a document?

 

If the answer is no, what exactly would be entailed in adding this
functionality, or, better yet, is this planned for a future release of
Lucene (2.0+)? Essentially, how heinous would it be to reach way into
the guts of Lucene to make this a reality? Also, would this even be an
efficient operation, or would it require an optimize operation to make
searching perform well?

 

 

Thanks for your patience (and understanding),

Anthony Arnone
