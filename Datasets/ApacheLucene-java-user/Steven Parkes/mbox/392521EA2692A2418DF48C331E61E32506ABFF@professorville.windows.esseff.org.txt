Subject: ranking/scoring algorithm in details

Hi,
 
Does anyone know of a written document that describes in some details
how Lucene's ranking/scoring algorithm works? I'm safely assuming that
a single consistent algorithm is being used to compute the scores of
each matching documents (with or without explicit boost factors in the
query) and rank them accordingly. 
 
I would appreciate any pointer to such information, or your own
description
if you happen to know that. 
 
Thanks in advance.
/Jong
