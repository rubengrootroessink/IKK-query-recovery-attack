Probably want a combination of extractWikipedia.alg and wikipedia.alg?

You want the EnwikiDocMaker from extractWikipedia.alg which reads the
uncompressed xml file but rather than using WriteLineDoc, you want to go
ahead and index as wikipedia.alg does. (Ditch the query part.)

You'll need an acceptable analyzer, which StandardAnalyzer might not be.

I haven't actually tried it, but I think very likely the current code  
in contrib/benchmark might be able to extract non-English Wikipedia  
dump as well?

Have a look at contrib/benchmark/conf/extractWikipedia.alg: I think  
if you just change the docs.file to reference your downloaded XML  
file it could just work?
