I stopped procrastinating on this today.

I signed up for a BOF slot at 8 on Thursday. Hopefully not against other
stuff of interest.

I've not done this before, but the BOF slots were filling.

>From my perspective, it'd be great to have people from any of the
subprojects. Plenty of cross fertilization opportunities.
