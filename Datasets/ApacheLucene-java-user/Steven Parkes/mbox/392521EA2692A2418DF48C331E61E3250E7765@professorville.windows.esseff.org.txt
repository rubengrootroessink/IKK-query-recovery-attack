	I'm curious, why is LogMergePolicy named *Log*MergePolicy?
	(Why not ExpMergePolicy? :-)

Well, I guess it's a matter of perspective. When you look at the way the
algorithm works, the merge decisions are based on a concept of level and
levels are assigned based on the log of the number of documents in a
segment (going back to Ning's equation). When one is in the code, it's
very natural to think/talk about "log-base-merge-factor".

This does result in the number of documents in segments being
order-of-magnitude/exponentially related so that might have made more
sense to users, so perhaps it wasn't the best decision ...
