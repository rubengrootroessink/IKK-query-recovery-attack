It is true that you can store more data and that will make it possible
to get it back. Storing fields (w/ or w/o indexing) allows you to pull
them back. Storing term vectors gives you something in-between nothing
and everything.

However, you're still gonna get stuck on the "update" part. Lucene does
not rewrite segments. It's fundamental to Lucene that it doesn't: from
that a lot of Lucene's concurrent nature flow.

The way I think of it is that Lucene never adds docs to segments. It
creates single doc segments and it merges segments to create bigger
segments. No where in that model is there the concept of changing
anything inside a segment once it's been created.

Could you tell a little more about why delete/reinsert is not viable for
you? A lot of people have dealt with this issue and come up with
acceptable solutions ...

What if the field is stored and unindexed?  It should be possible to
update the contents of that  in isolation.  How would that be done?

Thanks
