See IndexWriter#addIndexesNoOptimize, released with 2.1. Note that it
doesn't optimize before or after, so if you want an optimize at the end,
you need to ask for it manually.

Subject: drawback addindexes method

 

I found that IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[]) always calls optimize
method twice 
I am indexing a documents in batches , i.e I call this method when X no.
of
documents are buffered in RAM
Using RAMDirectory . So as the index size grows , optimize method will
only
increase by indexing time
 
Can these lines be commented out and call the optimize method only at
the
end of indexing process?
 
Your thoughts please
 
Thanks
Chandan
