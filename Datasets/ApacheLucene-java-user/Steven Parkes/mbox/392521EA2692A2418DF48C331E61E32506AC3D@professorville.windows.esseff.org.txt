It's possible to do leading wildcard searches in Lucene as of 2.1. See

Subject: Wildcard searches with * or ? as the first character

Hi,

I have read that with Lucene it is not possible to do wildcard searches 
with * or ? as the first character. Wildcard searches with * as the 
first character (or both first and last character) are useful for text 
in languages that have a lot of compound words, like German and the 
Scandinavian languages.

Some systems do offer such searches, but at a penalty. I assume such 
systems sometimes do a sequential search of the text, which is slow, and 
sometimes a sequential search of an index, which might be a bit faster, 
but still quite slow.

But a slow search might be better than no search, as long as the user is 
aware of the consequences of doing wildcard searches starting with a 
wildcard character.

Any comments?

Cheers,

- Øystein -
