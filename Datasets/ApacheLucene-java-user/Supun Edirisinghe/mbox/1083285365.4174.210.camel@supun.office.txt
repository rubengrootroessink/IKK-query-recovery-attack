I think I'm alittle confused on how and index is put into use on a
readonly file system

I'm using Lucene in my web application. Our indexes are built off our
database nightly and copied into our web app servers. 

I think our web app dies from time to time and sometimes a lock is left
behind from Lucene in /tmp/.  

I have read that there is a disableLuceneLocks System Property(is that
the full name or is it something like
org.apache.jakarta...disableLuceneLocks?). But, I'm still not sure how I
can set that. Do I give it as commandline arg to the java VM? 

thanks
