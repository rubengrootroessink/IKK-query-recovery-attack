SUBJECT: advice on a query
DATE: 20 Feb 2004

Hi,

I'm still new to Lucene and I'm slowly learning it.

I'm trying to think of how to build a query for this situation:
I have an index of Foods.
I have a field called Name that is Indexed and Untokenized
it holds values like "chicken soup" "roast duck" "chicken pot pie"

users are going to search with strings like
"how to make chicken soup" or "cooking chicken" or "chicken soup
history" or "bbq chicken wings"
basically a term held in the index's Name field can appear anywhere in
the search's input string.

if a user inputs "how to make chicken soup" or "chicken soup history" I
want to only display documents with Name containing "chicken soup" (not
"bbq chicken wings" or "chicken")

The problem I'm confused about is that the Name term can appear anywhere
in the string and can be any number of words long. 

is there a better way to do this other than creating  a PhraseQuery with
every possible combination of consecutive words and checking against the
Name field with them? 

thanks
