I have read these 2 threads in the mail group:

I'm still wondering how people stil order by a field. I know that it is
possible to lexiographicaly sort results. 

I've been trying to play with boost values to massage Hits into a good
order but I think I need to order by the fields to get strict order. 

thanks
