SUBJECT: which query matched in a Boolean query
DATE: 8 Mar 2004

I have a BooleanQuery that takes 3 TermQueries

for example (title:colombo OR txt:colombo OR city:colombo)

I would like to mark hits that match in the field title in red on
display, txt in blue, and city in green. and maybe those that match in 2
fields in another color

is this possible?

thanks
