SUBJECT: Documents the same search is done many times.
DATE: 28 Apr 2004

what happens in this situation:

I query a field "id" for "one"

say I get a Document object (object A) from a search which has a field
"content" with value "pig". and that object persists forever.

then a new index is written with a document with "id"="one" and
"content"="mongoose"

another search does the same search querying "id" for "one". will this
new search return the same object A or a new object?

if they are different, will examining object A show that the "content"
field has changed?

thanks
