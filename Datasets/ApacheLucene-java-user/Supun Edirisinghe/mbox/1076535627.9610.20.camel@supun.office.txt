thanks otis

you are right. Is there a way the thread using isLock and unlock know
how old the lock is?

my assumption is that if it is older than a couple seconds it is from
something dying or some branch where something is uncaught.

I guess I can try looking at the timestamp of the commit.lock file using
IO. I'm worried that that read of the lock file will be many times the
time
searching. I guess I won't know until I test and that time will only
come in cases where the lock is set. I didn't see any methods in the API
for 
finding the age of the lock. am I wrong?

thanks again
