SUBJECT: commit.lock file
DATE: 11 Feb 2004

Hi everybody, I'm new to the mail list.

I'm also new to using Lucene.

We use lucene to index some of our pages.

sometimes (for a reason unknown to us) a commit.lock file is left and 
searches using the index  don't work.

what are some of the causes for this commit.lock file to persist.

I've read in the faq that it is written so that access to the segments 
is synchronized correctly.

What are some good strategies to make make this file go away? Would it 
be a good idea to assign a  program to  just check the timestamp on 
that file and just delete it if it has been there for a long time?

all comments are welcome.

thanks
