SUBJECT: calculate average distance between words
DATE: 2 Mar 2007

hy,
We want to correlate words and construct a network which links give the
correleation strength.
We believe that if words occur very often very near to each other the
strenght of the link should be stronger.

I remember that somebody once told me that lucene has the capability of
doing that.
So given two terms and the common field (of a single document or all the
documents in which both words occur) it can give the average distance
between the two words.

anyone has any clue?
thanks for attention
dzi
