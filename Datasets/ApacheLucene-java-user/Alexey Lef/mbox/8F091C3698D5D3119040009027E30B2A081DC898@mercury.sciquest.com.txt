If my understanding is correct, unless you are using JNI, you should never
be able to crash the JVM using only java code. We've had a lot of crash
problems with Sun's JVM, especially in server mode (on Linux, not Windows).
We don't have any JNI code (only the JVM itself and the database driver).
Finally we have switched to BEA Jrockit and haven't had a crash since.

Hope this helps,

Alexey

No, I didn't change the source code at all. Has anyone ever seen this error
with Lucene 1.4.3? I am unsure how to troubleshoot further, since the error
occurs within the call to search().

A similar message appeared for me on linux. I would recommend doing a

ant clean (or something similar.)
ant jar
ant war

if you changing the source code. Did you change your source code?
