You can also store a phonetic key for the term to find sounds-like matches.
I use double metaphone algorithm which appears to be English specific. Not

For the length, I use relative distance cutoff (distance/length) in addition
to the absolute length cutoff that doesn't work very well for short words
(as you mentioned).

true for misspellings based on 'ch' and 'g' both being the same sound in
Dutch but written differently.

3. words that could never be part of a suggestion were added based on a
single matchting n-gram. (e.g. if I ask for suggestions on 'per' then
tupperware is also suggested. But solely based on length it is clear
that it has a minimal distance of 7.
