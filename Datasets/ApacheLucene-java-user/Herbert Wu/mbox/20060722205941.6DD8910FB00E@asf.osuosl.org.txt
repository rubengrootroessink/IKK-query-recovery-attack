SUBJECT: Special characher & ; : % index/search question
DATE: 22 Jul 2006

Hi, all,

My document's title field contains standalone(not contained inside a word)
special char such as &,:,%,; etc. With luke0.6 tool, I found that these
chars are not indexed in the title field or any other place and hence not
searchable. Is there any way to index these special chars for search? My env
are:

Lucene: version 2.0.0

Index parser: org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer

JDK: Java1.5

OS: XP sp2

Debugger: luke0.6

 

Any help is greatly appreciated!

 

-Herbert
