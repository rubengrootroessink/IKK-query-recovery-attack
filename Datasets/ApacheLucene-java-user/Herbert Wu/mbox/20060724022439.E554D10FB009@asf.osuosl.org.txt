WhitespaceAnalyzer looks brutal. Is it possible that I keep StandardAnalyzer
and at the same time to tell the parser to keep a list of chars during
indexing?

the WhitespaceAnalyzer breaks up streams on whitespace, and will give you
these characters as tokens. Be careful to use it for indexing AND searching.
Also, make sure that's the analyzer in Luke if you submit queries that way
(it's a drop-down on the search page, upper right as I remember).
