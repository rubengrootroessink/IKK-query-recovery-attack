SUBJECT: Matching a single document
DATE: 8 Feb 2004

This may not fit any of Lucene's usage models, but is there a way to 
match a single document - before it has been indexed - to a query?

The motivation for this is to add a listener to the IndexWriter which 
listens for documents matching existing Query objects.  Two possible 
approaches, both of which seem ungainly, are 1) creating a temporary 
index for each document being indexed or 2) Writing a class that matches 
document Fields with Query Terms.  This second approach would require a 
way to extract individual Terms from Queries.  Is that possible?

Thanks,

Chris
