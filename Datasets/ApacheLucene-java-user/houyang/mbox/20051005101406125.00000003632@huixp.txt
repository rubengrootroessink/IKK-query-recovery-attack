Hi Erik
Practically it is a big performance issue by access external security data through filter.
And it could take even longer than the end user could wait.
It is true that it is an extra cost to rebuild the security index but it seems there are no
other better options.

Regards,
hui

No, not with Lucene 1.4.3.  But the Subversion trunk has a feature
that can facilitate this sort of thing by building two indexes, one
with the data and one with the security information.  Look at
ParallelReader and it's javadocs.

However, for data like permissions, ACL's, groups, etc, it may be
better to keep the information where it originally resides and have a
Filter that accesses the external data.  It would likely be easier
and quicker to re-instantiate Filter's than to rebuild a security
index and less duplication.
