"YYYYMMDD" is better since it has less number unique terms compared with the unix time stamp
if you only care about the days.

DateFilter sounds great!! - But how is the best way to store dates in af
Field? I get the time as a unix time stamp, seconds since epoch - and
usually I can cut it down to hours or days since ephoc instead - if this
has any effect on the perfomance...

thanks...
