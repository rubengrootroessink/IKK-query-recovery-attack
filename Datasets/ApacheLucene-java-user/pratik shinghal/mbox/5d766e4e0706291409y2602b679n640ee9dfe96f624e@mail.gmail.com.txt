SUBJECT: Re: queryparser
DATE: 29 Jun 2007

when i m using normal tokenizers i m getting " track " as a result and not
getting " 9 ".

and when i m using this custom analyser and checking the output , i m
getting the right output as " track  9 ".
but as soon as i use queryparser using the same custom analyser i get only "
track " and not " 9 ".

so i want to why queryparser is ommiting the single character in the
string..
is there any threshhold in the queryparser or some minimum length which is
not able to enter single character string in the queryparser.
