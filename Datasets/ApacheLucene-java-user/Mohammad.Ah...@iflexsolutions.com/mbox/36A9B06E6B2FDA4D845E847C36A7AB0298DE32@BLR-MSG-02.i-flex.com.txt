SUBJECT: Query regarding usage of Lucene - Filtering folders
DATE: 28 Feb 2008

Hi

I would like to join java-user mailing list.

I had a query regarding usage of lucene.

 

 

I have done the indexing for the files kept in root folder -> subfolder

-> subfolder structure.

 

 

When I make the search with particular word it returns me the list of
matching files across the folder structure right from root to the last
subfolder.

 

 

I want to restrict search to specific folder only.

 

Is it possible with lucene?

 

If yes, please suggest me the steps to follow.

 

 

Thanks,

 

Mohammad
