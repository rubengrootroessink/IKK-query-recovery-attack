SUBJECT: Which parser or query should I be using
DATE: 15 Feb 2008

 
trying to send this again...  i keep getting delivery failures  so i've
attached my code snippet instead   
 
My index from Luke looks like this where the columns are for
Rank/Field/Text
 
2 guid aaaa2
1 guid pi1
1 statement Some policy statement for pi3, needs some text with a 2 in
it
1 guid pi3
1 name a1
1 name a2
1 guid pi2
1 value 0
1 value 4552
1 guid aaaa1
 
i want to be able to enter the following search strings
 
    policy
    Some policy
    Some policy*
    *statement*
    statement:Some policy
 
and for these queries for "Some policy statement for pi3, needs some
text with a 2 in it" to be returned.

 
Other examples which are returning correctly are
 
    guid:aaaa1
    aaaa2
 
My code is as  attached . Perhaps i'm overthinking it and some Regex
parser or query should work instead.
Thanks for any suggestions,
Erica
