SUBJECT: Luke error browsing to a lucene index
DATE: 4 Feb 2008

Hi,

I'm trying to test out Luke and I get an error saying unknown format
error:-4
The index I'm trying to point to is the one built by the demo in the
documentation for getting started with lucene.

Can anyone please tell me what this error might mean.

Thanks
Erica
