SUBJECT: Performance Improvments?
DATE: 4 Oct 2005

Hi,

 

I am looking at changing the value BufferedIndexOutput.BUFFER_SIZE  from
1024 to maybe 8192.  Has anyone done anything similar and did they get
any performance improvements.  

 

Generally I am looking to reduce the time it takes to optimize the
index, currently a 20GB index takes about an hour.  I have at least four
indexes of this size and they are all in the critical path for the
production cycle.

 

Any other suggestion would be appreciated.

 

 

Andrew
