I have just had a quick look at both the US and UK version of Amazon and
they both list the book as Lucene In Action.


I was curious as I work for the UK Bibliographic agency and it was on
our database and should have been on Amazon for a least a couple of
weeks.  The agency has known about the book since start of September.


It has a publication date of 31/12/2004.

Manning will have the electronic book version available *TODAY* 
(hopefully).  It has been sent to the printers and this process takes a 
few weeks.  I don't expect Amazon.com to be shipping them until January 
though - the book industry really is slow moving.

Otis and I thank everyone for their patience and you can be sure that 
no one wants the book in their hands more then he and I :)
