SUBJECT: index file size threshold affecting search performance?
DATE: 28 Mar 2007

So I assumed a linear decay of performance as an index got bigger.

For some reason when going from an index size of 1.89 to 1.95 gigs
dramatically increased cpu across all of our servers.

I was thinking of splitting the 1.95 index into 2 separate indexes  and
using a multisearcher on those parts?

thanks.
