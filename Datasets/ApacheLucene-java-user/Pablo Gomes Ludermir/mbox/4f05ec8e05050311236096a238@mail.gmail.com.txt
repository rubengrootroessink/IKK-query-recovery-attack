SUBJECT: getting document metadata
DATE: 3 May 2005

Hello all,

I would like to retrieve some document metadata after the search, i.e.
the documents that are returned in the Hits would be PDFs and I would
be able to get some info using PDFBox.
But I am not sure about indexing the path when adding the document to
the index (I do some processing with the contents of the index, and I
would like to have only one field: the body contents). Is there
another way to get the document's path if we don't index it? Or just
with magic? :)

Regards,
