SUBJECT: getting the number of occurrences within a document
DATE: 14 Apr 2005

Hello all,

I would like to get the following information from the index:

1. Given a term, how many times the term occurs in each document.
Something like a triple:
< Term, Doc1, Freq> , <Term, Doc2, Freq>, <Term2, Docx, Freq>, ...

Is possible to do that?


Regards,
Pablo
