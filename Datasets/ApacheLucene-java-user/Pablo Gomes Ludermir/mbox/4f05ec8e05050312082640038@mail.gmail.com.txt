To: Luke Shannon <lshannon@futurebrand.com>


I actually would like to have a single field on the Document object,
named CONTENTS. My question would be if it is possible to retrieve the
document with its "number". e.g. IndexReader.document (n); And "n"
would be provided by the Hits.id(...) from the search results. Is it a
reliable approach?

Regards
