GSpell is an open source java spell checking API.  It can be found at
http://umlslex.nlm.nih.gov/nlsRepository/gspell/doc/userDoc/

It incorporates both metaphone (which is similar to SoundEx, I think) and
ngram algorithms and it is easy to use.

I currently have an application in which a user submits a query to Lucene
and along the way I use GSpell to check all the terms in the query.  If any
are misspelled I underline with a squiggly red line and provide spelling
suggestions from GSpell if the user right-clicks.

If your spelling correction dictionary is exactly equal to the terms in your
index then any misspelled word is also guaranteed not to yield any hits, and
any indexed term is guaranteed not to turn up incorrectly spelled.

Then the query would search the regular fields and then form a second
soundex'd query and run it on the soundex field.  Does this sound plausible?
I'd be really interested to hear results if anyone has tried this before.
