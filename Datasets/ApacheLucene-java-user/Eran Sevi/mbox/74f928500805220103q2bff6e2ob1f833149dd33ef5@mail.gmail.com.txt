SUBJECT: Best way to get payloads
DATE: 22 May 2008

Hi,

I'm running a SpanQuery and get the Spans result which tell me the documents
and positions of what I searched for.
I would now like to get the payloads in those documents and positions
without having to iterate on TermPositions since I don't have a term but I
do have the document and position.

Maybe Spans should be extended to also hold the payloads as well as the
start and end positions of the span.

Another option might be to extend TermPositionVector and return an array of
payloads.

 Can anyone think on a way to do it ?

Thanks,
Eran.
