SUBJECT: Preventing index corruption
DATE: 26 Jun 2008

Hi,

I'm looking for the correct way to create an index given the following
restrictions:

1. The documents are received in batches of variable sizes (not more then
100 docs in a batch).
2. The batch insertion must be transactional - either the whole batch is
added to the index (exists physically on the disk), or the whole batch is
canceled/aborted and the index remains as before.
3. The index must remain valid at all times and shouldn't be corrupted even
if a power interruption occurs - *most important*
4. Index speed is less important than search speed.

How should I use a writer with all these restrictions? Can I do it without
having to close the writer after each batch (maybe flush is enough)?

Should I change the IndexWriter parameters such as mergeFactor,
RAMBufferSize, etc. ?
I want to make sure that partial batches are not written to the disk (if the
computer crashes in the middle of the batch, I want to be able to work with
the index as it was before the crash).

If I'm working with a single writer, is it guaranteed that no matter what
happens the index can be opened and used (I don't mind loosing docs, just
that the index won't be ruined).

Thanks and sorry about the long list of questions,
Eran.
