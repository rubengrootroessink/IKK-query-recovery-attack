Hi,
I have the same need - to obtain "attributes" for terms stored in some
field. I also need all the results and can't take just the first few docs.

I'm using an older version of lucene and the method i'm using right now is
this:
1. Store the words as usual in some field.
2. Store the attributesof each word in another field aligned with the words.
If you have several types of information, create a field for each type.
3. In order to retrieve the information, run a span query of the words
field.
4. use the positions of the spans to "jump" directly to the stored metadata
field.

This seems cumbersome but it works quite well and quite fast. You don't have
to do several passes - just iterate on the spans. you can easily add as many
attributes to the word as you want as long as they are aligned to the words
fields. The problems are that you are restricted to span queries and that
you have get all the attributes fields for each document and split the
fields before being able to jump to the right position.

However, Mark's suggestion to use PayloadSpanUtil might greatly improve my
solution if for each span we could have the payload information without
running another search. I saw some discussions about extending the Spans
class to include the combined payloads of the terms in each span, but I
don't think it was implemented.
