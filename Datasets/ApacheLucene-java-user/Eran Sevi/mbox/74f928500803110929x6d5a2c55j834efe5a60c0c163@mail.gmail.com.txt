SUBJECT: Query for "Bigger then" specific term
DATE: 11 Mar 2008

Hi,

What's the best way to query Lucene for a "bigger then" term, for example "
value > 10".

I know there's a range query where I can use a large upper bound but maybe
there's something more efficient (instead of Lucene transfrom to query to
thousands of OR queries).

Thanks,
Eran.
