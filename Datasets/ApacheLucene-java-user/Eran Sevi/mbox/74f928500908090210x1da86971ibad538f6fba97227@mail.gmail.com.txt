SUBJECT: Re: score from spans
DATE: 9 Aug 2009

Thanks for the answer.

I tried to further understand the weight and score mechanism when running a
span query search.
I noticed that indeed the SpanScorer and SpanWeight are being called and
some score is returned but it seems to me that these basic implementations
are more appropriate for the basic SpanTermQuery.
For the other types of span queries, the inner queries scores and weights
are not taken into account - for example if I run a simple SpanOrQuery and
boost one of it's child SpanTermQuery, the boost is not taken into account.

It seems to me that some recursive calculation is required in order to take
into account all the weights and scores of the span's sub queries.
I'm trying to come up with a correct implementation for SpanOrQuery,
SpanNearQuery, SpanNotQuery based on similiar calculations of BooleanQuery.

Do you have a better idea on how to achieve the correct scoring? the score
calculations are quite complex for each case of span queries so any help is
appreciated.

Thanks, Eran.
