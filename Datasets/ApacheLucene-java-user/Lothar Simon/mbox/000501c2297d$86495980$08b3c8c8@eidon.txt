Of course you are right. And I am surely more the last then the first one to
try to come up with THE solution for this. But still... Could the following
work?

If space (ok, a lot) is available you could store "beutiful", "eutiful",
"utiful", "tiful", "iful", "ful", "ul", "l" PLUS its inversions ("lufitueb",
"ufitueb", "fitueb", "itueb", "tueb", "ueb", "eb", "b") in the index. Space
needed would be something like (average no of chars per word) as much as in
a "normal" index.

Say you want to search for "*tif*", you would actually search for "tif*" in
the first group AND for "fit*" in the second group and voila hit "beutiful".

Just as a note, there is a big difference between

*xyz
abc*

And

*bcxy*

For the first two, there are techniques that can be used to search much
faster. For the 3rd option, the only way I can think of how to solve it is
brute force.
