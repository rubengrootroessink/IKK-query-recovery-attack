SUBJECT: Status: Sorting on tokenized fields
DATE: 22 Sep 2006

Hello,

for years there is the discussion to make lucene able to sort on TOKENIZED
fields.
(e.g. if more then one term is available concatenate the tokens OR use the
stored value for sorting).

Could some of the developer please make a statement if there are any
plans to implement this feature in future?

Thanks
lude
