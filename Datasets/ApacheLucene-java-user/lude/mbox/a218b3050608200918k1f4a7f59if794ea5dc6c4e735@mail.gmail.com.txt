SUBJECT: Singleton and IndexModifier
DATE: 20 Aug 2006

Hello,

when using the new IndexModifier of Lucene 2.0, what would be
the best creation-pattern?

Should there be one IndexModifier instance in the application (==singelton)?
Could an IndexModifier be opened for a longer time or should it be created
on use and immediately closed?

Another issue:
- I create an IndexModifier
- The applicaton crashes
- There exists a write-lock on the index
--> Next time I start the application the IndexModifier couldn't be opened
because of the locks.

What is the right way to check and delete old write locks?

Thanks
lude
