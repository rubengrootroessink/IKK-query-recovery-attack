SUBJECT: QueryParser returns all documents
DATE: 4 Sep 2006

Hello,

a simple, stupid question to the friendly mailinglist:

How do you have to define the query-string to get all documents of an index
be returned by using the QueryParser?
In theory a query like 'NOT word_not_in_index' should find and return all
documents. In practice this doesn't work (no documents are found).

Greetings
