SUBJECT: Any experience with spring's lucene support?
DATE: 1 Nov 2006

Hello,

while starting a new project we are thinking about using the
spring-modules for working with lucene. See:
https://springmodules.dev.java.net/

Does anybody has experience with this higher level lucene API?
How does it compare to Compass?
(Dis-)Advantages of using spring-modules lucene support?

Thanks
lude
