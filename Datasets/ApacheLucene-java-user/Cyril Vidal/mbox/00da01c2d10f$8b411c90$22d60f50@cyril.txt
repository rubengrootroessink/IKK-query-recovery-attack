SUBJECT: highlighting with Lucene and Cocoon
DATE: 10 Feb 2003

Hi,

I'd would like to perform highlighting with Lutece integrated in Cocoon.
Did someone already do the same task?

Basically, if I have a xml file such as the following:
<flower>
This is a great yellow flower
</flower>

I would like when pointing by example 
to http://localhost:8080/cocoon/flora?query=flower:yellow

to get an xml document like this:
<flower>
This a great <em>yellow</em> flower
</flower>

Any suggestions would help,
Thanks in advance,
Cyril.
