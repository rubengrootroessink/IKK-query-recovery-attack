SUBJECT: Wild carded phrases
DATE: 9 May 2008

Hi all, 

First of all, well done to the implementers of Lucene. The performance
is incredible! We get search results within 20-40 ms on an index about
1.5GB. 

I could not find a Lucene maillist search engine, something I am a bit
surprised about!

My question is how I can implement wild carded phrases searches like:
"boiler replac*"
This will pick up text:
"boiler replacement" and "boiler replacing"
But not:
"boiling replacement" or "boiler user replacment"

I am using the queryParser through Spring-lucene-module. 



I did simply try textToSearch= "boiler replac*", but this did not work
as anticipated. Have not analyzed properly, but it seemed to interpret
this as: 
boiler OR replac*


Is there a way to implements this?

Many thanks, 
Jon
