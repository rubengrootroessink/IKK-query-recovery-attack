SUBJECT: concise definition of Lucene score?
DATE: 3 Sep 2008

Hi all, 

I have attempted to find a concise definition of how the Lucene score is
calculated, something that can be understood by most people. 

The information I found is accurate, but not particularly concise.

If there is no boosting or sorting involved, how is a default sort
calculated?

Many thanks, 
Jon
