Hi, 

I posed a similar question on 09 May 08. 

The response was as below. I did not go down this route however, as a
wild carded 'exact' phrase is in a way contradictory.

Hi,

Here's a searchable mailing list archive: 
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/

As regards the wildcard phrase queries, here's one way I think you could
do it, but it's a bit of extra work. If you're using QueryParser, you'd
have to override the "getFieldQuery" method to use span queries instead
of phrase queries.

A phrase query can be implemented as a span query with a span or "slop"

factor of 1. So, once you have the PhraseQuery object, you would:

1. Extract the terms
2. For each one, check if it contains a "*" or a "?"
3. If it does, create a WildcardQuery using that term, and re-write it
using IndexReader.rewrite method. This expands the wildcard query into
all it's matches.
4. Create an array of SpanTermQuery objects, (one SpanTermQuery for each
term that matched you wildcard); then add that array to a SpanOrQuery.
5. Repeat 2 to 4 for each wildcard term in the phrase.
6. Finally (!), create a SpanNearQuery, adding all the original terms in
order, but substituting your SpanOrQuerys for the wildcard terms. Use a
slop of 1, and set the inOrder flag to true.

So, essentially, you'd end up with: (you'll have to excuse me if I
haven't rendered the span queries correctly as strings here - but this
should give the general idea...)

spanNear[boiler (spanOr[replacement replacing])]

So it will accept *either* "replacement" or "replacing" adjacent to
"boiler", which is what you want.

As you can see, it's a bit of work - but if you add this functionality
to the QueryParser, you'll can re-use it a lot!

Hope that helps!

-JB

Subject: Wildcard and Literal Searches combined


Folks,
My users require wildcard searches. Sometimes their search phrases
contain spaces. I am having trouble trying to implement a wildcard
search on strings containing spaces, so if the term includes spaces I
force a literal search by adding double quotes to the search term.
So the search string for 'Dublin' becomes search term (Dublin*) whereas
search string 'Dublin City' becomes ("Dublin City")


If I use (Dublin City*) I get all instances of Dublin OR City in the
results which is not what I am looking for. 

Is there any way I can combine the wildcard search and the literal?

Heres my existing code. Its in c# with Lucene.Net

//if input has spaces we do a literal search if (sSearchQuery.IndexOf("
") < 0) { sSearchQuery = "(" + sSearchQuery + "*)"; } else {
sSearchQuery = "(\"" + sSearchQuery + "\")"; } IndexSearcher searcher =
new IndexSearcher(sIndexLocation); Hits oHitColl =
searcher.Search(oParser.Parse(sSearchQuery));

Thanks folks
