SUBJECT: case insensitive searches
DATE: 10 Mar 2005

Hi all, 

 

              I have a field that has been populated as a keyword e.g.
populated via doc.add(Field.Keyword("ID", "Xyz Abc"));

 

              Is it possible to perform a case insensitive query that is if
I do a search for xyz, the document is returned.

 

 

              I know that this is possible for UnStored fields as they are
stored in lower case formats.
