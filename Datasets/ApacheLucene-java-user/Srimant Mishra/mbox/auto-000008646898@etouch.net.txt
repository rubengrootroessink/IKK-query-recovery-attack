SUBJECT: How to manipulate the lucene index table
DATE: 2 Mar 2005

Hi all, 

 

         I have a web-based application that we use to index text documents
as well as images; the indexes fields are either Field.Unstored or
Field.Keyword. 

 

 

         Currently, we plan to modify some of the index field names. For
example, if the index field name was DOCLOCALE, we plan to break it up into
two fields: DOCUMENTTYPE and LOCALE. Since, the index files that lucene
creates have become quite big (close to 1 gig), we are looking for a way to
be able to read the index entries and modify them via a standalone Java
program.

 

Does lucene provide any APIs to read these index entries and update them? Is
there an easy way to do it?

 

Thanks in advance

Srimant
