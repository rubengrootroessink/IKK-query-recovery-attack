SUBJECT: spatial search - query to see if I fall within an area
DATE: 18 Jul 2010


Hi, what is the most efficient way of doing a spatial search in this way.
I have persons who monitor an area. I am at position x and I want to find
whether I fall within those monitored areas. If I do then they can monitor
me.

What is the best method for doing this type of search. The simplest is to go
to each person and ask if my position sits inside their monitor area. How
would this query look with lucene spatial search plugin?

Thanks
