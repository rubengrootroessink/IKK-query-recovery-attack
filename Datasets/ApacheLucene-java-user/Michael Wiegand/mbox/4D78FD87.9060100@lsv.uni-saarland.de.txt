SUBJECT: Re: index enforcing query terms to appear within the same sentence
DATE: 10 Mar 2011

Conceptually, I think I know what to do. Unfortunately, with the given 
interfaces of Lucene I have some difficulty.

If I add the content of a document sentence by sentence, i.e. line by 
line, (using a multi-valued field), there are only two constructors 
possible:
Field(String name, String value, Field.Store store, Field.Index index)
or
Field(String name, String value, Field.Store store, Field.Index index, 
Field.TermVector termVector)
The sentence comes as a string which I get from a BufferedReader-object 
by using the readLine() method.

But as far as I understood, I need to access some TokenStream-object in 
order to set the PositionIncrementAttribute. So how should that work?

Thank you in advance.
