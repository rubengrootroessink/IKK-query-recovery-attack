SUBJECT: no. of documents with hits vs. no. of hits
DATE: 14 Mar 2011

Hi,

Does Lucene always count the number of documents with hits matching a 
query or is it also possible to count the overall number of hits?
There would be a difference between the two if within a document there 
is actually more than one hit.

Thank you in advance!

Best,
Michael
