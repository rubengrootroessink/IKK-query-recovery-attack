SUBJECT: Re: index enforcing query terms to appear within the same sentence
DATE: 4 Mar 2011

Thank you for all these useful hints!

If I use the multi-valued fields in combination with "modified" position 
increments, I would actually distort the shape of a document.
For instance, if I would like to compare a retrieval enforcing query 
term co-occurrence within the same sentence with a co-occurrence using 
PhraseQuery (or SpanNearQuery) just enforcing that the query terms have 
to appear within a text window of n words (also allowing this window to 
cross sentence boundaries), I would need to create another index where I 
do not modify the position increments.
Is that right?

Best,
Michael
