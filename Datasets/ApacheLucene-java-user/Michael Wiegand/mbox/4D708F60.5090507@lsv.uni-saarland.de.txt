SUBJECT: index enforcing query terms to appear within the same sentence
DATE: 4 Mar 2011

Hi,

I would like to create an index with Lucene to a document collections of 
text files.
The index should be created in such a way, that for the search I can 
enforce that query term A and query term B are contained within the same 
sentence.

How should implement the index? Should I have for every sentence a 
different field (but make sure that it is not a multi-valued field 
because they would get merged which is exactly what I do not want)?
Would it be problematic that different documents would then end up 
having different numbes of fields?

Thank you in advance!

Best,
Michael
