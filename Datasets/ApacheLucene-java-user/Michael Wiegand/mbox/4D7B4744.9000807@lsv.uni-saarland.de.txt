SUBJECT: matching multi-word terms
DATE: 12 Mar 2011

Hi,

I would like to find documents matching multi-word terms, more 
specifically: my query is something like "B C" and I would like match 
contexts such as
"A B C D E"
but not
"B A C D E"
There seems to be some contradictory information on the web. Apparently, 
the statement
Term t = new Term("f", "A B")
would not do the job. If this is so, what is the common procedure for 
these type of terms? Some SpanQuery subclass?

Thank you in advance!

Best,
Michael
