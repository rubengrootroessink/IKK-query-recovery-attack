DATE: 10 Apr 2007

Hello
 Please excuse my newbiness but I need Lucene to do a simple taks and
I haven't been able to find out how. I just need to search some text
files for a given string, say "brown fox" and get the filename , which
I found out how but I also need the position in that file ( so I can
replace that text ).
 Any help , hints would be appreciated and I'm not afraid to read the
doc , I just don't know where tot look.
 Thanks.
