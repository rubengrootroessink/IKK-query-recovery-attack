SUBJECT: Re: Disk space used by optimize - non space in disk corrupts index.
DATE: 4 Feb 2005

Hi all

We have a big index and a little space in disk.
When optimize and all space is consumed, our index is corrupted.
segments file point to nonexistent files.

Enviroment:
java 1.4.2_04
W2000 SP4
Tomat 5.5.4

Bye,
Ernesto.
