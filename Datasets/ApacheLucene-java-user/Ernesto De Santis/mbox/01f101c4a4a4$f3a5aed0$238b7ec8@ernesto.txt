Hello

I want administrate two index, one for online searches and another for index
process.

I want that the users search with a complete index, if I leave search at the
users over the same index that index process work, the users probabily see
an incomplete index.

For this I think, index process work in a "offline" index while the users
search in a online directory. When index process finish do the change.

Is my idea correct?
What is the best way to do this?

Thanks
Ernesto.
