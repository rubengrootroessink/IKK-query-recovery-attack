Hi Aviran

Thanks for response.

I forgot important information for you understand my issue.

My process do some like this:
The index have contents from differents sources, identified for a special
field 'source'.
Then the index have documents with source: S1 or source: S2 ... etc.

When I reindex the source S1, first delete all documents with source: S1, in
otherwise I have the index with repeated content. Then add the new index
result.
In the middle of process the IndexSearcher use an incomplete index.

Is posible do it like a data base transaction?

Bye
Ernesto.

You don't need to maintain 2 indexes.
You can search on an index while adding more documents to it.
All you have to do is to check if whether the index has changed since the
last time you got an instance of Index Reader, and if it has, just get a new
Index Reader.

Hello

I want administrate two index, one for online searches and another for index
process.

I want that the users search with a complete index, if I leave search at the
users over the same index that index process work, the users probabily see
an incomplete index.

For this I think, index process work in a "offline" index while the users
search in a online directory. When index process finish do the change.

Is my idea correct?
What is the best way to do this?

Thanks
Ernesto.
