SUBJECT: Wildcard queries with '-' signs
DATE: 17 Jan 2002

I need to do wildcard searches on terms with minus signs in them but 
can't get it to work (eg. 380-1211, searching for 380-12*  must result 
in a hit).

I have created my own Analyzer class that includes minus signs and 
numbers in the indexing and it works fine for simple queries using the 
QueryParser, but when I use a WildcardQuery against the same index it 
does not find any hits. Any ideas? Maybe I should use a PrefixQuery instead?

thanks in advance,

Ulf
