DATE: 29 Dec 2008

FIELD_BODY is defined as

public static final String FIELD_BODY = "AVS_FIELD_BODY";

and its indexed as

  ParsedDoc webdoc = ParsedDoc.getDoc(page);
...
document.add(new Field(Constants.FIELD_BODY, webdoc.getContents(), Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.ANALYZED));

-x-x-x-
public static ParsedDoc getDoc(Page page) {
		try {
			String raw = page.getContentType();
			int semicolon = raw.indexOf(";");
			if (semicolon>  -1) {
				raw = raw.substring(0, semicolon);	
			}
			MimeType mime = new MimeType(raw);
			String contentType = mime.getBaseType();
			String classname = getImpl(contentType);
			if (classname == null) {
				classname = getImpl(mime.getPrimaryType());
				if (classname == null) {
					return null;	
				}
			}
			Class webdocClass = Class.forName(classname);
			ParsedDoc webdoc = (ParsedDoc) webdocClass.newInstance();
			webdoc.page = page;
			webdoc.contentType = contentType;
			return webdoc;
		} catch (Exception e) {
			_log.error("Eror while parsing file: " + page.toURL());
			throw new SysException(e.getMessage());
		}

And Luke is not able to open the Indexed files by Lucene currently. But 
on my colleague's System it opened but no arabic content was found 
instead some chanrecters like Ø§Ù"Ø§Ø³ØªØ±Ø§ØªÙS(Ø¬  .. etc were found.
In my local now its giving 'Unknown format version: -8' as it was giving 
when my colleague tried to open and index from a Linux system where 
search was working fine.
