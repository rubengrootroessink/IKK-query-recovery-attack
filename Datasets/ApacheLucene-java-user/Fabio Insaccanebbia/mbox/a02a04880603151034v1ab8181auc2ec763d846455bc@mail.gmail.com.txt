Do you mean that a full text search on the news text isn't required?
I might be wrong, but it seems to me it doesn't sound as a typical
Lucene usage..

I'd go for the (c) option.. (but not just one table :-)

Bye,
Fabio

P.S.:
however a direct link "news -> customer" seems a bit strange. Are you
sure you can't model the problem as "news -> news type <- customer" or
"news -> customer group <- customer"
