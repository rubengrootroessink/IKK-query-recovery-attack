SUBJECT: bridging php lucene: php-java-bridge or solr, anything else ? how facebook do search ?
DATE: 26 Dec 2006

hi there,
i know this topic has been discussed over time.  it seems like the current
two most possible solutions are :

1) using php-java-bridge to call java class from php code
http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge

2) deploy solr and interact with php through http & xml
http://incubator.apache.org/solr/features.html

i'm curious that, any other solution come up recently ?  i'm inclined to use
2)Solr as i don't want to mess up java with php.  does anyone have
experience on doing that in production environment ?

one more question, does anyone have idea how facebook implement their search
? facebook uses php, guess they should face the same problem, their solution
should be very worth to reference.

cheers,
anson
