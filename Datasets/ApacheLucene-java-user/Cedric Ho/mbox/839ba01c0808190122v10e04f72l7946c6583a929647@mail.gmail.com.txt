SUBJECT: Are there any Lucene optimizations applicable to SSD?
DATE: 19 Aug 2008

Hi all,

We are testing Lucene with SSD. No doubt the performance is much
better than that of a normal hard disk.

However it's still not good enough for our particular case. So I
wonder if there are any tips for optimizing lucene performance on
SSDs.

For example, I saw that Lucene's BufferedIndexInput class will read
1024bytes off the disk each time. This certainly make sense on hard
disk because of the seek latency involved. But would it actually
hinder performance on SSD?


FYI, we were trying to fit an index about 20G in size into a single
machine with 8G ram. And the searches we receive are vastly different.
So it's not likely we can depends on the system's file cache to speed
things up for us.


Any input is appreciated.


Thanks,
Cedric Ho
