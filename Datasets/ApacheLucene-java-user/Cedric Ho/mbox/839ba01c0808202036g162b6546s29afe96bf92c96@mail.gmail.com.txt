ah, actually I've also seen that some slow queries are very short
range, so not a problem there. Sorting also not likely for I've tried
Sort.INDEXORDER before, which makes searching a little bit quicker
overall, but won't account for those very slow queries.

The problem is that if I just pick out all the slow queries and run
those, they are not slow again, (probably due to caching somehow)
