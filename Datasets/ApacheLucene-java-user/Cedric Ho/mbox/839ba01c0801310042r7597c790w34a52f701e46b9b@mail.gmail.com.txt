SUBJECT: Distributed Lucene Directory
DATE: 31 Jan 2008

Hi all,

I am wondering if there exist any implemenation of
org.apache.lucene.store.Directory which can be distributed across
multiple machines with comparable performance to a local FSDirectory
index, or is such an idea feasible in the first place.

By comparable performance I mean a 100G index distributed in 10
machines should achieve the same performance as a 10G index on a local
FSDirectory.

I know that optimization would be a problem for such a big index, but
would the partial optimization introduced in Lucene 2.3 help?

Any thoughts?

Regards,
Cedric Ho
