SUBJECT: exception during optimze
DATE: 1 Jun 2007

Hi,

When I tried to build an index last night, the following exception
occurred during call to IndexWriter.optimze():

java.lang.NullPointerException
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexFileDeleter.findDeletableFiles(IndexFileDeleter.java:88)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.mergeSegments(IndexWriter.java:1570)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.flushRamSegments(IndexWriter.java:1351)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.optimize(IndexWriter.java:891)
        ......

The mergeFactor is set to 500. And the final index file size is about 10Gb.

Also since the writer.close() is not called. There's an write.lock
file in the index directory. After deleting the write.lock file, I
called optimze() again and it complete successfully. Is the indexing
successful then? Will any documents be lost due to the above
exception?

I am using lucene-core-2.1.0

Thanks,
Cedric
