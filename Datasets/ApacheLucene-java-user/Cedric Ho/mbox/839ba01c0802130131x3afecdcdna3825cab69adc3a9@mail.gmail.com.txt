SUBJECT: How to pass additional information into Similarity.scorePayload(...)
DATE: 13 Feb 2008

Hi all,

My problem is I have some additional weighting info that come with
each search. And I need to take both the weighting info and the
payload to calculate scores.

So how do I access the weighting info in
Similarity.scorePayload(String,byte[],int,int) ? I've thought about
using a ThreadLocal, but this seems like a hack, are there better
options ?


Regards,
Cedric
