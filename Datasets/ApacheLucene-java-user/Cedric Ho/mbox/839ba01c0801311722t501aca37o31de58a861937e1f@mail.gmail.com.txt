DATE: 1 Feb 2008

Yes, I am aware of the RemoteSearchable and ParallelSearcher. And I am
doing something similiar now. i.e. split the index on multiple
machines.

But managing such a set of indexes is not trivial. Especially when
need to add redundancies for reliability and update frequently.

I bumped into this a while ago:

http://www.kimchy.org/compasslucene-and-datagrids/

also I've heard there is a Directory implemented for the HDFS but is
unfortunately very slow. which makes me wonder whether this type of
approach is practical (i.e. having good performance, can update index
easily, optimization won't takes too long, etc)
