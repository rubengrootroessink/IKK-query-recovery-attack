SUBJECT: Can I do boosting based on term postions?
DATE: 1 Aug 2007

Hi all,

I was wondering if it is possible to do boosting by search terms'
position in the document.

for example:
search terms appear in the first 100 words, or first 10% words, or in
first two paragraphs would be given higher score.

Is it achievable through using the new Payload function in lucene 2.2?
Or are there any easier ways to achieve these ?


Regards,
Cedric
