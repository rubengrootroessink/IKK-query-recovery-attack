fluctuating I would say. anything between 0.01 to 1 sec. Mostly center
around 0.5 secs.

It is much slower than SSD, I forgot the exact figures, but about 50%
returns within 1 sec, and those slow ones can go wild up to more then
100 secs

For this I've done an interesting test previously on harddisks. I have
two set of similar index on two machines and I queried them with
exactly the same query together. And they show very similar pattern of
search response time for each query, including those very slow queries
with response time >1-10 secs.

However I can't figure out why some of these queries are slower. Some
are complicated queries, yet others are just simple single term
queries and doesn't seems to score lots of hits. There's no
correlation between the number of terms or number of hits with the
response time. It's probably not due to filter cache miss also because
I've checked that too.

We keep monitoring it with jconsole, but don't see any abnormal gc
activities there. And yes, gc probably won't affect such slow queries
that much.

Thanks for the help =) We'll also keep trying different methods until
our goal is met.
