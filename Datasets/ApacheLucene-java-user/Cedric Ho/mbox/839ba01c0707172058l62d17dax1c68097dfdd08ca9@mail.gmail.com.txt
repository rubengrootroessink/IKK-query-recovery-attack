SUBJECT: WildcardQuery and SpanQuery
DATE: 18 Jul 2007

Hi everybody,

We recently need to support wildcard search terms "*", "?" together
with SpanQuery. It seems that there's no SpanWildcardQuery available.
After looking into the lucene source code for a while, I guess we can
either:

1. Use SpanRegexQuery, or

2. Write our own SpanWildcardQuery, and implements the
rewrite(IndexReader) method to rewrite the query into a SpanOrQuery
with some SpanTermQuery.

Of the two approaches, Option 1 seems to be easier. But I am rather
concerned about the performance of using regular expression. On the
other hand, I am not sure if there are any other concerns I am not
aware of for option 2 (i.e. is there a reason why there's no
SpanWildcardQuery in the first place?)

Any advices ?

Cedric
