Hello,

that is what I know about indexing international documents:

1. I have a language ID
2. with this ID I choose an special Analzer for that language 
3. I can use one index for all languages

But what about searching for international documents?

I don't have a language ID, because the user is interested in documents with his native language
and a second language mostly english.
So, what Analyzer do I use for searching?


Thanks

Günter
