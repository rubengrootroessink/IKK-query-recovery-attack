SUBJECT: IndexWriter addDocument NullPointerException
DATE: 21 Feb 2003

Hello,

writer.addDocument(doc) is throwing an NullPointerException. The stacktrace from the catched
Exception is only one line "NullPointerException" without anything else. 
I open the IndexWriter with create true. Run over the files in a Directory and add all found
documents. After that i close the indexwriter. 80% of the documents were added without problems.
The rest gets that NullPointerException.

Any Ideas?


Thanks

Günter
