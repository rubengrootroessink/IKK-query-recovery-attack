Yes... just like every software boils down to branching and while loops for
the processor... ;o)

Yes, of course this is very complex. That's why NLP is a very popular field
of research: it's challenging!

You're correct, results are not 100% perfect. But getting 95% is pretty
impressive when you're dealing with a computer software. Don't forget, even
with many years (decades even) of experience with our own language, we
humans still manage to misunderstand certain sentences... can you really
expect a software to be 100% correct all the time?

Maybe you're right, technologies derived from NLP may never be perfect. But
it doesn't make them useless. Quite the contrary I think.

I'm not a Lucene expert, but I'm sure it could benefit from using derived
NLP methods for text analysis. Maybe someone out there has some experience
they might want to share with us?

Thanks,
Phil
