Actually, yes there is. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a very broad
research subject but a lot has come out of it.

More specifically, Rule-based taggers have become very popular since Eric
Brill published his works on trainable rule-based tagging.

Essentially, it comes to down analysing sentences to determine the role
(noun, verb, etc.) of each words. It's very helpful to extract noun-phrases
such has "cardiovascular disease" or "magnetic resonance imaging" from
documents.

So, yep... you can definitely derive rules to analyse natural language...

I'm sure you already know about all of this... just thought it might be
interesting for some...
