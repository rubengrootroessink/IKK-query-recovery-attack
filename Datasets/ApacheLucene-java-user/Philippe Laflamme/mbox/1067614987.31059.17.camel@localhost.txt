Having more RAM does not necessarily mean you can use it in your
process. Keep in mind that a Xeon is a 32 bit x86 architecture, hence
can only physically address 4GB of RAM.

This means that theoretically a process cannot access more than 4GB (all
of them accounted for can add up to 16GB and more due to swap).

I say theoretically because there are other limitations. Last I heard,
Linux can only access 2GB of RAM per process. This is even worse for a
Java VM since it needs to allocate its memory in one chunk. 

This Java VM limitation makes the available memory even lower: look at
/proc/<pid>/maps of a Java process, you'll see that dynamic libraries
create holes in the memory map that a VM cannot access. A Java VM on
Linux is limited to approximatly 1.5GB. Try it: java -Xmx2000m will fail
on a 32 bit Linux machine. There might be some kernel pathes that I am
not aware of though.

If your 6M docs take up more than what you can access in one process,
you'll have to split up your processing into multiple VMs. Each VM could
load a RAMDirectory index that fits into the limitations. Then you'd
have another process that could access these "distributed" indexes.

Yes 16GB of RAM is defenitly fun... on a 64 bit architecture.
