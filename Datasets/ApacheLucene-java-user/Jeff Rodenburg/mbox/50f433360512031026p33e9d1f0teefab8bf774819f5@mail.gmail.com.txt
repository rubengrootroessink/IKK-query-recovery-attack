SUBJECT: Distributed sort
DATE: 3 Dec 2005

In one of the Google Labs whitepapers (
http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf), a programming construct
known as MapReduce is used in a variety of jobs/tasks within Google's
operation.  As an example of the application of MapReduce, the whitepaper
refers to Distributed Sorting.

Essentially this looks like a data storage strategy to facilitate a
distributed sort feature.  How does this approach compare to Lucene's
sorting mechanism?
