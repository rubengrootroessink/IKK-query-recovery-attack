Doug Cutting once said, back in 2003:

" The *HitCollector*-based search API is not meant to work remotely. To do
so would involve an RPC-callback for every non-zero score, which would be
extremely expensive. Also, just making *HitCollector* serializable would not
be sufficient. You'd also need to pass in a *HitCollector* implementation
that subclasses UnicastRemoteObject, so that the callbacks can return to the
original VM.

So, if you can, it's considerably simpler and more efficient to use
TopDocs-based search when you're working remotely."

Is this still considered best practice?
