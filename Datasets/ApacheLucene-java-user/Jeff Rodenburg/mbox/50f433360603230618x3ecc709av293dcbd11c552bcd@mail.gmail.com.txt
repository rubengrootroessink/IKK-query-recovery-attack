I run Lucene.Net as well, and your indexing performance is dependent on more
factors aside from whether you're using the Java or C# version.  As a basic
suggestion, learn what you can about minMergeDocs and mergeFactor as well as
the compound file format.  Try different combinations to understand what is
faster vs. slower.

As a strategy for your specific scenario, you might consider building
several indexes in parallel, then merging the indexes at the end.

Hope this helps.
