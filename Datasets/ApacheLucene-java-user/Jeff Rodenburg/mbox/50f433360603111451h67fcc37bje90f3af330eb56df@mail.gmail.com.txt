SUBJECT: Index validation utility
DATE: 11 Mar 2006

I'm working on a utility program to help me verify/validate my Lucene
indexes.  By that, I mean checking for data conformance, minimum fields,
etc.  Using XML Schema Definition (http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema), my goal is
to ensure that indexes that I create are compliant for requisite fields,
data types, etc.

I'm working on this mostly for myself, but if anyone is interested just send
me an email off-list.

cheers,
