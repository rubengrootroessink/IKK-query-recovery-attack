Ben -

I can think of two ways to achieve this.

1) While adding your information to the index, query the index for an 
existing record. If you get no match, add the record.
2) Control the exclusivity requirement from your data source, so that no 
duplicate records ever have the opportunity to be indexed.

This is an operational question, so the *best* way depends on your overall 
operation, as both of these approaches have consequences on index 
maintenance operations.

Hope this helps.
