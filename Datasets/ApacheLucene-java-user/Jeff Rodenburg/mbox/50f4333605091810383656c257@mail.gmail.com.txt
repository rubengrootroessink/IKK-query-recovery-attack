The typical approach (from what I know) to implementing an affect on scoring 
is to do field boosting. The difficulty in this scenario is the distance 
factor, which sounds as if it's determined at run-time, plus the trickiness 
of field boosting based on the values of the field. I've looked at this as 
well, and it's not a simple problem to solve.

How are you determining if something is "near me"? Is it a calculation at 
run-time, i.e. latitude, longitude, and geometric math? What options do you 
have to determine distance?
