SUBJECT: "Right" combination of analyzers for indexing and searching
DATE: 4 Sep 2005

Question to those who've deployed and maintained Lucene: any recommendations 
or observations about practical decisions regarding analyzer choice in 
indexing & searching? What have you found in operation to work well, become 
difficult, yield better/worse results, affect performance, etc.? What would 
you do differently if you were starting from scratch?

Cheers from sunny Seattle,
