The Keyword analyzer does no stemming or input modification of any sort:
think of it as WYSIWYG for index population.  The Whitespace analyzer simply
removes spaces from your input (still no stemming), but the tokens are the
individual words.  I don't have the code in front of me, so I'm not sure if
the Whitespace analyzer uses a LowerCaseTokenizer or not.  Analyzers don't
break on partial terms; they may take a term and break it down further, but
the starting point is the term itself.

The analyzer won't detect the patterns -- it's your query.  You'll want to
look at WildcardQuery and/or PhraseQuery.  Given the sequences you've listed
as matches, you'll have to experiment with indexing to meet those
scenarios.  Start there and that should give you a better idea of what you
need from your analyzer.

Hope this helps.
