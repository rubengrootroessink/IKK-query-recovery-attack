Sounds like you might have to consider both, if the first one doesn't solve
your issue. A company field sounds like it's a single entry, i.e. one that
can't be "spammed up" with multiple terms, i.e. "Oralce Oracle Oracle". It
also sounds as if you're searching multiple fields, and that some fields are
more important than others.

It sounds like there are expectations about what documents rise to the top
for a given search, so I would suggest starting by getting your boost
prioritization in order by working with a "clean" or non-spammed index.
After that, bring in the spammed index and go from there. You're right, you
won't be able to boost away the spammers.

I don't have much background with Classifier4j, but it seems that words
would need to be considered spam differently across different fields, if I
understand your indexing/querying structure. I like the approach of indexing
a boiled summary, not sure if Classifier4J doesn't have you doing a lot of
work.

Hope this helps.
