SUBJECT: Re: deleting duplicate documents from my index
DATE: 29 Jan 2006

One way to do this (depending on your system and index size) is to remove
and add every url you find.  This would ensure that every document in the
index is unique.  No need to worry about sorting and iteration and doc_ids
and the like.

It rebuilds your entire index, but if you have a duplication issue that
needs to be addressed, it's worth it.

Hope this helps.
