SUBJECT: Why is BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount static?
DATE: 15 Apr 2006

What was the thinking behind making the BooleanQuery maxClauseCount a
static?  Or, I guess more to the point, why not an instance setting as well?

Not trying to point out a flaw, just curious about the original thinking
behind the setting.  I have a situation where I have a set of BooleanQueries
that use a high number of clauses, but another set that needs a low number
of clauses (different indexes searched, and efficiencies dictate the
high/low clause range.)


cheers,
jeff
