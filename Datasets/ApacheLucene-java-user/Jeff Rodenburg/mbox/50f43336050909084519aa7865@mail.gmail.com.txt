SUBJECT: BooleanQuery or QueryFilter?
DATE: 9 Sep 2005

I know this question has been asked before, but I'm not certain of what 
would work best for my scenario. So here goes...

I have an index with documents that carry a broad number of keyword fields, 
usually containing numeric Ids (no sorting, so no leading zeros). From a set 
of search results, I need counts of the results filtered by any one of these 
keyword Id fields. So, for a search yielding 10000 matches, I need to filter 
the search results by Field1 containing the Ids 1,2,3....... and so on. The 
keyword field filter list can be substantial, running into the thousands of 
Ids.

Should I be looking at BooleanQuery, QueryFilter or a custom filter? 
QueryFilter (or customfilter, as I may pull the id values from a db) seem 
like the *best* approach for my scenario. I'm just looking for feedback from 
others who have gone this route and what their experiences yielded.

Thanks,
jeff
