I have a similar requirement, but the loop-through-and-build model looks way 
too expensive. I've explored the concept of executing multiple sub-searches 
to get filters and their subsequent counts, but my requirements allows me a 
sustainable, smaller set of potential dynamic filters. This is the concept, 
haven't put it into practice so have no idea if it scales any better than 
the brute force method.
