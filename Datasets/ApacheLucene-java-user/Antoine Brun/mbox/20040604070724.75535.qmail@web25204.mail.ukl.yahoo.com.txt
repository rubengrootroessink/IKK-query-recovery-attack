SUBJECT: using previous results on a new search
DATE: 4 Jun 2004

Hello,
 
I am new to Lucene and more generally to search engines. As my company has decided to base
its new software on Lucene, I have one first question about Lucene querying functionnalities.
 
We are investigating the possibility to insert previous search results to a new query.  
 
Does anyone knows if it is possible or if such an evolution is under development
 
Thanks
 
    Antoine Brun
