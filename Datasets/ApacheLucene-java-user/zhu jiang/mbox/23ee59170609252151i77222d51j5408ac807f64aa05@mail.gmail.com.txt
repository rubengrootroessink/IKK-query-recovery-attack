SUBJECT: [Lucene2.0]How to not highlight keywords in some fields?
DATE: 26 Sep 2006

Hi all,

    For example, if I have a document with two fields text and num like
this:
----------------
text:foo bar 1
num:1
----------------

When users query "foo", I changed the query to "text:foo AND num:1", both
"foo" and "1" in the text field will be highlighted. I don't wanna the word
"1" in text field to be highlighted. What should I do? Pls help me
