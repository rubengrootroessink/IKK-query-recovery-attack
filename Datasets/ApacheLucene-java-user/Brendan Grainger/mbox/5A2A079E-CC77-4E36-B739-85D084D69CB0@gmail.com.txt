SUBJECT: Re: Question about startOffset and endOffset
DATE: 12 May 2008

Hi Erick,

Thanks for the reply. The use case I have is this:

Say you have a synonym expansion like this:

ac -> air conditioning

And to keep it simple, a document where the first term is ac. When  
analyzing the document I currently create a token stream that looks  
something like this for the 'ac' term:

ac -> Token(positionIncrement = 1, startOffset = 0, endOffset = 2,  
type = 'word')
air -> Token(positionIncrement = 0, startOffset = 0, endOffset = 2,  
type = 'synonym')
conditioning -> Token(positionIncrement = 0, startOffset = 0,  
endOffset = 2, type = 'synonym')

Now what I'd like to do is be able to do is to display the fact that  
this expansion took place to the user when they query. However, now I  
don't know how to reconstruct the word 'air conditioning'. If however,  
I do this:

ac -> Token(positionIncrement = 1, startOffset = 0, endOffset = 2,  
type = 'word')
air -> Token(positionIncrement = 0, startOffset = 0, endOffset = 3,  
type = 'synonym')
conditioning -> Token(positionIncrement = 0, startOffset = 3,  
endOffset = 15, type = 'synonym')

I can reconstruct the fact that ac maps to air conditioning.

Thanks
Brendan
