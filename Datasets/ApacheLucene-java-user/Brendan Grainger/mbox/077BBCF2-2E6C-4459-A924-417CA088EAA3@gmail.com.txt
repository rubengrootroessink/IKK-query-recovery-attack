SUBJECT: Question about startOffset and endOffset
DATE: 12 May 2008

Hi,

I have a TokenStream that inserts synonym tokens into the stream when  
matched. One thing I am wondering about is what is the effect of the  
startOffset and endOffset. I have something like this:

Token synonymToken = new Token(originalToken.startOffset(),  
originalToken.endOffset(), "SYNONYM");
synonymToken.setPositionIncrement(0);

What I am wondering is if I set the startOffset and endOffset to 0 and  
the endOffset to the length of the synonym string what effect will  
this have?

eg
Token synonymToken = new Token(0, repTok.endOffset(), "SYNONYM");
synonymToken.setPositionIncrement(0);

Thanks
