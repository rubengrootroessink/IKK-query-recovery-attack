SUBJECT: Escape character and Special character
DATE: 30 Jan 2008


Hi,

When I tried to do a lucene search using escape character with other
special character like the following:

SUBJECT:Yahoo\!~0.5
SUBJECT:Yahoo\!*

It seems the parser totally ignores the escape character, and becomes

SUBJECT:Yahoo!~0.5
SUBJECT:Yahoo!*

which gives me syntax exception.

Any reason why?

I am using Lucene 2.2.

Thanks.

Joshua
