I can't see any real advantage of storing n-grams explicitly. Just index the 
document and use phrase queries. Order is significant with phrase queries if 
I recall correctly, although you can use SpanNearQueries to look for 
unordered ngrams, although I don't know why you would want to!

Perhaps if you explain a little more about what you are trying to achieve more 
generally, we can confirm that you don't need to mess with explicit indexing 
of indexing.
