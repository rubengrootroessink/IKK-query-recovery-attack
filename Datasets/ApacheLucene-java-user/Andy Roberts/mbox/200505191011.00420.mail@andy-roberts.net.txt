I'm not sure if this helps. I have a method that I used when experimenting 
with Lucene. It takes in a String which contains the path for an index, opens 
a reader, enumerates each term in that index. For each term, it prints out 
the term itself its frequency, and the number of documents that term appeared 
in.

public static void viewTerms(String indexPath) throws IOException {
	
		IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(indexPath);

		TermEnum te = reader.terms();

		while (te.next()) {
			Term currentTerm = te.term();
			
			TermPositions tp = reader.termPositions(currentTerm);
			
			int termFreq = 0;
			
			while (tp.next()) {
				termFreq += tp.freq();
			}
			
			System.out.println(currentTerm.text() + "(" + termFreq + "|" + te.docFreq() 
+ ")");
		
		}

		reader.close();
	}

HTH,
Andy
