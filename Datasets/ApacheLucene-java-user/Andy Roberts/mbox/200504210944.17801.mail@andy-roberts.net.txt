Of course, you are making the assumption that Lucene is only used in the 
context of online search engines. This is not the case here. I have developed 
a stand alone application for text analysis, and I bundle the Lucene jar with 
it to store text in an efficient index. Once the software is on the users' 
computer, I don't want to be doing any maintenance of their indexes! (And I'm 
sure they'd prefer it that way too)
