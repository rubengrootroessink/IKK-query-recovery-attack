Can you not provide the user with a option list to specify their input 
language?

Language identification can be a pretty tricky field. There are some tricks 
you can do with unicode to identify language, e.g., \u0600 - \u06FF contains 
the Arabic characters, so if you're input contains lots of chars within this 
range, you can guess that the input is Arabic, for example.

The problem comes with differentiating between the languages that use a Latin 
alphabet. Again, there are multiple approaches, although the only one I know 
of that worked pretty well for identifying European languages was to build a 
model based on character bigrams (that is, sequences of two letters) [1]

At the end of the day, Lucene cannot help you in choosing the correct language 
as it doesn't know, and so it'll be up to you to add the necessary logic to 
tell Lucene which Analyzers to utilise. :(
