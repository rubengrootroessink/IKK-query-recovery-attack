SUBJECT: Highlighter compile error
DATE: 10 Mar 2005

I've search the archives for this error, but it reported no matches...

I'm trying to get hold of the Highlighter code as this could be relevant 
to my earlier post. I've checked out the highlight repo to my PC and 
tried to build.

I get the following error:

BUILD FAILED
/home/andyr/programming/java/lucene/common.xml:107: Compile failed; see the 
compiler error output for details.

It may not be obvious to those not using fixed-width fonts, but basically it 
can't find the 
TermVectorOffsetInfo class. Which is hardly surprising, since it doesn't seem 
to exist! I've
also downloaded and successfully built the code in the lucene-1.4.2-dev 
branch,
but that doesn't contain that class either!

Any hints? Google didn't shed any light, btw.

Cheers,
Andy Roberts
