Perhaps you do some crude checking against a dictionary. Combine the word 
anyway and check if it's in the dictionary. If so, keep it merged otherwise, 
it's a compound and so revert back to the hyphenated form.

Word lists come part of all good OSS dictionary projects, as well as other 
language resources, like the BNC word lists etc.
