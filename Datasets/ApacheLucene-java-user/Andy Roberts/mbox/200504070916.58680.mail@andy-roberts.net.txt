The Lucene In Action book has an excellent chapter on Analysers - well worth a 
read. Of particular interest is some code that allows you to see how a given 
Analyser tokenises an input string.

You can download the source code from the book 
(http://www.lucenebook.com/LuceneInAction.zip). If you unzip this file you 
will find a directory called "LuceneInAction/src/lia/analysis" and in there 
is a class called AnalyzerDemo (which depends in AnalyzerUtils). Compile this 
and run to see how the Analysers work. Put in your hyphenated strings to see 
how they work too.
