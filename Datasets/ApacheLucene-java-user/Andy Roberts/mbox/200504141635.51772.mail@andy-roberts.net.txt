Off the top of my head... assuming you have an IndexReader (or MultiReader) called reader:

TermEnum te = reader.terms();

while (te.next()) {
	Term currentTerm = te.term();
	
	TermDocs docs = reader.termDocs(currentTerm);
	int docCounter = 1;
	while (docs.next()) {
		System.out.println(currentTerm.text() + ", doc" + docCount + ", " + docs.freq());
		docCounter++;
	}
}

HTH,

Andy
