Instead of UnIndexed, have you tried using a Keyword field?

 From the javadoc:
   Field.UnIndexed:  Constructs a String-valued Field that is
                     not tokenized nor indexed, but is stored
                     in the index, for return with hits.

   Field.Keyword:    Constructs a String-valued Field that is
                     not tokenized, but is indexed and stored.

(note that I haven't tried this in code with file paths, so there may 
still be analyzer tweaking necessary)
