Is there a better way to achieve this?

I'd think it would be hard to gather a list of meaningful terms
from the current hit that are meaningful to the user.  It would seem
that an alias expansion on the origional searh experssion, or 
possibly even a collection of terms (of the most common terms
in the document we're looking for documents like) after 
going through a stop word analyzer or something.  

I've not implmented anything like this.  Just a few thoughts.
