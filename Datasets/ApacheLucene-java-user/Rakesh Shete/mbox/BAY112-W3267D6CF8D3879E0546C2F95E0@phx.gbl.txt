SUBJECT: Boosting Vs Sorting
DATE: 21 Dec 2007


Hi all,

I am using Hibernate Search (http://www.hibernate.org/410.html) which is a wrapper around
Lucene for performing search over info stored in the DB. I have questions related to Lucene
boosting Vs sorting:

Is index time boosting of documents and fields better than specifying sorting parameters at
search time?

I have been browsing through the Lucene mail archives for an answer to this. Going through
them and reading on stuff related to Lucene scoring, my understanding is that if I know upfront
at index time that the relevance order of results is based on certain fields, then, it is
better to have index time boosting of documents and fields. Am I right here?

My requirements are like: 
Results having an exact match to the input query string should have highest preference followed
by an exact match with field1, field2, field3 and then followed by search query substring
(or near match) match with field1, field2, field3.

Any suggestions are most welcome.
