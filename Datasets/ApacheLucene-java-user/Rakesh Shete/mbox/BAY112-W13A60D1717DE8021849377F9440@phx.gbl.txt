SUBJECT: Matching symbols like #,$,@
DATE: 12 Jan 2008





Hi all,

I want to match a string like "ABC#$" with "ABC#$@%@$^@$^@". 

The query string generated by QueryParse is as follows:

title:ABC#$*

I
append the "*" so that it becomes a wild card search. It does not
return me any records. I did try escaping '#' and '$'. But that too
does not work. 
I checked the list of special symbols that can be escaped and the above two don't fall under
it.

If modify the search to match "ABC" with querystring as title:ABC* then it does return me
the result as "ABC#$@%@$^@$^@".

Am I missing something here? How do I tell Lucene to match symbols like '#', '$', etc.

--Regards,
Rakesh S
