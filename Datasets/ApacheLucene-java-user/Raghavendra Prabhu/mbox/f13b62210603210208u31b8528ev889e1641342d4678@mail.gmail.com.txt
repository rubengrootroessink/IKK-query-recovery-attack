Hi

I am using the highlightertest.java to extract the wild card terms.

I use the queryParser to parse my queryString

Then i store the text in a RAM directory ( which i want to scan)

and then rewrite it as mentioned in the highlighter example

query=query.rewrite(reader)

Now if i print the query, i see that it does not contain anything

I repeat the query does not contain anything

What is the reason for this problem?  Any help would be appreciated.

Rgds
Prabhu
