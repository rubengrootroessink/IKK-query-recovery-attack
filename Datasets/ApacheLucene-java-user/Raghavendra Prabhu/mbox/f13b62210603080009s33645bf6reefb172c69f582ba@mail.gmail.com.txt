DATE: 8 Mar 2006

I want to use query parser to parse my query string

But the default field should be a group of fields with different fields
where it is searched on

Can any one let me know

For example if my query is

new books

new should be searched in different fields ( content and title)

books should be searched in different fields ( content and title)


How do i accomplish this and how can i extend querparser to do the above
