Hi

The problem which i am facing is that the query is Case Sensitive

If i type in BIG letters i am not able to see answers and if  i type in
small letters i am able to see results

Is there anything by which i can do a case conversion

Now i am using a WhiteSpaceAnalyser . What Analyser should change it to ?
