Hi guys

If anyone can tell me how to get the best fragments using the highligher

The query has two terms  - term1 and term2

The search result display only term1 in the highlighter whereas term2 is
also there. How can i adjust the lucene highlighter to make sure that
atleast each term is displayed in the query result
