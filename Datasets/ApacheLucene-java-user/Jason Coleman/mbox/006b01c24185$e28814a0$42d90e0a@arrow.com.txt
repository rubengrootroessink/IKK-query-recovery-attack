SUBJECT: Lucene is not closing connections to index files
DATE: 11 Aug 2002

Lucene is not letting go (closing) index files that are being searched.

I have not traced exactly where the problem is occurring, so I thought I
would get some ideas first from the board.  It appears that when a user does
a search against the Lucene index files, the connections to these files are
not released.  It continues to maintain a connection until the JVM runs out
of file space.  This is how I am querying the index:


Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(index_path);
Query query = QueryParser.parse(queryString, "body", new
StandardAnalyzer());
hits = searcher.search(query);


index_path is just the location of the Lucene index files.  I am sure that a
Reader class somewhere is not being closed properly.  Has anyone experienced
this problem when querying the index?

Jason
