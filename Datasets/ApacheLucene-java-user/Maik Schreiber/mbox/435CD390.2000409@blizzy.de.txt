SUBJECT: Non-scoring fields
DATE: 24 Oct 2005

Hi,

Just a quick question: How do I add non-scoring fields to a query? Set boost to 0?

To be more specific, my documents have a "permissions" field containing the
names of groups who are allowed to access the document. When searching, I
search for the particular user's group (a user is in exactly one group).
Searching in the "permissions" field adds to the score, however, so that more
restrictive documents (having fewer groups in the field) tend to get a higher
score, thus showing up more towards the top of the list. I just don't want
that, though...
