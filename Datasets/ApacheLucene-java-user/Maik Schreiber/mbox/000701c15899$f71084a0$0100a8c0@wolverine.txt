I don't really think so. Since Lucene uses virtual "files" to store its
index, you have to use long binary data types with databases to store
them. It seems like each database uses these data types quite
differently. (Actually, it was quite difficult to write that
OracleDirectory because of Oracle's BLOB implementation.)
