I think this is not possible with the current Lucene implementation yet,
but I wrote a CachingDirectory implementation which is able to cache
Directories from any source Directory. Currently a RAMCachingDirectory
(caches in RAM) and a FSCachingDirectory (caches in local file system)
exist.

I still have to do some tests before I will post them on the developers'
list, though.
