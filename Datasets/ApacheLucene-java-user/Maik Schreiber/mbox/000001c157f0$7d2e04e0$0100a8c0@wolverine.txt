I developed an OracleDirectory implementation some time ago, which I
plan to post to lucene-dev in the near future.

I'm also willing to implement an SQLServerDirectory, but I haven't heard
of any demand for it. As if that weren't all, I'm having a hard time
finding a suitable (free!) JDBC driver to MS SQL Server.
