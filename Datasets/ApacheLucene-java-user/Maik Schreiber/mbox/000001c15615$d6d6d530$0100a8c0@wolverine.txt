SUBJECT: Highlighting terms, new white paper
DATE: 16 Oct 2001


Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I've set up a new white paper
along with complete source code. The new code also takes care of the new
Query subclasses PrefixQuery, RangeQuery and MultiTermQuery.

You can get the white paper (in PDF format) and source at
http://www.iq-computing.de/lucene/lucene-highlight.tar.gz
If you need US Letter format instead of A4, try
