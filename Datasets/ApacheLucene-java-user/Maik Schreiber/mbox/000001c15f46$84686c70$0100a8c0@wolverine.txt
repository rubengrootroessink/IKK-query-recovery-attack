One way to have more meaningful "stars" would be to use a scale factor
that will be applied to the scores before you decide how many stars to
display.

As an example, all scores could be scaled such that the document with
the highest score will get 100% (and thus gets 5 stars):


	float scaleFactor = hits.score(0);
	float currentDocumentScore;

	while (i = 0; i < hits.length(); i++)
	{
		currentDocumentScore = hits.score(i) * scaleFactor;

		// calculate number of "stars" here

		// do something with hits.doc(i)
	}
