I tested by directly creating a WildcardQuery, and it worked okay for
me.

As you can see from the trace, the exception occurs in MultiTermQuery.
As what I can see from the source, it looks like WildcardQuery.setEnum()
has not been called before. I have to admit that I don't know much about
the internals of MultiTermQuery and its subclasses, except for a basic
understanding of what they do (that is, constructing a BooleanQuery).
