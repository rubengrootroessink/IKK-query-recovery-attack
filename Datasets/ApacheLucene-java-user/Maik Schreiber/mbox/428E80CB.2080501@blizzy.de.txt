Looks good to me. This query would only return products where either name or
content matches "audio cable" (or both), and name matches get a higher score.

Yes. Actually each BooleanClause can have a required (+) or prohibited (-)
mode. That's why the following expansions take place:

- x AND y -> +x +y
- x OR y -> x y
- x AND NOT y -> +x -y (off the top of my head)

I for one prefer to use +/- syntax instead of AND/OR because those I find
misleading.

I have tried to explain your query with my own words. See for yourself if
they match :)


Aside from all that, did you really want to query for the _phrase_ "audio
cable"? Perhaps you wanted the words "audio" and "cable" to appear anywhere
in the fields, but not necessarily as a phrase.
