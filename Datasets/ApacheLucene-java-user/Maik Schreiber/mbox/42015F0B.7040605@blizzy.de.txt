Your search is an OR search, which is why you get a union of search hits. 
Consider these documents (which I think you have in your index):

Document 1:
- name=mario
- desc=mario

Document 2:
- name=mario
- desc=foo


- Searching for "mario" in field "name" would return 2 hits.
- Searching for "mario" in field "desc" would return 1 hit.
- Searching for "mario" in both fields would return 2 hits (which is what 
you're seeing).
