Exactly. You cannot search for "-kcfileupload:jpg", you need at least one 
clause that actually _includes_ documents.

Do you by chance have a field with known contents? If so, you could misuse 
that one and include it in your query (perhaps by doing range or 
wildcard/prefix search). If not, try IndexReader.terms() for building a 
Query yourself, then use that one for search.
