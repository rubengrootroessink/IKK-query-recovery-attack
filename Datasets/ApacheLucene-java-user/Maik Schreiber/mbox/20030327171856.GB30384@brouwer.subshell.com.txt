SUBJECT: Changing Field type
DATE: 27 Mar 2003

Hi,

In an index I have documents with a field that has been constructed using Field.UnIndexed().
Now I want to switch to Field.Keyword() so I can search for those fields,
too.

Does it cause any harm if I'm mixing field types like that?

If yes, what would be the best way to do the switch? Is removing the affected documents enough,
or do I have to recreate the entire index from scratch? (This takes
quite a while, so I'd rather avoid that if possible.)
