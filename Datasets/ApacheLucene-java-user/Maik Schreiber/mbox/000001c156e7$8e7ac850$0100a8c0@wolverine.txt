I will put a revised revision of my white paper on my server regarding
Query objects that use multiple internal Query objects to represent
themselves to the outside world. This will also include RangeQuery which
you didn't mention above.

In addition to this, I've put together a new "Projekte" (=projects) area
on my site so that you can learn about the current white paper's version
more easily.
