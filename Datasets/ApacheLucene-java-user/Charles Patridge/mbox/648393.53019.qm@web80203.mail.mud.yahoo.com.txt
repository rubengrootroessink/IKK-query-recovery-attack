SUBJECT: Concept Search
DATE: 15 May 2007

  I have looked around on Lucene web site as well as some documentation 
but have not found anything to do with Concept Search.
   
    My definition of Concept Search is as follows:
  
  1.  I would have a file (list) of various phrases / N-grams which I 
would like to Lucene to use as a search basis without having to type in 
all these phrases manually, and have Lucene return the results as it 
would normally if a single search query was entered.
   
    2.  An example would be - find !Wild_Animals! - where the "!" would 
indicate that this is a search that would use a file (ie 
Wild_Animals.txt) and read in the various phrases within this file and perform the 
search in the corpus for these phrases.
   
    3.  The contents of Wild_Animals.txt could look like this:
  BUFFALO
  BEAR
  MOOSE
  COYOTE
  WOLF
  MOUNTAIN GOAT
  MOUNTAIN SHEEP
  DALL SHEEP
  DEER
  KODIAK BEAR
  BROWN BEAR
  BLACK BEAR
  etc etc etc
   
    4.  Is my idea of a Concept Search feasible / doable???  If so, can 
you point me to any documentation that exists whereby this could be done 
within Lucene
   
    Please send any info you have on this to me -
