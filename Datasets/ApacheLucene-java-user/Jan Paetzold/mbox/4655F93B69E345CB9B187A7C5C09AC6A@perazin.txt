SUBJECT: lucene score and float precision
DATE: 29 Apr 2009

Hi,

in some cases we have the problem that for a document the ScoreDoc score
differs at the last digit of the float from the score reported by the
explanation functionality of lucene. For example: 

ScoreDoc: 16.770466 -- Explanation: 16.770468 = (MATCH) sum of: ...
ScoreDoc: 21.118656 -- Explanation: 21.118654 = (MATCH) sum of: ...

The explanation function reports a score as expected, compared to the other
results of the search, while the ScoreDoc score is a bit to low or to high. 

Does anyone have an idea? 


regards,
Jan
