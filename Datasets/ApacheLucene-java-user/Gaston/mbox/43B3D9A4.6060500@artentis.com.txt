SUBJECT: QueryParser over multiple fields
DATE: 29 Dec 2005

Hallo,


in my index every document consistsof multiple fields like 
url,contents,description etc.I want to search for documents in the url 
and the contents field.
My problem is that the constructor of QueryParser only provide one field 
like "Query query=QueryParser.parse("query",field1,analyzer);"
Is there an oppurtinity to construct an query Object like "Query 
query=QueryParser.parse("query",field1,field2,analyzer);" to provide a 
search over field1 and field2 ?
I solved this problem in a very unelegant way I think because I 
introduced two searching procedures in my application, one for field1 
and the another one for field2. But this is very bad for the performance 
because the application has to search two times.

I am glad about every suggestion


Greetings


Gaston
