SUBJECT: cache persistent Hits
DATE: 26 Sep 2006

Hi,

Lucene has itself  volatile caching mechanism provided by a weak 
HashMap. Is there a possibilty to serialize the Hits Object? I think of 
a HashMap that for each found result, caches the first 100 results. Is 
it possible to implement such a feature or is there such an extension? 
My problem is that the searching of my application with an index with 
the size of 212MB takes to much time, despite I set the BooleanOperator 
from OR to AND

I am happy about every suggestion.

Greetings

Gaston.
