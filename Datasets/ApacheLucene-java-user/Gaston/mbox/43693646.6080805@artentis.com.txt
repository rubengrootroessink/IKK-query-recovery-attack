SUBJECT: lucene jar and war
DATE: 2 Nov 2005

Hello,

My provider only allows to upload war files. My problem is I make a war 
archive out of the lucene-1.4.3.jar file and my jsp webpages based on 
lucene. And this does not work. I hava one solution to solve my problem: 
I have to unpack the lucene-1.4.3.jar file and pack it again with my 
.jsp webpages in a war file. My question is: Is there any better solution?

Thank you in advance

Gaston
