I was wondering if there is any way to control what kind of documents
are returned from a search. For example, lets say we have an index
built from different types of documents (pdf, txt, html, etc.). Is
there a way to have the first x results have a specified distribution
of document types? It would be nice to have an even number of results
that are from pdfs, txt files, and html files.


Any help would greatly be appreciated.
