I posted this on java-dev@lucene.apache.org and it was suggested that
I pose this question here:

Hello Everyone,

I just started to use lucene recently. Great project BTW. I was
wondering if anyone has suggested making an open source version of
dbsight (www.dbsight.net/). I've just started using it and I think it
would be awesome if it was open source. Does anyone know of a project
that's like this that is OS?

If not, then how can I propose a project that does a similar thing?

Thanks,
Mike
