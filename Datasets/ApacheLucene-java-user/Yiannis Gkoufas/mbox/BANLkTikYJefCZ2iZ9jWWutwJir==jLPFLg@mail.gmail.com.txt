SUBJECT: Re: Semantic indexing in Lucene
DATE: 24 May 2011

It's not my blog! :D
I used some of the ideas in that article
http://sujitpal.blogspot.com/2009/03/vector-space-classifier-using-lucene.html
in
order to perform classification with lucene for my tasks.
You can get full access to the source code of the project by typing in the
command line:

svn checkout *http*://semanticvectors.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/semanticvectors-read-only

Or you can access the trunk directly by the url
http://semanticvectors.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
