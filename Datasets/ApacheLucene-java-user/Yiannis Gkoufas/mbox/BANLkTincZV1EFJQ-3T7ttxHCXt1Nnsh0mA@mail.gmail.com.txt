I have noticed that for some queries the results are the same, for others
not. It should be the same, if someone knows why is it happening it would be
very useful.

After running numerous tests I have concluded that a boost factor up to 20
makes sense.

Yes, that is certain.

In order to get the best boosts for my tests, I tried brute-forcing it.
In theory, you can experiment with vector space models, modified perceptron.
