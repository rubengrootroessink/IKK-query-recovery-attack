Hi Diego,

Are you referring to that project-->
http://code.google.com/p/semanticvectors/ ?
If yes , then documentation exists here
http://semanticvectors.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest-stable/index.html .
Also I think this blog might interest you --> http://sujitpal.blogspot.com/ and
the project related to it ---> http://jtmt.sf.net/

BR,
Yiannis
