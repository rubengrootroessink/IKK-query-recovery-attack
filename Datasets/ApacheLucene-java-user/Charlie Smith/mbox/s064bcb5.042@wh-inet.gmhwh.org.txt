DATE: 27 Mar 2004

What would be the URL for the JUnit stuff?
 
BTW: I was able to build a new Index.class file, with the additional line
iw.setUserCompoundFile(true)  after extracting the  lucene-1.4-rc1-dev.jar.
 
Then reindexed.  Guess what - no worky.  :(
 
Help!!!!!!!
 
Can I get 1.3-RC2?  Could someone point me to the URL for this download please
;)
 
I noticed following entry in mail archives:
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg06118.html
 
along with 139 others that dealt with the "too many files open" problem.
 
Looks like this is a high priority problem that might justify a new release in
and of itself?

Geez, you want documentation also?   :)

Try the JUnit test cases for starters.  That is the "definitive" 
documentation at the moment.
