SUBJECT: UNIX command-line indexing script?
DATE: 13 Mar 2004

Anyone written a simple UNIX command-line indexing script which will read a
bunch off different kinds of docs and index them?  I'd like to make a cron job
out of this so as to be able to come back and read it later during a search.
 
PERL or JAVA script would be fine.
