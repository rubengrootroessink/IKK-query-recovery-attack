Your opinion of course on the issued of "too many files open" not being a bug.
I found it to be otherwise.  

Thanks for the info on popular elections.   

Being a newbie to this list, I am finding that most others on the list a bit
more pleasant.  

But then, you not up for a popular election, are you?  Appreciate all you do to
keep
us from shooting ourselves in the foot.

Thankyou. :(

There is no "too many files open bug", except perhaps in your 
application.  It is however an easy to encounter problem if you don't 
close indexes or if you change Lucene's default parameters.  It will be 
considerably harder to make happen in 1.4, to keep so many people from 
shooting themselves in the foot.

Also, releases are not made by popular election.  They are made by 
volunteer developer when deemeed appropriate.  If you'd like to get more 
involved in Lucene's development, please contribute constructive efforts 
to the lucene-dev mailing list.

This was discussed at lenght on the developer mailing list a while back. 
  The change has been made and will be present in 1.4.

The second hit for a Google search on "lucene 1.3RC2" reveals:

These search engines sure are amazing, aren't they!
