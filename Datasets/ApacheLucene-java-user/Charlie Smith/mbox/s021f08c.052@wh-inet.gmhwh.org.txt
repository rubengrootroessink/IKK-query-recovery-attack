Can we post to this forum for help with plucene?
There is reference to a simplanalyzer.  Is there another that would be used to
parse ms word, word perfect files?

Plucene 1.0 has just been released to CPAN, and is available at
  http://search.cpan.org/dist/Plucene/ 

This is a port of Lucene to Perl, and should mirror the Java version
fairly closely.

More details on the rationale behind Plucene are available at

Thank you to the Lucene team for a wonderful product. Hopefully Plucene
can help take that to a wider group of developers.

Tony
