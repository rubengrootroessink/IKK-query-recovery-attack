I'll vote yes  please release new version with "too many files open" fixed.
Maybe default the setUserCompoundFile(true) to true on this go around.
 

Otherwise, how can I get 1.3-RC2?  I can't seem to locate it.

thanks Erik.  Ok this is my official lobby effort for the release of 1.4 to
final status.  Anyone else need/want a 1.4 release?

Does anyone have any information on 1.4 release plans?

thanks,
chad.

    This is open-source.   I'm only as serious as it would take for someone
    to push it through.  I don't know what the timeline is, although lots
    of new features are available.

    Why explain it?!  Just show great results and let that be the
    explanation :)

    *shrug* - feel free to lobby for it.  I don't know what else is planned
    before a release.
