OOps,   I meant to say I found no setUseCompoundFilter().  I read the note
wrong
and tried to compile with ...Filter  not ...File.
There is a setUseCompoundFile(), which is what was recommended.

So, got rid of that problem   whew.  now have others like:
Index.java:125: cannot resolve symbol
symbol  : method didParse ()
location: class PdfToText
                       else if  (pp.didParse()) {
                                            ^
./EmailThread.java:2: package javax.mail does not exist
import javax.mail.*;
^
./EmailThread.java:3: package javax.mail.internet does not exist
import javax.mail.internet.*;
^
./WordToText.java:5: package org.apache.poi.hdf.extractor does not exist
import org.apache.poi.hdf.extractor.WordDocument;
                                    ^
./WordToText.java:11: cannot resolve symbol
symbol  : class WordDocument
location: class WordToText
    WordDocument wd;

I downloaded latest 1.3 of lucene (lucene-1.3-final ), searched for setUse and
only found setUseCompoundFile().  No routine called setUseCompoundFile().
