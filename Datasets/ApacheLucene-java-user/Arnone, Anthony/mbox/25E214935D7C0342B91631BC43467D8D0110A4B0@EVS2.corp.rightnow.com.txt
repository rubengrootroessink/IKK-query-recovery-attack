SUBJECT: span queries and proximity boosting
DATE: 4 Dec 2007

Hello all,

 

I’ve been looking into using the nice power of the SpanNearQuery instead of PhraseQuery,
mostly because of the simplification of the slop factors. However, I’m wondering if the
SpanNearQueries will boost the result based on the term proximity, just like PhraseQuery does.
Does anyone have any experience with doing this?

 

Thanks,

Anthony
