SUBJECT: Re: all stop words in exact phrase get 0 hits

thanks all,

Yes, I know + means it must be true, but the phrase goes through the
same analyzer, so stop words are removed....

I made some debugging and I got this:
Query query = QueryParser.parse(searchexp, "body", LuceneHelper.getAnalyzer());

If searchexp is
((+(body:"I have")) OR (+(attachments:"I have")))
query .toString() is
(+()) (+())

but if searchexp is
+body:"I have" OR +attachments:"I have"
query .toString() is blank

so that makes it work differently I think. I have lots of parenthesis
cause I build the string by code from multiple UI boxes etc, to make
sure ands and ors are properly handled.

As i said i can overcome that by code, but I think that is a bug no?
it shoudl realize (+()) (+()) its just parenthesis...
