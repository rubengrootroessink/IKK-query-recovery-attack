SUBJECT: all stop words in exact phrase get 0 hits
DATE: 15 Dec 2005

 Hi,

Suppose I have a query like this:
+attachments:purpose
 that returns N hits.
If I add another condition
+attachments:purpose +attachments:"hello world"
I still get some hits, but if the words in the "hello world" phrase
happen to be all stop words I get 0 hits.

I can fix that by checking at least one of them is not a stop word,
but just wanted to know wether thats expected behaviour.


Im using lucene1.9rc.
thanks
