SUBJECT: Re: Best HTML Parser !!
DATE: 26 Feb 2003

I've had fairly good experience with Jtidy!

But HTMLParser http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/
seems to have the lighter looking API. It is Event
based and I might need to parse some large HTML sometime
soon, where DOM might be the problem. Does anyone
have practical experience with HTMLParser?

Thanks
Frank
