Hi,

after working with lucene again after nearly two years of
abstinence, yeah ;-), I'm running into trouble :-/

Hope I didn't miss it in the FAQs: IndexReader.termDocs(Term)
doesn't return a positioned TermDocs with lucene 1.3 RC1
(actually it seems to return the same as a termDocs() call).
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe the RC1 ?

Cheers,
Frank
