SUBJECT: Avoid stemming to get exact word in search results
DATE: 3 Mar 2008

Hi, 

 

I’m using RSS Bandit feed reader (HYPERLINK
"http://www.rssbandit.org"www.rssbandit.org) whose search engine is based on
Lucene. 

 

I understand the interest of stemming but I sometimes want the exact word
and not the stemmed one.

 

For example a search  with OFS (a company) gives plenty of responses with
“of”. 

 

If I search for “custom”, I sometimes don’t want to get “customer”.

 

I’ve tried “OFS” or +ofs but nothing works. 

 

Is there a specific syntax to get it (could be a good idea to have it in the
Query Parser Syntax) or do the guys at RSS Bandit have to modify something ?


 

Best regards

 

Serge
