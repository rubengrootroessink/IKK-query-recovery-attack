SUBJECT: Re: which HTML parser is better?
DATE: 3 Feb 2005

Karl,

Two things, try to experiment with both:

1) I would try to write a lexical scanner that strips HTML tags, much 
like the regular expression does. Java lexical scanner packages produce 
nice pure Java classes that seldom use any advanced API, so they should 
work on Java 1.1. They are simple state machines with states encoded in 
integers -- this should work like a charm, be fast and small.

2) Write a parser yourself. Having a regular expression it isn't that 
difficult to do... :)
