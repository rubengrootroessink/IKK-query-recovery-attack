I'm pretty sure it doesn't solve the problem in general (it isn't a 
thread-save solution for sure, you mentioned the memory barrier, I'd add 
compiler optimizations). If it works it must be something 
application-specific, maybe synchronization isn't really needed there, 
or you just don't do anything (i.e. write operations) that would cause a 
crash.
