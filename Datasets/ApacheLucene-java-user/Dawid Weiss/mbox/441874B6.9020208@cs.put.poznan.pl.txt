Hi Doug,

It should definitely say so in the JavaDoc because I've seen this 
propagate to people's articles (it was Eric Hatcher's I think, but I'm 
not sure).

To be honest I didn't go that deep in the subject. I just found myself 
perplexed a bit when I saw you calculating the edit distance as a 
difference of two values :) Nothing personal of course, your code in 
there is quite neat but it tosses all all kinds of indices around and I 
actually thought I got it wrong somehow so I asked to be sure.

That's the idea I came up too -- aggregating the error over absolute 
values of positional differences (?) would solve the problem; I'd also 
go for incrementing/ decrementing totalError instead of changing method 
signatures. I'm just not sure if it makes sense to change the behavior 
of PhraseQuery just because I had to please my curiosity :). People are 
used to how it works and maybe it should stay this way. If somebody 
really wants a real edit distance then with your hints and understanding 
of how PhraseQuery works it should be quite straightforward to implement.

Thanks for clarifications,
Dawid
