Hi.

I have a very technical question. I need to alter document score (or in 
fact: document boosts) for an existing index, but for each query. In 
other words, I'd like these to have pseudo-queries of the form:

1. civil war PREFER:shorter
2. civil war PREFER:longer

for these two queries, 1. would score shorter documents higher then 
option 2, which would in turn score longer documents higher. Note that 
these preferences can be expressed at query time, so static document 
boosts are of little help.

I'd appreciate if those familiar with the internals of Lucene gave me 
brief instructions on how this could be achieved (my rough guess is that 
I'll need to build my own Scorer... but how to access document length 
and where to plug in that scorer... besides I'd rather hear it from 
somebody with more expertise).

Thanks,
D.
