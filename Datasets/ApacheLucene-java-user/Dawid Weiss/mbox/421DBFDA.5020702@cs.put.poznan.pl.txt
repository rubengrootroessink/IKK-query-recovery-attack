Hi Owen,

I'm from the Carrot2 project, so I feel called to the blackboard:

Staszek Osinski is the author of Lingo, the best clustering algorithm 
available in Carrot2 -- we still work together in that project... In 
other words, Carrot2 doesn't use 'similar' techniques. It uses _the_ 
techniques described in the above thesis (and other various papars, see 
my Web page).

You can use Carrot2 directly for that. There are a few options. One 
thing is you can directly feed your input collection to the clustering 
component (it will take a while, but should work) -- you need to write a 
custom input component, but it is a very simple thing to do and I'm sure 
if you write to Carrot2 mailing list there will be somebody willing to 
help (like myself or Staszek ;).

Another option is: use Lucene to index your documents. Set up Carrot2 to 
use Lucene (described somewhere on this list, see David Spencer's message).

Yep, there is a problem with it. Post a bug report to carrot2 bugzilla, 
please. I'll investigate it when I have time.

It kind of is because carrot2 clustering components work primarily with 
_short_, scarce information sources, such as snippets. We don't intend 
to work on large, raw documents collections... Having said that, a 1200 
documents isn't that much and you should be able to get your clusters.
