SUBJECT: Clustering lucene's results
DATE: 23 Sep 2004


Dear all,

I saw a post about an attempt to integrate Carrot2 with Lucene. It was a 
while ago, so I'm curious if any outcome has been achieved.

Anyway, as the project coordinator I can offer my help with such 
integration; if you're looking for some ready-to-use code then there is 
a clustering plugin for Nutch that integrates one of the clustering 
algorithms from Carrot2 with Nutch; I'm sure porting it to Lucene 
wouldn't be a big problem.

Ragards,
Dawid
