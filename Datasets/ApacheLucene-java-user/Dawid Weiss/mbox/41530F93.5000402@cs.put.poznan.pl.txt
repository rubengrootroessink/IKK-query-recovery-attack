yeah... I know there have to be demos... I tried to be lazy, you know :)

Anyway, as I told Andrzej -- I'll take a look at it (and with a 
pleasure) after I come back. i don't think the delay will matter much. 
And if it does, ask Andrzej -- he has excellent experience with both 
projects -- he's just very shy by nature and doesn't talk much, hehe.
