Hi Lorenzo,

Search in the list's archives -- I posted a glue code that lets Lucene 
results be clustered with Carrot2 clusterers (there are a few 
implementations there).

http://java2.5341.com/msg/82310.html

The official Web site of the project is at:

http://carrot2.sourceforge.net/

You'll find some links to demo pages there as well.

Let me know if you have any questions/ concerns (or if you want to 
contribute in any way).

Dawid
