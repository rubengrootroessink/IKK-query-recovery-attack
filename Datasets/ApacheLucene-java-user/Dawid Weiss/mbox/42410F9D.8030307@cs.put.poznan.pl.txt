Your implementation and ideas sound very interesting, Owen. Can we see 
the system anywhere in public (and play with it?)

You are very welcome. We are also academic, so in the feeling of 
brotherhood we might help you set up a demo on-line clustering server 
free of charge. There really is not better clustering technique than the 
one devised to a particular problem and it seems like you found that 
niche. Although it's always worth experimenting with other stuff just 
for the sake of comparison. Just let me know if you're interested (if we 
  can access the 'feed' of those plain search results I can set up the 
clustering demo in a few minutes, really).

It is always going to be challanging if you attempt to cluster the 
entire collection, you know. I'm (or rather: I will be) working on 
algorithm's extensions to deal with full text documents.
