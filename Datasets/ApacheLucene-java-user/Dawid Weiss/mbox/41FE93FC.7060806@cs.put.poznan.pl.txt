Hi Adam.

Otis and David have already provided you with pointers to my previous 
post regarding Carrot2-Lucene integration, so just a tiny note here:

Yes, there exists a possibility to combine components locally. It is 
even demonstrated in the sample code David Spencer mentioned.

I don't know... I guess it could but you'd have to play with the source 
code and modify it a bit to get the required functionality. Can't really 
tell anything more specific because I'm not deep in that subject.
