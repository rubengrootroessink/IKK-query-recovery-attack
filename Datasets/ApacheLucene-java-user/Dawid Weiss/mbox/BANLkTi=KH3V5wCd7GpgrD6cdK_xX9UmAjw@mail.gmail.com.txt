Can you describe the kind of sorting you're doing? Maybe the data is
already sorted (and in RAM) and you're only getting it out?

I think I am understand why it's faster than relational databases for information retrieval.
For example, Lucene use very efficient index than allows to retrieve posting list in constant
time and do intersect between them.
