Hi.

Coming up with answers... a little belated, but hope you're still on:

Yes, there is not "official" release. We just don't feel the need to tag 
the sources with an official label because Carrot is not a stand-alone 
product (rather a library... or a framework). It does not imply that the 
project is in alpha stage... quite the contrary, in fact -- it has been 
out there for a while and it seems to do a good job for most people.

> is there any intentions to have any releases in the near future?

I could tag a release even today if it makes you happy ;) But I hope I 
made the status of the project clear above.

D.
