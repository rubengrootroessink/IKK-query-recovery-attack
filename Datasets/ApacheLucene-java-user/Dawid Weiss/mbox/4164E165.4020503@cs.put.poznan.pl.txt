Just to point out the fact: most slavic languages also use diacritic 
marks (above, like 'acute', or 'dot' marks, or below, like the Polish 
'ogonek' mark). Some people argue that they can be stripped off the text 
upon indexing and that the queries usually disambiguate the context of 
the word.

It is just a digression. Now back to the arabic stemmer -- there has to 
be a way of doing it. I know Vivisimo has clustering options for arabic. 
They must be using a stemmer (and an English translation dictionary), 
although it might be a commercial one. Take a look:
