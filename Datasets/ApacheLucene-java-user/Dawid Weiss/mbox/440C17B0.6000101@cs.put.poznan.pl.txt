Great to hear this; is there a public URL or something?

Well, we're not exactly a multi-million company, so quality might not be 
identical, you know ;)

> has anyone thoroughly compared the two? algorithm wise and quality

Undoable. Vivivismo is a commercial company, noone knows what they're 
using. Quality is hard to define either as clustering is usually 
ambiguous. Carrot2 also has a commercial spin off and the commercial 
algorithm is faster and gives slightly better results, so you might want 
to check out that option -- www.carrotsearch.com

We're also tuning the open source algorithms and installations. Let us 
know if you need it (it's a consulting service and we charge for that).
