Are these fields stricly defined or free text? Because if they are
product/dictionary fields then what you're looking for is not text
clustering, but faceting and the solution is to use either SOLR or its
components for doing exactly this.

This definitely looks like faceting. Take a look at Solr's faceting
functionality -- I think this will solve your problem.
