Instead of profiling, provide some more info about the following:

- what are the problematic (slow) queries -- are they generated from the
code, are they parsed from text? What are they? Certain query types are
slow(er) than other query types.

- what is the index built from? Natural language (text)? Something else?

If you describe the above folks may tell you right away why your queries are
slow -- people on this list continue to amaze me with the insight they have
even without looking at the code ;)
