SUBJECT: [release announcement] Carrot2 2.0
DATE: 18 Sep 2006


Hi guys. A bit of self-promotion; I hope nobody will consider it rude, 
after all Carrot2 is a plugin to Nutch and some folks use it with 
Lucene, so I thought it may be of relevance to both lists.

Of course we invite everyone to try the demo on-line. Number of daily 
queries to Yahoo is limited, so if you get an exception, switch to 
another search engine -- MSN or Google. These limits are assigned to the 
source's IP address, so if you install the demos locally, you'll be able 
to send a great deal more queries.

Carrot2 Search Results Clustering Engine released

Version 2.0 of the Open Source Carrot2 Search Results Clustering Engine 
has been released. Carrot2 can automatically organize (cluster) search 
results into thematic categories by combining one of its ready-to-use 
search results acquisition components with some of Carrot2's built-in 
search results clustering algorithms.

The 2.0 release comes with a faster and more usable search clustering 
web application, the Aduna ClusterMap visualization component integrated 
into the standalone GUI application, a simplified core API and much more.

At the same time Carrot Search, the Carrot2 spin-off company, released 
Lingo3G -- a high-performance document clustering engine offering 
hierarchical clustering, synonyms, label filtering and advanced tuning 
capabilities.

For more information, please see the Carrot2 live demo and the project 
website.
