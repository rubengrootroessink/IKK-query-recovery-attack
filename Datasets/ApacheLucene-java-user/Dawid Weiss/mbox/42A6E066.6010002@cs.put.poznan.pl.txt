You should state your requirements clearly:

1. What data you want to cluster? (whole index/ search results)
2. What is the role of the extension? How is it going to be used? 
(front-end clusters, query refinement, etc)
3. Do you need the implementation or an API for clustering in the
source code? (I'd personally stick to the API; there are many products 
out there that perform clustering. Carrot2 is no exception -- there is 
an excellent (in my humble opinion :) open source clustering algorithm 
Lingo, but there is also a commercial component that is much faster and 
more customizable. You can start off with an open source clusterer then 
and switch to a commercial product if you want higher scalability or 
different functionality. I implemented such an API in Nutch -- take a 
look in its source code for hints).
