Yes, Carrot2 should help you with this. The labels it creates highly 
depend on the quality of the input snippets, but the so-called KWIK 
snippets (keyword in context) should suffice (see David Spencer's 
example with Wikipedia).

There is one thing, though: what is employed in Carrot2 is an on-line 
unsupervised clusterer that is designed to work with small number of 
documents and incomplete descriptions (snippets versus full text 
documents). It will _not_ work for large document collections (thousands 
of documents) simply because it was not designed to do that. I guess
you could try with up to 500 snippets -- beyond that, you'll be waiting 
for the result forever.

There is a great number of algorithms that can cluster large document 
collections -- see proceedings from information retrieval conferences 
for example.

As for David's hints:

Yes, 100 to 200 snippets is optimal with the open source clustering 
algorithm. We have a refactored and optimized version of the Lingo 
clusterer that is commercial (it also provides hierarchical clustering 
capability as an add-on to the open source component). But even the 
commercial version will only cluster up to 500 -- 1000 snippets. As I 
said, it was not our goal to cluster document collections, rather to 
retrieve useful information from preprocessed snippets.
