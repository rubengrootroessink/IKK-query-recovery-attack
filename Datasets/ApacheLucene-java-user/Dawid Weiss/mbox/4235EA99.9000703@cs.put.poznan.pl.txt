SUBJECT: Re: Removing similar documents from search results
DATE: 14 Mar 2005


I think what they do at Google is a fancy heuristic -- as David Spencer 
mentioned, suburls of a given page, identical snippets, or titles... My 
idea was more towards providing a 'realistic overview' of subjects in 
pages. So you could pick, say, the first document from each cluster and 
show them like that to the user. Then, in every cluster documents 
already have mutual similarity (this could be calculated manually, the 
clustering algorithm doesn't do it for all pairs of documents), but some 
have more and some have less. You could then hide nearly identical 
results from the user.

Anyway, I think the Google method is just a heuristic based on URLs and 
nothing as fancy.
