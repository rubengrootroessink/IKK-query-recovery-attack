Thanks for the info, Lorenzo. I'm just a little surprised at the timings 
you gave -- that's on a slow machine, right? On a PIII, 3GHZ the timings 
are between 250ms and 500 miliseconds (open source Lingo clustering 
component). The demo which runs at http://carrot.cs.put.poznan.pl is 
slower because it needs to fetch the results from Yahoo/ Google, then 
cluster them and send it back. That machine is also much slower (PIII, 
750Mhz) and used by other projects. Anybody willing to donate more 
processing power to a university? :)
