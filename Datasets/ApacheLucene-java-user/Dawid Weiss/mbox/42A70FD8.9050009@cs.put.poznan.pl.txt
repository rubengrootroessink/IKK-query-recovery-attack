True. But in most cases clustering of search results can yield sensible 
clusters. Try, for example:

http://demo.carrot-search.com/carrot2-remote-controller/newsearch.do?query=chips&processingChain=carrot2.process.lingo-cluster-odp&resultsRequested=200

We in fact use Lucene for this demo (indexing ODP categories) --

An open source clustering component isn't much worse (with Google 
serving as the data source):

http://carrot.cs.put.poznan.pl/carrot2-remote-controller/newsearch.do?query=chips&processingChain=carrot2.process.lingo-google-en&resultsRequested=100

Compare it with (same algorithm) AllTheWeb:

http://carrot.cs.put.poznan.pl/carrot2-remote-controller/newsearch.do?query=chips&processingChain=carrot2.process.lingo-alltheweb-en&resultsRequested=100

As you said -- much depends on the data, but there is also a lot of 
space for the clustering algorithm (try identical inputs and different 
algorithms and you'll see the difference).
