Hi David,

I apologize about the delay in answering this one, Lucene is a busy 
mailing list and I had a hectic last week... Again, sorry for belated 
answer, hope you still find it useful.

Yes, I admit what you've done with Wikipedia is quite interesting and 
looks very good. I'm also glad you spent some time working out Carrot 
integration with Lucene. It works quite nice.

Yes, this is true. Carrot2 doesn't use all of Lucene's potential -- it 
merely takes the output from a query (titles, urls and snippets) and 
attempts to cluster them into some sensible groups. I think many things 
could be improved, the most important of them is fast snippet retrieval 
   from Lucene because right now it takes 50% of the time of the 
clustering; I've seen a post a while ago describing a faster snippet 
generation technique, I'm sure that would give clustering a huge boost 
speed-wise.

No, there is absolutely no benefit from it. It was merely to show people 
that the clustering needs to be warmed up a bit. I should not have put 
it in the code knowing people would be confused by it. You can safely 
use clusterHits just once. It will just have a small delay at the first 
invocation.


Thanks for experimenting. Please BCC me if you have any urgent projects 
-- I read Lucene's list in batches and my personal e-mail I try to keep 
up to date with.
