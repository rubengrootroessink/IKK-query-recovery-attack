Lorenzo... Did you take a look at the mail I posted before? There was a 
ready-to-use clustering for Lucene there. It _is_ simple. I don't know 
what you mean by "much simpler" -- much simpler to use? You really don't 
have to know all of Carrot2 code to use it. You build, or fetch a 
precompiled clustering component and add an input to it. This is 
basically what I did before and it took just a few lines of code to 
integrate clustering into Lucene, so I can hardly find it difficult.

AHC and k-means are all classic clustering algorithms, so their 
implementation will always look similar. They, unfortunately, need a lot 
of tuning to get the results right. With Lingo clustering you can avoid 
much of that work.

But anyway, if you're up to the challange, feel free to contribute in 
any way you want to. I'll be glad to compare your clustering to ours.
