Carrot2 is a programming framework. Its demos are meant to showcase the 
technology, but you need to delve into the code to actually build 
something of your own.

The manual that should somehow guide you through the installation 
process is at:

http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dweiss/carrot/manual/ch08.html#sect:installation

There is also a preconfigured example (0.1rc1) ready to be downloaded 
from SourceForge's file download area (both a stand-alone application 
and a web application).

Finally, if you have problems there are developers willing to help :)
