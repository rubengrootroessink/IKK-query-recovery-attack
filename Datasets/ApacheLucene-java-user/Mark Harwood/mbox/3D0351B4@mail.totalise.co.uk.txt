Is it possible to configure your app server to have just one message driven 
bean instance in the pool? Obviously this is not a solution in general to 
concurrent access to Lucene but would remove the need for multiple 
IndexWriters in your particular case and give you the same overall throughput 
- (hopefully the appserver would be looking after contention on the one bean 
instance)

Cheers
Mark
