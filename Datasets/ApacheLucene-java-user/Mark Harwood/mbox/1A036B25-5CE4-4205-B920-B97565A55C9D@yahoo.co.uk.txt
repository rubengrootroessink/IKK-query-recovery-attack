SUBJECT: Re: Merge and commit behaviour - changed between 2.4 and 2.9?
DATE: 5 Oct 2010

OK. I'll double check the reports. 
So presumably when merges occur outside of transaction control (post commit) the post-merge
update of the segments_N file is managed safely somehow?
I can see the logic in continuing file changes outside of transaction control because the
document updates are safely committed (flushed as new segments) and the merges are essentially
just a background tidying of committed state that can fail with no detrimental effect on the
previous transaction.
