That explains the highlighter behaviour. Clearly BBB is not at  
position 0-3 in the String you supplied

>>> String CONTENTS = "AAA :BBB CCC";

Looks like the Tokenizer needs fixing. Is this yours or a standard  
Lucene class? If the latter, raising a JIRA bug with a Junit test  
would be the best way to get things moving.
