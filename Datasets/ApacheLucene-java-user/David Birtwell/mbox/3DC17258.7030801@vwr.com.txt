Harpreet,

This looks like a fine solution to me.  As an alternative, you could use 
Field boosting at index time.  Before you add the security credential 
field to the lucene Document object, you could call field.setBoost(0.1f).

FYI, field boosting is not part of the release.  You can get it from the 
public CVS.
