I thought I had included in at[1] before but apparently not, my  
apologies for that. I have updated that wiki page. I'll also reproduce  
it here:

{ "Rounds"

     ResetSystemErase
     { CreateIndex >
     { AddDoc > : NUM_DOCS
     { CloseIndex >

     [ "UnoptSearch" Search > : 100
     { "Optimize" OpenIndex Optimize CloseIndex }
     [ "OptSearch" Search > : 100

     NewRound

} : 6

NUM_DOCS increases by 5,000 for each iteration.

What constitutes a "proper warm up before measuring"?
