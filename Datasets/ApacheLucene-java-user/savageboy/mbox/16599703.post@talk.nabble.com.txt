SUBJECT: Re: Fetches the hits very slow (when the date sorting) !
DATE: 10 Apr 2008


Yes, I found it is because the index-files are bad, it is not because of the
time-resolution( my resolution is yyyy-MM-ddHH:mm:ss, as I work for a
newspaper group-company, so the time of news pulishing must be more accurate
than normal use!)
But now the time sorting is alright! 
I can sorting the 110000 results by time in 0.02 secends!
Thank you for your response!
