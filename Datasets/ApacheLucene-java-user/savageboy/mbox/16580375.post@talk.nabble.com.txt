SUBJECT: Fetches the hits very slow (when the date sorting) !
DATE: 9 Apr 2008


Hello everyone,
I have made a search project by use of Lucene2.0
But when I use date sorting, the server is running very slow for the result
getting(about 3 sec but I dont sort the results the time of it is about
0.019 sec, there are 110000 results to be hit).

document.add(new Field(docFieldName, StringUtils.defaultIfEmpty(contentStr,
""), storeFlag , tokenizeFlag));

storeFlag is true
tokenizeFlag is false

so it means the Field dateTime should be stored and be not tokenized!

If you have some idea about this issue I met, plz let me know!
Thanks a lot and best Regards!
