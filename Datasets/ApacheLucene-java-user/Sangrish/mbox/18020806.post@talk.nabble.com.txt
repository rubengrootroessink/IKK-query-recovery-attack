SUBJECT: Arbitrary String to String Similarity Score
DATE: 20 Jun 2008


I have a use case for comparing two given strings (attached to a specific
field)
using Lucene and get the similarity scores.

  I tried but could not find any built-in way to do so. Hence assuming that
Lucene only compares a Query against Indexed documents, I came up with the
following approach:
(Let the 2 strings be, str1 and str2 )

1) Create an IndexWriter using a RAMDirectory (I don't want to store those
strings on the disk)
2) Index str1 and store it 
3) Search str2 in the index. ( shall the indexWriter be closed before you
search on the index? )
4) Get the similarity score & publish it
5) Delete str1 from the index and make the index available for a new
comparison

Any comments & suggestions on making the process optimal

Siddharth
