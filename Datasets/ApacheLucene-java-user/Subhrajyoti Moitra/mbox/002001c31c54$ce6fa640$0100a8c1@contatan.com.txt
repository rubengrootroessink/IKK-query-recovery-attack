SUBJECT: multi field wildcard boolean query
DATE: 17 May 2003

Hi,
I have a jsp which has five text box. The user puts in some text in 1 or more text boxes.
I want to conduct a multi field wildcard search.
Eg:

for textBox1 the user enters "hello"
for textBox2 the user enters "ar*"
for textBox3 the user enters "jav?"
for textBox4 the user enters "apa*"

now i want to conduct a search

field1: hello field2:ar* field3:jav? field4:apa*

so in verbose mode- i want all results which has field1 as "hello" (this is complete term)
AND field2 as anything starting with "ar" AND ... so on.

How do i do this??

What if the user instead of a single term, inputs a phrase like "cool dude"?

Please help me.

thanks in advance.
subhro.
