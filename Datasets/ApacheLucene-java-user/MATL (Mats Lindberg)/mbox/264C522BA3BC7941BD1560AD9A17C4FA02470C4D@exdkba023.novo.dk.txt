SUBJECT: index, reindexing problem
DATE: 17 Oct 2004

Hello.
 
I have a problem when reindexing some documents after an index has been
created, i get an error, the error is the following.
caught a class java.io.IOException

with message: Lock obtain timed out:
Lock@C:\DOCUME~1\..........lucene-0b877c2d5472a608d6ec3ee6174018de-write
.lock
<mailto:Lock@C:\DOCUME~1\..........lucene-0b877c2d5472a608d6ec3ee6174018
de-write.lock> 

 
This is how i do it.
1.st make the index (_indexDir is the location of the index)
writer = new IndexWriter(_indexDir, new StandardAnalyzer(), true);

..... do the indexing here

writer.optimize();

writer.close();

this works fine

 
2. this is where i get the error (reindex an existing document)
writer = new IndexWriter(_indexDir, new StandardAnalyzer(), false);
Directory directory;

IndexReader reader;

// if the file is in the index already, remove it

directory = FSDirectory.getDirectory(_indexDir, false);

reader = IndexReader.open(directory);

try {

Term term = new Term("deleteid", deleteID.toLowerCase()); 

if (reader.docFreq(term) >= 1) {

deletedItems = reader.delete(term);// ----- this is where the error
occurs, i get the locking error

}

} catch (Exception e) {

System.out.println(" caught a " + e.getClass() + "\n with message: " +
e.getMessage());}

finally {

reader.close();

directory.close();

}

continue with reindexing the new document

......

 

I hope anyone can help me with this problem.

 

Best regards,

Mats Lindberg
