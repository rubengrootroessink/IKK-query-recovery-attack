SUBJECT: lucene sort error - there are more terms than documents in field ....
DATE: 13 Jul 2004

Hello.
 
I am using:
import org.apache.lucene.search.Sort

 when searching an index, but for some reasons, in some indexes i get
this error:

caught a class java.lang.RuntimeException
 with message: there are more terms than documents in field
<TheFieldIAmSortingBy>
 
does anybody know what causes this, or how to solve it.
 
Best regards,
Mats Lindberg
