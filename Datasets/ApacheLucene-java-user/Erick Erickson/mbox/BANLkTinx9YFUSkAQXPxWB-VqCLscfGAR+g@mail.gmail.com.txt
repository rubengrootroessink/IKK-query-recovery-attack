SUBJECT: Re: MultiFieldQueryParser with default AND and stopfilter
DATE: 8 Jun 2011

Could you just construct a BooleanQuery with the
terms against different fields instead of using MFQP?
e.g.

bq.add(qp.parse("title:(the AND project)", SHOULD))
bq.add(qp.parse("desc:(the AND project)", SHOULD))

etc...? If your QueryParser was created with a
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper I think you might get what you
want....

Note, bad pseudo code there...
