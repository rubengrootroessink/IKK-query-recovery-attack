This is really unanswerable unless you provide some details. Pretend
you're the expert and someone asked you this question; where would
you even begin to answer?

Please provide more details about what you're trying to accomplish,
what you've tried, what kinds of things you expect to index and
how queries would work against that data.

Best
Erick
