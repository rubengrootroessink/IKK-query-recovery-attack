Perhaps the most straight-forward way would be to index a known unique value
for each document that would have had a null entry. Conceptually, when a
field would be null, index the value "nothinghere". Then you can just search
on documents where the value is equal to "nothinghere".

Alternatively, you could create a filter using TermEnum/TermDocs for each
document that had an entry in the field in question and then invert it to
get your real filter. The trick here is to build your term something like
new Term("field", ""); which enumerates all the terms in a field. Since a
filter is just a bitset, there are operations for inverting it. You can even
store these filters somewhere and reuse them (note, they will have to be
re-built when you change your index). For 2 million documents, they would be
quite small, somewhere around 250K bytes. Building these filters is quite
fast, so the first thing I would try is building them dynamically. If you
use a CachingWrapperFilter, they will be cached automatically for the
duration of your program.


But I'd go with the simple way first, that of indexing a unique value for
the null fields and searching on that....
