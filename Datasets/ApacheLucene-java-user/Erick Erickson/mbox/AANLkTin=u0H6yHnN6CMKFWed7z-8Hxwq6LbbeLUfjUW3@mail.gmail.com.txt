SUBJECT: Re: Best way to create a Lucene Index with fields that can be updated frequently, and filtering the results by this field.
DATE: 1 Nov 2010

How often is "frequently"? How many updates do you expect to do in
a day? And how quickly must those updates be reflected in the search
results?

800K documents isn't all that many. I'd go with the simple approach first
and monitor the results, #then# go to a more complex solution if you
see a problem arising. Just update (delete/add) the documents when
the value changes.

Well, the cost to reindex is just about what the cost to index it orignally
is. The old version of the document is marked deleted and the new one
is added. It's essentially the same cost as to index a new document.
This leaves some gaps in your index, that is the deleted docs are still in
there, but the next optimize will compact them.

>From which you may infer that optimizing is the expensive part. I'd do that,
say
once daily (or even weekly).
