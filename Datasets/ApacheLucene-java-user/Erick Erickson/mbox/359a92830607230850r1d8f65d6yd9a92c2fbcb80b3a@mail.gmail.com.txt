Both of these topics have been discussed at length in this forum. I think
you would be well served by searching the archive for both of these topics,
and you'd get your answer faster <G>.....

NFS mounts have problems that have been discussed recently.

There is nothing built into Lucene that indexes a database for you. You have
to write a program to extract the data from the DB and put it into a Lucene
index. Thereafter, you have to try to keep the two in synch.
