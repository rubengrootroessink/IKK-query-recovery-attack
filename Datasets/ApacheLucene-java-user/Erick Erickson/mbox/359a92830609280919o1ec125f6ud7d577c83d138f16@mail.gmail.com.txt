SUBJECT: Re: Indexing large index with Lucene
DATE: 28 Sep 2006

Two things come to mind...

First, you can freely write to an index while searching it, the search is
always available. I'm pretty sure this includes deleting/readding documents.
However, you won't be able to search on the changes in your index until you
close/reopen the *searcher*.

Second, depending on how quickly you need updates, you could always make a
*copy* of your index, update that and then move it back to where your
searcher looks for it, sort of a batch process really. It all depends upon
how quickly you require seeing the changes.

Hope this helps
Erick
