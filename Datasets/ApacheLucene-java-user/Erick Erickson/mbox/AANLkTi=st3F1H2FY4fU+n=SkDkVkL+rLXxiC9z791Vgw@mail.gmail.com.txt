This is usually something you should not do. Is there any possibility you can
combine these indexes into one? Maybe sharded? Because this approach
is almost guaranteed to scale poorly.

This smells like an XY problem, perhaps you can back up and explain
what the higher-level problem you're trying to solve is...
