See the class in the docs or Lucene In Action for more
detail, but here's the short form.....

A Filter is a bitset where each bit's ordinal position stands
for a document. I.e. bit 1 means doc id 1, bit 519
represents document 519 etc.

When you pass a filter to one of the search routines that accepts a Filter,
the search is restricted to ONLY those documents with the corresponding
bit set in the Filter. Which sounds like just what you want, but I may be
wrong.

You construct a Filter by iterating over the terms you care about (see
TermDocs/TermEnum classes).  In a nutshell you find the terms you
care about, and for each document that contains that term, set the
bit in your filter. This is actually much faster than you might think. All
this is provided for you in the two classes above, how you use them
depends (tm). Watch that you don't run past the term you care about, I
remember having that happen in one of those classes but the details
escape my aging memory.

Hope that helps
Erick
