SUBJECT: Re: Special characters prevent entity being indexed
DATE: 18 Nov 2008

What analyzer are you using at index and search time? Typical problems
include:
using an analyzer that doesn't understand accented chars (StandardAnalyzer
for instance)
using a different anlyzer during search and index.

Search the user list for "accent" and you'll find this kind of problem
discussed,
and if that doesn't help we need to know what analyzers you are using and
what behavior you really want. Typically, for instance, *requiring* a user
to
type the upside-down exclamation point to get a match on this field would
be considered incorrect.

Also, you'd be helped a lot be getting a copy of Luke and examining your
index
to see exactly what's been indexed, it'll reveal a lot.

Best
