You really have to tell us more about what you're trying to do
to get a meaningful reply.

What do you mean you create the index on a table? Are you
using some sort of embedded SQL to query the table then
creat a lucene index? How big is the index? What search
are you submitting? What does your search code look like?

Best
Erick
