SUBJECT: Re: Phrase indexing and searching with Lucene
DATE: 18 Feb 2009

I'm still not clear why the built-in phrase query syntax won't work. If I
index the following terms (erick, erickson, thinks, small, thoughts)
in a single field, then searching for "erick erickson" (as a phrase query,
i.e. with double quotes when sent through a query parser or constructing
a PhraseQuery yourself) will generate a hit but "erick thinks" won't
generate a hit (unless you specify slop).

"thinks small thoughts" would also generate a hit

If you're saying that you only want to match on *all* the tokens, i.e.
the only way to get a hit on the above would be to search for
"erick erickson thinks small thoughts", then you can create a
field that's UN_ANALYZED. If you do this, though, beware
that you have to do things like lower-case terms yourself when
indexing.

I have no idea what IndexTermGenerator is or what it does, but I'm
assuming that it just generates single words.

Some examples of what you put in your index and what searches
you expect to return results for your example AND searches you do
NOT want to hit that document would be a great help.

As far as searching for both, constructing a BooleanQuery with regular
TermQuerys and PhraseQuerys would work if you're constructing
your queries programmatically, or just using a Lucene query
like +termfield:word +phrasefield:"erick erickson thinks" would
work. Or, if you just require that the phrase exists you could do
it all in one field like
+field:word +field:"erick erickson thinks"
