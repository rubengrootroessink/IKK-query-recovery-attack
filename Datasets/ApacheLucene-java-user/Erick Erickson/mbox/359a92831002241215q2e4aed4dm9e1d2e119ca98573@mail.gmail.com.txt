DATE: 24 Feb 2010

It sounds to me like you'll have to pre-process your text, then use
something
like KeywordAnalyzer. The idea here is to do something like lowercase the
strings (both index and query), and remove all non-letter (or whatever)
characters, normalize whitespace (e.g. remove leading and trailing, turn
all sequences of whitespace into a single space, etc) and go from there.
