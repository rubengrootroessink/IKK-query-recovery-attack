They'll be in synch forever unless and until you *change* the index. Once
you do anything with an IndexWriter, you have to be very careful about
relying on doc IDs.

But remember that opening a searcher takes a snapshot of the index and
that reader/searcher will NOT see changes. So you could think about
building your cache and using it *as long as you haven't closed/reopened
your index reader*. The cache and search will be in synch for that interval.
