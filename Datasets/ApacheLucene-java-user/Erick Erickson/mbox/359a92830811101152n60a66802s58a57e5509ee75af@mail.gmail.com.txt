You have to have indexed something that uniquely identifies the
document in order to know what the old one is. Really, this is
the same question as updating, isn't it? If you could update
a document in place, you'd have to know what document
that was. If you know that information, you know which
document to delete.

Note that lucene has no built-in document recognition. If I
add the same document to the index twice, Lucene will
happily consider them two *separate* documents. You have
to code your own notion of document meta-id (as distinct
from the Lucene doc id). It could be the URL, the file path
on disk, a document ID from your organization... the
possibilities are endless. Which is why Lucene can't do that
for you.
