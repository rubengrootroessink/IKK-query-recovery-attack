The first place I'd look is whether you're closing your *searcher* between
times in both cases.

If that leads nowhere, I'd make sure I had a copy of Luke so I could
reassure myself that the document was actually in both cases.

After that, I'd think about posting a fragment of both your deletion code
and test case <G>...

Best
