The fastest way to see if opening/closing your searcher is a problem would
be to write a tiny little program that opened the index, fired off a few
queries and timed each one. The queries can be canned, of course. I'm
thinking this is, say, less that 20 lines (including imports). If you're
familiar with junit, think of it in those terms.

Once you've proved that is a bottleneck you want to work on, you probably
need a search server. We've used XmlRpc, which has server code built-in, and
has worked like a charm for us. It'll add a bit of complexity, but it'll
keep your searchers open.

That said, I suspect that someone will chime in with another solution, since
this is already implemented <G>....
