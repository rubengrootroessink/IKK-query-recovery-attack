I really don't understand the question. Ranking is what Lucene *does*.
Here is a link explaining how Lucene ranks documents:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/scoring.html

<http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/scoring.html>If this isn't relevant,
you need to explain what about the current
ranking isn't working for you and what you want handled differently....
