I suspect you have to do some fancy indexing. That is, index the following
terms: sponge bob square pants spongebob squarepants.

But this requires that you understand all the variations you want to hit on
ahead of time.

Or, you could conceivably deal with wildcard queries, but I think this is
the same problem as indexing the many different terms.

Note that "Lucene in Action" has a section on indexing synonyms that could
be very helpful to you if you decide to index several terms, particularly if
you want span queries to operate in this space.
