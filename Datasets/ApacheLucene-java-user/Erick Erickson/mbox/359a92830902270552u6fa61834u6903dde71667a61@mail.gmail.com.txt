I have no clue about netbeans, but I *do* know that you'll need
to provide more details than "it fails" to get any meaningful
help. What version of JUnit? Lucene? NetBeans? what
error messages/stack traces?

Imagine you were trying to respond to your own email knowing
nothing except what you wrote and I think you'll see the problem....

I've done this from Eclipse just fine.

Best
