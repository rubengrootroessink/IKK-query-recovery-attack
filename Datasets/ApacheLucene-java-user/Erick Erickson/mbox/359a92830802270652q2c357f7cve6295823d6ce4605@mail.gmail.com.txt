SUBJECT: Re: Inconsistent Search Speed
DATE: 27 Feb 2008

To reinforce Grant's comment, lazy loading improved one situation for me
on the order of 10X. I wrote it up and it's somewhere in the Wiki. Your
results
will vary, and unless you have a LOT of stored fields I wouldn't necessarily
expect a similar speedup, but it's sure worth looking at.

And don't iterate through the Hits object for more than 100 or so hits. Like
Mark said. Really. Really don't <G>...

Best
