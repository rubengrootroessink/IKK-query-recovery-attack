I'm a bit confused, this is the Lucene list, but it sounds like you're using
SOLR. If you are, could you post the relevant parts of your schema,
especially the field type definition for the field in question? If you are,
why not just take WordDelimiterFilterFactory out of your field type
definition?

The analysis page will help you lots here if you're in SOLR.

StandardAnalyzer could well be splitting on '-' if you're using that.

Best
