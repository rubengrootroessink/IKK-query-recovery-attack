Ricardo:

Well, your English is so much better than my Portuguese that I can only
congratulate you. You're perfectly understandable, so your efforts are
paying off!

About your question. It's quite easy to search on multiple terms. Just
submit the entire text to QueryParser.parse. Be sure that the default
operator (QueryParser.setDefaultOperator) is set to OR. You'll get back a
list of documents that are ordered by relevance, as Lucene calculates
relevance. You can use the "field:text" form to search across multiple
fields.

Several things, though.

if you think that the user would be well served by, for example "working"
being indexed as "work". So searching on "worker", "work", "working" would
all match (assuming you stemmed your query too).

But I'd only do this if submitting the whole text didn't give satisfactory
results.
