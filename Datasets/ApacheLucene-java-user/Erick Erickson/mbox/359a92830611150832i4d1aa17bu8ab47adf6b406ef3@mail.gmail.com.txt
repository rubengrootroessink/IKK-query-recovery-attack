Why do you think you need term frequencies in the first place? What is it
that you're trying to do that just searching wouldn't accomplish?

I've often jumped into the middle of something and made it waaaaay too
complex, so I'm asking to see if you're doing something similar <G>.

Lucene has no requirements that each document have identical fields. So you
could simply index a varying number of fields with each document,
corresponding to the attributes of your files. After a search, you could
determine what you needed to by which docs had which attributes (fields). It
seems to me that if you form your query appropriately, the search results
*are* the results you want and this kind of analysis wouldn't be necessary.
Since your search would only return documents that had the fields you
specify and the values you want in those fields (attributes).

But that may just reflect that I don't understand the problem you're trying
to solve very well <G>...
