I certainly found that lazy loading changed my speed dramatically, but
that was on a particularly field-heavy index.

I wonder if TermEnum/TermDocs would be fast enough on an indexed
(UN_TOKENIZED???) field for a unique id.

Mostly, I'm hoping you'll try this and tell me if it works so I don't have
to sometime <G>....
