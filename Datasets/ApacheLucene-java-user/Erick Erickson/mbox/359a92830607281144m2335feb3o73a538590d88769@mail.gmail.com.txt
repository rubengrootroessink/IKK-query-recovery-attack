I'd really advise getting a copy of Luke to inspect your index as a first
step. I've been surprised a number of times by what really got in my index.

You might also try using a WhitespaceAnalyzer instead of StandardAnalyzer,
that's the most basic analyzer available. I'm not sure whether individual
numbers are considered stop words by the standard analyzer, yet another
reason to look at your index with Luke.

Hope this helps
Erick
