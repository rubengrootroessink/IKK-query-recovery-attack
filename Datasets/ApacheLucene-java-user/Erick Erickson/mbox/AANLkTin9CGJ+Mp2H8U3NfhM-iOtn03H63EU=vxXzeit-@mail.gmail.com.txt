That is certainly one way of approaching it. Another is to add a
ClientId field to each document and add a mandatory "AND
ClientId=thisclient"
to each query.

This will have some effect on relevance since the statistics are
gathered over the whole corpus rather than just the individual client.

Also, if you us autosuggest, you may well suggest terms that will
result in zero hits.
