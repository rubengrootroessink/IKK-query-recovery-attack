What do you mean by "first"? Would you want to process a doc thatdid NOT
have a "Term 3"?

Let's say you have the following:
doc1: "Term 1"
doc2: "Term 2"
doc3: "Term 1" "Term 2"
doc4: "Term 3"
doc5: "Term 1" "Term 2" "Term 3"
doc6: "Term 2" "Term 3"

Which docs do you want to get from your search? And does order really
matter?

Best
Erick
