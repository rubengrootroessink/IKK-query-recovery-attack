You have to check yourself. Lucene has no concept of relations
*between* documents. What you're really asking for is something
like a database unique key. No such luck, you have to create
one yourself.

What I've done is post-process the entire index, removing duplicates.
This can be done quite efficiently with TermDocs/TermEnum, and you
can then institute policies like, say, LIFO or FIFO.

You could also certainly check before adding a document, also
using TermEnum/TermDocs.
