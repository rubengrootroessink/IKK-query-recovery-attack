This is exactly the behavior I'd expect.

Consider what would happen otherwise. Say you have documents
with the following values for a field (call it blah).
some data
some data I put in the index
lots of data
data

Then I don't want deleting on the term blah:data to remove all
of them. Which seems to be what you're asking. Even if
you restricted things to "phrases", then deleting on the term
'blah:some data' would remove two documents.

So, while UN_TOKENIZED isn't a *requirement*, exact total term
matches *is* the requirement. By that, I meant that whatever
goes into the field must not be broken into pieces by the indexing
tokenizer for deletes to work as you expect.

Best
Erick
