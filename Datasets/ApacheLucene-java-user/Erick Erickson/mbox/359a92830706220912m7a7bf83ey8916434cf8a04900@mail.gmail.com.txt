Yes, you should also stem the query terms. Otherwise, you'll have
indexed "working" as "work", but your search for "working" will look
for "working" and won't match. Which is not what you want, I'm sure.

Query.toString() will tell you a lot about how queries are
processed, BTW....

In general, unless you're very sure what the effects are, you should
use the same analyzer for indexing as you use for searching.
