No. What is "correctly"? Are you stemming? in which case using thesame
analyzer on different languages will not work.

This topic have been discussed on the user list frequently, so if you
searched
that archive (see: http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/MailingListArchives)
you'd find a wealth of information quickly...
