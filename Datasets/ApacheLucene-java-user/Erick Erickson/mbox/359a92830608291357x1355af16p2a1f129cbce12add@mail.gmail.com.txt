SUBJECT: Re: Installing a custom tokenizer
DATE: 29 Aug 2006

Tucked away in the contrib section of  Lucene (I'm using 2.0) there is....

org.apache.lucene.index.memory.PatternAnalyzer

which takes a regular expression as and tokenizes with it. Would that help?
Word of warning... the regex determines what is NOT a token, not what IS a
token (as I remember), which threw me for a bit.

Don't know if this is really useful, but it might work for you without as
much work...
