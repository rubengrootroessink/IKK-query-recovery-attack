condition

Zip IS NOT NULL

why invert the bitset?



a token containing the empty string matches documents that

Isn't this exactly what he wants? Or am I mis-reading this? I'm reading it
as "any document that contains a ZIP will match a token containing the empty
string"..... Or am I getting tokens and terms all mixed up?


what you want to do is create a bitset for every document that has a value
