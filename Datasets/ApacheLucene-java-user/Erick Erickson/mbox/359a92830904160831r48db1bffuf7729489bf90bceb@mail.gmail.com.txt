SUBJECT: Re: Best way for paging with TopDocs class?
DATE: 16 Apr 2009

Well, under the covers, the old Hits object *was* reloading the first N
pages to
get page N + 1, you just didn't see it. Hits also had other, undesirable
behaviors.

But "loading docs N-1 times" it's not as expensive as you perhaps fear.
To get a sorted list, you must sort the entire set of documents. Which
means to get, say, page 3 in some sort order, somewhere, sometime
you must keep track of the scores for documents 1-200 in order to
insure that docs 201-300 are really in the proper place. Since a
TopDocs is just an int/float pair we're not talking about much memory.

So I'd advise just going about it as you outlined. The *real* savings would
be in not re-executing the search every page, but I wouldn't think about
a caching scheme unless you demonstrate a problem. And if you were
making due with Hits before, I suspect this isn't really a problem....

Best
Erick
