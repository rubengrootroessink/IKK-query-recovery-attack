Hmmm, somehow I missed this days ago....

Anyway, the Lucene query parsing process isn't quite Boolean logic.
I encourage you to think in terms of "required", "optional", and
"prohibited".

Both queries are equivalent, to see this try attaching &debugQuery=on
to your URL and look at the "parsed query" in the debug info....

Anyway, to your qestion.
+foo:bar +baz:"there is"

reads that "bar" must appear in the field "foo". So far so good.
But it's also required that baz contain the empty clause, which
is different than saying baz must be empty. One can argue that
any field contains, by definition, nothing.

But imagine the impact of what you're requesting. If all stop words
get removed, then no query would ever match yours. Which
would be very counter-intuitive IMO. Your users have no clue
that you've removed stopwords, so they'll sit there saying "Look, I
KNOW that "bar" was in foo and I KNOW that "there is" was in
baz, why the heck didn't this cursed system find my doc?

Anyway, I don't think you really want this behavior in the
stopword removal case. If you can post some use-cases where this
would be desirable, maybe we can noodle about a solution....

Best
Erick
