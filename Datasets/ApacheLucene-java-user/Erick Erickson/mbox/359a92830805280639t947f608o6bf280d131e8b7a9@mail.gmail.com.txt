It's unclear what you *should* expect. How is your data
distributed?

In other words, how many documents do you have? In this example,
for instance,
1. TTL:data AND TTL:store OR TTL:variable => 3,733 results
it considered the TTL:data part only.

it's perfecily reasonable if every document that had "variable" in the
field *also* has "data" and "store" in the field. So your numbers
don't give us much to work with.....

Remember, though, that Lucene syntax isn't a pure boolean syntax. See

http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BooleanQuerySyntax

And when in doubt parenthesize <G>...
