SUBJECT: Re: ways to minimize index size?
DATE: 14 Mar 2007

Store as little as possible, index as little as possible <G>.....

How big is your index, and how much do you expect it to grow?
I ask this because it's probably not worth your time to try to
reduce the index size below some threshold... I found that
reducing my index from 8G to 4G (through not stemming) gave
me about a 10% performance improvement, so at some point
it's just not worth the effort. Also, if you posted the index size,
it would give folks a chance to say "there's not much you can
gain by reducing things more". As it is, I don't have a clue
whether your index is 100M or 100T. The former is in the
"don't waste your time" class, and the latter is...er...
different....

I wouldn't bother compressing for 1%....

Question for "the guys" so I can check an assumption....
Is there any difference between these two?
Field(Name, Value, Store, index)
*<file:///C:/lucene-2.1.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html#Field%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20org.apache.lucene.document.Field.Store,%20org.apache.lucene.document.Field.Index,%20org.apache.lucene.document.Field.TermVector%29>
*Field(Name, Value, Store, index, Field.TermVector.NO)
