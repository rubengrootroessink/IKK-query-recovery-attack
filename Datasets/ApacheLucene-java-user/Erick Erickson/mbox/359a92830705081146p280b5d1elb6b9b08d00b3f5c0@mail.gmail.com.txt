First question: What analyzers are you using at index and search time?

Second question: Have you tried using query.toString() to see how
the query parses? If so, you should post the results.

Third question: Have you used Luke to examine your index, to see
what's actually in there (which may surprise you depending upon
what analyzers you are using). You can also see how queries
parse using various analyzers. Which may also surprise you.
