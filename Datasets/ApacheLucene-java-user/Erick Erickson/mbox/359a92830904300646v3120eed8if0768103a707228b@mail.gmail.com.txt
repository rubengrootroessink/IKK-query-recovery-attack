This is surprising behavior, which is another way of saying that,
given what you've said so far, this shouldn't be happening. I'd
really look at system metrics, like whether you're swapping
etc. In particular you might want to try varying how big you
allow your memory footprint to grow before you flush, this is
in the doc Ian pointed out under *
Flush by RAM usage instead of document count*

There's no need to periodically optimize, just do that at the end
if you must.

Best
