SUBJECT: Re: Lucene sorting case-sensitive by default?
DATE: 14 Jan 2008

Several things:

1> do you need to display all the fields? Would just storing them
lower-case work? The only time I've needed to store fields case-
sensitive is when I'm showing them to the user. If the user is just
searching on them, I can store them any way I want and she'll never
know.

2> You might very well be surprised at how little extra it takes to
index (but not store) the lower-case version. How big is your index
anyway? And be warned that the size increase is not linear, so
just comparing the index sizes for, say, 10 document is misleading.
If your index is 10M, there's no reason at all not to store twice. If it's
10G........

3> You could store (but not index) the cased version. You could
index (but not store) the lower-case version. The total size of
your index is (I believe) about the same as indexing AND storing
the fields. That gives you a way to search caselessly and display
case-sensitively.
