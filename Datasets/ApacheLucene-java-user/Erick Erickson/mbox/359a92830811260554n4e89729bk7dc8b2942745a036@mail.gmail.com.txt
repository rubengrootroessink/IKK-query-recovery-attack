Why not index into different fields based upon the file type? That would be
MUCH easier and PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper would be your friend. For
example.....

Doc1
text_html: "some text here"
type: html

Doc2
text_jsp: "some jsp text here'
type: html

etc...

Now your PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper has your html extractor for the text_html
field and your jsp extractor for the text_jsp field.

Searching would require you to search across all your different types, but
that's do-able. Or you'd have to restrict your searching to one of the
text_* fields if you really only wanted to search that type.

But I still think you're not clear on the difference when searching. Your
search query analyzer will probably have no relation to your indexing
analyzer since the type of input is irrelevant to your query (I guess
anyway). There you're probably using one of the analyzers provided out of
the box.
