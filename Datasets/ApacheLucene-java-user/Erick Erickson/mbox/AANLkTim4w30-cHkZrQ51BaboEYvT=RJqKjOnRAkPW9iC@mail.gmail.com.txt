Line number is a completely unknown concept to Lucene, you have to somehow
figure it out. I've seen at least two ways to make that work:
1> use payloads. A payload is just a bit of data you attach to each token,
what you
     put in there is up to you, so you can encode this kind of information
however you
     want. See:
http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2009/08/05/getting-started-with-payloads/

2> You can do a similar sort of thing by recording the relevant information
when
     you analyze a document and the include that data in a very special
(probably
     stored-only field) in your document. Say the offsets of each beginning
of line.
     This field would never be searched, just used to find out what line a
hit
     was on. Then, when you can find the lines numbers once you know the
term
     positions. Stealing from Grant:
See
http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/7fe40486bc935ce4/get_term_neighbours(although
I think you can do better than the code in the third reply by using a
TermVectorMapper such that you can process the TermVector as it comes from
disk.)

Essentially, you need to use a combination of SpanQuery, TermVector and
TermVectorMapper.
