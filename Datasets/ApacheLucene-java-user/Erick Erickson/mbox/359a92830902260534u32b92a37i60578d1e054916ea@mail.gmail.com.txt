UNLESS you have stored the data (Field.Store.YES/COMPRESS),
in which case you can just get the field from each index and put it
in the new one. Tokenization has little to do with this although you
could get a similar effect with untokenized fields but why would you
want to?

I assume you have a way to uniquely identify the documents that you
want to combine, relying on the Lucene doc ID is fragile....

If possible, your best bet would be to reconstruct the new index
from the source you used to create the original indexes.

Maybe a higher-level problem statement would help generate
more suggestions.
