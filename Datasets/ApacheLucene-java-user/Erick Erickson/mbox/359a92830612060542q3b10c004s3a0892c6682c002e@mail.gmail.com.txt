Chris is asking you to post a program that *he* can compile and run that
demonstrates the problem. So far, you've posted code that requires other
parts of your system to be present in order to compile and run. That makes
it hard to see the problem. For all we know,
access.getProductsByKeyword(keyword);
throws an exception that's handled in a way that fails benignly. Or maybe it
just creates a collection but fails to assign it to the return properly. Or
you're connecting to a different searcher than you think you are. Or there's
a real problem in Lucene. Or...... The point is that there are so many
hidden parts that we can't see that it's hard to help.

One real value of the exercise is it forces one to concentrate on the
fundamental expected behavior of the product in question, Lucene in this
case. 99 times out of 100, when I try this, I can't demonstrate a failure
case and realize that it's not the problem I thought it was.
