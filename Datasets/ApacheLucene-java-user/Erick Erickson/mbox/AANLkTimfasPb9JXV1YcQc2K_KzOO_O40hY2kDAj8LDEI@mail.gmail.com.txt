In addition to Ian's comment, an important question is what
kind of values you're sorting on. It sounds like a time stamp,
because most languages only have a (relatively) small number
of terms.

It's not the total terms in the field, it's the total *unique* terms
in the field. So even with a very large text field in, say, English,
there are only around 300,000 terms and that will be the max
that are loaded into memory.

So, as always, details matter <G>.

Best
