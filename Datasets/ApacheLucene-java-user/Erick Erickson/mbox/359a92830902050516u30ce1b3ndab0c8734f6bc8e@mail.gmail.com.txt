I don't understand your question. From the API docs for
HitCollector.collect:

<<<Called once for every non-zero scoring document, with
the document number and its score.>>>

Can you ask your question another way? Because the
only answer I can come up with is
"HitCollector.collect only sees each document once by definition".
