You can ignore the warning.

But you haven't told us a thing about *how* the failure occurs or
what gets reported. What exactly are you doing? What exactly
fails (i.e.do you just not find files? Get a stack trace? Get a
"class not found error"?)

We really cannot help at all without more information.
