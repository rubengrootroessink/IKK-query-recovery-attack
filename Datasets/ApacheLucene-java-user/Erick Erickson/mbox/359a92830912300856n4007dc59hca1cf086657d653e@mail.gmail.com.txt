SUBJECT: Re: Question about many fields within a single index
DATE: 30 Dec 2009

As far as I know, no problem. There's no penalty that I
know of for having this kind of setup. Of course your
mileage may vary, and a relevant question is "why do
you care?" That is, if your total index is 100M in size,
pretty much no matter how Lucene implements the internal
data structures you won't notice any performance issues.

If your index is 100M *documents* and 1T in size, you care
very much about internal efficiency. So a few more details
would probably generate more useful answers <G>....

But "more useful answers" probably will boil down to
"spin up a test index and see", since there are so many
variables to search performance.

I would imagine, though, that you'd see some non-typical
search response times due to cache loading. In
a more "usual" setup, I'd expect the first query or two
that caused caches to load up to be anomalously
long, hence the notion of "warmup queries". I suspect
instead, that you'll see little bumps in search
time since it'll take a lot more queries to hit every field
that can be cached. Those bumps should be shorter though,
since presumably the fields won't contain as many terms.
But without more details, that's just a guess.

I guess about all I'm saying here is that there's no
reason not to go ahead and see...
