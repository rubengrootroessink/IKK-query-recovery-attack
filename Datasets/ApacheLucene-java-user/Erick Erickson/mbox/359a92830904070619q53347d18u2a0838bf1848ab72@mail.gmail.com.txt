Hmmmm. There's nothing in Lucene that I know of that will do what you
want, you'll have to do one of two things:

In general, you'll have to break up your token stream yourself, either
through pre-processing or building your own analyzers. There's
nothing already built that I know of that will break up, for instance,
KeyWordAnalyzer into three tokens.

Part of the confusion is the use of the phrase "keyword" as in
"and class should be a Key word". If I'm reading this right, you'll
want "class" to be in a separate field since it's special (in your
context). Again, to accomplish this you either need to pre-process
the input stream, extract "class", and put it in a separate field or
create your own analyzer that extracts only "class" from the
input stream. Then you'd feed the entire contents into *both* fields (say
"content" and "key"). The analyzer attached to the "content" field
(see PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper) would take care of breaking up
things like KeyWordAnalyzer, and the analyzer attached to the
"key" field would throw away everything except "class"..

Hope this helps
Erick
