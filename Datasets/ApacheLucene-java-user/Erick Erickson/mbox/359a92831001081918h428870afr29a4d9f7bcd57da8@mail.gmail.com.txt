Sure, you can add any data to any document that you want,
probably stored but not indexed in this case. It could even
be a serialized Java object. Or an XML packet or a
stringized map. Or... whatever suits your fancy. If it's not
indexed, only stored it'll make your index larger but have
a negligible impact on search performance.

The trick is getting token offsets to put in your meta data.
You'll have to get the term positions and store them, but
it's do-able.
