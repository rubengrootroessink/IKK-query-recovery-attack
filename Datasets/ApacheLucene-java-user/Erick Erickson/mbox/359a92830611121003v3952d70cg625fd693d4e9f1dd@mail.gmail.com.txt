I'm going mostly from memory here, so the details may not be entirely
accurate, but.....

See TermDocs (FilterTermDocs?). Use the seek method to get to the term e.g.

TermDocs.seek(new Term("specific_field", ""));

 Note that the "" as the value of the term gets all the terms. Then use
TermDocs.next until it returns false. At each point, TermDocs.doc() will
give you the Lucene ID of a document containing that term.

Really, this enumerates all the documents that have any values in
specific_field.

One issue here is that you'll get multiple hits per document. For instance,
say you've indexed A, B, and C as values in specific_field for document 5.
Just blindly doing the next() call will get you document 5 three times. You
can use TermDocs.skipTo(current document + 1). to insure that you only
process a document once. This is either a minor efficiency or a major time
savings, depending on the characteristics of your index..... Be a bit
careful and only call next() if you *don't* use skipto, or you may skip a
doc that only has one value for specific_field.

Hope this helps
Erick
