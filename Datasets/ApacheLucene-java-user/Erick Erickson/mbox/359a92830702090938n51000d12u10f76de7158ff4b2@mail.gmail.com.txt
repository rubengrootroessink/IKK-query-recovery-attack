DATE: 9 Feb 2007

The query should be tokenized *by the query parser*. You shouldn't have to
do the tokenizing yourself. When you print out the results of the parsing,
you should see something like field:value1 field:value2, which are built up
under the covers to be a BooleanQuery with a bunch of clauses.

I think, though, I'm really at the end of any helpful suggestions I can come
up with without looking at some code from both the indexing and querying.
Otherwise, we'll just continue to mislead each other. If you haven't
already, I strongly urge you to get a copy of Lucene In Action since that'll
give you a much more thorough explication of tokenizing than I can.

Best
Erick
