The synonym analyzer shown in Lucene In Action is a good place
to start. You need to change *all* occurrences of one form into
another, both an index and search time to get consistent results.

There are some "interesting" implications for this, though, but they
only really need to be considered if you need either phrase or
span queries. For instance, let's say you have the following doc
fragments:
doc1: "this is a tcp interaction that I want to deal with"
doc2: "this is a transmission control protocol interaction that I want to
deal with"

is "this" within 4 of "interaction" in both documents? Do you care?

Also, is the phrase "transmission control protocol" match for the
first document? Would the user be confused by matching a document
with "tcp" in it for that phrase?

For that matter, does searching on "transmission" match doc1?
Mostly, these are issues that may or may not be relevant depending
on the intent of the application...

Highlighting also becomes interesting.

Best
Erick
