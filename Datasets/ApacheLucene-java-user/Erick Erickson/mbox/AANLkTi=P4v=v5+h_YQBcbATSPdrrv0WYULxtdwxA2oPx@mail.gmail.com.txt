SUBJECT: Re: lucene3.0.2: getting incorrect no. of occurrence in file
DATE: 6 Dec 2010

"but do not gives correct no of occurrence in each document".

An example of the document you expect to be matched and the
code you're using to search would be a great help.  You might
consider making a Junit test case illustrating your problem, that
very often shows you the underlying problem.
