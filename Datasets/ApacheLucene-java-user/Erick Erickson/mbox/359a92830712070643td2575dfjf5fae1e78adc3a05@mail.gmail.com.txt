Have you looked at Filters? Essentially, you construct a bitmap where each
bit corresponds to a document and pass that along into your search.
Constructing
a filter is surprisingly speedy.

What you lose is relevancy for the filtered part of the query. See
ConstantScoreQuery.

Also, search the mail archive for wildcard and you'll find a wealth of
information.
See the thread "I just don't get wildcards at all" for some very worthwhile
discussion.
