yes and yes. Try searching the mail archives for things like
multi-language and you'll find this topic discussed ad-nauseum

But basically consider why this must be so, especially when
stemming. Languages are so variable that you'd get wildly
different (and inappropriate) results if you tried to analyze them
with the same analyzer. Especially when you get different
language encodings in the document.
