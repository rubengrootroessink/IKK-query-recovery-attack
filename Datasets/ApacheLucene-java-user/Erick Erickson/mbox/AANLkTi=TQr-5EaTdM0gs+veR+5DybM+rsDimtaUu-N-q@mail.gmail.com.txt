How could there be such a tool? Consider the number of ways
that a given input stream can be defined. WordDelimiter, Stopwords,
synonyms, etc. Eventually, you'd reconstruct all of the logic embedded
in the analysis process in your checking program. Then you'd wonder
if that was correct.

There's quite a bit of testing done automatically, but that doesn't
really answer your question. You can easily create a special-purpose
tool that would spin through the terms for a given field and figure
out that they were what was expected, but then you have to define
expected terms.

So, you're stuck with just assuming it works or writing a custom tool
I think.
