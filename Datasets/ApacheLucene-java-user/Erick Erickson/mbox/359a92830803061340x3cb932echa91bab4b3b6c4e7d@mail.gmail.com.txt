Well, I'm not sure. But any index, even one split amongst many nodes
is going to have some interesting performance characteristics if you
have over 2 billion documents.... So I'm not sure it matters <G>...

What problem are you really trying to solve? You'll probably get
more meaningful answers if you tell us what that is.
