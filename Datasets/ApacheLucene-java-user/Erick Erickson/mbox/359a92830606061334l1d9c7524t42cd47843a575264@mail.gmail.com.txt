Are you as old as I am or do you just like old Rock-n-Roll? If you're
getting this from the Apostrophe/Overnight Sensation album (Frank Zappa),
you can also listen to my all-time favorite song "I'm the slime".

P.S. Haven't owned a TV in 30+ years.

P.P.S. This will make no sense whatsoever to anyone who hasn't listened to
the song.
