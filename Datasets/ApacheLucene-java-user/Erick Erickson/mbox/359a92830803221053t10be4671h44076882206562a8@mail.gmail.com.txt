SUBJECT: Re: factor in stopwords when searching
DATE: 22 Mar 2008

What's your reason for trying? The whole point of stop words is that
they should be considered "no ops". That is, they add nothing to the
semantics of whatever is being processed. I' don't understand the use
case for why you want to go outside that assumption.

Another way of asking this is "what tangible benefit to your users
are you trying to implement"?
