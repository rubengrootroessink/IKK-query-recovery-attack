PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper is your friend, assuming that you have separate
fields, some tokenized and some not. If you *don't* have separate
fields, then we need more details of what you hope to accomplish...

something like

(+tokenized:value1 +tokenized:vaue2) (+untokenized:value3 +
untokenized:value4)

should do the trick, where you've constructed a PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper
with a tokenizing analyzer for field "tokenized" and a non-tokenizing
analyzer
for field "untokenized".
