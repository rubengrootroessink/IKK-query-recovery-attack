Note a couple of things:

1> how a doc scores also takes into account how many other words
     are in the field you're querying on.
2> Is "text" your default field? Because what you posted is really
     searching text:fleming <default field>:roofing <default
field>:inc......
     Not also the implicit OR between each of them. Is this really your
     intent?
3> query.explain (as i remember) is your friend to figure out how the
     weights are being calculated. If you haven't got a copy of Luke, I'd
    *strongly* advise getting one and looking at the "explain" tab...
