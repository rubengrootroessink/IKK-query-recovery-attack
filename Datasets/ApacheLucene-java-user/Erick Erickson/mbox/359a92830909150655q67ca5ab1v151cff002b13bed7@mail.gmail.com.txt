SUBJECT: Re: Displaying search result data - stored fields vs external source
DATE: 15 Sep 2009

Categorically I store everything in the index unless/until I *know* it
doesn'twork. With some things, it's easy to know from the outset, like if I
have
20T of data to store.

First, storing fields has minimal impact on the search speed, the stored
text
isn't interleaved with the search tokens, so they're pretty much disjoint.

Second, any scheme storing data separately is inherently more complex
and difficult to maintain. From the eXtreme Programming folks "Do the
simplest thing that could possibly work".

Third, there isn't much work in trying it and seeing. I mean you have to
write
the retrieval code, and if you encapsulate fetching the data you can switch
it out later if it comes to that pretty easily. So you don't lose much at
all
by "just trying it" <G>..
