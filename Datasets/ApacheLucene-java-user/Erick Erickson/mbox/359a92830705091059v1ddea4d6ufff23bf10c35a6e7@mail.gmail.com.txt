Well, I don't see how this can work. In your example, you'd
index "werkte". But how are you going to search such that
this matches "werk"? No matter what analyzers you use? It looks
like you're thinking about either stemming or wildcarding, but
I really suspect that stemming is language dependent. So
I don't think you're going to get reasonable results when mixing
languages if you try to stem....

You might try something like indexing AND searching in a single
language. Say the standard low-ascii character set, with all the
accented characters folded into their unaccented forms. Of course,
the data you search on isn't the same data you display, so you
could still display the data in the native language.

Mind you, I think this is tricky, with hidden problems. But it
might work.

As far as the stemming is concerned, I also suppose you could
do something like use the native stemmer at index time, *then* fold
all the characters into values 20-127, THEN index the result. And do
the same at query time. I *still* think you'd get some "interesting"
results, but it could suffice. Although this requires you to know what
the language is that the person writing the query is using.

But no matter what you do, I'm pretty sure you'll get some results that
won't be what you want. The results may be close enough though.

Best
