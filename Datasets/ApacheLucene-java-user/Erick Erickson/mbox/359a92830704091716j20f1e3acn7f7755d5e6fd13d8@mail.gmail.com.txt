Well, a couple of things....

The IndexReader is opened on an already existing index. You need to
have built an index to open a reader on it. So there isn't really a default
reader.

So usually, one uses Lucene to create an index out of some
number of documents, and use that index for searching. One of
the major parts of creating an index is exactly reading in the
raw text and deciding what needs to go into the index in various
fields.

This makes what you're trying to do a bit clumsy, at least it
would have a release or two ago...

However, you're in great luck, because some kind soul created
MemoryIndex, which is a simplified in-memory-only index
intended to be used to create indexes on a single document for
some processing and then throw out. Which may be just what you
need. See the jar in C:\lucene-2.1.0\contrib\memory

But I'm still not sure this is what you need, because you only get
relevancy rankings in Lucene based upon the query you are trying
to submit. If you're doing simple term frequency counting, perhaps
you can get creative with TermFreqVector and other Term* classes...

Perhaps others will be able to chime in here....

Best
Erick
