It would help a lot if you provided a couple of examples of inputs into your
index and expected outputs for queries.

For instance, you say:
<<<For example I need to search for "java de*" and recieve "java
developers",
"java development", "developed by java" et>>>

But then in your follow-up you say
<<<I have not tokenized phrases in index.>>>

Well, if you haven't tokenized your input streams at index time and
query time, you can't get what your first statement asks for.

StandardAnalyzer, for instance tokenizes the input stream. If you use
that at index time, you do, indeed, tokenize the phrases. That is, the
analyzer does it for you.

So, in order for us to help you, please provide:
1> the analyzers you use at index time (code snippets)
2> the analyzers you use at query time (code snippets)
3> example queries with  expected responses
4> example input that corresponds to <3>.

Or, a small, self-contained program (or unit test) that illustrates
what you are trying to accomplish.

Best
Erick
