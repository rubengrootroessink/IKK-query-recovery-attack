SUBJECT: Re: Special characters prevent entity being indexed
DATE: 19 Nov 2008

I'm going to have to punt on what Hibernate does/doesn't do since I have no
experience there.

But in general analyzers are very important. StandardAnalyzer, for instance,
tries
to recognize e-mail addresses. So it'll create some very interesting tokens,
some
that are unexpected unless you really know the guts of the tokenizer
underneath.

What I expect is really happening is that some of your tokens are getting
munged
in ways you don't expect and that they're getting indexed, but you're not
finding
the munged version because they're somewhere else in the index. Either that
or
you're getting some sort of error condition that you're throwing away.....

So here's the approach I would take. Make a list of your tokens that you're
having
trouble with and create an index with *only* those tokens, to see whether
they
really get into the index or not.

Make really, really sure you use the same analyzer BOTH at index and search
time. I've seen ISOLatin1AccentFilter() recommended, but I confess that I
don't know the underlying details.

Perhaps you could create your own filter/analyzer based on the analyzer of
your
choice, override the next() method and spit out the tokens that are produced
to examine the results closely.

Anyway, general advice that probably doesn't address your issue, I know. But
the best I have this morning. I'll appeal to people who understand Hibernate
now <G>.

Best
