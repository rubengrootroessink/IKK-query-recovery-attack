ahhhh, finally. I'm almost completely sure you can't *write* to a
RAMDirectory
and expect the underlying FSDir to be updated. The intent of RAMDirectorys
is to *read* in an index from disk and keep it in memory. Essentially I
believe
that your RAMDirecotry constructor is taking a snapshot of the underlying
disk index, modifying that in-memory copy, and throwing it away without
ever writing it to disk. I wouldn't expect opening the FSDirectory after
writing
to the RAMDirectory to find anything. Ever.

If you really need the RAMDir, I suspect you'll have to open an FS-based
writer as well as a RAM-based writer, and write to both when necessary.
You'll probably also have to open/search your RAM-based index as the
faster alternative to re-opening the FS-based index. Either way, reopening
the index is probably expensive, are you sure you need to? Is there a way
to keep your information in an internal data structure for some period of
time?

Best
Erick
