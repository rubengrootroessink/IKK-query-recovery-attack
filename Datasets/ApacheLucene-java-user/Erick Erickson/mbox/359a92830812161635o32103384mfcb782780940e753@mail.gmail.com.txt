I'd ask the client why stemming wouldn't work <G>. I've spent faaaar too
much
time in my life doing useless things "because the client asked". Really, ask
for
the use cases where that is really required and that stemming wouldn't
cover.

But you're right that Lucene doesn't have such a facility or API. How could
it?
Stemming is easy (yeah, right). But at least it's algorithmic. Going from
one word
to all the possible variants (or even worse, all those variants the client
thinks
should be there) usually requires some kind of "expansion map". Particularly
when you want to go from, say, Steve to Stephen.
