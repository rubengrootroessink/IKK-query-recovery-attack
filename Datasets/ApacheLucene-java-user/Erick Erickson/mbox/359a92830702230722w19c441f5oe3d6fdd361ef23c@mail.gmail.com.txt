Sure, you can use the TermDocs/TermEnum classes. Basically, for a term
(probably column value in your app) these let you quickly answer the
question "which (and how many) documents does this term appear in". What you
get is the Lucene doc id, which let's you fetch all the information about
the documents you want.
