SUBJECT: Re: StandardFilter not handling dots as exptected ?
DATE: 6 Aug 2009

I don't see anything obvious in the code.
Are you using the same analzer at query time as at index time?
I'd also get a copy of Luke and examine your index to see what
is actually getting put in it, and query.toString might help.
