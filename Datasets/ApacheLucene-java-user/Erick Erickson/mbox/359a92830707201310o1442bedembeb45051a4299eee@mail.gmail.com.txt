SUBJECT: Re: [RegexQuery] how to check what words were founded in particulary Documents ?
DATE: 20 Jul 2007

First, the period (.) isn't part of the syntax, so make sure you look
more carefully at the Lucene syntax...

Then, you might be able to use WildcardTermEnum to find
the terms that match and TermDocs to find the documents
that contain those terms.

There's nothing built into Lucene to do this out of the box, you
have to roll your own.

Best
