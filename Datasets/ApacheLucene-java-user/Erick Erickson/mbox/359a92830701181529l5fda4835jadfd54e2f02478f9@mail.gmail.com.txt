SUBJECT: Re: Counting hits in a document
DATE: 18 Jan 2007

Hoss:

It was late this afternooon and I was square-eyed, so I didn't add the
detail. The app we're working on first returns a summary list of all the
books that match a query, no hit information. Next, the user clicks on a
returned title and we show the hits by chapter. That is, a list of chapters
and the count of the hits for each. The index is nearing 15G at present, so
I *assumed* that I really didn't want to re-query the entire index when I
know the particular document I care about already. But what do I know?

Mark:

Very most excellent. I'll give it a look in the morning. I hope that the
class doesn't need the raw text since I don't have it any more, but your
comment "Give it a query it will give you the spans" makes me hopeful.



The real issue is that it looks like I'm reverting to my old "C" days. The
code I was writing the last couple of days started to look like a program
from...well...a long time ago. So I *know* it must be wrong <G>...... It's a
real pain in the neck to *think* in Java terms when much of my training was
before this new-fangled way of looking at programming problems happened. I
suppose I could go into management, but that would be giving in to the dark
side....

Thanks all
Erick
