I didn't ask a clear question. *Why* do you want to do this?
What is the use-case you're trying to solve? Is relevance
not what you want? Are you just experimenting?

The statement of *what* you want to do is clear, but I don't know
an easy to do that. Perhaps there's a better approach to solving
the underlying need.
