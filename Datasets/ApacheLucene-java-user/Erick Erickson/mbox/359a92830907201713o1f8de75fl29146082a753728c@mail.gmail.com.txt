Describe a bit more, please, what "does not seem to work" means.

For instance, if you're searching for the doc and haven't reopened your
index, you won't see changes.

Better yet, a small, self-contained test case would be even better. I've
often
found my problem trying to write a test to illustrate my problem..

Best
