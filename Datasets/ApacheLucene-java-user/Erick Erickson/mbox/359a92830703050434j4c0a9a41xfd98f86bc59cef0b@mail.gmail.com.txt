DATE: 5 Mar 2007

There was quite a long discussion thread on this topic relatively
recently, try searching the archive for concurrence, perhaps
IndexReader, etc.

The short take-away is that you should share a single instance
of the reader, since opening one is an expensive operation, and
the first searches you perform will incur some overhead while
underlying caches are built. You have to build in some mechanisms
for gracefully shutting it down when you need to re-open them if they
are being shared....
