OK, now I understand what you're trying to accomplish. Unfortunately, I
haven't a clue about any better solution than you're already using. I've
also seen the optimize step take a really long time.....

Does it make any sense at all to write a bunch of separate indexes (a new
one each time you would flush your RAMdir) and then use a MultiSearcher on
them? Perhaps with some offline merger/optimizer that ran periodically so
you don't end up with a bazillion indexes? It adds ugly complexity to
managing your indexes, but...
