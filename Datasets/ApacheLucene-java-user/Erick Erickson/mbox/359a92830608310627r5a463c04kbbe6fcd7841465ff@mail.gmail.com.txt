Let me chime in here on a different note.... before you get happy with
wildcard queries, take a look at the thread "I just don't get wildcards at
all". There is lots of good info that Erik, Chris and Otis provided me.

The danger with prefixquery and wildcard query is that they will throw
TooManyClauses exceptions when you start matching a number of terms (the
default is 1024, although you can make this much bigger if memory allows).
If you're aware of this and it is and will be OK in your app, ignore this.
But if your index is going to grow significantly, this is a real problem. I
went with implementing filters with WildCardTermEnum (you could also use
RegexTermEnum) for the wildcard portions of my query. Which has interesting
implications for spans, we elected to say spans didn't work with wildcards.

Anyway, as I said, if you're aware of the TooManyClauses issue and are sure
it doesn't matter, ignore me. After all, everybody else does <G>.....


Best
Erick
