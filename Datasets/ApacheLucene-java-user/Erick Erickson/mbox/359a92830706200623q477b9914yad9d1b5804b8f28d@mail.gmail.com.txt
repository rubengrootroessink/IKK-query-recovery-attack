SUBJECT: Re: zero termfreq for some search strings with special characters
DATE: 20 Jun 2007

You don't. You don't have an actual term "emp-id" in your index. You
have "emp" and "id". So "emp-id" isn't a term.

If you really want to control this sort of thing, and none of the
stock analyzers work exactly as you require, you need to write
your own Analyzer that breaks the stream however you want, and
use *that* analyzer at index and search time. Then looking at
termfreq will work as you expect.

PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper will allow you to treat different fields
differently, which may help if you want one sort of behavior for
one field in your documents and different behavior for others.
