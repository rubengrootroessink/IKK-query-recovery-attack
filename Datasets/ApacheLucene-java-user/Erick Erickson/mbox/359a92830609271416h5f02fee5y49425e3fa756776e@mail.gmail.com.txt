Yes. New additions to an index are NOT searchable until the
indexSearcher/IndexReader is closed and reopened, just as you are observing.
I think of it as the IndexSearcher taking a "snapshot" of the index when it
is instantiated and operating on that snapshot exclusively thereafter,
regardless of what changes are made to the underlying index.

You got it right in one <G>.
