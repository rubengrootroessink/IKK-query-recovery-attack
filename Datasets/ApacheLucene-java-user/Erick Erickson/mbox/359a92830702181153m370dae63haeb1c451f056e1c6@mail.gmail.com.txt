DATE: 18 Feb 2007

So, which class wasn't found? Indexfiles? And should that be IndexFiles?

But check again that the path to the jars is exactly correct. I can't tell
you how many times I've made a typo in something like that...... Often I
resort to making a command file, and cut-n-paste from Windows Explorer
address bar just to be sure, then cut-n-pasting things into an editor to
force myself to do a character-by-character comparison.....

One final note, it's useful to cut-n-paste the errors, since if you re-type
things, you can, say, capitalize incorrectly and not get much useful
back......
