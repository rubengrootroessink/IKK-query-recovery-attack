If you know this at index time, could you index language-specific fields?
i.e.
text_en, text_de, title_en, title_de etc? Perhaps you could have a catch-all
that contained everything too.

Then your searching would be on a per field_lang basis.
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper
would automatically use the proper language-specific Analyzers.

This may turn out being too clumsy if you have many fields X many
languages....

Actually, this looks a lot like what SOLR could provide, perhaps with
dynamic
fields and the dismax query parser
