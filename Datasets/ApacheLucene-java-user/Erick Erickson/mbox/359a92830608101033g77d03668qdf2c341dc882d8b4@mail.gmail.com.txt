probably not because I doubt that you'll have the '%' in the index (but I
admit I don't know for sure). Get Luke and check to be sure (
http://www.getopt.org/luke/). That will tell you exactly what is in the
index. I suspect you'll find "772B" but the '%' will simply be absent.

Also, watch capitalization. The StandardAnalyzer lowercases your stream as I
remember....

You probably want a different analyzer fot *both* indexing and searching if
you really need to search such strings, try WhitespaceAnalyzer and perhaps
store your values UN_TOKENIZED (but watch that latter, this assumes you're
controlling your tokens yourself and not relying on the analyzer to break up
your input stream).

And if you want to look treat different fields differently, think about
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper.

Best
