How large is (large)? What machines are you intending to run this on?

In general, though, don't worry about index size until you actually have some
numbers to deal with. Solr generally has resource issues based on the number
of #unique# terms in an index. So repeating the same thing in a bunch of
documents isn't as bad as you'd suppose.

If you *store* fields, certain files in your index will grow linearly,
but these aren't
the ones that are used for searching. *.fdx, *.fdt, *.fnm in
particular will grow.

So I'd go ahead and just replicate the data and then monitor your system for, in
particular, cache issues (see the admin/stats page). Normalizing your data
is tricky in Solr, so don't do it unless it proves necessary IMO...
