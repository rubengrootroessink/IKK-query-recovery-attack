Index>>>


So it's just the IDs to your hourly index contained in each Daily document.
Problem here is that this ID is probably NOT the Lucene ID, so my original
idea needs some refinement. Assuming that your IDs to the hourly index
are contained in your daily document, you should be able to use TermDocs
to get the Hourly documents efficiently.

Note to self: Engage brain.

FWIW
