well, why not just include a field that identifies each document's class?
Then, to search over
all classes, just don't mention the class field.

When you *do* want to restrict by class, include "AND class:blah" in your
query.

This assumes you don't have a huge number of classes and it wouldn't be a
problem
to have a clause like AND (class:cl1 OR class:cl2 OR class:cl3......). That
said, a
clause containing 100s of class:blah isn't a problem.

And if you want to get really fancy, create a Filter for each class and you
can just
combine the filters appropriately when you want to query and restrict to
classes.

Limiting the results to the top 10/20 per class is tricker, but see
HitCollectors
for a way to intervene in the hit selection process. You could keep a simple
map
that counted by class and reject each doc that came through the hitcollector
class after it reached your limit. Beware of doing a Reader.get() on each
hit, you'd have to do some work with TermDocs/TermEnum.

All that said, I haven't really kept up on the faceting that's been talked
about
in the archive, so you may want to look at the searchable mail archive and
see what's up with that.

How big is your index? That is, how many documents and how many fields
(approx) are you talking about here? That'll influence whether you would
be better off keeping them all in one index or splitting them up. But if you
can keep them in a single index, your maintenance will be *much* easier.

Best
