SUBJECT: Re: Getting a score of a specific document
DATE: 17 May 2009

I'm still unclear what you want the statistics *for*. "statistics"
are pretty meaningless as far as I understand. The whole point
of scoring is to use various "statistics" to *rank* documents *for
a specific query*. You cannot, for instance, compare scores
between different queries in any meaningful way.

If you're saying that you want the documents for your query to be
ranked *relative to each other*, but restricted to only the documents
you care about, then I think you need a HitCollector
because a Filter (last I knew) doesn't score documents therefore
won't order them.

But asking if the statistics reflect the whole index just isn't making any
sense to me. If you're asking that question I suspect that there's
something about your problem space I don't understand and
you're not explaining simply enough for me to grasp <G>.

So forget a Filter because you'll get the documents back in
(probably, but my memory is weak some days) document ID
order. Implement a HitCollector whose collect method only
sets bits for docs in your list. See:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_2_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/HitCollector.html#collect(int,%20float)
