No. I've found this kind of odd too. Here's a snippet...

Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators. Lucene
supports AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" as Boolean operators(Note: Boolean
operators must be ALL CAPS).

Well, first ~ isn't a wildcard, it's a "fuzzy search" (aka similar terms).
So getting "bellow" for "yellow~" is expected. Although, somewhat
confusingly, "lemon orange"~10 is a proximity search.

* and ? are the wildcard characters.

Searcher.explain() is probably your friend, although I haven't used it much,
I've certainly seen it mentioned enough......

If you haven't, get a copy of Luke (google lucene luke). It's a program that
allows you to explore your indexes, explain queries, explore the effects of
different analyzers, etc. Really, really, really get a copy <G>....


Thanks for all the help.
