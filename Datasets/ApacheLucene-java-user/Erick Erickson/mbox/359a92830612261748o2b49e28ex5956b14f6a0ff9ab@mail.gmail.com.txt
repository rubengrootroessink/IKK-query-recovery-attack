Did you look in contrib/snowball? It should have been unpacked along with
everything else when you unpacked lucene 2.0, it's named something like
lucene-showball-2.0.0.jar.

That said, I've also had to poke around to find things, and I still don't
understand large portions of what Lucene does for me. Of course, the
documentation I'd really like is always an example that does exactly what
I'm looking for right now and nothing else <G>. An interesting place to look
is the unit tests for examples of how various classes are used, but they
also suffer from a dearth of explanations about why I should care about a
particular class.

But considering that it's free and how generous the the main players have
been with their time answering questions for me, I really don't have
anything to complain about...

Best
Erick
