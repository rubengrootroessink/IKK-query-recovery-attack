Well, if I think you can create three PhraseQueries and combine them  in a
BooleanQuery with SHOULD. That is
PhraseQuery pq1 = new PhraseQuery();
pq1.add(new Term("content", "jakarta tomcat"));
pq2.add(new Term("title", "jakarta tomcat"));

BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
bq.add(pq1, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);
bq.add(pq2, BoleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);

and then use the bq for your searcher.

Note: you may have to do a separate add for pq, once for "jakarta" and once
for "tomcat"...

As far as the second question is concerned, you probably are running afoul
of the analyzer you use either at index time or search time or both. If you
use StandardAnalyzer, it will strip out the colon ':', so searching only for
"jakarta" is exactly what I would expect. Something like WhitespaceAnalyzer
might be a better bet...

Hope this helps
Erick
