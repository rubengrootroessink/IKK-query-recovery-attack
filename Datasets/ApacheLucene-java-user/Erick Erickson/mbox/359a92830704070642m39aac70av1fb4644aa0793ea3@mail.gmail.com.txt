Well, you're not giving us much to go on here other than code inspection.
It would be much more useful to give us the exception trace, try using
e.printStackTrace();
As an added benefit, that often allows me to figure out the problem
myself, which is faster.....

But at a guess, you're destroying your index with the call
FSDirectory directory = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexDir,true)

because the second parameter is set to true, causing a new
directory to be created or the old one to be erased. This call
as been deprecated in Lucene 2.1, what version are you using?

And the line
System.out.println("The value of Deleted Document is " +directory);

confuses me a lot since directory is an FSDirectory, not a string.

Best
Erick
