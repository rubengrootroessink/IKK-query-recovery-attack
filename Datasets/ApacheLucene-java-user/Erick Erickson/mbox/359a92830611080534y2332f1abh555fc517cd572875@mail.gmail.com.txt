Martin's got it right. You might get some mileage out of the IndexModifier
class if you have to do insertions and deletions, but really read the
documentation.

Also note: Any changes you make to an index are invisible to a searcher
that's already open. You have to close/reopen that searcher to see the
effects of index modifications (either insertions or deletions).
