I guess it depends upon your goal. If you're asking what the difference
between writing to a RAMDirectory *then* flushing to an FSDIrectory,
I don't believer there's much, if any. As I remember (and my memory
isn't always...er...accurate), there's been discussion on this thread
by those who know that underneath the covers an FSDirecotyr
uses a RAMDirectory for a while, then flushes it to disk.

If you're asking what the difference between a RAMDirectory is
and an FSDirectory, that's another story.
