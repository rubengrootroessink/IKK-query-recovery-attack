One way to mitigate the cost of this kind of thing is to create a series of
indexes on portions of your corpus and then merge them. Say you have 10,000
documents. Create 10 separate indexes of 1,000 documents each then use
IndexWriter.addIndexes to make them all into a single index.

This pre-supposes you have a neat way of partitioning your files so don't
index any of them in more than one of your sub-indexes.

This doesn't really solve the underlying problem, but at least when the
thing crashes, you spend less time trying the next thing <G>....
