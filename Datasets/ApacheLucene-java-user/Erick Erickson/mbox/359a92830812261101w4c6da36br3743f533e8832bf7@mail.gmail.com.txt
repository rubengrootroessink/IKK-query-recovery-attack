Several points:

1> Prabin's suggestion is, I think, equivalent to something like:
title:(business AND author)^9.0 OR
author:(business AND author)^3.0
OR description:(business AND author)^1.0.
Either way may give you results more in line with what
you expect. (note, the syntax here is suspect, but you get the idea)
I'm not sure what the boosting in your original clause
really does, but it seems suspect... but then I'm no
scoring expert.

2> If you haven't already, get a copy of Luke and
run a few of these scenarios through the "explain" function.
That'll show you a lot about how the queries are scored. And
Query.explain is your friend too.

3> Boosts are a modifier of the score, so expecting the
result sets to be simply predictable will probably surprise you.
Boosting will *tend* to sort things the way you want, but
a document whose description score is 10000 and title score is
1 will still sort above other title scores (numbers pulled out of thin
air). That said, since your title and author fields will very probably
be shorter than description, they'll tend to sort first anyway
I suspect.
