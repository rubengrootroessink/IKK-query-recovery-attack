SUBJECT: Re: range of scores : queryNorm()
DATE: 22 Feb 2010

Could you back up a step and tell us what the upper-level
task you're trying to accomplish is? That is, why the partner
wants the number?

Because the raw score in Lucene is only relevant within that
single query, and then only for ranking. The normalized score
*is* in a fixed range already, between 0 and 1. Would it serve
to just modify that and send it back to the partner?
