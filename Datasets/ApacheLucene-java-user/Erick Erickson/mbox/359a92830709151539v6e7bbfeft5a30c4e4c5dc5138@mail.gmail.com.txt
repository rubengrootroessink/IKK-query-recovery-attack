SUBJECT: Re: multiple Tokens in a Tokengroup not matching
DATE: 15 Sep 2007

I really can't tell much from your e-mail. What I'd recommend is
that you get a copy of Luke and examine your index (including
your query and it's results). Also, try query.toString() to see what
the actual query submitted to Lucene is, that may give you some
clues as to what's going on.

If the results make no sense, think about posting the results of
the toString and/or the Luke explain to  the list and I suspect
you'll get a more helpful response.

Imagine that you had been given your e-mail while knowing nothing
about the application. There's not much "there" there <G>. More
detail would help us give you a more helpful response....

That said, it's tough getting a bunch of code dropped on  your
head and being told "fix it". Been there, done that. Not much fun.

Best
Erick
