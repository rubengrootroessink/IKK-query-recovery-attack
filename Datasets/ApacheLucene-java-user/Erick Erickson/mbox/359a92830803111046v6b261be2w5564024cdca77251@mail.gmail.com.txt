You could also think about making a filter, probably when you open
your searcher. You can use TermDocs/TermEnum to find all of the documents
that *do* have entries for your field, assemble those into a filter, then
invert that filter. Keep the filter around and use it whenever you need
to. Perhaps CachingWrapperFilter would help here (although I've never
used the latter).

Another possibility is to index a field only for those documents that
don't have any value for MY_FIELD_NAME. So when indexing a doc, you
have something like
if (has MY_FIELD_NAME) {
   doc.add("MY_FIELD_NAME", <real value>);
} else {
   doc.add("NO_MY_FIELD_NAME", "no");
}

Now finding docs without your field really is just searching on
NO_MY_FIELD_NAME:no

Your index would be very slightly bigger in this instance....

FWIW
