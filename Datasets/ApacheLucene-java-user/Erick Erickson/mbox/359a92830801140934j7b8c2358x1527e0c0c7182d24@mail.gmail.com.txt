Sorry, I was confused about this for the longest time (and it shows!). You
don't actually have to store two separate fields. Field.Store.YES stores
the input exactly as is, without passing it through anything. So you
really only have to store your field. I still think of it conceptually as
two
entirely different things, but it's not.

This code:
   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
    {
        try {
            RAMDirectory dir = new RAMDirectory();
            IndexWriter iw = new IndexWriter(
                        dir,
                        new StandardAnalyzer(Collections.emptySet()),
                        true);

            Document doc = new Document();

            doc.add(
                    new Field(
                            "f",
                            "This is Some Mixed, case Junk($*%& With Ugly
SYmbols",
                            Field.Store.YES,
                            Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
            iw.addDocument(doc);
            iw.close();
            IndexReader ir =  IndexReader.open(dir);
            Document d = ir.document(0);
            System.out.println(d.get("f"));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("done");
    }

prints "This is Some Mixed, case Junk($*%& With Ugly SYmbols"
yet still finds the document with a search for "junk" using
StandardAnalyzer.

Sorry for the confusion!
