Whenever you start thinking this way, step back, take a deep
breath and remember that Lucene is a *text search* engine, not a
database engine. Forget all you know about data normalization
and construct your index so you do NOT have any conception of
foreign keys. De-normalize your data so you can do this
kind of thing with simple queries. Yes, this takes more room and
it may not be reasonable. But unless and until you *know* you'll
have space/performance problems, this should be your first
approach.

If that doesn't work, think about hybrid solutions where you put your
text in a Lucene index and the data you really, really do need to
use in a RDBMS way in a real-live database. If you search the
archives you'll see this discussed in some detail.

+title:java +content:lucene

should do the trick, but you'll have to write your own code to know
that the phrase "java and lucene" should be broken up this way.
