I think they'd have to be in the same document. So you could
read all the pages and add it to, say, a field named "text"
and add the doc and all the pages at once in a single document.

Be aware that by default Lucene only index the first 10,000
terms, but that can be changed with IndexWriter.setMaxFieldLength (?)
