Why won't Ian's suggestion work? You haven't really given us a clue what it
is about
your attempt that didn't work. The expected and actual output would be
useful...

But Ian's notion is the well-known issue that lexical and numeric sorting
aren't
at all the same. You'd get reasonable results if you left-padded the number
portion of the IDs with 0 out to 4 spaces, thus
aa-90   -> aa-0090
aa-123 -> aa-0123
aa-1000 > aa-1000

and your range queries should work. You might have to transform them
back when displayed. Or you could add them to your document twice.
Once in a "hidden" field, the one you searched against in your range query
and the other to display. This latter wouldn't bloat your index (much) since
you would store one and index the other....

Best
Erick
