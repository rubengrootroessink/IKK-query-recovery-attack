SUBJECT: Re: Counting term frequency without using Explanation
DATE: 19 Feb 2007

Just search the mail archives for the threads mentioned... start at
...http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/


But if all you want to do is count terms, see the termdocs/termenum classes
in the Lucene api...

But I believe that term frequency is *already* part of the relevance
calculation provided out of the box. Are you sure that the default relevancy
calculations aren't already doing this for you?
