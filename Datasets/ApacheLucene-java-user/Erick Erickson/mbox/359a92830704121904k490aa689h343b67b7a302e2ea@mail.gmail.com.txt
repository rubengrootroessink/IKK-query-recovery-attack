SUBJECT: Re: I have a question about phrase query with stop words
DATE: 13 Apr 2007

As I understand it, there really is no "space indicator". I think of it
as replacing the stop word with a space, which is then discarded.

so, you're indexing 'you find answer', and both your searches are
looking for 'you find answer',  the stop words are just gone as though
they never were. So both queries match.

But I've been wrong before <G>...

I can't really speak to the highlighter question, so I'll let someone
more knowledgeable pipe up.
