As Miles said, use the DateTools (lucene) class with a DAY resolution.
That'll give you a YYYYMMDD format, which won't blow your query with a
"TooManyClauses" exception.......

Remember that Lucene deals with strings, so you want to store things in
easily-manipulated string format, often one that's suitable for comparison.
Which is what you want to do when you create a RangeQuery
