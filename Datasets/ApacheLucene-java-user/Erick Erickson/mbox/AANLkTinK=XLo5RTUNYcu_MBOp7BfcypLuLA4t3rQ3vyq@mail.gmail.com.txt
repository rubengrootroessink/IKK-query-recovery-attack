SUBJECT: Re: filtering results per field?
DATE: 1 Nov 2010

I'm not quite following here. You can construct filters on any field you
want,
and combine them as you choose, then apply the resulting filter to your
query.
See TermsFilter for instance. Or, your filter could #be# your query.

If this is gibberish, could you give an example or two showing what you're
trying to accomplish?

Best
