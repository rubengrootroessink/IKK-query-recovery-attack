SUBJECT: Re: How do you check a field has been indexed correctly if not stored	?
DATE: 5 Jan 2010

One way to handle this is to run some searches and check to see
if the number of matched documents is what you expect.

You could also use some of the TermDocs to inspect your
index to see if things are what you expect.

You could knock yourself out and look at things like
TermPositionVector and TermFreqVector and see if the
terms you're interested in are in the positions you expect.

But I've been satisfied with just doing the first option, run a search
and see if you get exactly what you expect.....
