DATE: 5 Mar 2007

I think you should search the archive for DateTools. There have been
very extensive discussions of this topic that will give you answers
far more quickly.

Dates are strings in Lucene. There's no magic here. You don't need
to override anything to get them to work, all you need to do is make
sure that you index and query for them as searchable strings. For
example, 20070122. If you have different formats for dates, decide
on an underlying format that allows them to be sorted lexically (that
is, by String comparison).

Inspect your index with Luke to see if they're being stored as you
expect. Use QueryParser.toString to see how the query string
is broken up. Don't override anything until you do this or you'll waste
much effort <G>.

Best
Erick
