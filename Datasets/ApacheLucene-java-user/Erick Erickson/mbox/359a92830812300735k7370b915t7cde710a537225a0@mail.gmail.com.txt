You might want to take a look at using the ISOLatinAccentFilter or similar
at
both index and query time. It basically folds accented characters into their
un-accented form.

I also did this before realizing that the second field is unnecessary.
Storing is
orthogonal to indexing. That is, the filters are NOT applied to the stored
data.

<<<Store the original field value in the index. This is useful for short
texts like a
document's title which should be displayed with the results. The value is
stored
in its original form, *i.e. no analyzer is used before it is stored*.>>>

I don't think it makes much/any real performance difference, but it does
make the
code simpler to use just one field...
