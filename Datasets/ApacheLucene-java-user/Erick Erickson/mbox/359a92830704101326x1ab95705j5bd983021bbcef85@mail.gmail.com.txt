DATE: 10 Apr 2007

Lucene sorting is intended to sort documents relative to each other.
So it makes no sense to allow sorts on tokenized fields in the
Lucene context. Imagine the separate tokens in a field for doc1 of
a, c and e, and for doc2 b, d and f. Where should doc1 go in
relation to doc2 when sorting on that field? There's no good
*general* answer that I've been able to see.

So I suspect you really want to do something that's not
document sorting, and if you'd make a clearer statement of
what you're trying to accomplish I'm sure you'd get better
answers than mine.
