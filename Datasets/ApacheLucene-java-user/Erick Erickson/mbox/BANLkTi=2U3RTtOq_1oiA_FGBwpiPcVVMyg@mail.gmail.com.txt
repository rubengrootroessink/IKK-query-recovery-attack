Hmmm, then it's pretty hopeless I think. Problem is that
anything you say about running on a machine with
2G available memory on a single processor is completely
incomparable to running on a machine with 64G of
memory available for Lucene and 16 processors.

There's really no such thing as an "optimum" Lucene index
size, it always relates to the characteristics of the
underlying hardware.

I think the best you can do is actually test on various
configurations, then at least you can say "on configuration
X this is the tipping point".

Sorry there isn't a better answer that I know of, but...

Best
