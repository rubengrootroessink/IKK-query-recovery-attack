SUBJECT: Re: Query String for a phrase?
DATE: 11 Mar 2007

It depends upon your analyzer during both index and search operations.

WhitespaceAnalyzer would do nothing to your string, and
you'd have "jakarta&apache".

StandardAnalyzer would give you two terms, "jakarta" and "apache"
and at query time this would be either jakarta AND apache
or jakarta OR apache, depending on what the default operator is.

and phrase search is something else again. that is, a
PhraseQuery with the term "jakarta apache" would only match the
two words if they were right next to each other.

You'll get a lot more and better help if you tell us what analyzers
you're using <G>...
