When in doubt, WhitespaceAnalyzer is the most predictable. Note that
it doesn't lower-case the tokens though. Depending upon your
requirements, you can always pre-process your query and indexing
streams and do your own lowercasing and/or character stripping.

You can always create your own analyzer with the building blocks
provided via Filters and Tokenizers....
