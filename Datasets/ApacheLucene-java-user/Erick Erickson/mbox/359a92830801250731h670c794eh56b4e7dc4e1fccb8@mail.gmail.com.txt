Try this, where ir is an IndexReader. The trick is that starting with ""
gives
you the entire list......

Note that you'll go off the end of the field sometime.....

        TermEnum theTerms = ir.terms(new Term("field", ""));

        Term term = null;
        do {
            term = theTerms.term();

            if ((term == null) || ! term.field().equals("field")) {
                return;
            }
            list.add(term.text());
       } while (theTerms.next());
