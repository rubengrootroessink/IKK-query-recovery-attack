Were you setting the boosts at index or search time? From an old
e-mail from Chris H.

"index time field boosts are a way to express things like
"this documents title is worth twice as much as the title of
most documents" query time boosts are a way to express
"I care about matches on this clause of my query twice as
much as i do about matches to other clauses of my query".
