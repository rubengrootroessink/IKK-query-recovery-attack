SUBJECT: Re: best practices for reloading an index for a searcher
DATE: 6 Dec 2007

If by reload you mean closing and opening the reader, then yes. You need
to do this in order to see the changes since the *last* time you opened
the reader.

Think of it as the reader taking a snapshot of the index and using that
for its lifetime.

Be aware that opening a reader (and running the first searches) is an
expensive operation and shouldn't be done unnecessarily. I guess it
all depends upon your requirements for how soon changes are available
for search.

As for guidelines, to quote the famous wise ones.... it depends. The
real question is how quickly your users require seeing recent changes.

One technique for handling these updates is to periodically open a new
reader
*without* closing the old one. Fire a few warm-up queries at the new
searcher,
then close the old one and start using the new one. There are some
coordination issues here..... Also be aware that this will chew up some
disk space....

Hope this helps
Erick
