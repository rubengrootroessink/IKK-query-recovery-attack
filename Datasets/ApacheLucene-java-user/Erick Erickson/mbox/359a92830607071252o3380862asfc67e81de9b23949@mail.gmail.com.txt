 Did you use a Hits object to assemble your results? And is that what you're
measuring when you say it's slow? In other words, were you measuring the
time it took to execute the statement

Hits hits = searcher.search(query, new Sort("fullname"));

or the time it took to iterate over the Hits object and do something? If the
latter, your problem may really be the fact that the Hits object re-issues
the search every 100 retrievals or so (this has been discussed in the mail
archive...) and you'd get satisfactory performance by using a lower-level
interface HitCollector(?) TopDocs(?).

Otherwise, I haven't a clue, but you probably already realized that...

Best
