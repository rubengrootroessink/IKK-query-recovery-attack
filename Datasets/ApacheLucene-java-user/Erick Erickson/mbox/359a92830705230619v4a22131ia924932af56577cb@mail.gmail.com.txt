You may have to index things twice, once for searching and once
UN_TOKENIZED for display. Say you have a bunch of service names
you want to display
service one
service two
service three

If you use WhitespaceAnalyzer, TOKENIZED you index the tokens
service  (note, there are three of these)
one
two
three

and re-assembling them is a pain. If you used UN_TOKENIZED, you'd
add
service one
service two
service three

as exactly three terms.
Now, simply using TermEnum on that field will return your list. And you
won't
get duplicates even if you indexed "service one" twice.

Another possibility is to index a special document. Remember that not
all documents need to have the same fields. So, say you have a list of all
services. You could index a document with "extra_special_meta_field" that
contained a comma-delimited list of services, and just get *that* document
to
generate your list. A variant of this is to index the *same* field in your
extra-special doc, like
Document doc = new Document();
doc.add("special", "service one"...UN_TOKENIZED);
doc.add("special", "service two"... UN_TOKENIZED);


Now, once you have the document (perhaps do this at startup time), the
call Document.getValues("special") will return a list like
"service one"
"service two".

At least I'm pretty sure....

All this may be in left field, but I thought I'd mention it.
