SUBJECT: Re: query problem: grouping "with same field"
DATE: 6 Feb 2007

Isn't this just a field on your document and an AND in the query with the
websiteID in question? Or are you saying you want to group results by
multiple website IDs in a single query? As in

webid1
  resulta
  resultb
  resultc
webid2
  resulte
  resultf
  resultg

etc.

If the latter, search the archive for "facets", "faceted" and there are
extensive discussions that'll help a great deal.

Best
