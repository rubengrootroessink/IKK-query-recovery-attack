Sure, your tomcat instance is assigning some amount of memory
to the JVM that your searcher is running in. Of course, now you're
going to ask me now to increase that number... I have no idea but
I've seen this question multiple times in the mail archive,
so a search there or in the tomcat docs should let you know.

But 12 seconds is still a long time to wait for a search to complete.
Can you tell us more about your search?

For instance, are you opening a searcher for each request? That's bad.
Are you sorting? that can take a long time, but again the first one
will have a performance penalty as things are cached.

There are a number of tips here:
