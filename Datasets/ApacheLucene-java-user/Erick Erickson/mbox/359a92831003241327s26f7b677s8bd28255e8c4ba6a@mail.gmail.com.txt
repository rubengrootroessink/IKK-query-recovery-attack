I don't think so, but a quick way to check would be to look at your
index with a copy of Luke and see what the actual tokens are.

But I'm not sure it matters, I don't think you *can* make things work
out well; your query-time analysis will be...er...difficult. You only
get to specify one analyzer per field, should it tokenize or not? Or
are you going to programmatically use different analyzers depending
upon some conditions? What if you want some of your tokens
analyzed and some not *in the same query* (e.g. several
OR clauses)? Or are you manually building up a BooleanQuery that's
"interesting"?

I think this will be a maintenance nightmare.

Why on earth would you want to do this anyway? Perhaps if you
described your use case we could suggest a better alternative.
