Well, counting frequency isn't the best approach. For instance, if a field
has 1,000 terms and 10 occurrences of your target, is that a better match
than a field with 10 terms and 5 occurrences of your target?

This kind of thing is already taken into account with Lucene scoring, you
might
want to look at this:
