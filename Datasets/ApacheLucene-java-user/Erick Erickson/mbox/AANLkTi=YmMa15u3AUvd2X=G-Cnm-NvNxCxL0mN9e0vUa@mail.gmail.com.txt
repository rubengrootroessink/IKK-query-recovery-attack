Here's a great intro to the garbage collection options:

@Ganesh:
The issue with 64 bit isn't really performance, it's that you can't allocate
much of
your memory to the JVM. So by definition your performance will tank much
earlier
with a 32-bit JVM no matter what physical hardware you're running on because
you're constrained by how much of the physical memory you *can* use.
