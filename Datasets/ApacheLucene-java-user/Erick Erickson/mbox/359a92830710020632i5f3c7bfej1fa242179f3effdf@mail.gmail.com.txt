Here's a couple of fragments, alter to suit....
    public void doRemove(Directory dir) throws Exception
    {

      this.reader = IndexReader.open(dir);

        TermEnum theTerms = this.reader.terms(new Term("unique_field", ""));

        Term term = null;

        do {
            term = theTerms.term();

            if ((term == null) || ! term.field().equalsIgnoreCase("doc_id"))
{
                break;
            }

            if (theTerms.docFreq() > 1) {
                this.removeDupsForTerm(term);
            }
        } while (theTerms.next());
}


   private void removeDupsForTerm(Term term) throws Exception
    {
        TermDocs td = this.reader.termDocs(term);
        for ( int idx = 0; td.next(); ++idx) {
            if (idx > 0) {
                this.reader.deleteDocument(td.doc());
           }
        }
    }
