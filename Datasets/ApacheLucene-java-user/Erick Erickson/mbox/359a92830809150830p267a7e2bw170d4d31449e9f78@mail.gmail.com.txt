Filters aren't really specified per field. All they are is a bitmask, one
bit per *document*. You can construct the filter any way you want, in your
case by inspecting the date-time field and passing it along with your query.
You can even combine several fields into one filter by twiddling the bits
as appropriate.

At least that's the general case. In your case, don't you just want a
RangeFilter?
>From the API:

*RangeFilter<file:///C:/lucene-2.1.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/RangeFilter.html#RangeFilter%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20boolean,%20boolean%29>
*(String <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html>
fieldName,
String <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html> lowerTerm,
String <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html> upperTerm,
boolean includeLower, boolean includeUpper)

One other thing: Do you really need seconds? How about minutes? The
coarser your resolution, the better your performance. See also DateTools.
