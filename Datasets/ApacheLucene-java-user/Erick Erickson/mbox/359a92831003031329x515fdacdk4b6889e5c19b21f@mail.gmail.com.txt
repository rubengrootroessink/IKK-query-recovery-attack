NOT_ANALYZED is probably not what you want.
NOT_ANALYZED stores the entire input as
a *single* token, so you can never match on
anything except the entire input.

What did you hope to accomplish by indexint
NOT_ANALYZED? That's actually a pretty
specialized thing to do, perhaps there's a better
way to accomplish your goal.
