Well, it's hard to say what "correctly" would be. Remove all
XML? Preserve attributes? Preserve tags? Put the attributes
and values into fields in the document? My point is that there's
no obviously "correct" parsing.

But if you just want to strip out all the <....>, it seems like
PatternTokenizer might work for you...
