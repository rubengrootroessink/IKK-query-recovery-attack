SUBJECT: Re: Issue while parsing XML files due to control characters, help appreciated.
DATE: 18 Mar 2007

Grant:

I think that "Parsing 70 files totally takes 80 minutes" really
means parsing 70 metadata files containing 10,000 XML
files each.....

Lokeya:
Can you confirm my supposition? And I'd still post the code
Grant requested if you can.....

So, you're talking about indexing 10,000 xml files in 2-3 hours,
8 minutes or so which is spent reading/parsing, right? It'll be
important to know how much data you're indexing and now, so
the code snippet is doubly important....
