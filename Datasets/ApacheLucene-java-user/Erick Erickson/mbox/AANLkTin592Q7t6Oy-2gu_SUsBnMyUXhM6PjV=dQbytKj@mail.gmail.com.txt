SUBJECT: Re: Retrieving payload attribute in highlighter
DATE: 30 Nov 2010

Warning, ignorance alert. I'm not all that up on the guts of this one.

But take a look at MemoryIndex, there's an example there. The gist
is that you create a MemoryIndex on the fly and index the doc in question
into it, then you can get the IndexReader from the IndexSearcher associated
with the MemoryIndex. All this is similar to how Highlighter works, and it
looks like you have access to the original input?

Now, this is largely a guess, so don't waste time if I'm really off base
with
this.

Best
