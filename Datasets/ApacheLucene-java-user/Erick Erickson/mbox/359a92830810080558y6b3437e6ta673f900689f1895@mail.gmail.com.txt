Kalani:

You are mistaken to think this is not possible. In fact
it is explicitly supported, and I've done it in many
situations. These two are entirely identical if you
use an analyzer that breaks the stream up on
words.

doc = new Document()
doc.add("myfield", "some text", blah blah)
doc.add("myfield", "here is more text", blah blah)
indexwriter.addDocument(doc)


and


doc = new Document()
doc.add("myfield", "some text here is more text", blah blah)
indexwriter.addDocument(doc)


except for a rather technical issue that if your PositionIncrementGap is
greater than one (say 10), the first form will have the token "here"
at offset 12  and the second form will have the token "here" at offset 2.
Which is useful and why the PositionIncrementGap is there in
the first place.

Note that they would probably not be identical with, say KeywordAnalyzer
though.

Which you can easily check yourself with Luke....

Best
Erick
