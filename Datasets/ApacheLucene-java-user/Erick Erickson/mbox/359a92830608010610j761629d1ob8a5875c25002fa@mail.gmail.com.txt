DATE: 1 Aug 2006

I can't speak to performance, but there's no problem having different fields
for different documents. Stated differently, you don't need to have all
fields in all documents. It took me a while to get my head out of database
tables and accept this <G>....

I doubt there's a problem with speed, but as always some measurements over
your particular data count most.....
