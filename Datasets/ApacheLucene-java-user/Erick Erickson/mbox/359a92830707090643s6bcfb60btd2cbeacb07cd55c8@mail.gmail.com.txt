Well, first you never test anything that will break the loop. TermDocs.next
()
does not set termdocs == null, but returns false....


I've always found it a bit confusing that calling next() doesn't skiph the
first term, but you want something like this....

        Term term = new Term(field, value);
        TermDocs termDocs = reader.termDocs(term);

        while (termDocs.next()) {
            System.out.println("Document num:" + termDocs.doc());
        }
