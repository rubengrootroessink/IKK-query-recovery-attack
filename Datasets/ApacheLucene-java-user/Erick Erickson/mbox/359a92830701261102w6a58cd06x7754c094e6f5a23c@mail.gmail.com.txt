SUBJECT: Re: Is the new version of the Lucene book available in any form?
DATE: 26 Jan 2007

The current LIA book, while written to the 1.4 code base is a very good
place to start. There will be some incompatibilities with the 2.0 codebase,
but they're relatively minor.

I guess I'm really recommending that you go ahead and spend the bucks on the
current version, it'll be money well spent if you can't get an updated
version promptly.

Haven't a clue about the other Lucene ports.
