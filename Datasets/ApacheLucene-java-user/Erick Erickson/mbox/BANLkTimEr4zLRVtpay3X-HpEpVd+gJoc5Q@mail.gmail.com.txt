Hmmm, I'm not going to even try to talk about the code itself, but I will add
a couple of clarifications:

Jetty has nothing to do with it. It's in Lucene, and it's used for sorting and
sometimes faceting. The cache is associated with a reader on a machine
used to search. When replication happens, that searcher should be closed
and any data associated with the cache is returned to the system.

Someone else will have to chime in on the underlying details <G>..

By the way, what version of Solr are you using? Because the memory
requirements for string sorting and faceting have been drastically
reduced on the trunk version. In a really rough test I've seen 75%
reductions in memory requirements (note I was doing the worst things
I could think of, so I don't necessarily expect your results to be as
drastic).

Best
Erick
