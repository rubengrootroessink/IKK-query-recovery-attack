This might help you understand Lucene scoring better...

 http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/scoring.html

The number of occurrences is not the sole determinant of a
document's score and boosting won't change that.

But I have to ask why counting words is important to you. What problem
are you trying to solve that requires that a document with a word
occurring, say, 5 times in 10,000 tokens should rank higher than a
document where that word occurs twice in 10 tokens?
