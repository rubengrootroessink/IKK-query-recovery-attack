I guess I don't see what the problem is. These look to me like
standard Lucene query syntax options. If I'm off base here,
let me know.

If you're building your own BooleanQuery,
you can add these as sub-clauses

Here's the Lucene query syntax:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_1/queryparsersyntax.html

See below
