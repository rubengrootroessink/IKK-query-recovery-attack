I'm not sure what *could* be easier than looping with IndexSearcher.doc(),
looping from 1 to maxDoc. Of course you'll have to pay some attention to
whether you get a document back or not, and I'm not quite sure whether you'd
have to worry about getting deleted documents. But I don't think either of
these
really count if the index was optimized
