SUBJECT: Re: Leading wildcard query
DATE: 28 Jul 2006

You could form a filter, using the WildCardTermEnum or RegExTermEnum and
then use the filter with a ConstantScoreQuery. You lose relevancy, but
relevancy is an ambiguous concept with wildcards anyway.

Using the query parser with a leading wildcard, even if enabled, is almost
sure to give you a "TooManyClauses" exception unless your index is very,
very, very small. There's a thread I started on the list titled "I just
don't get wildcards at all" in which the guys generously gave me a tutorial
in what wildcards are all about. I suspect you'd find it interesting.....
You might also want to search the archive for any TooManyClauses since this
has been discussed several times.....
