Look at PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper. It allows you to use different
analyzers on different fields during the query parsing phase.

But I wouldn't go there if you don't have to. I suspect you'll spend a
LOT of time tracking down errors in your use of a mixed case index.
If for no other reason than your users will use the "wrong" case.

Unless your index is huge (and I don't consider, say, 8G huge), I'd
index everything in, say, lower case. And ditto for your query
parsing.

If you need to return data to the user in mixed case, then you can
*store* (but perhaps not *index*) the display fields. So you search
on one field and return data from another.

Best
