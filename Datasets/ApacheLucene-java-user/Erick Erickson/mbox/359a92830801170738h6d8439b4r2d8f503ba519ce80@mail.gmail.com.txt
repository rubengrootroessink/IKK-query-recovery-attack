SUBJECT: Re: constructing query from string
DATE: 17 Jan 2008

I just thought of an interesting test for whether
toString() is reasonable. You could log/flag
when the reloaded query differs. I.e.
String queryFromToString;  // your stored form
Query newQ = parser.parse(queryFromToString);
if (newQ.toString != queryFromToString) {
  log some stuff or throw an exception or....
}

That'd provide you a reality check...
