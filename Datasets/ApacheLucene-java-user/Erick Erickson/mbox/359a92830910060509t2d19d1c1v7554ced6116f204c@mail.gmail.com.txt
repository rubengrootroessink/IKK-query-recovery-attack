Why do you care? That is, what is the problem you want to solve with a
reversestemmer? Note that if you STORE the field, the *original* text is
available, storing
and indexing are orthogonal. So if all you want is to get the original text
back,
you can freely index with a stemming analyzer, but just fetch the stored
data back and it won't be stemmed....
