It's not so much a matter of problems with indexing/searching
as it is with search behavior. The reason these strategies
are implemented is that using English stemming, say, on
other languages will produce "interesting" results.

There's no a-priori reason you can't index multiple languages
in the same field.

So I don't see what you would accomplish by using payloads
to indicate which language the term is in. Could you expand
a bit on what you're trying to accomplish here? Maybe there
are better solutions....
