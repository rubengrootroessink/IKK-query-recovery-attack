SUBJECT: Re: NOT_ANALYSED_NO_NORMS should get max field length boost
DATE: 12 Jan 2010

Are you saying that you index the *same* field differently in different
documents? Or do you index the field in question in the same way in
all documents?

I ask because I'm having a hard time following the logic here. A
field that is NOT analyzed is an all-or-none match, i.e.
looking for "paul" in an unanalyzed field "paul taylor" will
not match, so boosting is pretty irrelevant on that field.

If you're analyzing the same field for some documents and not
analyzing it for other documents, I don't know what happens, but
it's probably bad.

Could you boost your *other* fields by less than one to achieve
the same end?

If none of this is relevant, could you explain your use case a little
more?
