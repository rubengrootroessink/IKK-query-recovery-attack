SUBJECT: Re: When to use which Analyzer
DATE: 13 Jan 2008

I'm pretty sure that UN_TOKENIZED really bypasses analysis
entirely. so yes, it's a little confusing that you can specify an
analyzer but then pass a flag that says, in effect, "ignore the
analyzer I *said* I wanted to use".

So, in your example, you *are* running your query through
SimpleAnalyzer, but your text is NOT getting run
through the analyzer when it's indexed.

Luke is invaluable for seeing the effect of different analyzers.

The caution to use the same analyzer at index and query time is,
in my experience, simply good advice to follow until you are
familiar enough with how Lucene uses analyzers to keep from
getting really, really, really confused. Once you understand
when analyzers are used and how they effect the token
stream, you can use different ones when analyzing as opposed
to searching. But I've rarely found that I *wanted* to do that....
