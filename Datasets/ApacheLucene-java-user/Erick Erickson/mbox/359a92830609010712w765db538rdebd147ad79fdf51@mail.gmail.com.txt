DATE: 1 Sep 2006

OK, a not very helpful answer, but "of course they're slower, they do more
work" (the span versions). But that's fairly useless, since the question is
really "is it enough slower in my situation that I need to find an
alternative?". And the only way I know of to answer that question is to make
some tests with the data representing my particular problem......

Sorry I can't be more help....
