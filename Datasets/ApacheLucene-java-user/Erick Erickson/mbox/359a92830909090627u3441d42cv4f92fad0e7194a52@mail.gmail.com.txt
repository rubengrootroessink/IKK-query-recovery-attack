It's all in the analyzers. Depending upon which analyzer you use manythings
happen to the input stream. Casing is one example, but that's just
the simplest. Which is why it's so important to use the same analyzer
when indexing and querying unless you have a *very* good reason not to.

I'd really advise looking at the Analyzer docs to see what transformations
they make. You'll see they're composed of Filters that perform various
transformations..
