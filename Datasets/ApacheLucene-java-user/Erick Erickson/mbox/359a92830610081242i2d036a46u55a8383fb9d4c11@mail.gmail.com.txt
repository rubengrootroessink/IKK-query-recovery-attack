How are you breaking up your query? That is, what analyzer are you using for
query parsing? Or are you building your own query programmatically?

Also, what about capitalization? Some of the analyzers automatically
lower-case the terms, either at index time or query time (or both). If
there's a mis-match, you get "strange" results.

I suspect what's happening is that your analyzers (either at index time,
query time or both) aren't behaving as you assume. I've gotten the most
intuitive results, when starting out, using WhitespaceAnalyzer. Once you're
comfortable with that analyzer, then think about the more complex ones.

And just to make it more confusing, if I understand correctly, when you
index UN_TOKENIZED, it doesn't matter what analyzer you use, it's ignored. I
might be wrong about this one though.....

I recommend downloading luke (google lucene luke). It'll let you look at
your index, and have queries parsed by various analyzers (and also explain
how the query is interpreted). It'll answer many, many, many questions for
you about "what really happened".
