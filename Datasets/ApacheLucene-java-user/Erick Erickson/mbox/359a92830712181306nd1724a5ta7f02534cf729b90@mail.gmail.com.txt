This will, indeed, NOT remove stop words. If that is all you need, you're
done.

But you will now have useless words in your index like the, is, etc. Making
your own analyzer by subclassing a suitable existing analyzer, or composing
one
will fix you right up if having the extra words in your index turns out not
to
be OK.

And it shouldn't change your indexing speed noticeably.
