Your confusion here, I think, is that you CAN search on an unstored field.
Consider a book. I want to show the user the titles of the most-relevant
books. If I store the text of the entire book, it bloats the size of the
index markedly. So, I index the text but do NOT store it. Now I can show my
titles in relevancy order (when searched over the entire text), but don't
have to pay the penalty size-wise. What I can't do in this case is
reconstruct the book from the index because I didn't store the text. But I
can search it, which is what my app requires.


Basically I'm not sure the points of UnIndexed and UnStored fields types.

You'd search on what you *have* indexed, get the doc (from the index), and
then read the field. Something like

String s = Hits.doc(52).get("SSN");

I'm doing this now since we have images stored with internal IDs on a
separate file system. I *never* care to allow the user to search by our
internal ID number. So I index the caption, and STORE but do not INDEX the
internal ID. We provide a page full of links (in relevancy order) and when
the user clicks on one, use the stored internal ID to fetch the right image.


As for the unstored, its like the scenario I described above... I see the

Again, you can search unstored fields. You just can't reconstruct the input
with 100% fidelity (things like stop words will be missing, and any funky
games you played during indexing will mess up an attempt to reconstruct the
data).

Hope this helps.
