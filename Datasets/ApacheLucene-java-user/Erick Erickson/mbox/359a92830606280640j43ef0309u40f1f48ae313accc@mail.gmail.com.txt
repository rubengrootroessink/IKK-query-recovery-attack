Kind of a tangential response, but there was a discussion a while back about
RAMdir .vs. FSDir that you probably want to search for and look over. As I
remember (and I only glanced at it) the statement was made that the FSDir
*is* a RAMdir, at least for a while. This implies that there es little to be
gained by what you are doing. Here's a quote from Yonik

"For indexing, even if you open IndexWriter with a FSDirectory, it
internally uses RAMDirectory to buffer until it reaches
maxBufferedDocs."

See the thread IndexWriter.addIndexes & optimization

Of course I don't fully understand your problem space, so your judgement has
to control. But do you have any metrics indicating that what you are doing
actually helps?
