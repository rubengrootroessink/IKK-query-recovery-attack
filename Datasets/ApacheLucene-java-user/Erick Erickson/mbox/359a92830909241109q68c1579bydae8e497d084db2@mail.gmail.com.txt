First, really think about getting a copy of Luke to help you investigate
what'sactually in your index, it's invaluable. It'll also let you try
running queries
through different analyzers and seeing the results.

But I think you're a bit fuzzy on what analyzers do. Their primary purpose
is to break the incoming stream up into *tokens*. By indexing
untokenized, you're bypassing processing by the analyzers. Further,
when indexing and searching with *different* analyzers, all hell breaks
loose unless you know *exactly* what you're doing <G>...

Lucene isn't "replacing the / with a space". Instead, StandardAnalyzer
treats most non-alphanum characters as delimiters, so what's happening
on search is cat/test is being broken up into "cat" and "test" as
separate tokens. The '/' is just completely lost.

Try this (sorry, I haven't got a handy test bed at the moment, so this is
from very rusty memory). Index and search with WhitespaceAnalyzer
(watch out, this will be case sensitive but that can be fixed pretty
easily). And index things tokenized, then try your searches.


KeywordAnalyzer is deliberately stupid. It's intended for fields that should
not be altered in any way. Besides, you're searching with one analyzer
and indexing with another I think. See the caution above.
