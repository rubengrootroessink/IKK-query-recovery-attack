Not really. WildcardTermEnum is actually MUCH less costly than
a search. Imagine a list that contains every term in the index, already
ordered lexically. A *trailing* wildcard character is really a prefix,
right?
So all that's really happening is something (and I've never looked at the
code, so beware <G>)

get the index of the first matching term.
starting with that index, increment until the term you find doesn't have
that prefix.

That's it. Way, way, way different than queries which find *all* the
terms that could possibly match your prefix. Find *all* the documents
that have *any* of those terms. Calculate the relevancy scores.
Optionally sort them.

But try it. In fact, try enumerating all the terms for a given prefix
and take some timings. I think you'll be impressed how fast it
is and you can lay your fears to rest.


Sounds pertty good?
