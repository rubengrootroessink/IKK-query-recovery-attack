There are several issues here....
1> How are you getting the entity reference? You must be encoding
the stream (or getting it encoded for you). So the first thing I'd do
is un-encode it.
2> After that, it's a question of what Filters/Analyzers you're using.
Take a look at ISOLatin1AccentFilter. I'm unclear whether it "closes up" the
case you're looking at, so be sure to check.
3> Since my peculiar situation can't use the Filter (the character
set I'm using isn't standard), I've pre-processed the input (both at
index and query time) to substitute the empty string for the
apostrophe

Hope this helps
