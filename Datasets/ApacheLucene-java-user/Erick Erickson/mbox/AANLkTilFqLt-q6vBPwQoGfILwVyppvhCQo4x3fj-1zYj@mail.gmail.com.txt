SUBJECT: Re: How to get the number of unique terms in the inverted index
DATE: 27 May 2010

I suspect it's not supported because it hasn't been seen
as valuable enough to put the effort into. You simply asked
if it was supported without any use-case, and I'm having a
hard time coming up with one on my own.....

If it's important to your particular situation, you could
have a special document in your index that contained these
values, with fields orthogonal to all fields in all other docs and
compute this at index time. Lookup would then be easy....

Best
Erick
