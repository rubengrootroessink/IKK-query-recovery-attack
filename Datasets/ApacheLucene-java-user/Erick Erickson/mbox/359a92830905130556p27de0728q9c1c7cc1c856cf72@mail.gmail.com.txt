I'd recommend you get a copy of Luke and examine what's actually in
your index when anomalous things happen. In your first post you didn't
specify what analyzer you used, I suspect you weren't getting the tokens
broken up as you expected. Luke would have shown you.....

But if you're satisfied with the results you're getting now, so much the
better.
