DATE: 18 Apr 2009

Lucene is an *engine*, not an application. *You* have to process the
XML, decide what the structure of your index is and index the data. There
are many
XML parser options, this is just straight Java code. You'll decide
what's relevant, and add the contents of the relevant elements to a Lucene
document
then add that to your index.

Similarly for searching.

So, say you have the following simple XML doc
<root>
   <ele1>ele 1 text</ele1>
   <ele2>ele 2 text</ele2>
</root>

You'd have to parse that text, then, say, add (semi-pseudo-code)
Document doc = new Document()
doc.add(new Field("ele1field", "ele 1 text", StoreOPtion, IndexOption);
doc.add(new Field("ele2field", "ele 2 text", StoreOption, IndexOption);
writer.add(doc);

Then at search time you'd form your queries on "ele1field" and ele2field".
