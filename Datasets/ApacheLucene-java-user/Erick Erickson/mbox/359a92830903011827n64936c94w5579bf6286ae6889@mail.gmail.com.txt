SUBJECT: Re: queryNorm affect on score
DATE: 2 Mar 2009

FWIW, Hossman pointed out that the difference between index and
query time boosts is that index time boosts on title, for instance,
express "I care about this document's title more than other documents'
titles [when it matches]" Query time boosts express "I care about matches
on the title field more than matches on other fields".
