You'll get more meaningful answers if you provide some details:
Things that come to mind:

op system (windows? *nix?)

file system (NFS? local? NTFS?)

An example of the error you receive (a stack trace would be good).

The code you're executing when you get the error.

Imagine you're trying to advise someone else and think about
what you'd find useful and try to provide that, please.

Best
