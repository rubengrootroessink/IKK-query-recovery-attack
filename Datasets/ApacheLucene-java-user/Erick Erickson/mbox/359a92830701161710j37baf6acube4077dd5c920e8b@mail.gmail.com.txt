What analyzer are you using when you *index*? Just as the analyzer you use
when you query breaks up the query string, the analyzer you use when you
index breaks up the indexing stream. You can easily get unexpected results
when you use one analyzer for indexing and another for parsing your query.

I'd recommend a couple of things.

1> just use the StandardAnalyzer first. When you start getting expected
results, substitute in your custom analyzer. That way you can deal with one
new thing at a time.

2> get a copy of Luke (google lucene luke). It lets you examine your index
and see if the things you *think* are in the index actually *are*. It also
lets you submit queries using various analyzers and see what is produced for
queries. I don't know if you can plug in your own custom one though....

Whenever I have this kind of problem, it almost always turns out to be an
issue with analyzers not doing what I *think* they're doing, or using the
wrong analyzer when indexing or searching or.....

By the way, you can easily use different analyzers on different fields, See
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper.

Finally, the Snowball analyzer also does stemming, and I'd always prefer a
stock analyzer to a custom one if it does what I want. You might want to
take a look at it if you haven't already.....

Hope this helps!
