There is no *lucene* limitation of a 2GB index file. I've had no trouble
with single indexes over 8G. If you're referring to this page...
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ?highlight=%282gb%29

then it's talking about an *operating system* limitation. So I wouldn't
worry about this unless your op system is a problem. What are you
running on?
