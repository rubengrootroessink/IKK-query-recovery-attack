Well, you have to do some extra work for page matching. If you search the
user list
you'll find significant discussions of paging. The short form is that you
have to
either index the entire document and record the start and/or end offset for
each page
(I'd put the results in a separate field in the document). There are various
forms of queries that give you match positions and you can look at the
stored
field with page offsets to find the page.

The other possibility is to index each page as a separate document, but this
solution suffers from the problem of matching, say, phrases that start on
one
page and end on the next.
