DATE: 11 Jan 2007

To answer questions like "what really happens" in terms of a lucene query,
I've been helped greatly by two things...

query.toString();

and Luke.

Of the two, luke (google lucene luke) is quickest. It will show you what
lucene request is produced by various query strings etc.

Sorry if you already know about them...

Best
