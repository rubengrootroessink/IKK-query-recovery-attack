SUBJECT: Re: scalability limit in terms of numbers of large documents
DATE: 14 Aug 2010

As asked, that's really an unanswerable question. The math is pretty easy
in terms of running out of document IDs, but "searched quickly" depends
on too many variables.

I suspect, though, that long before you ran out of document IDs, you'd need
to shard your index, Have you looked at SOLR?
