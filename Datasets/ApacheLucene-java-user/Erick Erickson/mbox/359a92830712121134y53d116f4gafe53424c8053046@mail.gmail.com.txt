SUBJECT: Re: Searching on plurals and phrases in a single field
DATE: 12 Dec 2007

I faced a very similar requirement and solved it by indexing multiple
tokens at the same place. For instance, say you're indexing
the word "foxes". Index something like fox$ and foxes at the same
position (see SynonymAnalyzer in Lucene In Action for an example).
You probably MUST index the multiple terms with an increment gap
of 0 (more later).

Example phrase "red foxes are plentiful"

Now you have the capability of distinguishing between a stemmed
and unstemmed version of the word and can search for exactly
"red foxes". But if instead you want to search for the stemmed
version, you can search for "red fox$". But "red fox" will NOT match.

The reason you need to index these with an increment gap of 0 is so
phrase queries work. If you let the gap increment for each token, and
indexed a phrase like "red foxes are plentiful", then did a
proximity search on "red plentiful"~2, it would fail because
you'd have fox$ and foxes each taking up one position. But if
fox$ and foxes both have the same position, it'll work.

And it's all in the same index, one field, etc.

Hope this helps
