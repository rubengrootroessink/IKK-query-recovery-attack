SUBJECT: Re: how can I merge indexes without deleting the original index?

OK, that makes sense. Note that Shashi's solution and mine are essentially
identical.
Shashi's code snippet, I think, pre-supposes that source and dest index
directories are
different. So copying your A/D index off some place else is functionally
equivalent.

I'm not sure what would happen if you had two separately constructed indexes
in the
same directory and then opened that dir....
