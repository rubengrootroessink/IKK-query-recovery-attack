Do you have a reasonable expectation that performance is going
to be a problem? The reason I ask is that I'm always suspicious
of efficiency arguments when "things are working fine". Unless and
until you can confidently predict that you're going to hit a
performance issue, do it the easiest way possible.

The same goes for space. Who cares if your data takes
up a Gig of extra space by storing things twice? Of course you
*do* care if you take up an extra 100G of space.

It's hard to make recommendations that mean anything
unless you fill in some of the space/time details you have/
expect to have, because the answer varies depending
upon what you need/expect.
