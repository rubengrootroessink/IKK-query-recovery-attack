Sure, just use a field that is not analyzed. Perhaps you want to
define a new field in your documents like "nameKey" that is
analyzed with something like KeywordAnalyzer. See:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/api/all/index.html

PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper will let you use different
analyzers for different fields.

I don't delete any of them. The problem is that the only difference between them is a name.
So it looks like this:
