SUBJECT: Re: Removing duplicate entries
DATE: 29 Apr 2008

The first question is what do you mean the document
is already in the index? Lucene doc IDs are useless
here since the ones in your FSDir and the ones in your
RAMdir are unrelated. In fact, I suspect that the
lucene docIDs will start at the same number in both.

Lucene doc IDs are just monotonically incremented integers.

So, how do you identify identical documents? Is there some
field in your document that's guaranteed to be unique to each
document? If so, *that's* the field you can use for termEnum
to get the Lucene docid to remove, assuming you've indexed
it UN_TOKENIZED or you are very, very, very confident that
your tokenizers won't break it up.

But you can make this easier by using IndexReader.deleteDocument(term)
where the term is your unique field.

Additionally, I question why you bother with a RAMdir for your changes.
An index reader essentially takes a snapshot of your index, and
subsequent changes are not seen by your searchers until you
close and reopen the underlying reader. What advantage do you
see in using a RAMdir?
