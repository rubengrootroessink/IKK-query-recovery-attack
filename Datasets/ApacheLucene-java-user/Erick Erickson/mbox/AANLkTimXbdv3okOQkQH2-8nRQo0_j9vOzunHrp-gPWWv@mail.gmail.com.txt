SUBJECT: Re: sort field should not be tokenized?
DATE: 9 Jun 2010

Consider analyzing on whitespace, without
removing stopwords for the input "the fox is in
his den". You'd have the terms:
the
fox
is
in
his
den

What does it mean to sort on this field? Which term
should be used?

What if you remove stopwords? What about casing?
Or any of a myriad of other possible things you'd to
with an analyzer.

So the behavior *can* work if you sort on a tokenized
field, but it'll be "interesting". If you happen to have
a field that only tokenizes to single terms, you'll
probably get expected results, but it'll be pretty
fragile..
