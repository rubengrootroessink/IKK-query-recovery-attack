That depends (tm Erik Hatcher) <G>. The problem with such an open-ended
question is that there are so many unique variables that it's impossible to
answer in any meaningful way. For instance....

How much work is it to parse the log files?
What kind if hardware are you using?
Are you accessing things over a network? Is there network latency involved?
Can you index various parts in parallel?
How many document are we talking about? You've given no data on whether you
expect 100 document or 1,000,000,000,000,000 documents?
How fast is the data being added to your syslogs?
and on and on and on.

All you can do is set up a test to see. It shouldn't be very hard to, say,
create a small program that randomizes input and push it through the
indexing process and measure.

Erick
