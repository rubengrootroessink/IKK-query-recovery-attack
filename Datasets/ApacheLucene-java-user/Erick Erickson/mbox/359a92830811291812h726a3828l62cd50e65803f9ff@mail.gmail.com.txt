I'm not entirely clear what you're trying to accomplish, but there's
a bunch of options.

You could just index the phrases as normal text, possibly with
positionincrementgaps (assuming more than one phrase is
possible in a field in a document). Then you could use SpanQuerys
to accomplish the "simple" form (choosing suitable increment
gaps and suitable distances on your span queries would insure that
hits wouldn't span phrases). You could then use regular queries
to accomplish the non-simple queries as they're pretty much unaffected
by increment gaps.

If that's total gibberish, perhaps a more complete example would allow
a clearer response.
