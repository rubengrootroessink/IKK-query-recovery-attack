Sure, but it's probably not what you want to do. You can use a
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper to analyze different fields with
different analyzers. So your category field could be both
indexed and analyzed with, say, WhitespaceAnalyzer or some
such.

Or, as testn suggests, store it UN_TOKENIZED.

Each has its tradeoffs....
