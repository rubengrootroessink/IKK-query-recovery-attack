Check query.toString(), but I think the problem is that Lucene is
looking for a single term (word?) that starts with "pretty" and ends
with "car". So this should match "prettynicecar" but not
"pretty nice car" since the latter is split into separate tokens.

If you're concerned only with whole-word terms, you can think about
phrase queries with an appropriate slop. Beware, phrase queries
aren't tokenized, so the following phrase query wouldn't do what
you want "pret* car"~5 if you submit it *with* the quotes.

You could also use SpanQuery, but again that would be
easier if you're only concerned with whole words.

Building up a wildcard query with pretty* car should work too.
