No, absolutely not. Lucene identifies documents by document ID. All the
documents in your secondary index will get unique Lucene IDs and
Lucene will NOT remove any documents from your original index.

Lucene has no concept of "document identity" in that you can index
the same document 15 times in a row and Lucene will have 15 entries.

"transaction" is really not a Lucene concept. What kind of behavior are
you really looking for here?


Thanks for the help!
