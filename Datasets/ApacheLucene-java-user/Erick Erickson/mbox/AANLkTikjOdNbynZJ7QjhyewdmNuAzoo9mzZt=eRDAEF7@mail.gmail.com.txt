SUBJECT: Re: Get fields from a Query object
DATE: 2 Aug 2010

Did you look at Query.extractTerms? I think that'll work for you.
Note that the query must be rewritten, and that the set of terms will
have duplicate fields. i.e. if you search field1:Erick +field1:James
I expect you'll have two terms in the set that are on field1.
