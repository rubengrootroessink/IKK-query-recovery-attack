Just add another document (I do something similar). The key is to remember
that documents in the same index do NOT have to have the same fields. So,
say for your "regular" documents, you have fields (f1, f2, f3, f4). For your
meta-data document, you index fields (md1, md2, md3...). The value for one
of these fields should be a known value (note, the value is completely
bogus, just so you remember it). Say index a value of "1" for md1 in your
meta-data document.

Now, to get your meta-data document, do a simple search on your known value
(e.g. md1="1") and read the rest of the document in whatever form is most
convenient. You can stuff anything you want in there, however you want. You
could index one field for everything you care about, or put it in a glob
that you parse. It's completely up to you.

The beauty of this is that, if you want to change your meta-data, all you
have to do is delete your meta-data doc and re-add it with new values, you
don't have to regenerate your index. And since your fields are orthogonal,
there's no danger of getting your meta-data doc as part of your regular
search.

One word of warning. Do NOT depend on the internal Lucene doc IDs (e.g.
reader.doc(idx)) being consistent. These internal numbers are not guaranteed
to be the same across an index optimize.

Hope this helps
Erick
