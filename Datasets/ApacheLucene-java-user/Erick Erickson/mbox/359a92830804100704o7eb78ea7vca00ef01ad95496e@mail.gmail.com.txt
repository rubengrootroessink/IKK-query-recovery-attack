SUBJECT: Re: Use of Lucene for DB Search
DATE: 10 Apr 2008

As always, "It depends". What is it you really want to do? Lucene excels at
searching text, NOT at doing RDBM sorts of operations. So if you have large
amounts of text in columns in your DB, you can certainly put them in a
Lucene index and search. But as soon as you find yourself trying to make
Lucene to a join, you should re-think your approach, possibly flattening
your data.

That said, search the archive for anything written by Marcelo Ochoa. He's
written quite a bit about embedding Lucene in Oracle (as I remember). I
confess that I don't really understand what he's doing as it doesn't apply
to problems I face, but it sure looked interesting and may apply to your
problem.

Here's a copy of his latest e-mail that was quite recent that should get
you started...

Hi all:
 I just released a new version of Oracle-Lucene integration
implemented as a Domain Index.
 Binary distribution have a very straightforward installation and
testing step, downloads are at SF.net web site:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56183&package_id=255524&release_id=589900
 Updated documentation is available as Google Document at:
http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddgw7sjp_54fgj9kg
 Source is available with public CVS access at:
http://dbprism.cvs.sourceforge.net/dbprism/ojvm/
 As consequence of reading many mails with feedback and development
tips from this list this new version have a lot performance
improvement by using a rowid<->lucene doc id cache, usage of
LoadFirstFieldSelector class to prevent Lucene from loading a complete
doc if only we need the rowid.
 Many thanks to all for sharing the experience.
 A complete list of changes is at:
http://dbprism.cvs.sourceforge.net/dbprism/ojvm/ChangeLog.txt?revision=1.3&view=markup
 Best regards, Marcelo.

PD: I have a plan to a make a new version of Oracle-Lucene integration
synchronized with Lucene 2.3.1 ASAP.
