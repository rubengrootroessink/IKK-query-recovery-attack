Well, anything's possible <G>.

There's nothing magic about Lucene and its interaction with, say, a PDF
document. What you put into the index is all you can get out. So..

You could index the PDF document by pages. That is, each page is a lucene
"document", related by some ID (NOT the lucene doc_id, since that can
change).

You could index the document and give the first term of each page a large
positionincrementgap and reconstruct the page data.

You could index meta-data in a field of the document giving the term offsets
of each page start and reconstruct which page it came from.

You could insert a special token at the beginning of each page. You'd have
to count to get the page.

and on and on. The take-away here is that Lucene is a search *engine*, not a
package. You have to carefully construct your application around Lucene to
get this kind of meta-data out of it...

That said, there might already be a contribution and/or package out there
that does much of this for you, but I'm unaware of any...

Hope this helps at least a little
Erick
