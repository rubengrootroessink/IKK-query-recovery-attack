It's often a mistake to try to force Lucene to act like a database. Is it
possible to just use the database for the join portion and Lucene
for the text search?

Otherwise I agree with Developer Developer. You need to provide
a higher level idea of *what* it is you're trying to accomplish to get
good suggestions.
