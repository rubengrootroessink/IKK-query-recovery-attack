What analyzer are you using to index? And is it a different analyzer
when indexing as opposed to searching?

Get a copy of Luke and look in your index to see what is
*actually* indexed. At that point, you can start worrying about
how the query is parsed. Until you know what's in your index,
you're flying blind.
