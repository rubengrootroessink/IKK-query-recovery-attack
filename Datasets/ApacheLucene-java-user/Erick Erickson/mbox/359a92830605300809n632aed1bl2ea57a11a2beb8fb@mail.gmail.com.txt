How did you store the data when you indexed it? If you didn't store it, it
won't be available for retrieval (although it will be available for
searching if you indexed it with, say Field.Index.TOKENIZED). See
Field.Store.YES.

These are for the Document.add call.

P.S. It would be better if you started a new thread when asking a question
unrelated to the current thread.
