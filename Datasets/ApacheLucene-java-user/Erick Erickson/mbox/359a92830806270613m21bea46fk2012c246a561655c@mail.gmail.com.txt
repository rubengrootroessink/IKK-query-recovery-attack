SUBJECT: Re: Does Lucene Java 2.3.2 supports parsing of Microsoft office 2007 documents...
DATE: 27 Jun 2008

Lucene doesn't actually support any of the document types. What happens
is that some program is used to parse the files into an indexable stream
and that stream is indexed. That used to be POI in the old days.

I confess I haven't used the latest demo, but I assume that under the
covers there's some program installed that Microsoft documents are
pushed through to get indexable tokens. So the real question is
whether that program handles the documents you're interested in.

I know this isn't very helpful, but you'll have to dig into this in some
detail if you really want to index Microsoft documents. If you don't
need to, then you don't need to waste time on this issue.
