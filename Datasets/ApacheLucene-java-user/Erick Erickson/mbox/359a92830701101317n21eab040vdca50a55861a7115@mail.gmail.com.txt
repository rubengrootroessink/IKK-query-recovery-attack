I'm pretty sure you can search UN_TOKENIZED fields, just be sure the
analyzers you use for querying don't break your query input up.... The
javadoc implies so (for the Sort class...)

**************
he fields used to determine sort order must be carefully chosen. Documents
must contain a single term in such a field, and the value of the term should
indicate the document's relative position in a given sort order. The field
must be indexed, but should not be tokenized, and does not need to be stored
(unless you happen to want it back with the rest of your document data). In
other words:

document.add (new Field ("byNumber", Integer.toString(x), Field.Store.NO,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
