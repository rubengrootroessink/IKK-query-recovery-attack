Actually, you can reconstruct the text, but it's a lossy process. Stop words
aren't in the index for instance. And it's very time-consuming. Luke makes
a "best guess" at this process, so you might want to take a look at that
code. But even the very bright folks who put Luke together caution that
it's not a perfect process.

What do you want to accomplish by reconstructing the text? Perhaps there's
a better way....

I'd also add parenthetically that while storing text certainly bulks up your
index, it doesn't affect searching proportionately since searching is
accomplished with indexed terms only. It may, however, substantially
increase document loading time (i.e. IndexReader.document(i)), which
*can* affect search time if you load a bunch of documents as part of
your processing. But this can be handled with lazy loading if it's an issue.
