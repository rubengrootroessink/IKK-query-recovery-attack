Because one of the restrictions of wildcards is that they cannot appear as
the first character in a search term if you use QueryParser. QueryParser
rejects it (as you've seen). This is a deliberate design decision since this
query will be humongous and most likely throw a TooManyClauses exception in
any corpus of any size.....

You can create a Filter by enumerating the terms yourself, think about
RegexTermEnum.
