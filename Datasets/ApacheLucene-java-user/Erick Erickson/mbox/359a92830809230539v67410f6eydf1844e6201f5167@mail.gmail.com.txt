That still seems excessive. Are you measuring your first sort? Lucene
builds up caches to help sort with the first few *sorts* that happen, so
that's a possibility.

But if that isn't the case, I think you need to slap a profiler on the
problem and see where you're spending your time. I'd also be careful
about what you measure when you measure your query. For instance,
I've been fooled by measuring the total time to get an assembled response
and it turned out that the time was spent fetching the documents, NOT
searching/sorting.

Try measuring various operations. In particular comment out anything having
to do with assembling the response. Perhaps just substitute in making a list
of the doc IDs and time *that*. Slowly build back up to your current app,
and
I suspect that one of the steps will cause your time to increase
dramatically.

How many documents are you assembling to respond? If you're assembling
40,000 hits, then 10-20 seconds may not be unreasonable.

Best
