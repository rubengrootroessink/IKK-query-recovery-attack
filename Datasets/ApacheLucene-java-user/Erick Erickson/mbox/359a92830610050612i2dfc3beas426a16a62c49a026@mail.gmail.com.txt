Search the mail archives for "date" and "sort" and you'll get many, many
responses. The short form is look at the DateTools class, and also look at
the Sort class.

Be aware that there are several issues regarding *ranges* of dates if you
have a need to search over, say, "all dates from 20060101 to 20061010" for
instance. You want to be mindful of the resolution of your dates.

But, as I said, you'll get lots and lots of information if you search the
list archive. There's also explications of this in Lucene In Action.
