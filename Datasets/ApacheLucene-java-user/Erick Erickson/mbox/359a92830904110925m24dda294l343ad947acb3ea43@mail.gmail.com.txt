That'll teach me to scan a post. The link I sent you
is still relevant, but wildcards are NOT intended to be used to
concatenate terms. You want a phrase query or a span query
for that. i.e. "A C F"~# where # is the "slop", that is, the number
of other terms allowed to appear between your desired terms.

SpanQueries are constructed programmatically, and PhraseQueries
are produced by the parser.
