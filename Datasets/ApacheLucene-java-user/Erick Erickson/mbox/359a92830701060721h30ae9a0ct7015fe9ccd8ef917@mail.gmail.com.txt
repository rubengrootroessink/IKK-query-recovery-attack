This is a confusing question. You have to create the index in the first
place. You can't just give the zip file to Lucene and expect it to do all
your work for you.

Somewhere, you have to have code like

Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(new Field("fieldname1", "stuff to store", Field.Store.***,
Field.Index.***));
doc.add(new Field("fieldname2", "more stuff to store", Field.Store.***,
Field.Index.***));
.
.
.
writer.add(doc);

the stuff you store in, say, fieldname1 is whatever you want. In this case,
say the real file name.
the stuff you store in, say, fieldname2 could be the zip file name.
the stuff you store in, say, fieldname3 could be the text of the file you
got from the zip file corresponding to fieldname1.

If this is conceptually unclear, I strongly recommend that you get a copy of
"Lucene in Action". It's has many examples of how to use lucene. Note that
it is written to the 1.4 code base, so there are some minor differences
between it and the latest 2.0 code.

Lucene isn't magic. It's an indexing and searching toolbox with an API that
you have to program with.
