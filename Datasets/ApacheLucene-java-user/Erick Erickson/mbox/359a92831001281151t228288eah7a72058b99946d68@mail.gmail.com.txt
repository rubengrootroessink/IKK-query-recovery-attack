the issue with non-letter characters is, indeed, the analyzer. Have
a look at all the different subclasses of Analyzer in the javadocs, getting
a copy of Luke will show you exactly what gets in your index, but
KeywordAnalyzer and WhitespaceAnalyzer may work for you (but they
don't normalize the case, you'll have to do that yourself).

And you can easily construct your own analyzer by stringing
together tokenizers and filters.

And don't forget PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper if you want different
analyzers for different fields.
