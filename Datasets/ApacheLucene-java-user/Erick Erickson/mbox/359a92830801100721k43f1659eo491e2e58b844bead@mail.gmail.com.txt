This seems really clunky. Especially if your merge step also optimizes.

There's not much point in indexing into RAM then merging explicitly.
Just use an FSDirectory rather than a RAMDirectory. There is *already*
buffering built in to FSDirectory, and your merge factor etc. control
how much RAM is used before flushing to disk. There's considerable
discussion of this on the Wiki I believe, but in the mail archive for sure.
And I believe there's a RAM usage based flushing policy somewhere.

You're adding complexity where it's probably not necessary. Did you
adopt this scheme because you *thought* it would be faster or because
you were addressing a *known* problem? Don't *ever* write complex code
to support a theoretical case unless you have considerable certainty
that it really is a problem. "It would be faster" is a weak argument when
you don't know whether you're talking about saving 1% or 95%. The
added maintenance is just not worth it.

There's a famous quote about that from Donald Knuth
(paraphrasing Hoare) "We should forget about small efficiencies,
say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of
all evil." It's true.

So the very *first* measurement I'd take is to get rid of the in-RAM
stuff and just write the index to local disk. I suspect you'll be *far*
better off doing this then just copying your index to the nfs mount.
