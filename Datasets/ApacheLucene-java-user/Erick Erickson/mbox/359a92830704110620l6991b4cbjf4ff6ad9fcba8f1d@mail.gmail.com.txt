SUBJECT: Re: Issue with : Searcher.search() returning Hits of same length for different searches
DATE: 11 Apr 2007

Well, there's nothing here to help you with, since you haven't provided
any information to diagnose. Like:

What queries are actually produced in the different cases?
Use query.toString().

I'm immediately suspicious of any statement that "my custom
code shouldn't be the problem". Try the test again using
one of the simplest analyzers you can.

Have you used Luke to query your index interactively and see
what the results are? Or how the queries parse?

Please, when asking for help, try looking at the question
you're asking from the perspective of someone who knows
nothing about your code. Imagine that a coworker had asked
you such a question.

Best
Erick
