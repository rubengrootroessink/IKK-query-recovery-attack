Sorry about that. I think II found the diagram you're talking about on page
89.
It even addresses the exact problem I'm talking about.

It's not the first time I've looked like a fool, you'd think I'd be getting
used to it by now <G>.

So, it seems like the most reasonable solution to this issue would
be for me to re-write the phrase queries as SpanNear queries, no?
