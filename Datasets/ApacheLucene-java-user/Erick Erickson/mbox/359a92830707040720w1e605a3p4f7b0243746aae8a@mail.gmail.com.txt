DATE: 4 Jul 2007

First, get Luke (google lucene, luke). Use it to open the index created
by the demo (I confess I don't know if the index is a RAMdir or FSDIR.
if it's a RAMdir, find the code in the demo that opens it and change it
to an FSDir). This is important as it'll give you a clue about the
structure of an index.

What you'll see in Luke is a set of fields along the left side.
(Available fields).

In general, these fields are accessible through the Document class.
You get a document by calling IndexReader.document(#);, where
# is the *lucene* document id (see the Documents tab in Luke). These
IDs are assigned by lucene, so don't count on them being the same over
time (as in across different openings of IndexReader).

Then call document.get("field name"); to get the value stored.

You get the lucene document IDs from the Hits obect.

Best of luck trying to learn both at once....
