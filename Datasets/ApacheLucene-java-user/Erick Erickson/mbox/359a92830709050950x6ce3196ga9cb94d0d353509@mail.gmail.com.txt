SUBJECT: Re: How to boost a document based on a field in the document
DATE: 5 Sep 2007

I think you misunderstand. The buckets are NOT the votes,
they are the relevance scores from the search. So your
search returns relevance scores (raw) from, say 1 - 100.
You could collect the results in 5 buckets and sort
by vote *within* the bucket. So the user still sees
the most relevant documents at the top, but within
that most relevant quintile she sees the order
munged a bit by vote. The thread I mentioned talks
about how to accomplish this with a FieldSortedHitQueue (?)
and a HitCollector.

Since you're massaging the sort however you want,
negative votes should be do-able.
