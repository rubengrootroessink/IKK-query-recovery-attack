SUBJECT: Re: Scoring for all the documents in the index relative to a query
DATE: 19 Nov 2007

Could you explain a bit more what problem you're trying to solve?
The reason I ask is that your question doesn't make sense to me,
since I have no idea what you expect by the term "negative score".

My simplistic view has been that all the docs returned via Hits
or HitCollector have scores > 0, and all the rest have scores of 0,
and this view is supported by the explanation of
HitCollector.collect

" Called once for every non-zero scoring document, with the
document number and its score."

You might also get value from this page:
