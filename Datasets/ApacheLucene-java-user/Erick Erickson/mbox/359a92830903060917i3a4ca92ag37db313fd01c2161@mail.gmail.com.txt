SUBJECT: Re: deletion of index-files fails
DATE: 6 Mar 2009

Hmmmm, reference counting is always yucky. I looked
the IndexReader javadocs over and there isn't any help
there for managing refcounts. You can't find the current
refcount, close doesn't indicate the results, etc. Or I
missed, for the Nth time, perfectly obvious documentation.

What do people think about one or more of these options?
1> have IndexReader.close() return some indication
     of what the resulting refcount is. I.e. "did the reader
     *really* close.
2> have decRef do the same.
3> have incRef do the same (although this seems less useful).


It's really, really hard to insure your reference counting is
correct solely by code inspection <G>!

yeah, yeah, yeah, this probably belongs on the dev list.
I'll be happy to put it over there and/or raise a JIRA...

Best
Erick
