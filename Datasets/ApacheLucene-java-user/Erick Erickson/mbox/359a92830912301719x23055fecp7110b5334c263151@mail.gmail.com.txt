It is possible to reconstruct a document from the terms, but
it's a lossy process. Luke does this (you can see from the
UI, and the code is available). There's no utility that I know
of to make this easy.

It's an open question whether this is more or less work than
re-parsing the document (I infer that you have the originals
available). Before trying to reconstruct the document I'd
ask how often you need to do this. The gremlins coming out
of the woodwork from reconstruction would consume a lot
of resources. For instance, could you guarantee term positions
when you re-indexed the reconstructed document?
What about stemmed words? How about synonyms?
And are you willing to spend the time tracking down the
bugs?

As I said, I wouldn't go there until forced....

FWIW
