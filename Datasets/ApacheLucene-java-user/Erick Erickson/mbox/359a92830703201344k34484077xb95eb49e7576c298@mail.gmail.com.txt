Well, depending upon your storage requirements, it's actually
much easier than that. Assuming you're adding
this field (or a duplicate) as UN_TOKENIZED (in this case, no
need to store), you can just spin
through all the terms for that field with TermDocs/TermEnum.
The trick is to have your term start with a value of "". I.e.
new Term(field, "") to enumerate them all. See TermDocs.seek.

This is without TermVectors at all, which'll save you some space.
