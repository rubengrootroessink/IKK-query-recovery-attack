SUBJECT: Re: NewBie:- Which Analyzer is best for Text and Number Indexing
DATE: 29 Dec 2006

Assuming that you are indexing these in different fields in your Lucene
document, you can use a PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper to use different analyzers
for each field. Be sure you carefully coordinate the analyzer you use for
indexing with the one you use for searching or your results will not be what
you expect....

You could break the input stream up upon input, and use, say, a
SimpleAnalyzer to just break on whitespace. This is really using your own
custom analyzer that cracks your XML document and returns selected data from
specific fields.

Assuming your index structure allows you to use a different analyzer for
different fields in your lucene document, I'd recommend the
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper....
