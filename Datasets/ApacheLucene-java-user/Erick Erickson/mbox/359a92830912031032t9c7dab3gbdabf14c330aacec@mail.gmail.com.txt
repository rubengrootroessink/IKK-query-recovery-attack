DATE: 3 Dec 2009

It would be clumsier, but you could create a Filter by spinning
through all the terms on a field and setting the appropriate bit.

You could even do this at startup and store the filters around for
all the fields you care about, or cache them when first used.

The advantage I see here is that it wouldn't depend upon
what looks like a peculiarity in field norms.

The disadvantage is that I bet it's slower.

FWIW
