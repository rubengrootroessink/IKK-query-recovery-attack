Sure, there are many tricks. If you search the mail archives you'll
find a bunch of them.

One would be to reverse the tokens and make your leading
wildcard queries into trailing ones on the reversed field.

But without more details about what you're trying to accomplish,
there's not much really useful advice we can offer.
