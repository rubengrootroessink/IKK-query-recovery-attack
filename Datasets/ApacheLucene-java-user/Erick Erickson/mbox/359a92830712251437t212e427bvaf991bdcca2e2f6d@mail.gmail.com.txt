It's more helpful to indicate what error you're receiving or
what your perceived problem is. Without that, we can only
guess...

But one thing wrong is that you keep appending to the
same StringBuffer forever, so your first writer.AddDocument
adds  document 1. Your second adds the text of BOTH doc
1 and doc 2. Your third AddDocument adds the contents of
docs 1, 2, 3. Etc.....

Just move the declaration for sb inside your for loop....

Note two things:
1> you can get the same effect by doing a
    document.add() for *each* line. That is,
    instead of the sb.append line, just do a
    document.add() for line. Then do your
    writer.addDocument outside the while loop as
    you do now.
2> there is a built-in default maximum of 10,000 terms that get
    indexed. You can change this, see SetMaxFieldLength on
    IndexWriter.
