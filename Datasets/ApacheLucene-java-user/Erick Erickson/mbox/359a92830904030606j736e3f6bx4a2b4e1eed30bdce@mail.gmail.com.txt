DATE: 3 Apr 2009

Hmmmm, that's odd. how many is "a large number of documents"? And
what is your index size when things to wonky? (approximately)

I can say that other people create very large indexes without this
happening,
but the only thing that says is that this isn't a *known* problem.

Is there any chance you're re-opening the indexwriter without
closing the old one (not that you should, you should reuse the writer,
but I've put a new in the wrong place by mistake a time or two)....

But I confess that I have no idea what happens under the covers when
indexing,
so I'll have to leave any real insights to the folks who know.
