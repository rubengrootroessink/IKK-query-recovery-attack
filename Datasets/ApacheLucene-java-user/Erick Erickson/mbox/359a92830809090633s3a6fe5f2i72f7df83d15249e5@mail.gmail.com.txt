SUBJECT: Re: Building Relationships between documents?
DATE: 9 Sep 2008

You must get your head out of the RDBMS world when
using lucene <G>. There's nothing in Lucene that
expresses relationships like a db. The usual solution is
to de-normalize your database at index time so you can
do reasonably simple searches that express your desired
relationship...
