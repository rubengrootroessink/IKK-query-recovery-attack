DATE: 8 Feb 2007

Sure, just don't index the html tags in the first place. Of course that
means you need to parse the document first. Here's a parser that was
mentioned on the thread a while ago....

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mozillaparser

There may very well be others....

Depending on how sophisticated you need to be, you might be able to do a
regular expression to remove all the HTML tags...
