DATE: 28 Jan 2011

I wonder if you can define the problem away? It sounds like
you have essentially random input here. That is, the users
can put in whatever they want so whatever you do will be wrong
sometime. Could you sidestep the problem with auto-complete
and prefix queries (essentially adding * to the user's input)?

That way, the user would see the exact input (A123-56 in
your example).

This assumes there's some kind of GUI front end, so I may
be way off base....

You could still let them search free-form if they really wanted,
but you wouldn't then have to try to figure out what the user
meant when they added A123,5,7....

FWIW
