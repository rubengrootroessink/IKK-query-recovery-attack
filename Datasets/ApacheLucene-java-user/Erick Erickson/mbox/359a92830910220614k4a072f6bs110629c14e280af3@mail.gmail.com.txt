SUBJECT: Re: Performance tips when creating a large index from database.
DATE: 22 Oct 2009

Besides the other suggestions, I'd really, really, really put
some instrumentationin the code and see where you're spending your time. For
a fast hint, put
a cumulative timer around your indexing part only. This will indicate
whether
the time is consumed in querying your database or indexing......

I'd also just use the default merge factor etc. until you answer
this question. They weren't just chosen at random <G>.

Something like this.
long elapsed = 0;
while (more database records) {
    get database record
    long temp = get time
    index Lucene doc
    elapsed += (get time) - temp
}
print time


It's unclear from your message whether you're calling optimize after
every 10,000 docs or not, but don't.

But I really suspect you're spending time interacting with the DB.

If these responses aren't all that helpful, some code samples
would help...

Best
Erick
