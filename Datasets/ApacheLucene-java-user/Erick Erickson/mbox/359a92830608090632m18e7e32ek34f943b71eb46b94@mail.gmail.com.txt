What analyzers are you using for both indexing and searching? Some analyzers
strip out numbers and some don't. I'd start with WhitespaceAnalyzer, and
index your fields UN_TOKENIZED and work up to the other analyzers and/or
tokenizations from there.

Under any circumstances, you really, really, really want to get a copy of
Luke (http://www.getopt.org/luke/) which will allow you to examine your
index to see what it actually contains. I've been surprised more than once
by thinking that my index contained something it really hadn't.
