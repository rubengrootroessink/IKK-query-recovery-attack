SUBJECT: Re: Multiple Documents sharing a common boost
DATE: 21 Aug 2007

Ahhh, I was assuming you didn't need to look at all clusters.
Oops.

That said, the question is really whether this is "good enough"
compared to re-indexing, and only some tests will determine that.
I was surprised at how quickly a *large* number of ORs was
processed by Lucene.

You could also think about implementing a HitCollector that
boosted the raw score of each document based upon the
cluster ID, but be careful not to read the full document in
the HitCollector (you shouldn't have to though, either make
a map early or get creative with filters).

You might find useful information looking through the mail
archive for "faceting", as this seems like a similar
topic.

But I wouldn't go anywhere with anything custom until and
unless I'd satisfied myself that the simple approach of
letting Lucene handle a large set of OR clauses wasn't
performant. Several very bright people put significant
effort in to performance, I'd see if they've already done
the hard part <G>.....
