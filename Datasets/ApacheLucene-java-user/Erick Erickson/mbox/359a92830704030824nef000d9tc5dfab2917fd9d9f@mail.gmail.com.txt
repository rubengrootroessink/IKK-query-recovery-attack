In the immortal words of Erik H.  ...it depends...

The big issue is whether you have fields in your index that are NOT
stored (i.e. Field.Store.NO). If this is the case, your documents
will not be complete, and adding it to the fresh index will not
include the un-stored data.

It's actually pretty common to store a field as
...Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.(UN_)TOKENIZED

Field.Store.COMPRESSED should be OK.

>From the Document API doc

"note that fields which are *not*
stored<file:///C:/lucene-2.1.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Fieldable.html#isStored%28%29>are
*not* available in
documents retrieved from the index, e.g. with
Hits.doc(int)<file:///C:/lucene-2.1.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Hits.html#doc%28int%29>,
Searcher.doc(int)<file:///C:/lucene-2.1.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Searcher.html#doc%28int%29>or
IndexReader.document(int)<file:///C:/lucene-2.1.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#document%28int%29>
."

Otherwise, it would *probably* work, but I haven't tried it. At worst,
you could create a new document and add the fields from the old
document to it......
