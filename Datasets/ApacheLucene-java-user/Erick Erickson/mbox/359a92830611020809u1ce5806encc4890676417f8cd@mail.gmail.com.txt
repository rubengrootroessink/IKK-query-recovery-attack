Well, the simplest way is to look at the HITS object returned from a search.
Something like

Hits hits = searcher.search(new TermQuery(new Term("field", "value")));
for (int idx = 0; idx < hits.length(); ++idx)
    float score = hits.score(idx);


Look at the warnings in the javadoc for why using the Hits object rather
than a HitCollector is not optimal if you intend to look at more than 100 or
so documents...
