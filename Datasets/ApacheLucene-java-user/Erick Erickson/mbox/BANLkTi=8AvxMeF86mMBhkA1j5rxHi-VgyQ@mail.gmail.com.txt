SUBJECT: Re: multiple small indexes or one big index?
DATE: 1 Jun 2011

I'd start by putting them all in one index. There's no penalty
in Lucene for having empty fields in a document, unlike an
RDBMS.

Alternately, if you're opening then closing searchers each
time, that's very expensive. Could you open the searchers
once and keep them open (all 90 of them)? That alone might
do the trick and be less of a change to your program. You
could also fire multiple threads at the searches, but check if
you're CPU bound first (if you are, multiple threads won't
help much/at all).

You haven't said how big these indexes are nor how many
documents you're talking about here, so this advice is suspect.

Do look at putting it all in one index though, let us know if you
have some data indicating how big stuff is/would be.

Best
