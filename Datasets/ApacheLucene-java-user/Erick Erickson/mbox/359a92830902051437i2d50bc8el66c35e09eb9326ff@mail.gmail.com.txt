Your coworker *might* have been talking about a Hits object when
iterating over it for documents past the 100th or so. See the
discussion list of the wiki for the messy details.

Well, you can always sort by a field rather than by score, see
SortField and associated. And you can always specify secondary
and tertiary... sorts.

I'll leave it to others for other suggestions since I'm in a rush.
