Hmmmm, have you seen this page?
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/queryparsersyntax.html
<http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/queryparsersyntax.html>If that doesn't
help, perhaps you can explain what it is that you're trying to do that the
syntax
is inadequate for.

Do note that Lucene query syntax is better thought of with the +/-/ / syntax
(this last is a blank
operator standing for "should". It's not true boolean logic.
