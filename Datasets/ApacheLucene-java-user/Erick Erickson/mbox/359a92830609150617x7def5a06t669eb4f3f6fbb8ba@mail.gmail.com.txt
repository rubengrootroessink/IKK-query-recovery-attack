SUBJECT: Re: Big Ducument Indexing Limit?
DATE: 15 Sep 2006

First, You really must undestand analyzers and what they do. If you haven't
seen the book Lucene in Action, I highly recommend it.

Second, get a copy of Luke (google luke and lucene). It is a graphical tool
that lets you examine an index and fire queries at it. It'll show you
exactly what was indexed with the particular analyzer you eventually use. It
will also show you exactly what the result of a query is after it has been
processed by the query parser (again, using different analyzers). I
guarantee that the hour or two you spend understanding Luke will be time
*very* well spent.

About the content you indicated... what do you want to search? Are you going
to search on "\A1" "Frank" "\Paul" "\A1;Frank\Paul"? That is, would you
expect searching on \A1 to produce a hit or not?

You have to decide what parts of this text are to be searchable (i.e. how to
tokenize the input) and then use an analyzer/tokenizer that breaks the
stream up as you wish (for both indexing and querying). If none of the
supplied analyzers do what you want, Lucene in Action presents an example of
making your own (under synonym injection) that you can use as a model for
making your own.

It would be much more helpful if you could give an example of what searches
you would expect to generate hits on a given example input.... Again, using
Luke to look at your index after indexing would help you a lot to understand
what's possible.

Hope this helps
Erick
