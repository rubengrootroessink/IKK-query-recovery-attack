SUBJECT: Re: Multisearcher will maintain index order sorting?
DATE: 21 Oct 2008

You say the timestamp sort is taking lots of RAM, which leads
me to ask "what resolution are you using and do you need
that great a resolution"?

As I understand it, sorting is sensitive to the number of unique
terms, so if you're storing millisecond timestamps you have a
whole lot more terms than if you store, say, minute resolution.
So one possibility would be to use a coarser resolution than
you are now, if you app can.
