SUBJECT: Re: Hit score and confidence ratio in results
DATE: 2 Dec 2010

If I understand your problem space, you're trying to compare scores
across two different queries. Don't do this, it is meaningless. Scores
are only valid for comparing documents' relevance within a single
query. How would one compare scores between two queries like
text:nonsense
name:terrible
? Different fields, different values. What does it mean that the score
for a doc matching the first query has a higher or lower score than
the first doc matching the second query?

As for how scores are > 1, have you looked at the scoring
formula here?
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html
and here? http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/scoring.html#Understanding the
Scoring Formula

Don't forget that there can also be boosts...

Best
