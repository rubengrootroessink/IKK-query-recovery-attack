When you say "we've tried the whitespace analyzer", did you mean for BOTH
indexing and searching? If you ony use it for one of those, you'd see
results like this.

And do you use Luke? It'll let you examine your index and see what's
*actually* in it. It's the first place I go when I don't get results I
expect....

See: http://www.getopt.org/luke/

What about capitalization? Lucene is case-sensitive. Some of the analyzers
automatically lower-case and some don't.

If you're using the whitespace analyzer, I don't think you need to bother
transforming the hyphen into underscore....

Hope this helps, without more context I'm not sure what else to suggest...
