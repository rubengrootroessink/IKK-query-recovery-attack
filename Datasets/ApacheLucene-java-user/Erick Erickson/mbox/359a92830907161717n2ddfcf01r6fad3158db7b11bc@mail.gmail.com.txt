OK, I'm feeling old today. But do any of you kids out there have any
idea how miraculous this thread is? In "the bad old days", or "when
I was your age", getting to the bottom of a problem like this would
have involved on-sited consultants at $150/hour and about 6 months.
Assuming that the product was still being supported. Or maybe
"you have to pay us a bazillion dollars to get this fix, it's in the new
release".

Here, you get a resolution in less than a week, with support far better than
many "support contracts" I've seen very good money paid for. And we
get it for free.

Just a note to give thanks that "the old days" are gone <G>.

Best
Erick
