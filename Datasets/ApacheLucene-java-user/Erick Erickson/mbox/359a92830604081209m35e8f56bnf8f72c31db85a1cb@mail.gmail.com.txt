OK, I get it now. Obviously I didn't read your response as you meant it and
was focusing on the optimization part.

I'd also agree that using the most specific tool for the task is better
design. There's also an argument that "I'd rather have a library fail than
do something non-obvious". I'll leave it to Erik whether this would be an
'obvious' behavior <G>...

Thanks for clarifying.

Best
Erick
