Well, this could get to be a really ugly query. Let's say you have 10 lines.
Then the
doc would have 10 different fields? ("line1", "line2" etc.)? Then to search
it
you have to have an or clause across all fields. And a file with 100,000
lines would be
a 100,000 term query...... Or I misunderstand you completely.

Calling doc.add with the *same* field (say "text") is a possibility,
especially if you
provide your own tokenizer that returns a large increment gap, say 1000.
This offset
gets added to each call to doc.add on a field. So say you have 10 lines,
each with 5 tokens.
The first token of each line would be at offsets
0, 15, 30, 45...

You have a couple of choices here. Say you can guarantee that no line will
be longer than 100 terms.
Each line could begin on an even 100 offset (assuming you're not indexing
something with many millions
of lines). Now, to find the line you just divide the offset by 100.

Another possibility is to keep a field in the document that correlates
offsets to lines and read that
in when you need to.

It all depends upon what the purpose of needing to keep track of lines. If
it's for a single document,
this kind of thing can work. But if you want line information for all the
hits, it could be too expensive.

The increment gap will play interesting games with Span queries (or slop in
phrase queries). If you need
proximity to span lines, this scheme needs some modification. Say I want
hits when "firstname" is within 10
terms of "lastname". Well, if you have a large increment gap this won't
work.

So it would be a good thing to tell us a bit more about why you want to
distinguish lines to get
better advice <G>.

Best
