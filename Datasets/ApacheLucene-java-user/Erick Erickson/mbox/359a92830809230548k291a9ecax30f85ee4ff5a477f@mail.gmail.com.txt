Are you sure you want to be boosting the document fields at
index time? From Hossman

<<<index time field boosts are a way to express things like

'this documents title is worth twice as much as the title of
most documents'.

query time boosts are a way to express
'i care about matches on this clause of my query twice
as much as i do about matches to other clauses of
my query'
>>>

But Lucene isn't magic, it's an engine that you have to
make do what you want. You say

"But i do not want to create one  more field(default_field)
that will contain all the values  concatenated in it"

Is this for theoretical reasons or do you have evidence that this
is unacceptable? You haven't told us how much data you're
indexing, so we have no way to reassure (or warn) you about
trying this.

I suggest you try the "bag of words" solution (this should
not take you more than a few hours) and see if it's
unacceptable before rejecting it.
