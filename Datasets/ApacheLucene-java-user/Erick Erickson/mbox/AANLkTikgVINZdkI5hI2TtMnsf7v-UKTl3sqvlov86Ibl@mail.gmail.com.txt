SUBJECT: Re: How to modify a document Field before the document is indexed?
DATE: 20 Jul 2010

One subtlety you might be able to use to advantage... This is
where getPositionIncrementGap in your analyzer can be used
to separate the two bits of data in the same field. If I have my
own analyzer (which could be a trivial override of an existing one)
that returns, say 10,000 from getPositionIncrementGap Now, if
you wanted to insure that proximity queries only matched in a particular
add to your "content" field, you could specify that all the terms had
to occur within 10,000 of each other...

FWIW
