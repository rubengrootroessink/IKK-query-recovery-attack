SUBJECT: Re: Using Lucene for user query parsing
DATE: 6 Mar 2009

Whatever you do will be wrong <G>. What you're saying is
that you have structured data that the user wants to search
in an unstructured way, and you want to try to create a
system that intuits what the user meant. Good luck <G>.

Can you back up a bit and talk about the problem you're
trying to solve? If, for instance, you're trying to find the
best match for a particular business, one approach would
be to create one index where each business had

street
business
area
bagowords

where the field bagowords contained a copy of the data
from the other three fields, then search bagowords
for your query terms. It sounds simplistic, but it might be
surprisingly good.

And if this is out in left field, a higher level statement
of the problem would help get better answers.

Best
Erick
