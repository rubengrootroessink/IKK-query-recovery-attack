SUBJECT: Re: Using PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper with KeywordAnalyzer - MultiFieldQueryParser
DATE: 13 Jan 2009

Are you sure that you close the IndexWriter *before* you
open your _Searcher in your program (it kinda looks
like a test program is why I'm asking).

If the above is OK, I'd really recommend getting a copy
of Luke, writing your index to a FSDirectory and looking
at it with Luke.

Barring all that, try peeling back your code. That is, use
a very simple analyzer first on a single field then move up
to MultiFieldQueryParser. Usually whenever I do this I
wind up finding something silly <G>....
