Well, you might have to pre-process your strings before you
give them to an analyzer. Or roll your own analyzer.

What you're asking for, in effect, is an analyzer "that does
exactly what I want it to, nothing more and nothing less". But
the problem is that there is nothing general about what you want.
That is, leaving in # and ++ is completely arbitrary so I don't
think there are any canned analyzers out there that'll do what you
want.

But it's pretty simple to write a regular expression that'll remove
(actually, replace with spaces), anything that you want to. So I'd
think about that approach and then feed your lower-case/whitespace
analyzer the results.

Best
Erick
