It's generally a bad idea to iterate a Hits object. In fact, Hits
is deprecated in recent versions of Lucene. The underlying
problem is that the query is re-executed every 100 responses
or so.

First suggestion, create a Filter by iterating over your
docid field and use that in your searches see
several of the Searcher.search variants.

Second suggestion, use one of the collector classes rather than
Hits, e.g. TopDoc*, TopFieldDoc*, whichever suits.
