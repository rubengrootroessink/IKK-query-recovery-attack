Lucene only gives you back what you put into the index. In this case,
did you index "robert" when the token was "bob"? In other words,
did you index all the variants of 'robert' every time you found any variant?

Let's say the three variants are 'bob' 'rob' and 'robert'. Whenever you
encounter any of those three variants, you need to add the *other*
two to your index as well as the original variant.

Well, if you make your own query analyzer (subclassing the relevant one),
you
can always substitute the one-word version for the three word version. Be
careful about doing it the other way unless you make very sure it's a
phrase.
That is, tokenizing "International Business Machines" would give you
three token and you'd be searching on the OR of them (assuming default
queryparser behavior). So you'd be better off having your analyzer turn
"international business machines" into IBM. You might be able to get
away with enclosing multiple-word entries in quotes...
