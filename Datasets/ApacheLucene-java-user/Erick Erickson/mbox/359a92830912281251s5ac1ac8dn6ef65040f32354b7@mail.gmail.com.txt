SUBJECT: Re: Multi-value (complex) field indexing
DATE: 28 Dec 2009

I'm not following entirely here, but multi-valued fields are supported.
Something like (bad pseudo-code here)
doc = new Document
doc.add(new Field("rows", <row1 text", stored, indexed));
doc.add(new Field("rows", <row2 text", stored, indexed));
indexWriter.addDocument(doc);

If your analyzer implements getPositionIncrementGap, you can keep your
rows separate (search the mail archives for getPositionIncrementGap for
more explanation).

Then, if you're searching with a proximity (or phrase) less than your
increment
gap, you'll only get matches within a row. You wouldn't get a search
"against
a particular row" if, by that phrase, you meant "only look in row 2". If you

mean "only match the document if the phrase is in a *some* row in the doc",
it should work.

The SpanNear query should work, as should regular phrase queries.

If this is off base, could you provide some more examples?
