Would it work to index the upper-case LET as something else? For
instance, index it as '$let'

Now, all your searches are on one index, but you have to substitute
'$let' where you want to find LET in your query.. This won't match your
other occurrences of let...

You'll have to watch to be sure your displays are appropriate. That is,
depending upon how you store your data for display you'd have to
translate '$let' back into 'LET'......

This should also work for span queries, etc.....

This won't foul  you up if you use wildcards as long as you don't
allow the wildcards to appear in the first character position...
