Yes, you can search while index writes are taking place, but....

When you open an index reader, it essentially takes a snapshot
of the index and further modifications of the index are not visible to
that searcher as long as it's open. You must close and re-open the
reader (and associated searchers) to see your changes. How this
interacts with index writer flushing is...er...well I don't exactly know,
but this could well be an issue...

I wonder if this is what you're seeing. In broad terms, the base
question is how quickly you need to see changes in the index reflected
in your search results.

I suspect that the 10 file thing is a red herring, what do you have your
indexwriter parameters set at? Especially maxbuffereddocs (which has
a default value, perhaps not coincidentally, of 10).......

Lucene 2.1 has an IndexWriter.flush() method that could help......
