<<<As i know the content of the document(whole text) is also stored in the
index, my question how to print this content.>>>

This not strictly true. For instance, stop words aren't even indexed.
Reconstructing a document from the index is very expensive
(see Luke for examples of how this is done).

You can get the text back verbatim if you store it in your index. See
Field.Store.YES (or Field.Store.COMPRESS). Storage is orthogonal
to indexing, so you can index the tokens in a field but not store them,
store them but not index them, or do both. Not storing and not indexing
is, I guess, theoretically possible but I sure can't see why you'd try it
<G>.

But if you store the field, you can get it back very easily with
Document.get("field").
Storing the fields will make your index larger, but shouldn't have a great
effect on your search times I don't think.

Best
