I don't understand your regex at all. Isn't it looking for in with any
*single* character in front and back? Given your example, I don't
see how you're getting anything back at all. Is this code you're
actually executing or just an example?

What does toString and/or Explain show? Think about getting
a copy of Luke and using that tool to show you what actually
happens.
