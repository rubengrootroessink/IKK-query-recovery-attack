SUBJECT: Re: factor in stopwords when searching
DATE: 22 Mar 2008

Well, whether it's a good user experience is exactly the question. I've
spent far too much time satisfying customer (or product manager)
requests that add zero value to the product *in the user's eyes*.

And I quote:
"This is asked by some customer, who may not know what's "stop words" at
all."

which raises red flags to me. You might be far ahead spending the time up
front to work with the customer and see if it's really worthwhile.
Especially
when asking them to provide actual examples that show the "better user
experience". The question is *always* "is the benefit *in the real world* to
the user worth the extra time and money it'll cost to develop this?".
Especially
when you factor in ongoing maintenance, and the next developer having to
spend time  figuring out what the heck is going on, and ......

Double especially when you ask the customer "would you rather have this
feature or some other feature?". It's amazing how often customers don't
need a particular feature when the costs are made explicit. Either in
additional time or other features not getting worked on.

As a profession, we spend way too much time doing whatever the customer
asks for, rather than what the customer actually needs. We've done a pretty
poor job of reminding the customer what something costs and letting *them*
make the decision. Usually, we say something like "sure, we can do that".
The
problem is that the customer never gets a chance to say "but it's not worth
it",
because we often neglect to add "and it'll cost 6 developer-weeks which
means
we won't be able to do X, Y and Z in the time frame".

Anyway, enough ranting <G>. If the customers are willing to pay for it
that's
their business I guess..

Best
Erick
