Several, all of which boil down to "what analyzers are you usingduring
indexing and searching?". Without that information, we can't
say much.

Also, I'd recommend you get a copy of Luke and examine your index
to see whether what's in there is what you expect.

And query.toString and (as Grant says), IndexSearcher.explain() is your
friend

Best
