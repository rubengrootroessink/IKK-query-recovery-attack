This seems really odd, especially with an index that size. The
first question is usually "Do you open an IndexReader for
each query?" If you do, be aware that opening a reader/searcher
is expensive, and the first few queries through the system are
slow as the caches are built up.

The second question is, have you looked at:

http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#head-1b15abeee21b0a72492b1b97a86e260e83c61387

the section "How can I speed up searching"

which also points you here:
