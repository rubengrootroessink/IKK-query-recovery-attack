As to your very last question, No, there'll be no performance penalty.
That's because there won't be any docs deleted <G>....

>From the javadoc (2.1) for IndexReader.deleteDocuments(Term)

" Deletes all documents that have a given term indexed."

You may be ahead if you index it UN_TOKENIZED though since
indexing it tokenized could lead to "interesting" results. Say you
have three of these IDs.
"this is id1"
"this is id2"
"this is id3"

Things would be fine if your terms were "id1", "id2", or "id3".
But if your term were "this", you would remove all your documents
if you indexed the identity TOKENIZED because "this" is a term
in all three docs for the identity field.

And to add to Otis's comment, optimizing is a pretty expensive
step in my experience...
