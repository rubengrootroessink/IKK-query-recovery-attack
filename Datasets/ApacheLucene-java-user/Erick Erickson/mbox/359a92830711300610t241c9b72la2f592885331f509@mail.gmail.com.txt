A directory that your program can modify <G>. I assume that
you are running on a unix-like system and the directory you've
specified is protected from modification by whatever user
your process is identified as.

But two other things:
1> do you really want to create a new index as the "true" indicates?
2> This form is deprecated. I'm not sure what the first version that
deprecated this, but from the 2.1 documentation....
*getDirectory<file:///C:/lucene-2.1.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/store/FSDirectory.html#getDirectory%28java.io.File,%20boolean%29>
*(File <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/io/File.html> file,
boolean create)
          *Deprecated.* *Use IndexWriter's create flag, instead, to create a
new index.

*But I'd expect the same behavior from IndexWriter with the create flag...

Best
