DATE: 24 Aug 2009

I'm not saying that calculating percentages is a bad thing *within a
query*.Your
absolutely right, users want some clue about how "good" a match
various items are.

But trying to compare percentages (scores) between *two different queries*
then trying to infer that there is some "better fit" based on that data
is where problems creep in.....
