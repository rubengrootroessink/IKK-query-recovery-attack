What are you trying to do with the regex? And why is it
appropriate to the Lucene list? What is a segment and how
does it relate to Lucene?

It would really help if you showed us some example input
and what transformation you are trying to implement with
your regex. If it's a pure regex question you might
get more informed responses if you looked at one
of the Java forums.
