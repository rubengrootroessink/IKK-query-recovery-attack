Well, you could index with your index as part of the value...
doc.Add (new Field ("Field1", "1A", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
doc.Add (new Field ("Field1", "2B", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));

// Add 2 values to Field2.
doc.Add (new Field ("Field2", "1C", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
doc.Add (new Field ("Field2", "2D", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));

then form your queries with all terms specific to one position and OR
together a clause for each possibility, something like this:


   (Field1:1A AND Field2:1C) OR (Field1:2A AND Field2:2C)
which would hit, but


  ( Field1:1A AND Field2:1D) OR (Field1:2A AND Field2:2D)
would fail.


I'm not sure how complex your queries get, so whether this works out for you
is an open question. It's obviously clumsy with a very large number of
tokens per field... How big do you expect your index to get, and how many
index positions do you expect as a max?

Do be aware that UN_TOKENIZED not fold case...

Best
