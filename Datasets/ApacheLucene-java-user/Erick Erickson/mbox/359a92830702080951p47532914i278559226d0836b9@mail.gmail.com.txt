DATE: 8 Feb 2007

Well, you've proved that your problem is that the analyzer you're using when
querying isn't matching what you use during indexing. I think that what
you've done will lead you into significant problems down the road as your
tokenizer then has to "correct" for what the index analyzer did though.

What would probably be MUCH less work in the long run is to align the
analyzer you use at query time with the analyzer you use at index time. You
can use a PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper to handle different fields in different
ways. Forget your custom tokenizer for the time being, just try using the
same analyzer during searching that you used during indexing. You can use
the
*QueryParser<file:///C:/lucene-2.0.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/queryParser/QueryParser.html#QueryParser%28java.lang.String,%20org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer%29>
*(String <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html> f,
Analyzer<file:///C:/lucene-2.0.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Analyzer.html>
 a)

form of the QueryParser, where the Analyzer is the same one you used when
indexing. There are some circumstances where you want to use different
analyzers when querying and when indexing, but don't go there unless you
need to <G>....

If that doesn't do what you want, I'd really recommend is that you make your
own custom Analyzer, built on, say, WhitespaceTokenizer, LowerCaseFilter.
This is usually the way I've approached this kind of problem. And use *that*
one at index and query time.

There's an example in Lucene In Action, see the SynonymAnalyzer example.
That example is MUCH more complex than you'll need <G>...

Best
Erick
