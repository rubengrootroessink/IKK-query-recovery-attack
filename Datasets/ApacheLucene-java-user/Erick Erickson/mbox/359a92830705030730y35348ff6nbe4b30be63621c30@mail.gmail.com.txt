SUBJECT: Re: MergeFactor advice wanted
DATE: 3 May 2007

I don't think (but don't know for sure) whether optimizing before the
end of the run buys you anything. And you're right, it takes a while.
I've assumed that it was best done at the end of the entire run,
but that's only an assumption.

Search the archives for the thread titled

MergeFactor and MaxBufferedDocs value should ...?

for an exposition on how all the indexing factors relate.

Also, look at the (new to 2.1) IndexWriter.ramSizeInBytes() (or something
like that). Rather than worrying about MergeFactor and the other
parameters and guessing, this may allow you to flush RAM to disk
when needed rather than every N documents. CAUTION: there's
a bug (detailed in the thread referenced above) with this code, so look
at the thread...

In fact, yesterday I experimented with what I call an "AdaptiveWriter".
The idea is to query the op system for the amount of RAM I'm using,
and track the amount of RAM used to index a document as it
relates to size. Then flush when I get "too close for comfort" to an
OOM error. Yes, this is a digression from optimizing, but it is
related to indexing as fast as possible <G>.

By monitoring the size of the index growth and the size of the
incoming document, I can create a crude measure of how much
RAM the index needs for a document of a given size. Actually,
I tracked the ratio of the size of incoming doc to the change in
memory. When my available RAM for the process is less
than 2X the largest ratio yet times the size of the incoming
document, I flush. I'm not sure how much this changes things,
but I thought that creating one of these was better than
experimenting with the various factors for each new project...

Anyway, do look at that thread for ideas on how to make
this as efficient as possible, and you can probably ignore
the rest <G>...

Best
Erick
