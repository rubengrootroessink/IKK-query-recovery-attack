1) Should the "FSDirectory dir" object be shared as some sort of static
variable?
I don't think it matters, do the simplest thing. The overhead in creating an
FSDirectory is so small in relation to the other operations that I don't
think you'd ever notice.

2) Should the "IndexSearcher searcher" or the "IndexReader indexReader"
objects be stored as a static variable, and then simply replaced when the
index is rebuilt?

Absolutely. Opening a searcher is expensive and they should only be opened
when necessary. However, if you have multiple threads using the same
searcher, you cannot close that searcher until all the threads are done with
their current search. There's an example of this in Lucene In Action II,
available from Manning in PDF format (it's still undergoing final editing).

Best
