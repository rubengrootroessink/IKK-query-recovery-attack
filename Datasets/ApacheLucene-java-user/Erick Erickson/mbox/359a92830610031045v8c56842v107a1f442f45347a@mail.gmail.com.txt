Sure, anything's possible. Whether Lucene is your best bet may be another
question <G>. But in this example, you're not using Lucene to do anything
except store the strings. By storing all the data as UN_TOKENIZED, all
you're doing is a regex match on the entire HTML text of each document. You
might as well put them in a database and do a "like" clause. Or store them
in files and read each file and do a regex. Or.....

My point is, that this design doesn't leverage what Lucene does, which is
allow you to quickly search on terms. The body you're storing is just a long
string, not a series of tokens. So I question whether lucene is relevant.

Unless you tokenize the body text then do some interesting term enumeration,
I don't think lucene is helping you.
