Well, it seems that your problem, as stated, is not soluble. You've
stated that the instructors have the same name but given us no clue
as to what other information you have access to. So there's nothing
to distinguish them.

So what other information do you have about the particular instructors?
I can imagine that each instructor is a document with other information
like past degrees, department, etc and that the classes also have
some kind of metadata that could be used to correlate. But unless
you can give us some clue what information you *do* have access to,
I don't think there's much we can do to help...

Best
