Don't do that <G> Why are you trying to open the index 700,000 times?
During indexing or searching? In either case, there's no reason
to. You should be able to open the index and keep it open as long
as you want.

I still don't understand why you can't index the records individually,
but I'll assume you've proven it to your own satisfaction. But I
will mention that if you were opening/closing your index each
time, *that* was your problem....
