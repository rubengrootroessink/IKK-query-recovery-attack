Sure, what analyzer are you using? Both for indexing and parsing the query?
I'll bet that you're using a tokenizer (in one or both) that breaks your
input stream up in ways you're not expecting.

Get a copy of luke (google lucene luke) if you haven't already and look at
what's in your index. You can also use several different analyzers for a
query and see what is produced. You'll be glad you did<G>.

You can also look at the query. I don't remember whether toString prints the
query or there's another call, but you can probably find it without too much
trouble.

Hope this helps
