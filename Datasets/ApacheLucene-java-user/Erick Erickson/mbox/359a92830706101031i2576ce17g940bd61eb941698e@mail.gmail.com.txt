SUBJECT: Re: Retrieving TermVectors from a Field over the full index?
DATE: 10 Jun 2007

Um, to return all counts of all terms in a field, what other option
*is* there except to walk the whole thing?

Have you looked at TermEnum, TermDocs, and TermFreqVector?
For that matter, TermPositionVector might also be of some use.

It would be easier to provide some help if you
1> mentioned what you'd tried already
2> mentioned what's inadequate about what you've tried.
