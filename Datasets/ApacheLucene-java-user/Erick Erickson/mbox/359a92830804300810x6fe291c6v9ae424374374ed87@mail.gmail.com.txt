Cool, this will work just fine for you. You can forget everything

Probably something very like that, although you see none of that. Just
doing a deleteDocument(term) does it all for you. And I learned long ago
that the folks who write this kind of stuff can probably do it more
efficiently
than I can <G>.

I ask because a lot of people are mistakenly suppose that RAMdirs are faster
because they have RAM in front <G>. The indexing process uses RAM implicitly
and periodically flushes to FS. You can control this by various parameters
on
IndexWriter like setMaxMergeDocs, setMergeFactor etc. and I personally
prefer letting that do the work and avoiding having to code merging the two.

But your point about failure is valid, although you might want to search the
mail archive for discussions on this as there's been work done to make this
less of a concern....
