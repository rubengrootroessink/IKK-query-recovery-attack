This has been extensively discussed in the mail archive, I think a search of
the archive would help you a lot.

The short form is no. There's nothing built into Lucene to help you index a
database. How would you define that anyway? <G>

That said, you can write a program to extract data from the database and
index that data. Depending on what you need to do, you can either store
enough data in the index to satisfy searches, or store data in each
"document" you index that allows you to "do the right thing" as far as the
database is concerned to satisfy searches.
