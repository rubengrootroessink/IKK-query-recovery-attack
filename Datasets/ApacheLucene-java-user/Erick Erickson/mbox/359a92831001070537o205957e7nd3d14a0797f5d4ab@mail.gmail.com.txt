SUBJECT: Re: Problems with IndexWriter#commit() on Linux
DATE: 7 Jan 2010

Several questions:
1> are the index files larger after you kill your process?
    Or have the timestamps changed?
2> are you absolutely sure that your indexer, when you
     add documents, is pointing at the same directory your
     search is pointing to?
3> Have you gotten a copy of Luke and examined your index
     to see if, perhaps, your documents aren't being added the
     way you think they are?
