Yes, in terms of what you probably mean, but your first
example would index one token "bar1bar2". But if you
changed your first example to (note space): they would
be entirely equivalent.

   doc.add(new Field("foo",
                             "bar1 bar2",
                             Field.Store.YES,
                             Field.Index.ANALYZED));


One note: The rather technical difference between the two methods
is that multiple calls to index the same field add PositionIncrementGap
to the first token of calls 2-n. This defaults to 1, so it doesn't change
anything unless you change it in your analyzer. Don't worry about it
yet <G>...

Best
Erick
