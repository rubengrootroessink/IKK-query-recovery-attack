I'm not sure what you mean by "loading them all into memory".

I'm pretty sure that the numHits you specify just limits the number
of documents kept in the internal ScoreDocs, and getTotalHits
can easily be much greater than numHits. But that would be
trivial to test (you shouldn't take my word for this one <G>)...
