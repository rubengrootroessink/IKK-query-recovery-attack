SUBJECT: Re: Problem searching field with % as value
DATE: 8 Dec 2009

Try printing out query.toString() to see what's actually being
sent to the searcher.

You can try the same thing in Luke, specifying StandardAnalyzer
to parse queries.

Are you sure you're specifying the fields in the query and not just the
'%'? That would go against your default field.

When you say that you can see the fields in luke, are you storing the field?
Because what you may be seeing is the *stored* value rather than the
*tokens*.
Make sure you're looking at the tokens in Luke..

If none of that helps, could you post a code snippet or two (index and
query)?

Best
Erick
