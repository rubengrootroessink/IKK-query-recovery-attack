See the thread "Standard Parser Behavior". It has several explications
of what the Lucene query syntax is all about. This confuses everybody,
so I think that thread will help you a lot.

Also, see http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BooleanQuerySyntax

You'll have to include a dummy value I think. Remember that you're
searching for stuff with Lucene, so saying "match even if there's
nothing there" is, er, ABnormal..

I'd think about putting a dummy value in those fields you want to handle
this way. For instance, add "matchall" to documents with no date. Then
you'd need to add an 'or date:matchall' clause to all the dates you query
on. Make sure it's a value that behaves reasonably when you want to
include all dates, or all dates before ####, or all dates after ####.
