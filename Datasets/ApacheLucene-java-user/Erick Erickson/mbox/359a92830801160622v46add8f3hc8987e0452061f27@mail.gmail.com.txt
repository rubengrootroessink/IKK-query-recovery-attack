As I read your latest post, it's not *searching* that's taking too long, but
*indexing*.

Well, 100,000,000 rows is a lot. It'll never be just a few minutes. But I
also
have to ask whether the most time is being spent actually indexing or
fetching from the database? You could time this easily by just skipping the
indexing step and measuring say the time to fetch the first 1,000,000 rows
and comparing that against fetching *and* indexing.

The whole point of a search engine is to trade some up-front time
indexing for faster searching.

Otherwise, have you looked at this page?

http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveIndexingSpeed

Also, 200M for 40K rows seems like a lot of disk space. Are you
storing all the data in the index? And do you need to?
