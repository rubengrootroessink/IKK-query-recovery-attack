Well, having your application depend upon incorrect behavior
is...er...fraught.

It looks like what you really want is custom behavior for multiple
question marks, perhaps only with multiple question marks
at the end of your query?

If this is the case, I'd think about substituting splat (*) in this
case at query time. So you simply transform
cat??? to cat*....

If that doesn't satisfy your requirements, perhaps you could
post a more detailed explanation of what you're trying to
accomplish.

Best
