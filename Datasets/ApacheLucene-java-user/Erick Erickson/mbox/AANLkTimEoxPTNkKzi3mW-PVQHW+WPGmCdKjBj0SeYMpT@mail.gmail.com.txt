Well, I guess I can answer your original question with "no". There's
no Lucene method that will give you these because they aren't
defined. If you can answer the question "given a corpus and a set
of queries and the correct ordering of the relevant documents, how
close does Lucene come to that ordering?", then you could calculate
whether all the docs that should have been returned were found (recall)
and whether the documents returned contained only the documents
that should have been returned (precision).

But a lot of effort in Solr/Lucene tuning is tweaking returned results
to make precision and recall "better", where "better" is understood
relevant to a particular problem space and aren't well defined in
the abstract (and perhaps can't be).

Best
