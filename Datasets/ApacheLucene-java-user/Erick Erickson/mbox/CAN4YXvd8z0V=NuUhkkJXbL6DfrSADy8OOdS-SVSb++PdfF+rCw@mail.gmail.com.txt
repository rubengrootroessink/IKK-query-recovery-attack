It's certainly possible as others have said, but don't be surprised
if it's not performant. At root, you still have a disk out there that's
being used for fetching the data. Simply moving it from fetching
individual files to fetching that data from the index doesn't change
that fundamental fact.

Before jumping to this conclusion, you might want to instrument
your code or use one of the profiler tools to see where the actual
bottleneck is rather than assume you know (if you haven't already).

Seriously, you *must* determine whether the file I/O is the problem
or whether you're, say, CPU bound or else risk wasting
lots of time and energy and still not fixing the problem.
