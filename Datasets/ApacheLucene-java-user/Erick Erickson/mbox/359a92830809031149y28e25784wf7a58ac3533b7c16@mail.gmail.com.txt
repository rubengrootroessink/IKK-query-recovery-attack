DATE: 3 Sep 2008

This has been discussed multiple times, so looking at the
searchable archive will give you more detailed info. But as
I remember, the consensus suggestion was to index some
"impossible" value for those documents that lack a field.
For instance, say your field was "sometimes". I document
that had nothing to index for that field could get a value of
"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ".

Now your query is simple sometimes:ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
