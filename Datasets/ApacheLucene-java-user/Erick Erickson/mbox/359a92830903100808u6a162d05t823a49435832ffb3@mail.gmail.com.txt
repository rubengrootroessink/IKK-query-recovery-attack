SUBJECT: Re: A model for predicting indexing memory costs?
DATE: 10 Mar 2009

You have my sympathy. Let's see, you're being told "we can't give
you the tools you need to diagnose/fix the problem, but fix it anyway".
Probably with the addendum "And fix it by Friday".

You might want to consider staging a mutiny until "the powers that be"
can give you a solution. Perhaps working with the system admins to
set up profiling. Perhaps a temporary ID that has enough privileges to
do what you need that can then be deleted. Perhaps.......

In case you're wondering, I've been in that situation often
enough that I get really belligerent when being told to solve problems
while wearing a ball-and-chain. Invariably it takes more company
time/resources than getting what I need to go forward directly.

I mean, you'll be in a situation where you'll only be able to say
"Well, I changed some things. Whether they were the right things
I really can't say because I don't understand the root of the problem
because you silly people won't let me use a profiler". And, even worse,
if the problem goes away after you change something, you won't be
able to say very much about whether or not it'll come back since you
really don't know whether you've actually fixed anything or just masked
the problem temporarily with the possibility that it'll come back when
you add document N+1. By which time you (and others) will have to
reconstruct all you know now, which is expensive.

So, be much more diplomatic than this note, please <G>. But you may
want to point out that without appropriate tools, your company may
well spend significant time, yours and others, repeatedly trying to
fix this issue. Through n+1 rounds. I've actually had good results
by pointing out that it's not only *your* time that's at risk, but
customers' time too. Whether you define customers as internal
or external is irrelevant. Every round of diagnosis/fix carries the risk
that N people waste time (and get paid for it). All to avoid a little
up-front costs due to admin privileges (in this case).


OK, enough ranting..
