You might get some joy from WhitespaceAnalyzer, but beware of case and
punctuation. You could pre-process your indexing and querying to remove
non-alphanumerics.

Or you could create your own analyzer, see SynonymAnalyzer in Lucene In
Action, and there's another example here: http://mext.at/?p=26.

The idea is to string together some number of Filters, starting with a
Tokenizer that "does the right thing",  and create your own Analyzer.

But as far as I know, there's nothing out of the box that does what you
want.
