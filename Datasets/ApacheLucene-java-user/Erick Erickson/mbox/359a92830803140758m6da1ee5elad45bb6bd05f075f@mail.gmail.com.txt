DATE: 14 Mar 2008

Doc IDs are assigned at index time and can change over time That is,
deleting
a document and optimizing (and other operations) can and will change
document IDs. So, yes, you have to do a search (either use a hits object
or one of the HitCollectors) in order to delete by doc ID.

You can also delete by terms, see the API.

There are other options, but you haven't explianed what you're
trying to accomplish enough to offer any more suggestions.
