SUBJECT: Re: How to loop through all the entries for a field
DATE: 22 Oct 2009

Try something like
TermEnum te = IndexReader.terms(new Term("BookTitle", ""));
do {
    Term term = te.term();
    if (! term.field().equals("BookTitle")) break;
    System.out.println(term.text());
} while (te.next());


Note that next() will merrily continue beyond the last term for
the field "BookTitle", so you have to check that you're still
where you want to be.
