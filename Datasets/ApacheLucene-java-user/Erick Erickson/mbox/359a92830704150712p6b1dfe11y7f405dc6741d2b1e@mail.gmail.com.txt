well, how much data are we talking about here? If your index
is already 100G, your options are much more limited than if
it's 1M...

Essentially, you have several choices:
1> de-normalize your data to whatever extent is "sufficient"
    and index it.
2> Try to do what amount to joins. If your needs aren't too complex,
     you can probably do some interesting things with
     TermEnum/TermDocs, but I should emphasize the word *simple*
     in the relationships or else you'll be re-inventing an RDBMS <G>.
3> You can mix-n-match. That is, use Lucene to index searchable
     data and use the database for some portion of your joins.

Best
Erick
