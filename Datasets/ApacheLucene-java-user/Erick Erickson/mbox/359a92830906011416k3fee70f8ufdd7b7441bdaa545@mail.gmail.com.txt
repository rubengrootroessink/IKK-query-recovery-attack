DATE: 1 Jun 2009

It's really unclear to me what
PhysicianFieldInfo.FIRST_NAME_EXACT.toString()
returns. I assume the intent is to return a field name, but
how that relates to
FIRST_NAME_EXACT(Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED)

doesn't mean anything to me. Could you provide some details?

Note that if you specify a sort field that isn't in the document it
has no effect (i.e. if your
PhysicianFieldInfo.FIRST_NAME_EXACT.toString()
returns something like "2309884@").

I'll ask the dumb question: you *are* passing your
sort object(s) to the search, right?

Finally, take some care about capitalization. My memory is weak,
so check that your casing on the sort fields isn't messing you up.
I'd think about lower or upper case everything you expect to sort on
when indexing since you're not displaying it anyway.....

Best
