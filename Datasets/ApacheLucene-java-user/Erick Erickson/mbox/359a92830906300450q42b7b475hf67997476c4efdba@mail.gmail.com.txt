in Ian's link, particularly see the section "Don't iterate over morehits
than necessary".

A couple of other things:
1> Loading the entire document just to get a field or two isn't
     very efficient, think about lazy loading (See FieldSelector)
2> What do you mean when you say "not very good"? Using too
      much memory? Slow?

Perhaps if you gave us a higher level idea of what you're trying to
accomplish we could make better suggestions.

Best
