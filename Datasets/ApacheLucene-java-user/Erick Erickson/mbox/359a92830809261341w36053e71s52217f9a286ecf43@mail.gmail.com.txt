That certainly doesn't look right. What analyzers are you using at index
and query time?

Two things that will help track down what's really happening:

1> query.toString() is your friend.
2> get a copy of the excellent Luke tool and have it do its explain magic on
your query. Watch that the analyzer you choose when querying is what you
expect....

If neither of those things sheds any light on the problem, let us know what
you find....
