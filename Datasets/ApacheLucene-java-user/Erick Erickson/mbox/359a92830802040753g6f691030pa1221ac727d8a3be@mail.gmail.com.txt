ummmm index smaller documents? <G>

You cannot expect to index a 1G doc with 512M of memory in the JVM.
The first thing I'd try is upping your JVM memory to the max your machine
will accept.

Make sure you flush your IndexWriter before attempting to index this
document.

But I would not be surprised if this failed to solve the problem. What's in
this massive document? Would it be possible to break it up into
smaller segments and index many sub-documents for this massive doc?
I also wonder what problem you're trying to solve by indexing this doc.
Is it a log file? I can't imagine a text document that big. That's like a
100 volume encyclopedia, and I can't help but wonder whether your users
would be better served by indexing it in pieces.
