Index files should not be disappearing unless you're using the form
of opening an indexwriter that creates a new index. We'd need to see
the code you use top open the IW to provide more help.

If all you're doing is looking at the index directory, segments will disappear
as they are merged so that's also what you might be seeing. Can you give
us more details?

A good time to commit? Well, that depends. It really depends upon your app.
Given what you've described, and assuming that you've set reasonable
numbers for, say, setMaxBufferedDocs, setRAMBufferSizeMB just letting the
commit happen when you close is probably fine.

What do you hope to accomplish by executing maybeMerge()? Personally I'd
stay away from that unless you're solving a specific question and just let the
segment merge process operate to handle all that...

Best
