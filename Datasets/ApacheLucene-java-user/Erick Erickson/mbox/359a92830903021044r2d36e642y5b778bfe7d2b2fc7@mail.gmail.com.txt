See page 88 in Lucene In Action for a fuller explanation, including
ordering considerations.

But basically, phrase query slop is the maximum number of
"moves" be required to get all the words next to each other
in the proper order. If you can get all the words next to each
other within slop moves, you succeed.

So, it's not pairwise. I don't want to reproduce the example
in the book, but that'd be the place to start.
