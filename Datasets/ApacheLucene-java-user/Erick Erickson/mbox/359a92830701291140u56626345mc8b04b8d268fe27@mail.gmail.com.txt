Sure, your problem is probably that the query goes through an analyzer and
its associated tokenizer. Probably something like StandardAnalyzer which
"massages" the input and strips out most non-alphabetic characters,....
except some. It tries to be smart about URLs, e-mail addresses, etc.

If you're new, I recommend you use WhitespaceAnalyzer until you get familiar
with what analyzers do for you. Be aware that WhitespaceAnalyzer does NOT
automatically lower-case your input, so "Which" won't match "which". It's
easy enough to make your own analyzer by subclassing of the standard ones.
The book "Lucene in Action " is valuable for this, although you should be
aware that it was written to the 1.4 codebase, so there are a few
differences.

It is important that the analyzer you use at *index* time is compatible with
the one you use at *query* time. Until you're more familiar with this, I
simply recommend you use the *same* analyzer at index time that you use at
search time. That'll give you more intuitive results. You'll want to refine
the use of analyzers later...

I also recommend that you get a copy of luke (google lucene luke). It will
allow you to examine your index, parse queries through the GUI, examine the
effects of different analyzers on input etc. It's a great tool and one
that'll make your life much easier.

Best
Erick
