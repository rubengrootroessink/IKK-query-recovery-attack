What you have to do here is *construct* a filter. This is often accomplished
by walking the terms (via TermDocs) to construct your Filter, then passing
that filter in. The Filter can be cached (CachingWrapperFilter as I
remember)
if desired for later reuse.

I *think* a filter restricts the documents to be scored, which is, indeed,
faster. But
the cost is that the field filtered on doesn't contribute to relevancy
scoring. Which
may be OK. The question to answer first is whether you care. If simply
adding the
clauses to the query is simpler and fast enough, the added complexity of
creating a filter is debatable. That said, you know your problem space and I
don't....

This confuses me. Why do you want to? If you're not going to return the docs
anyway,
why filter them later?
