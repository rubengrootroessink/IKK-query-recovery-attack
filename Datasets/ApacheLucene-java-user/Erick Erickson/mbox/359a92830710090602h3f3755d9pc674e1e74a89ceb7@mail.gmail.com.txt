I certainly applaud your effort to dig in and find out what's going on!

However, I suspect you'll get farther faster by trying one of several
tactics:
1> post the indexing code and the searching code in snippet form. This
    kind of issue is usually a problem with analyzers. That is, perhaps
    you're using one analyzer for indexing and a different one for
searching.
    Or you've made a typo in, say, the field name. Or.... Phrases certainly
    work for many people <G>.
2> Just let Luke reconstruct the document in question for you and inspect
     the reconstructed document. You can cut-n-paste the contents of a
     field into an editor and just search......
3> back out any complex analyzers you're using and just go with
     something like SimpleAnalyzer. Once that's working, work up
     from there. A unit test and/or small self-contained program
     will work well for you here.
