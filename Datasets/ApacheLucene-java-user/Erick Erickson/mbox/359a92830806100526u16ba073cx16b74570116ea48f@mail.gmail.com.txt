You add as many fields to the document while indexing as you need to
correctly contain your "image stuff".

If this answer seems cryptic, it's as clear as your problem statement
<G>. To give you a meaningful answer, we need a much clearer
problem statement. What is "image stuff", what format is it in, and
what do you want to do with it?

Lucene doesn't index binary data...
