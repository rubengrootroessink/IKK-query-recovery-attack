Your problem is out of my experience, so all I can suggest is that you
search the list archive. I know the idea of faceted searching has been
discussed by people with waaay more experience in that realm than I have
and, as I remember, there were some links provided....

I just searched for 'faceted' on the e-mails I've seen since I subscribed to
the list, and there are certainly discussions out there...
