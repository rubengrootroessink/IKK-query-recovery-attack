SUBJECT: Re: Query about Query.ToString()
DATE: 17 Feb 2010

Well, Query *does* implement the Serializable interface, so that
might work. WARNING: I haven't personally used the Serializable
interface on Query, so I have no real clue whether it's applicable!

Taking the results of query.toString() and pumping it back through
the parser is not guaranteed to produce an equivalent query though.

But if you're creating a library of queries, why not just code up the
queries
as strings and store/reuse those?

I'd think about forming a query that I can send through the query parsing,
then storing that string for later reuse (i.e. the string you parsed). This
has
problems if you're constructing the query programatically (say assembling
a BooleanQuery in the lucene code) though.

not much help I know
Erick
