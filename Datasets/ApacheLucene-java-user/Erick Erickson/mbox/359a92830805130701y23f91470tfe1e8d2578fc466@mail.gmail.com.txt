SUBJECT: Re: Exact match query on a field in index which has been indexed using StandardAnalyzer
DATE: 13 May 2008

First, why do you OR together the different cases? Assuming
you're pushing your query through StandardAnalyzer, it'll lowercase
for you (just as it did during indexing).

But to your question. Would you expect your query to match a document
with the field value "Member of Technical Staff for Accounting"? because
your phrase would match this as well.......

Not to mention stop words. "Member Technical Staff" would be equivalent to
your query, is that acceptable?

Probably the simplest way would be to index the field UN_TOKENIZED too
(perhaps normalizing it by, say, lower casing it and taking out stop words)
and search against the duplicate field with KeywordAnalyzer. Yes it'll cost
you some space but disk space is cheap <G>. How big is your index anyway?

I suppose you could also STORE the field and take any documents returned,
get the field and compare, but then stop words, casing, etc are tricky.

What is the use case you're trying to support? There may be other ways
to accomplish your goal than messing around with exact matches.
