You need to give us more information for meaningful replies, like
the analyzers you use when indexing and searching, the exact
query you use, perhaps the snippets of the code, etc.

That said, things to check:
Get a copy of Luke and examine your index. You can even
run queries through that tool and see what gets sent to the
database and what responses you get with those analyzers.

Make sure you're analyzers at query and index time are doing
what you expect. Query.toString() is your friend. If you don't
take the time to understand analyzers, you'll spend lots of time
spinning your wheels.

And you really should wait more than 9 minutes before pinging
the list....

Best
Erick
