I think you can use this form
*QueryParser<file:///C:/lucene-2.0.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/queryParser/QueryParser.html#QueryParser%28java.lang.String,%20org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer%29>
*(String <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html> f,
Analyzer<file:///C:/lucene-2.0.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Analyzer.html>
 a)  where the analyzer is a PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper. Then use the same
analyzer you used during the indexing process.

This is Lucene 2.0...
