Mostly, the difference is in the sorting. Your
example (1) scores by document relevance whereas
your example (2) sorts by whatever is in fieldName.

example (2), because it is sorting, will try to
cache all the distinct *terms* in your index for that field,
which is probably where  your out of memory is
coming from. The number of documents
is irrelevant here, what is relevant is the number of
distinct terms in your "fieldName" field.

I'd get a copy of Luke to look at your index and see if it's
what you expect.

And yes, increasing memory should help. How much memory
are you running with when you get the OOM error? Sometimes
the default memory allocation is very small and most of it's taken
up with the program leaving very little left over for caching.

Best
