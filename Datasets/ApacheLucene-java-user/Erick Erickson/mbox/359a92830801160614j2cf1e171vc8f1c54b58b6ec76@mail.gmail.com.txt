SUBJECT: Re: constructing query from string
DATE: 16 Jan 2008

As I remember from various threads, toString is more of
a debugging aid and you cannot completely rely on the
transformation from a parsed query -> tostring -> parsed query
to be reliable. But this is "something I remember", so take
it with a grain of salt (you might want to search the mail
archive to see if my memory is correct).

That said, use BooleanQuery to add as many clauses in
as many ways as you want.

Actually, I don't know how I'd go about storing a programmatically
constructed query, I'd sure like to know if there's a way. You could
certainly store the original query if you were taking user input and
parsing it...

Best
