You might get some good pointers by searching the mail archive for
"faceted search", or perhaps just "faceted". I vaguely remember that
the whole notion of sub-dividing result sets into bags of documents
was discussed under that heading, quite an extensive discussion
as I remember, and certainly not a term that jumps to mind <G>.


The other thing you might be able to do is combine a HitCollector with
a FieldSortedHitQueue. The idea here is to use a HitCollector to
gather the hits, and put the results in a FieldSortedHitQueue whose
comparator is sensitive to your unique doc ID (Not Lucene's id, but
the one it looks like you've assigned to your docs) and the user's
preferred language.

One caution about the second approach, you may slow your search
down dramatically if you go out and fetch each document to get
its ID and language. But if the fields are indexed, you can use TermDocs/
TermEnum to get them quickly.
