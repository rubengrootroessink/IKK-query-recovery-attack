SUBJECT: Re: Performance and index size (rephrased question)
DATE: 31 Mar 2011

5-10 G indexes are pretty small by Lucene/Solr standards, so
given reasonable hardware resources this should be no problem.
That said, only measurement will nail this down. But an
often-used rule of thumb is that you need to consider some
better strategies in the 40G range.

CAUTION: you haven't specified what hardware you're running on,
64/32 bit? Memory available? Other things running on your
machine?

You might want to review:

As to your second question, why do you care? If you simply
optimize every so often (say daily or weekly) you'll reclaim all
the space anyway and avoid operational/programmatic
complexity. I'd venture that you won't notice any performance
difference unless you're changing your documents at a
furious rate.
