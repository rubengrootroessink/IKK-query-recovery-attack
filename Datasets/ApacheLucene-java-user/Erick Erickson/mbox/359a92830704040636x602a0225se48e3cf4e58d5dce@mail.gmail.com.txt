The default operator for QueryParser is OR, so what you may really
be getting is hits on Mill, and Vally is irrelevant.

But this is just a guess, it'd be way more helpful if you told us what
your index structure was and what query you actually submitted,
for which query.toString is really helpful.

And if you haven't gotten a copy of Luke, you should. It'll help
you examine your index, see how different queries parse (be sure
to set the Analyzer you use in Luke), etc.
