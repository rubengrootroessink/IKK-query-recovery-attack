SUBJECT: Re: How to do Multiple-Cluster Query?
DATE: 1 Apr 2011

You might consider a multiValued field and a positionIncrementGap longer
than the longest <a, b, c> tuple.
At that point, you can search for phrase queries where the slop is less than
the positionIncrementGap.

I'm a bit rushed, so if you need more details we can talk later....
