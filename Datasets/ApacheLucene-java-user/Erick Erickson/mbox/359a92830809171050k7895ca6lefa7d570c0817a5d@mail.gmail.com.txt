A couple of things come to mind:

1> are you absolutely certain that you're opening the index
    file you *think* you are? I'd try being really crude and renaming
    the index file and restarting my server. Perhaps you're
    pointing to the index on the *old* server when searching.

2> Are you absolutely sure you're closing and reopening your
     readers after the update? You'd be able to tell this by restarting
     your server and seeing if your searches worked then.

3> Get a copy of Luke and examine your index, that'll tell you a lot
     about how it's changing (or not).....

Sounds to me like somehow there's a mismatch between the index you're
updating and the one you're searching, but that's a WAG.
