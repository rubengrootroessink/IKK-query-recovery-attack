When you say it isn't working very well, what do you mean? It's slow? It's
not removing what you expect? If the latter, I suspect you're tokenizing the
term when you index such that it's not being found correctly....

You need to, somehow, get the Lucene document ID to remove. You can either
do a search, or you can use the termenum/termdocs classes to find out what
documents contain the term you want.
