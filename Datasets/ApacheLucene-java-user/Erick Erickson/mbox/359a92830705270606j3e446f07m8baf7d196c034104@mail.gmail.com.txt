First, if you haven't already, get a copy of Luke and use it to examine
your index and see how your query parsed. The colon's ":" are part
of the Lucene query syntax, so I have no idea what now
contents:Sense:sense parses.

Second, what analyzers were you using both at index and query time?
Standard analyzer, for instance, lowercases the terms.

Third, take the time to read over the FAQ at
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ

Fourth: have you tried query.toString() to see what
the results of the parse are? If so, please post it.

Best
Erick
