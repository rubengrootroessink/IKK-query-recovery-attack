SUBJECT: Re: Deleting the result from a query or a filter and not a documents specified by Term
DATE: 19 Aug 2007

Chris:

I didn't understand how your first solution would work,
 so I tried it. The terms I extracted from the rewritten
query were just the four raw terms, i.e.

field1:query1
field1:query3
field2:query2
field2:query4.

So iterating over and deleting them term by term wouldn't
preserve the sense of the original query
(field1:query1 AND field2:query2) OR (field1:query3 AND field2:query4)
and would delete (presumably) more documents than just
the documents matching the query.

So what am I missing?

Thanks
Erick
