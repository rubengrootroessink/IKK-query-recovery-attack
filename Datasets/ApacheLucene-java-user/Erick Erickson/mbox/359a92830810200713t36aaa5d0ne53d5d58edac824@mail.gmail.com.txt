Let's claim you have build indexes in this order (by date).
index1
index2
index3

Now if you addindexes clause has them ordered the same way, then,
in the merged index, the first docID from index 2 will be greater than
the last doc id from index1 in the merged index. The first doc id from
index 3 will be greater than the last doc ID from index2.

But, if you ordered them as:
index2
index1
index3
in your addindexes statement, the first doc ID from index 1 will be greater
than the last doc ID from index2. etc.


But I'd recommend that you think carefully about whether you care
or not. Building your app such that it's sensitive to the ordering of
Lucene's internal document IDs should be done with care, and
only after you're absolutely sure that the other options don't work.
For instance, indexing a date field instead and sorting on that....

Best
