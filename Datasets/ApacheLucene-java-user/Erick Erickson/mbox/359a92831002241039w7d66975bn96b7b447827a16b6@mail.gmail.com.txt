OK, I'm confused. In your original message, you said that
changing analyzers is NOT an option. Then you said you'll
give WhitespaceAnalyzer a shot....

Assuming your original constraint is accurate,
why isn't changing analyzers an option? Are you aware of
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper which allows you to specify different
analyzers for different fields? If absolutely necessary, you could
copy the field indicated into another field that you use for this case,
which would isolate this change from any other part of your index.

Be aware that WhitespaceAnalyzer does NOT fold case, so
groupc would not match groupC.

But it's easy to fix this. You can either take care to lowercase
your input and query streams, or compose your own analyzer
from, say, lowerCaseFilter and WhiteSpaceTokenizer to handle
all that automatically.
