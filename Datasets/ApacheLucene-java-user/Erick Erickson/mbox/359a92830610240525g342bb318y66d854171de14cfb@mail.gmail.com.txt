Could you specify why the score is not suitable? What is it you're trying to
do that isn't working correctly?

At a guess, I'd suspect that if you're using, say, StandardAnalyzer during
index time, the input stream is being tokenized differently than you expect.
And, depending upon what analyzer you use at query time, you could be seeing
results that are surprising.

But that is only a guess since I don't know what behavior you would like to
see but do not see.
