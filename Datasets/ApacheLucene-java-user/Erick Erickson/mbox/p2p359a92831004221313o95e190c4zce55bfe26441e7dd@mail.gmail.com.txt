You have to provide more info, especially the search code you're
using. How many documents in your index? What are you measuring?

Anything else you can think of that might help people diagnose
your issue.

Also, consider asking on the .Net user's list.

Known things to look for (in Java).
1> Are you re-opening an index reader each time? Don't
2> Are you sorting? If so, the first querie(s) will fill internal
   caches, this takes time. Time subsequent searches.
