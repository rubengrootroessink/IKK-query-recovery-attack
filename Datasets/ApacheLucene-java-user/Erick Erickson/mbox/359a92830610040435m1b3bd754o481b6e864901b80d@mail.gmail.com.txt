Don't interpret my reponses as *recommending* a database, since I don't know
much about your problem space. It may or may not be the right choice.
Mostly, I was thinking that your particular use of lucene as stated wasn't
playing to lucene's strengths.

It may well be that lucene is a fine choice if you re-think your solution,
but then again, maybe not.

Best of luck
Erick
