SUBJECT: Re: PrefixFilter and WildcardQuery
DATE: 17 Oct 2006

Well, depending on what you mean by wildcard, a prefixfilter isn't
necessarily what you want. If wildcard means abc*, then prefixfilter is
right. If it means ab*cd?fg, a prefix filter isn't useful unless you want to
do some fancy indexing.

Think about writing your own filter. Wrap it in a ConstantScoreQuery and put
as many of these together in a BooleanQuery as you want, anding and oring
and notting as you see fit.

 It's a good thing you don't want scoring, since ConstantScoreQueriy doesn't
support it <G>.

You could also do something similar with regular expressions (there are
classes to support this in the 1.9 API, contrib section).

There's also CachingWrapperFilter if you think your filters will be re-used.

Here's an example of a wildcard filter (Lucene 1.9) ...

public class WildcardTermFilter
        extends Filter {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;


    protected BitSet bits = null;
    private String   field;
    private String   value;

    public WildcardTermFilter(String field, String value) {
        this.field = field;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public BitSet bits(IndexReader reader)
            throws IOException {
        bits = new BitSet(reader.maxDoc());

        TermDocs         termDocs = reader.termDocs();
        WildcardTermEnum wildEnum = new WildcardTermEnum(reader, new
Term(field, value));

        for (Term term = null; (term = wildEnum.term()) != null;
wildEnum.next()) {
            termDocs.seek(term);

            while (termDocs.next()) {
                bits.set(termDocs.doc());
            }
        }

        return bits;
    }
}

Hope this helps
Erick
