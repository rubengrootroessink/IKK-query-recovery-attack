You could always implement your own sorter, but I really have to ask why you
are storing things in your index case-sensitive in the first place. In the
above example, if you're searching on "banana", you'll get no hits. That may
be your desired behavior....

You could also store a sort field in your index that's lower-cased and sort
on that (as well as the case-sensitive field)
