SUBJECT: Re: Boosting hits based on a value in a field, without that field contributing to the search
DATE: 7 Dec 2007

It seems like doing something like pre-processing the query
(or equivlently, adding a BooleanClause to a BooleanQuery)
that expressed
(your original query) AND (field:foo^boost1 OR field:bar^boost2 OR
field:baz^boost3)
should do the trick. Or I'm just not understanding what you're doing at all
