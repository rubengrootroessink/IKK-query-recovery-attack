DATE: 22 Mar 2011

You can't. If by "normalize" you mean compare the scores
between two different queries, it's meaningless. The scores
from one query to another are not comparable.

If by "normalize" you mean make into a value between 0 and 1,
anywhere you have access to raw scores I believe you also have
access to the max score, and you can just divide.

But this smells like an XY problem. Can you back up and tell
us what the use case you're trying to solve is? Maybe there are
other possibilities.
