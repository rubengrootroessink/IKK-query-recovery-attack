Then the analyzer you're using when parsing the query is stripping them. It
must be different than the one you use when indexing somehow. At least
that's the only explanation I can imagine....

Perhaps, somehow, you are using a default analyzer when you parse a query?
Or you aren't specifying the field when you query and thus a default is
used? Or you are using a PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper and dropping through to the
default? or ????

Just for yucks, I'd try using WhitespaceAnalyzer on a query with something
you *know* exists in the index for a particular field and work my way up to
whatever your real problem is in small steps (since you can't post code
<G>)......
