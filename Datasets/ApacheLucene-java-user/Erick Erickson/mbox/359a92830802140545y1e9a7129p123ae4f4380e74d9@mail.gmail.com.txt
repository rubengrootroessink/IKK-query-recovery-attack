SUBJECT: Re: how to get the programmatic control over index's document id
DATE: 14 Feb 2008

I'm a little confused about what's happening here

Are you inserting a pre-existing primary key from the DB into your
Lucene documents?

Or are you using the Lucene doc ID as your primary key in the database?
If this latter, you're going to have many, many problems since the Lucene
ID can, and will, change. Sometimes surprisingly. So in this case speeding
up your app is the least of your problems <G>....

Assuming you're doing the former, you don't have to call getDocument to get
the DB primary key from your Lucene document. Look at TermEnum/TermDocs
which can give you the Lucene doc ID *from the index* rather than from the
document.
Of course, you'll have to index the DB PK in your Lucene document, but that
doesn't take much space....

And TermDocs/TermEnum is MUCH faster than getDocument....

But what problem are you really trying to solve? It sounds like you're
searching the
Lucene index, then trying to use the DB primary keys that you get back from
the search to do something in the DB. If this isn't the case, perhaps you
could explain the problem you're trying to solve a little more.
