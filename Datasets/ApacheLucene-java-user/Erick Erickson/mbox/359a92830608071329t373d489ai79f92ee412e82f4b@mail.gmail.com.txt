Well, I expect that defining "less common" is tricky and doesn't lend itself
to a canned answer <G>. Would it work to create your own list of stop words
(possibly very large) to use for indexing and/or searching? This would
simply exclude the "less common" words (as you define them).
StandardAnalyzer, for instance, can take a File of stop words in one of its
constructors.......
