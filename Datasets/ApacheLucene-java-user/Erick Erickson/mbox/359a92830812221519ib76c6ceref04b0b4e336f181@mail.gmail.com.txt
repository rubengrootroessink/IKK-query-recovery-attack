SUBJECT: Re: Field sorting when same doc has multiple values for a field
DATE: 22 Dec 2008

You're off in undefined territory. From the docs for the Sort
class:

<<<...Documents must contain a single term in such a field,
and the value of the term should indicate the document's
relative position in a given sort order. The field must be indexed,
but should not be tokenized, ...>

Whatever is actually going on under the covers, you can't
count on it anyway....

I'd create a "sort_letter" field that *only* got the single
value you want to sort on (as above) and sort on that....

Best
