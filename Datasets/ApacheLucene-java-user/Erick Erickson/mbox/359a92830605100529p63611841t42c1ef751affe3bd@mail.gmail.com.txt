I'll take a quick stab at it. What analyzer are you using with the query? In
the search page of Luke, near the upper right there's the "Analyzer to use
for query parsing:" box. You might try the WhitespaceAnalyzer, since that
shouldn't do anything "interesting". Also, below the search box on the
search page, you can get a lot of information from the "update" and "explain
structure" buttons.

These make a LOT of lucene's behavior clearer.

Finally, watch out for case. Lucene's comparisons are often
case-sensitive.....
