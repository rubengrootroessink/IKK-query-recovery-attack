I can answer a few of these. If you haven't yet, you'd do yourself a favor
to pick up the book "Lucene in Action". It's written to the 1.4 code-base,
the examples compile but give deprecated warnings for the 1.9 code base, and
need a few more tweaks for the 2.0 code base.

Also, download a copy of Luke. It's invaluable for looking at an index to
answer questions like "why isn't this query returning what I thought it
should?".

That said, see below, and understand that I have exactly one 500K document
(growing to 1M over the next few months) project under my belt with Lucene,
so my opinions are those of an relative novice....

I'll let folks who understand security answer this one <G>.



Is there a good explanation somewhere how to set up incremental

See Luncen in Action (LIA). The short answer is yes. In the simplest form,
you can just add new data to a currently-existing index. You probably want
to make a copy just in case your power goes out or something.

Then there's IndexMergeTool which I haven't used, but looks interesting.

Then there's the possibility of using a MultiSearcher, but I'll leave it to
the experts to talk about how that combines results....
