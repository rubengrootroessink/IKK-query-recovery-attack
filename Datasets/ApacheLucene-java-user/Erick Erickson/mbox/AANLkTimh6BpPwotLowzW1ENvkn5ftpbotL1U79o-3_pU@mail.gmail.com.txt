SUBJECT: Re: Which is the +best +fast HTML parser/tokenizer that I can use with Lucene for indexing HTML content today ?
DATE: 11 Mar 2011

Solr doesn't do it. There exist various tokenizers/filters that just strip
the HTML tags, but there's nothing built into Solr that I know of that
understands HTML, HTML-aware operations are outside Solr's purview.
