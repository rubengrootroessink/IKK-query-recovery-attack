Can't answer the second question, but the answer to the first is "no".
Not only are Lucene IDs internally generated, but they change when
you  delete/optimize.

Would caching filters help? Especially if you pre-computed them
at, say, warm up?

What problem are you trying to solve anyway? A statement of the
problem might get you better answers.....
