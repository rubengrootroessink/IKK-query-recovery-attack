What analyzer are you using at *query* time? I suspect that's where your
problem lies if you indeed "don't use any sophisticated analyzers", since
you *are* using a sophisticated analyzer at index time. You almost
invariably want to use the same analyzer at query time and analyzer time.

Please start a separate thread with your second question. Google
"Thread Hijacking" for the explanation of why that's a good idea.
