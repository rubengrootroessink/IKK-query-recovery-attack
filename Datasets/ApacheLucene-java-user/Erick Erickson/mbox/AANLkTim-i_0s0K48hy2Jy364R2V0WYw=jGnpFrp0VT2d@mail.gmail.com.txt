SUBJECT: Re: Am I correctly parsing the strings ? Terms or Phrases ?
DATE: 22 Mar 2011

A good habit to develop is to print out the toString() of the assembled
queries, that'll get you going pretty quickly understanding what the
query assembly is all about without having to wait for people to respond.

But the short form is that phrase queries require all the terms to be
adjacent, which may be what you want but may not.

BooleanQuery is just asking for all the terms. You should probably
normalize them.

Parsing is something like
Query query = QueryParser.parse("your text here");
and the returned query is what you pass to the searcher. This latter
will apply the analysis chains to your input and is probably perferred.

Best
