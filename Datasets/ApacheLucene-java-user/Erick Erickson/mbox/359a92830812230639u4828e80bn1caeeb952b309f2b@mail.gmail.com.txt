My first bit of advice would be to step back and take a deep
breath and "take off your DB hat". Lucene is a *text* search
application, not an RDBMS.

The usual solution is to flatten your data representation when
you index so you can use simpler searches. Others have
posted that it's hard to use Lucene to express relationships
satisfactorily.
