You've probably got it right. But I'd add a couple of things....

1> by using the correct analyzer at index and query time, the
casing will be taken care of for you.

2> you don't want UN_TOKENIZED for fields you search on
in general because there's no parsing. So if you indexed
"This is a String", searching on "This" or "this" wouldn't match.

3> In your code fragment, you didn't show what Analyzer you
use. This is way more important than you think.

4> get a copy of Luke (google lucene luke). It'll let you examine
your index and save you a world of hurt. There have been some
very nice improvements lately along with 2.1 compatability.

5> If you want searches and indexing to use different analyzers
on different fields, see PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper.

6> You'll probably find yourself storing the same data multiple
times, once for searching and once for displaying. So you'll search
on the lowercased, indexed field and display the UN_TOKENIZED
version since it'll retain the capitalization.

7> I think your underlying problem is that the syntax of the search
isn't correct. You're really searching on
NAME:color
defaultfield:me
defaultfield:mine

You want something like +NAME:color +NAME:me +NAME:mine
