SUBJECT: Re: how to store and reuse query
DATE: 2 Feb 2007

I doubt that this is a worthwhile place to spend your time. You're
introducing possibilities for error and saving very, very, very little time
I suspect. I'd only try this if you have *proof* that constructing the query
takes enough time to matter. Have you timed query construction to see if
it's actually a bottleneck?
