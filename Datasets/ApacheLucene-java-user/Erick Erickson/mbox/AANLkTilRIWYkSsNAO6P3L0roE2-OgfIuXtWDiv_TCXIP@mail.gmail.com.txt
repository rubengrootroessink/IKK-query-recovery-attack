You can construct your own analyzer by creating
it from a pre-existing Tokenizer
(e.g. WhiteSpaceTokenizer) and any number
of TokenfFilters (e.g. TokenFilter). You can
string any number of TokenFilters together
to get many different effects.

But I have to ask, why you want to keep capitalization?
and punctuation? Do you really want to fail to match
text indexed with "Erickson, Erick" with the query
"erick erickson"? That's often a source of frustration
instead of goodness.
