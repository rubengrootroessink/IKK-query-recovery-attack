SUBJECT: Re: Lucene as a primary datastore
DATE: 20 Jan 2010

My preference is to put the effort into preserving the original
source on the theory that I'm sure no information is lost that
way. So the suitability of Lucene to store it varies depending
upon the source IMO.

If it's raw text, then storing all the raw text in an un-indexed
field in Lucene might suit you well. But if it's a database,
there may be lots of meta-data codified in the design
(e.g. foreign keys, required fields, etc) that's hard to
preserve outside a DB, and that you may need someday....

So that's the first question I'd explore....
