Why do you want to do this? The reason I ask is that you're
making each clause very complex.....

For a single term, it's not very complex, but for something like
((A AND B) OR (C AND D)) NOT X

expanding A, B, C, D and X to, possibly many terms is...er...ugly.

You could think about ngrams, although I confess I've only seen
this on the lists, haven't worked with it myself.

If your goal is to be able to search exact match words (i.e. you
need to find "flash" when exactly "flash" was indexed, not "flashing")
there are better strategies....

So a bit more explanation of the problem could perhaps generate more
helpful responses.
