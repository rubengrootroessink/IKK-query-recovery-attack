Couple of things.

1> you can use a different analyzer to NOT remove stopwords. SimpleAnalyzer
comes to mind (though watch out for case). Look at LuceneInAction for an
explanation of several analyzers that are available.

2> If memory servers, Lucene defaults to indexing only the first 10,000
words of a document, so it's quite possible that you are missing parts of
your document. I believe this is configurable, but haven't had to delve into
it yet, but IndexWriter.setMaximumFieldLength looks promising...
