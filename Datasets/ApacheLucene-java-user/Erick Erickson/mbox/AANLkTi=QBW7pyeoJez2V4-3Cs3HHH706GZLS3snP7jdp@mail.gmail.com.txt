Why do you care? By that I mean that nothing you've written gives
us any clue whether you need to do anything about making things
faster. "Making things faster" is a laudable goal, but not worth worrying
about until you can confidently state you have performance issues.

And you've provided no details that'll help us help you. How big is
your index? What kinds of queries are you submitting? What are
your performance requirements? What kind of throughput are you
expecting (i.e. queries per second)? What kind of hardware are
you running on? What are your JVM settings?

This is for SOLR, but it might help if you reviewed it:
