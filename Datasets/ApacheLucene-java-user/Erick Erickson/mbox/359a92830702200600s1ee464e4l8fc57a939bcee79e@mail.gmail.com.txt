Is there a Lucene 2.1 compatible version of Luke hanging around that I've
overlooked or do I need to compile it myself?

The change notes for Lucene 2.1 indicate index format changes, and, sure
enough, when I tried to open a new index with my current version of Luke, it
doesn't work (something about "not a lucene index" <G>)...
