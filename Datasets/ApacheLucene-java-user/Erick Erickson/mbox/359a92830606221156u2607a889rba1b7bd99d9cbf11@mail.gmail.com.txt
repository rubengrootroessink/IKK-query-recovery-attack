How many documents are you getting in your result set? And how are you
dealing with those results? If you're looking at more than a hundred or so
using a Hits object, you are acutally re-executing the query every 100
results or so you examine. This has been discussed several times, you might
want to search the mail archive to get the full story.

Why, you may ask? The Hits object is optimized for the "usual" practice of
only being interested in a few of the most relevant documents. If you have
needs to process a large number of results, I believe that a HitCollector
(or TopDocs?) is the way to go...
