SUBJECT: Re: How specify the analyzer when created query with api?
DATE: 22 Sep 2008

What do you mean when you say "trying to use the lucene api to build
 queries"?
Are you trying to use BooleanQuery? If so, you either construct specific
clauses yourself (presumably by, say, tokenizing things yourself and
creating TermQuerys, PhraseQuerys, etc.) which *don't* need an
analyzer, or add Querys that you get from running stuff through
QueryParser that has a constructor that takes an Analyzer.

Code snippets or more specific questions would be a great help <G>...
Imagine yourself trying to respond to an e-mail like you sent. There
isn't enough information there to really understand the problem you're
trying to solve, so I have to guess.

Best
Erick
