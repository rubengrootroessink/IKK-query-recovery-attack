SUBJECT: Re: cannot retrieve the values of a field is not stored in the index
DATE: 5 Jun 2009

Enumerating terms will be inefficient compared to getting the stored field.I'd
try soring the fields first until and unless you can demonstrate a problem.
BTW, if you're not going to *search* on the field, there's no reason to
index
it at all.

Why do think you don't want to store the paths? How big is your index?
Are you running into any performance issues?

Best
