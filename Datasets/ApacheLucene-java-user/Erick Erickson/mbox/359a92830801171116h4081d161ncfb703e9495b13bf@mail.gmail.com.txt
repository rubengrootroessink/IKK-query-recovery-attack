You have to look at your analyzers. StandardAnalyzer
tries to respect things like e-mail addresses. Various
other analyzers you could use do things like break
on punctuation.

I'd suggest you get a copy of Luke and examine what
your index actually holds and you can look at the
parsed form of a query. Note that in Luke, you can
choose various analyzers for these steps.

So, you'll probably have to write your own Analyzer
(see Lucene In Action for examples).

And be sure that you use the same analyzer for
both indexing and querying unless and until you
really understand them.

Finally, show us your indexing and query code
if you want more suggestions, but please pare
out any unnecessary parts.....

Best
