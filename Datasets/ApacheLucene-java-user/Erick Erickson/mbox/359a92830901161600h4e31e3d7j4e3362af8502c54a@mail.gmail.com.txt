I think you forgot a set of parentheses, a close paren right before
the AND and an open paren right after AND

Depending upon how big your index is, a MUCH easier way to do
this is to index another field, call it all_text say, and add all your
terms to that field as well as to the individual one, then search your
all_text field instead....
