I'm not at all sure what you're asking.

I believe you can use a TermEnum with an empty term ("") to get all the
terms in a particular field.

If you're asking "how can I find all the fields in a document", well, that's
tricky. Since there's no requirement that every document have the same
fields, there's no way that I know of of asking "what are the names of all
the fields in the index". You have to "just know".

That said, given a document, you *can* enumerate all the fields in that
document. But that doesn't tell you anything about the fields of the *next*
document.

If none of this is relevant, could you give more details about what you're
trying to do?

Best
Erick
