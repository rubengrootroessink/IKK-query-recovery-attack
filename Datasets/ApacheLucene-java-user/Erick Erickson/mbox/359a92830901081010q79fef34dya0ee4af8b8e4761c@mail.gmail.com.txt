SUBJECT: Re: IndexSearcher - architecture - shortest possible latency between update of index (via IndexWriter/IndexReader) and querying the same using IndexSearcher
DATE: 8 Jan 2009

This topic has been discussed *very* extensively, so I'd recommend you
search the mail archive (see
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/MailingListArchives )
since there are more good ideas there than I can remember. But the short
answer is that you must open a new searcher for modifications to be seen.

There are schemes for real-time updating, (see the archive) but they all
take work. There are no out-of-the-box solutions that I know of.

I don't understand your last paragraph at all.
