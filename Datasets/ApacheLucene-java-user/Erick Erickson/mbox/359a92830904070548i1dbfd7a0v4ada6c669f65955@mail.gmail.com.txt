DATE: 7 Apr 2009

Do you want the dates to *influence* or *determine* the order? I
don't have much help if what you're after is something like "docs
that are more recent tend to rank higher", although I vaguely
remember this question coming up on the user list, maybe a
search of the archive would turn something helpful up...

But if you want the date to completely determine order you can
always sort by date, see some of the IndexSearcher.search(...sort...)
methods.
