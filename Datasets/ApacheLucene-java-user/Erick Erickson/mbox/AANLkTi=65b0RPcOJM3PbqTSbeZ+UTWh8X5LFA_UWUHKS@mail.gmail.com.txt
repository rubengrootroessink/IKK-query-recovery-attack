SUBJECT: Re: Combine data from index and db before sorting and pagination
DATE: 1 Sep 2010

The usual first choice when using Lucene to search database data is to
denormalize the db data into the index. Yes, it's redundant, but it's often
a better solution than trying to use both. Synchronization can be an issue,
but you have to deal with that anyway since you're indexing from the db
anyway.

 But you haven't given us any indication of how much data you're talking
about here. Without some such detail, it's really hard to make a
recommendation.
