You can answer an awful lot of this much faster than waiting for someone
to reply by getting a copy of Luke and look at the parse results using
various
analyzers.

And you can use query.toString() to see the parsed results as well.

Try KeywordAnalyzer for your query.

Combine queries programmaticaly with BooleanQuery.
