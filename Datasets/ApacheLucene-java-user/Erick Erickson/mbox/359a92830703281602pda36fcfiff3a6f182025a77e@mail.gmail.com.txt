Well, if you're adding data, you must be doing something with
it later. Are you sure the problem is in the index growing and not
how you use the data afterwards?

The reason I ask is that I found almost a 10-fold increase in
my apps performance when I used FieldSelector (Lucene 2.1)
to only load the important fields in my documents. See the
thread labeled

Lucene 2.1, using FieldSelector speeds up my app by a factor of 10+,
numbers attached

A quick test you could do is to time the actual search as
opposed to the overall response time. That is, just time
the call to Searcher.search, and collect the time you spend,
say, assembling whatever you do to respond separately to
see whether the search is killing you or your manipulation
after the search.

The take-away is that we're all surprised by the difference you're
seeing and I'm betting that it's something other than merely
adding 5% to your index size. What is left as an exercise for the
reader <G>.

Best
Erick
