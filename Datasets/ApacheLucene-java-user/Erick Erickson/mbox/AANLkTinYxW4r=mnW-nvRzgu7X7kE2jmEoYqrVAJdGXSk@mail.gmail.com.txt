that code has waaaaay too much stuff in it for your first application.
Hibernate
is in there and it looks, from the description, like it tries to search your
database.
I'd *strongly* recommend that you don't go there.

Try looking at
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#How_do_I_start_using_Lucene.3F
and this is a good place to start too.
