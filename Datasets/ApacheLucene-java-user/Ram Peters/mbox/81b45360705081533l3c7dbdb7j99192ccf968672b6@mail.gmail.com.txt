SUBJECT: Periodic Indexing DESIGN QUESTION
DATE: 8 May 2007

I am indexing documents periodically every hour.  I have a scenario.
For example, when you are indexing every hour and large document set
is present, it takes >1 hr to index the documents.  Now you are
already behind indexing for the next hour.  How do you design
something that is robust?

thanks.
