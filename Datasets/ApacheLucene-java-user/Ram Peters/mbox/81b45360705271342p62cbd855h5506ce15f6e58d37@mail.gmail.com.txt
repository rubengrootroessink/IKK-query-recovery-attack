SUBJECT: Re: Search Query AND OR for Title and Description Fields
DATE: 27 May 2007

What I like to do is search over multiple fields.  Multiple fields:
title and description.  I don't want to concatenate the title and
description field into one and search on that field, because title and
description have different boosting.

When I search over multiple fields for "object oriented programming",
it could appear both in title and description or on one of the fields
(either title or description).
