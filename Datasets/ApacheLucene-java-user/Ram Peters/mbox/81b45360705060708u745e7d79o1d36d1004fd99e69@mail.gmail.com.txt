SUBJECT: Search Result cutoff
DATE: 6 May 2007

How do you specify cutoff on search results?  If I want to sort the
search result, on other than relevancy, I don't want non related stuff
showing up at the top.  Is there way to set a cutoff, so only result
that falls between certain range are displayed?

Thanks.
