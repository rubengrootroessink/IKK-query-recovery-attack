SUBJECT: Lucene or Nutch ?
DATE: 5 Apr 2006

  Hi All,

I have to develop a protoype of a search/indexation system with the 
following characteristics,
1) High volume of data indexation but only with add and delete 
functionality (approximatively 10 PDF) => scalable architecture HDFS 
seems good.
2) Specific analysis chain and a given set of meta-data indexation.
3) Language Recognition
4) No graphical interface for searching is needed, no crawling is 
needed, Indexation and Search are performed with HTTP Request to a Servlet

What is the best starting choice for this : Lucene or Nutch ?

As far as I know Lucene is a good choice for 2 and 4, Nutch is a better 
choice for 1 and 3.

Is Nutch as configurable as Lucene regarding the indexation and search 
process and is it possible to write plug-in for specific analysis  ?

Bruno
