Thanks for your answer, I was not aware of the SOLR project,

There was a big typo here, I meant less than 10 Go of PDF files per day 
during one month => i.e. less than 300 Go of PDF files.
I made some tests with PDF files, 100Mo or Native PDF are converted to 
3Mo of index in lucene [The text was indexed but not stored].
