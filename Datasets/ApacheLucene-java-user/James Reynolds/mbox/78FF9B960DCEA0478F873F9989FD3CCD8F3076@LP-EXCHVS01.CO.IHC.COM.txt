SUBJECT: Is Lucene for Me?
DATE: 14 Sep 2005


Please forgive this low tech question, but I'm wondering if Lucene is an
appropriate solution for a challenge I'm facing.  I need a quick look up
method for a growing list of customers in a database (the alphabetical
select list has become too cumbersome).

Lucene seems to be an excellent option for a key word search, but I
wonder if it's overkill for my relatively simple need.  Have other users
leveraged Lucene in this manner?

Thanks for your advice,

JR
