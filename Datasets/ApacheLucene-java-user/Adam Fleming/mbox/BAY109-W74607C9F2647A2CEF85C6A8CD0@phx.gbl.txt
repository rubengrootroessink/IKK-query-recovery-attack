Hi Patrik

Thanks for the thoughtful responses.  I am not a pro with Searchers yet, but it seems like
closing + opening searchers would still result in a small period of unserviceability.  I would
also like to stick to the Directory API so that I can keep the option to use FS or RAM based
indexes.  

I think a slight extension to this idea may really do the trick.  It's as follows: 

1. Create Index A + Reader A.
2. set CurrentReader = A
3. After time interval T, build Index B + Reader B. 
4. set CurrentReader = B
5. After time interval T, rebuild Index A + Reopen A
6. set CurrentReader = A

etc. 

The advantage here being that the '=' operation is atomic and indivisible - the currentReader
variable always points to a valid and up-todate index.  Although this system doesn't GUARANTEE
there won't be a service interruption, in practice if T is long enough there shouldn't be
a problem. 


Thoughts?  I'm curious if this solution reflects a misunderstanding about the way Lucene works.



Thanks, 

Adam
