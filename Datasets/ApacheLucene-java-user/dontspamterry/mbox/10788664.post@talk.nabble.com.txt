SUBJECT: KeywordAnalyzer vs. Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED
DATE: 24 May 2007


Hi all,

I have an ID field which I index using the KeywordAnalyzer. Since this
analyzer tokenizes the entire stream as a single token, would you say the
end result is the same as using any analyzer and specifying this ID field as
untokenized? The latter approach does not use the analyzer so would that be
more "performant" than the KeywordAnalyzer since there is no call into the
analyzer's tokenization method? Is either approach acceptable or is there
one "proper" way of indexing fields where the entire field value requires an
exact match, i.e. untokenized? Thanks!

-Terry
