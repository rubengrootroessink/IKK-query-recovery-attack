SUBJECT: How are results merged from a multisearcher?
DATE: 18 May 2006

Greetings,

Could someone describe how the results from multiple indices are merged when
using a MultiSearcher? My naive intuition is that the scores for documents
found in each index could be wildly different, so what criteria is used to
merge the scored docs?

Many thanks in advance,
