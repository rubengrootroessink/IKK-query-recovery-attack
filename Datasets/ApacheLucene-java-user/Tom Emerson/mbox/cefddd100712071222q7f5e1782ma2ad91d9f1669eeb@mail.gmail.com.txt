SUBJECT: Re: Boosting hits based on a value in a field, without that field contributing to the search
DATE: 7 Dec 2007

Erik,

Thanks for the response. The issue with

(original query) AND (field:foo^boost1 OR field:bar^boost2 OR
field:baz^boost3)

means that the 'field' must have a value for the query to succeed, which
isn't always the case: there could be documents where 'field' has no value.
So unless I understand the BooleanQueries this would be a non-starter.

Or am I missing something?

Thanks again,
