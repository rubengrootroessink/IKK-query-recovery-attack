Autonomy's KeyView is an alternative to Stellent. It does not cover all of
the file formats that Stellent does, though many of them are probably not
interesting for most applications. When I last looked at it it did not
handle mail archives, though there was a plan to add it. I found it more
stable than Stellent, and it has a JNI interface that works quite well. It
is still quite expensive, however.

PDFBox works, but we found it to be really really slow.

YMMV,
