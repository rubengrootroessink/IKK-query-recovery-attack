You can utilize the CustomScoreQuery introduced in Lucene 2.2 to provide
this type of functionality. This is quite straight forward to do and works
really well. Since "recentness" is a function of the time the search was
made, we store the appropriate date in an index field and use a
CustomScoreQuery to effect changes to the score based on the current date.
Works like a champ.
