DATE: 11 Jan 2008

String fields are sorted using natural (lexicographic) order. For characters
in ASCII range this means uppercase letters will sort before lowercase
letters (e.g., 'A' U+0041 sorts before 'a' U+0061). This behaviour is
documented on in the JavaDocs for org.apache.lucene.search.Sort.
