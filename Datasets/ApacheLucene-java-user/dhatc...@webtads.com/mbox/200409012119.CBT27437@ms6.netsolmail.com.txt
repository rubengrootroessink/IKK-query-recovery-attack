SUBJECT: Building Lucene in Eclipse
DATE: 1 Sep 2004

I'm trying to use Ant to build Lucene within Eclipse, or 
rather trying to.  I've went to external tools and created a 
lucenebuild.xml entry.  Under location I have the build.xml 
file for lucene and the base directory is set to the lucene 
base directory.  Eclipse has the optional jar but I am 
getting the following error:

[Targets]: File: (mybasepath)/build.xml:11 :Unexpected 
element "tstamp"

Any ideas what is wrong/how to fix it?
