I'm trying to build Lucene with ant (in XP) from the prompt  
I got the ant-optional.jar from 
http://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/ because I 
couldn't find it anywhere else.  I'm running the newest 
version of ant and when I go into the lucene base directory 
and type 'ant' it finds the build.xml file but then gives the 
following error:  

BUILD FAILED
C:\lucene\build.xml:140: srcdir "C:\lucene\src\java" does not 
exist!

What am I doing wrong?
