SUBJECT: Phrase indexing and searching with Lucene
DATE: 18 Feb 2009



Hello everybody,

I use Lucene to index and search into text documents.
At present, I just index and search for single words. I want to extend this to phrases (or
nGrams).

Could anyone please give me details on how to index phrases and then make a phrase search?


Thank you very much in advance for your help.
