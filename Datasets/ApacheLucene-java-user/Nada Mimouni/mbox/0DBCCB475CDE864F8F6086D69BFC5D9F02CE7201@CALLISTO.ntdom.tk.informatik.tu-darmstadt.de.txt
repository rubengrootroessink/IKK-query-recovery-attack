Thank you Erick.

I need first to index phrases, the built-in phrase processing (with double quotes) comes in
the search step.  
Is there any difference between : 
            1) start by indexing phrases and then make a phrase search 
            2) index terms and then search for phrases


To make things clearer:

What I am doing now: 
 - In the indexing step:  I am using "IndexTermGenerator" to generate term based indexes,
one index for all queries I have and another one for documents (term means single word). 
 - In the search step : Lucene matches terms in queries index with terms in documents index.

What I need to do:
 - Index phrases ("multi" words) in addition to terms (single words)
 - Search for both : phrases and terms


Is there any idea on how to proceed?

Regards
Nada

Have you tried the built-in phrase processing with double quotes? e.g.
"this is a phrase"?

See the Term section at
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html
