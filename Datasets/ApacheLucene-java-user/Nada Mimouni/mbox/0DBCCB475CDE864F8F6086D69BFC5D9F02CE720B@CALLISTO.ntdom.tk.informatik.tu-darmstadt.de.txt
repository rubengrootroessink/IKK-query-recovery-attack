You need to create a TermQuery or PhraseQuery with terms in your query depending on what result
you need exactly. 

To create PhraseQuery, try the built-in phrase processing with double quotes, e.g.
"this is a phrase".

See the Term section at
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html

You can also have a look  at http://www.lucidimagination.com/Community/Hear-from-the-Experts/Articles/Getting-Started-with-Lucene/
