SUBJECT: Phrase indexing and searching with Lucene
DATE: 18 Feb 2009


Hello everybody,

In my research work, I use Lucene to index and search into text documents.
At present, I just index and search for single words. I want to extend this to phrases (or
nGrams).

Could anyone please give me more details on how to do it and also point me to some useful
references on this?

Thank you very much in advance for your help.

Best regards,
Nada Mimouni
