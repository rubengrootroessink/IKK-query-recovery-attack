Thanks for the tip!

I used the StandardAnalyser(Set stopWords) constructor and passed in an
empty stop words set. 

Now my queries in OR look like this:
+lastname:rhodes +state:or 

I think that solved the problem.

OR is both a stopword and a reserved word.... In this case you
*probably* are getting hit by it being a stopword.
Changing your analyzer to not use stopwords is probably the way to go,
but beware that you should probably use the same analyzer at index AND
query time.

If you're using StandardAnalyzer, you're getting your case folded, so if
you change analyzers be aware of that.

Get a copy of Luke to see the effects of various analyzers on queries
and to examine the actual contents of your index, it's invaluable.

PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper may be your friend <G>. It would allow you to
use a different analyzer for your "state" field than others, which may
be very useful.

Best
