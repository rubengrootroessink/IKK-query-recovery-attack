SUBJECT: Lucene 2.2.0 Strange QueryParser behavior
DATE: 27 Oct 2008

Hi all,
I'm hoping this is an easy question. I have a Lucene index that contains
names and states, and I'm having an issue when the state is Oregon,
specifically OR. Below is an example of the query I pass in and the
query string that QueryParser builds below it.
 
This works for every state except OR.
 
String I build: lastname:"rhodes" AND state:"AK"
QueryParser output: +lastname:rhodes +state:ak
 
This is what OR look like:
 
lastname:"Rhodes" AND state:"OR"
lastname:rhodes
 
As you can see the state:"OR" is cleaned off by QueryParser. Is there
any way around this?
 
Thanks for the time.
 
Bob
