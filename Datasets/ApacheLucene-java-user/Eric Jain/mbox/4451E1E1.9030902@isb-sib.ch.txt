SUBJECT: Preventing phrase queries from matching across lines
DATE: 28 Apr 2006

What is the best way to prevent a phrase query such as "eggs white" 
matching "fried eggs\nwhite snow"?

Two possibilities I have thought about:

1. Replace all line breaks with a special string, e.g. "newline".
2. Have an analyzer somehow increment the position of a term for each line 
break it encounters.

Latter seems a bit more complicated to implement, but it would also be more 
efficient, right? Or are there better options?
