Is it possible to expand a query such as

   foo bar

into

   (title:foo^4 OR abstract:foo^2 OR content:foo) AND
   (title:bar^4 OR abstract:bar^2 OR content:bar)

?

I can assign weights to individual fields when indexing, and could use 
the MultiFieldQueryParser - but it seems this parser can't be configured 
to use AND as default!
