I need to: Sort by a field containing 1M distinct strings. While I can't
afford to waste much memory for the entire duration of the application,
loading all strings into memory temporarily is possible. A solution may
therefore be to load all strings into memory, sort them, and then
replace them with sequentially numbered integers. The question is: Could
this approach work, or did I overlook anything?
