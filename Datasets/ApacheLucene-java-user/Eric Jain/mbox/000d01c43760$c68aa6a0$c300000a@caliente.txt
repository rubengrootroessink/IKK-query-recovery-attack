A range such as '10-60' is expanded into a boolean query containing all
terms that are in the index and lie within the specified range, e.g. '10
or 11 or 20 or 59'.

For sorting, Lucene loads into memory all terms that occur in a field
according to which someone may want to sort. Can't give you any further
information, as that's where I stopped reading :-)
