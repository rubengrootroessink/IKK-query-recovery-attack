I noticed that searching for terms that appear in a significant number
of documents tends to be relatively slow. For example

   foo AND (bar:yes OR xyz)

where every document has a field 'bar' with a value of either 'yes' or
'no'. Had a look at CachingWrapperFilter, unfortunately this class
doesn't seem to be any help here. Perhaps I need to create a CachedQuery
class that caches Weight objects for wrapped Query objects (and subclass
QueryParser to make use of this)? But would this work? Any ideas?
