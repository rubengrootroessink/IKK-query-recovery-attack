SUBJECT: Enumerating terms in reverse order
DATE: 24 Jul 2003

Is it possible to enumerate terms in reverse order? I see the TermEnum
class has only a next(), but no previous() method. Can this be worked
around, or would this be a sensible addition to the core of Lucene?

This would be extremely useful for sorting results from large
collections according to arbitrary fields.
