My personal issue with the StandardTokenizer is that it splits off
single letter prefixes, as in 't-shirt'. A query for 't-shirt' therefore
also returns documents with 't. miller's shirt'. I can't imagine how
this behavior could ever be considered useful or depended upon, but I
may be wrong (perhaps someone has an example where it does make sense).
