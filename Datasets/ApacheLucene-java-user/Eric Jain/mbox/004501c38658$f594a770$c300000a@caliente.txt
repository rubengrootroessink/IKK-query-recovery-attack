See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#IfInterpreterIsGPL:

"A consequence is that if you choose to use GPL'd Perl modules or Java
classes in your program, you must release the program in a
GPL-compatible way, regardless of the license used in the Perl or Java
interpreter that the combined Perl or Java program will run on."

MySQL AB, for instance, insists that you buy a license for their JDBC
driver if you intend to use it in a non-GPL application...
