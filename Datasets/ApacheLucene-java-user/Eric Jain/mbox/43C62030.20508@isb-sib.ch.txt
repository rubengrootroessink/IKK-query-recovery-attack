Yes, that's precisely what I am talking about. Sorry for being unclear.

I'd already be happy to get *any* phrases :-)

If the phrases could be ranked, I might prefer to pick the *most frequent* 
phrases. For example:

   anopheles anopheles malaria

("anopheles anopheles" is the latin name for the common mosquito)

I'd like to be able to suggest quoting this name to eliminate all the other 
mosquito species that also contain "anopheles" in their name.

There are lots of documents with "anopheles anopheles". There may also be a 
document or two where "anopheles" happens to appear next to "malaria", but 
these are less interesting here.
