SUBJECT: MultiPhraseQuery
DATE: 5 Mar 2006

I need to write a function that copies a MultiPhraseQuery and changes the 
field the query applies to. Unfortunately the API allows access to neither 
the contained terms nor the field! The other query classes I have so far 
dealt with all seem to allow access to the contained query terms...
