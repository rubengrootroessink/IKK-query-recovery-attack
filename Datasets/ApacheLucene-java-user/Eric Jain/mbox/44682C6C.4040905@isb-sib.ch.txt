Speaking of listeners: Would be great if there was a way to know when 
optimize() changes a document ID. Storing document IDs externally is the 
only way to merge Lucene queries with queries in a relational database 
efficiently (as far as I know), but the inability to track document ID 
changes complicates things a bit...
