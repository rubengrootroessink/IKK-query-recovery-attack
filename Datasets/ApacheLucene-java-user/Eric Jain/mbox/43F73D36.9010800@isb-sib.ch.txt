SUBJECT: QueryPrinter?
DATE: 18 Feb 2006

I need to parse a query string, modify it a bit, and then output the 
modified query string. This works quite well with query.toString(), except 
that when I parse the query I set DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND, and the output of 
BooleanQuery.toString() assumes DEFAULT_OPERATOR_OR... Would be great if 
this behavior could be changed through a static field, or perhaps someone 
has already written some kind of QueryPrinter that is a bit more flexible?
