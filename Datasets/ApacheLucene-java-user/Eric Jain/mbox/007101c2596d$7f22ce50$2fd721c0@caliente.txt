Has anyone written something like a GoogleQueryParser?

Such a parser would differ in the behavior of the default parser in the
following points:

- Default AND rather than OR.
- Treat a-b as "a-b" rather that a -b.
- Perhaps disallow ~.

I guess I could write my own QueryParser, just wanted to be sure it hasn't
been done already, especially as it seems to be something rather basic. Any
suggestions?

By the way, I was honestly surprised by the compactness of the indices
Lucene generates, as well its performance. I had always thought there was a
trade-off between good design and speed... great work!
