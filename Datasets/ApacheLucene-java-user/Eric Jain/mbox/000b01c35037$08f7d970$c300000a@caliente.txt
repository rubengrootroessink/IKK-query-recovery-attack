SUBJECT: Custom sorting by computed values

Is it possible to customize Lucene's scoring algorithm so that scores
are computed based on how close a vector stored in the index matches a
vector entered by the user? Queries may also contain other terms - those
however should only influence whether or not a document has a score
equal to or greater than zero, but not the score itself.

I had a look at Lucene's Similarity class, but couldn't quite see
whether such an approach would be possible, let alone how to go about
it. Any help is greatly appreciated.
