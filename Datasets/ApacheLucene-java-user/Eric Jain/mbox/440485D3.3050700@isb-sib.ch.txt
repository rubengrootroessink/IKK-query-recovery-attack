To be more precise: The patch reduced the time required to build one large 
index from 13 to 11 hours, though I vaguely remember it used to require no 
more than 9 hours. But there have also been some other changes that are 
none of Lucene's fault, so I'll rerun the indexing procedure with the old 
version overnight, just to be sure.
