I believe a term with a wildcard is expanded into all possible terms in
memory before searching for it, so if the term is 'a*', and you have a
million different terms starting with 'a' occuring in your documents,
it's quite possible to run out of memory.

Does anyone know if there is a setting that limits the number of terms
for wildcard queries?
