SUBJECT: SegmentReader using too much memory?
DATE: 11 Dec 2006

I've noticed that after stress-testing my application (uses Lucene 2.0) for 
I while, I have almost 200mb of byte[]s hanging around, the top two 
culprits being:

24 x SegmentReader.Norm.bytes = 112mb
  2 x SegmentReader.ones       =  16mb

The second one isn't a big deal, but I wonder what's the explanation for 
the first one?
