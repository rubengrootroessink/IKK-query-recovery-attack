There doesn't seem to be an Analyzer that doesn't do anything included 
with Lucene, is there? This would seem useful to prevent tokenization of 
certain fields in queries, together with the PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper. 
But perhaps there is a better way to accomplish this?

   private static class NullAnalyzer
     extends Analyzer
   {
     public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader)
     {
       return new CharTokenizer(reader)
       {
         protected boolean isTokenChar(char c)
         {
           return true;
         }
       };
     }
   }
