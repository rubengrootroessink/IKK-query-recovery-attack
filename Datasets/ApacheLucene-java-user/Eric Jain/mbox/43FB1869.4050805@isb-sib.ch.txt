I was wondering:

Is there any good reason why

   x AND y OR z

is interpreted as

   +(+x y z)

rather than

   +(+(+x +y) z)

?

If yes, any suggestions how this could be accomplished most easily?

Searched the mailing list, found something about a "PrecedenceQueryParser", 
but this seems to have disappeared?
