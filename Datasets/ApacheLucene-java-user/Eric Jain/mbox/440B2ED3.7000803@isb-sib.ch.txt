SUBJECT: QueryParser dropping constraints?
DATE: 5 Mar 2006

I've noticed that while the QueryParser (both the default QueryParser and 
the PrecedenceQueryParser) refuse to parse

   foo bar) baz

they both seem to interpret

   foo bar( baz

as

   foo bar

Bug or feature?

In any case, would be great if there was a "strict" mode, and a more 
lenient mode where incorrect syntax is ignored (as far as possible).
