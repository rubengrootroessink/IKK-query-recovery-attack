Didn't run these tests (maybe later, too lazy to set up the build 
environment at the moment), but I just swapped in the 
PrecedenceQueryParser, and all looks fine, and my (admittedly somewhat 
anemic) test suite doesn't detect any problems. I therefore assume that if 
there are any issues they are most likely less annoying and confusing than 
the weird boolean logic used by the default query parser...

In any case, thanks a lot for this code!
