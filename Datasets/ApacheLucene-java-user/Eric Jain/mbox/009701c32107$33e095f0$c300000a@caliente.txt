My current solution is to have all updates done through a JMX MBean.
This MBean is also responsible for (re)binding an IndexReader to JNDI at
startup and after updating.

A JCA wrapper would allow things such as whether or not the current
operation is being executed in a transaction to be passed on to such a
Lucene MBean - certainly useful if you intend to modify the index from
an EJB. Of course you would still have to implement the rollback
function yourself...
