SUBJECT: Generating phrase queries from term queries

Is there an efficient way to determine if two or more terms frequently 
appear next to each other sequence? For a query like:

a b c

one or more of the following suggestions could be generated:

"a b c"
"a b" c
a "b c"

I could of course just run a search with all possible combinations, but 
perhaps there is a better way?
