'test:[TO 100] test[200 TO]' would seem okay, though this would preclude 
the string 'TO' from being used to begin or end of a range - but who cares?

The problem I see here is that the QueryParser will most likely complain 
already before calling getRangeQuery. Nevertheless useful for padding 
numbers, e.g. '1' to '00000001'.
