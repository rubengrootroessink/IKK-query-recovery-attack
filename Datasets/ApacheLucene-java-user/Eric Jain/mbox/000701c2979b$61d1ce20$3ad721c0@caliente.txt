SUBJECT: Custom result ordering
DATE: 29 Nov 2002

Is any work being done to allow results to be sorted according to the value
of a specific field, rather than by score?

Maintaining an in-memory mapping of document IDs to sortable fields a la
SearchBean does not seem to be a practical solution when working with a
large set of documents (1M).
