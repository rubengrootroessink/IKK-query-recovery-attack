Read vs. write locks...

Anyways, having a JCA wrapper does not necessarily imply that the
resource must support transactions; nevertheless having such support for
Lucene would be very useful, though it is a lot of work, and to be
honest, things also work as is.

On the other hand not being able to use Lucene on an application server
without walking over some specifications may be a show stopper for some
projects, but then again I'm not part of the marketing team :-)
