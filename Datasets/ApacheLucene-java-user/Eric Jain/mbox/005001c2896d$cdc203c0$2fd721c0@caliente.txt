SUBJECT: Boost documents
DATE: 11 Nov 2002

Is there any way (or workaround) to boost the scores for certain documents?

My problem is as follows:

The documents I am indexing may contain a number of literature references,
the more the better. Unfortunately the scoring algorithm ranks documents
with a lot of references in their body lower, all else being equal.

On addition, there are two types of documents, automatically generated and
manually edited, latter being of higher quality.

The most convenient solution would be if Lucene Documents had a single
numeric boost factor field, but maybe there are other ways to achieve such
an effect?
