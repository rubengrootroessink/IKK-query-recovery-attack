Don't think there would be any benefit in spliting your index, unless
queries are usually restricted to one part of the index. We have a
similarly sized index that it is so fast, sometimes the query results
appear even before the user hits the submit button :-) The only thing
which can be slow is retrieving stored fields for lots of documents.
