I'm trying to extract the actual phrases, rather than scoring documents 
with terms that appear in the same order higher (though that would seem 
like a good idea, too).

The idea is that once I have the phrases, I can suggest something like 
"show only matches where a and b appear next to each other". Not terribly 
important, but if there was a simple and efficient way to accomplish this...
