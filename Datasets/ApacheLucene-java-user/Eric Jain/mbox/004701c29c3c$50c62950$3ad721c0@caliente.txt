Thanks. I'm not so much worried about temporary inconsistencies as the index
is maintained separately. Of course it would be great if Lucene provided
direct support for some kind of transactional integrity! Anyways, removing
all changed documents first means I have to scan through all documents
twice, not very efficient, though in fact faster than the procedure I
described.
