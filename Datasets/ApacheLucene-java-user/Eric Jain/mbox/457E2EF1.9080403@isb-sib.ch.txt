Come to think of it, I do have two large indexes that don't really need any 
document boosting, could perhaps save some memory there...

But what I still don't understand is why the amount of memory that is used 
by SegmentReader.Norm.bytes keeps growing -- at first quite fast to about 
150mb, then slower.

After startup:

11 x SegmentReader.Norm.bytes = 17mb


After searching some indexes once or twice times:

78 x SegmentReader.Norm.bytes = 79mb
  5 x SegmentReader.ones       = 16mb


After a few dozen queries on one of the indexes:

58 x SegmentReader.Norm.bytes = 158mb
  5 x SegmentReader.ones       = 16mb
