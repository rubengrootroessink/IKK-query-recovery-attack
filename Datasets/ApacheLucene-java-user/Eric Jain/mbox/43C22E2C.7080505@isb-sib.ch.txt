SUBJECT: Scoring by number of terms in field
DATE: 9 Jan 2006

Lucene seems to prefer matches in shorter documents. Is it possible to 
influence the scoring mechanism to have matches in shorter fields score 
higher instead?

For example, a query for "europe" should rank:

1. title:"Europe"
2. title:"History of Europe"
3. title:"Travel in Europe, Middle East and Africa"
4. subtitle:"Fairy Tales from Europe"
