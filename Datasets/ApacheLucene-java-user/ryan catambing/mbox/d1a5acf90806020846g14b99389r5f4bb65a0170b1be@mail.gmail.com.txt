SUBJECT: Lucene ignoring query to a field containing single character values
DATE: 2 Jun 2008

Hi All,


I am using Lucene-core-2.3.2.

One of the fields that I have indexed with Lucene contains a single
character value which stands for a code.  When I make queries using a
StandardAnalyzer lucene is ignoring queries against the said field when
using the required operator (+), however when trying out the reverse of the
condition using the prohibit operator (-) it works ok.

Below is a sample of the lucene query:

//This does not work. It just ignores the industrial codes and shows
documents with the term toys
+industrialCode:a +businessName:toys

//Trying out the opposite -- this works shows documents not having the
industrial code "a"
-industrialCode:a +businessName:toys

Any enlightenment would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Ryan
