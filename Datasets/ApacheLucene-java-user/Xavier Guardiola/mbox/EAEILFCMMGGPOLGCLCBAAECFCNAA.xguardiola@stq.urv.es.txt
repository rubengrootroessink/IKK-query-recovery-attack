SUBJECT: AND / OR mutiple term queris
DATE: 16 May 2003

Hi all,
I've got a question regarding how Lucene priorizes complex --like "yoggy
drop the honey pot"-- query results.
I wanted lucene to show first those results having ALL terms. By default
lucene doesn't do this, so I transform all user queries to + AND ("+yoggy
AND +drop AND +the AND +honey AND +pot"). It works nicely. However now I
face the need to show AFTER the ALL-terms-results those results where SOME
of the terms do appear. Is there a way of doing that easily?
Thanks!
