Yes that's what it should be, but I forgot to mention that I assign
different weights to different fields as well as different weights to
different documents. So I may end up with a doc not having all the terms but
the highest score.
That's why I don't see a trivial way of getting the results in the desired
order (first those with all terms and then the rest)...
