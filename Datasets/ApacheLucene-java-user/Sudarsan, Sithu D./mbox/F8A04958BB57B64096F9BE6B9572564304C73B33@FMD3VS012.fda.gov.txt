Our experience is, if the number of cores equal number of active
threads, then it performs optimal using single JVM.

Both on Windows XP and CentOS 5.2, with Lucene 2.3.2

Subject: Merging indexes & multicore/multithreading

Let's say I have 8 indexes on a 4 core system and I want to merge them
(inside a single vm instance).
Is it better to do a single merge of all 8, or to in parallel threads
merge in pairs, until there is only a single index left? I guess the
question involves how multi-threaded merging is and if it will take
advantage of all cores.

thanks,

-glen
