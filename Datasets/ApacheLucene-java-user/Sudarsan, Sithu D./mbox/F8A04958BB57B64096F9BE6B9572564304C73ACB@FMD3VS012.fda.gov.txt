Hi All,

I'm new to Lucene. 

1. Could you please tell me as to where do we see the old emails (even
one day old), not as an archived file  but as  a mailing list.
2. Where do we look for sample codes? Or detailed tutorials?
3. I found one at LuceneTutorial.com, but it is only for command line.
Not for web based one.

Thanks in advance,
Sithu
