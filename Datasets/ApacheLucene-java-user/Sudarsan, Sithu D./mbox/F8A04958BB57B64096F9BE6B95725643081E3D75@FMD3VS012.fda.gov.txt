If so,

Input1:  c1c2c3c4c5c6c7....
Input2: c1c2 c3c4 ...

I guess, they are different! Add a whitespace after commas and see if
that works...

Sincerely,

No, there is no whitespace after the comma in Input1

Input1: C1C2,C3C4,C5C6,C7,C8C9C10
Input2: C1C2  C3C4  C5C6  C7  C8C9C10

Input1 is basically one big long word with commas and Chinese characters

one after the other. Input2 is where I manually separated the string 
into the component terms by replacing the comma with whitespace. My 
confusion stems from the fact that I thought it should not matter since 
the analyzer should be discarding the punctuation anyway? So the 
tokenization process should be the same for both Input1 and Input2? If 
that is not the case, what do I need to change?

Thanks,
Wei Ho
