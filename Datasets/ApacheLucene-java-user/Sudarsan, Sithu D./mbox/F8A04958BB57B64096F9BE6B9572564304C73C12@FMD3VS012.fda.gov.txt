SUBJECT: Parsing large xml files
DATE: 21 May 2009


Hi,

While trying to parse xml documents of about 50MB size, we run into
OutOfMemoryError due to java heap space. Increasing JVM to use close 2GB
(that is the max), does not help. Is there any API that could be used to
handle such large single xml files?

If Lucene is not the right place, please let me know alternate places to
look for,

Thanks in advance,
