Hi Joel,

Couple of quick points.

1. The metric for indexing only. 

2. It is 1000 docs/minute  (sorry for the earlier 1000/sec goof up)

3. Regarding search/query, it depends on many parameters... (similarity,
proximity, synonym look up etc.)

Sincerely,
Sithu D Sudarsan

Hi Joel,

With approx. 100K doc size, on dual-quad core machine, (3.0Ghz) -
Windows platform, we have an average 1000 docs/sec. This includes text
extraction from PDF docs. 

Hope this helps.

Sincerely,
Sithu D Sudarsan

Subject: metrics for index ~100M docs

Hi,

Does anyone know of any recent metrics & stats on building out an index
of  ~100mm documents (each doc approx 5k). I'm looking for approx stats
on time to build, time to query and infrastructure requirements (number
of machines & spec) to reasonably support an index of such a size.

Thanks, 
Joel
