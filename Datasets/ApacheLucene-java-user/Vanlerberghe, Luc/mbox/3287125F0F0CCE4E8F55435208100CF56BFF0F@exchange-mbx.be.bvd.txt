You can open a new instance *before* closing the previous one.
If you have queries that occur often, you can 'warm up' the new instance
before starting to use it.

Just make sure you don't close an IndexSearcher instance that is in use
by Hits instances...

hello all,
   
  i have an environment with a number of search instances (index
searchers) running as rmi servers and a federator (a parallel multi
searcher) combining the results of all the instances, this is working
great, and allows us to load into memory millions of docs.
   
  my problem is as follows:
   
  i want to update the indexes but i do not want any down time,
  looking at the parallel multi searcher code i see that if one of the
searchables throws an io exception the multisearcher doesnt bother
dealing with that searchable's results (am i correct? if so this is
great), 
   
  i would like to write my own remotesearchaer that adds a reload
function that will close the indexsearcher and reload the indexes into
memory after they have been updated.
   
  however this means that closing and then reopening/reloading an
indexsearcher (running as a search instance) would result in a specific
instance not returning results during the load time.
   
  is there a better solution?
   
  thanks
