Good rule of thumb: don't ever count on the garbage collector cleaning
up for you (even if you call System.gc() to give it a hint).

You should close your IndexSearchers, but with a multithreaded
application  it's difficult to know when (you have to keep them open
until no thread uses it any more)

I created a class DelayCloseIndexSearcher class and posted it in jira
just for this purpose (See
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-445)
There's a use case in the javadoc.

I'm using it in my production system (but in a more complex way than in
the example code) and I don't (seem to :) have any problems...

Either way, I would very much appreciate some feedback about the code.

Thanks,

Luc

I'm updating nearly continuously (probably average about every 10
seconds). I don't explicitly close the IndexSearcher objects I create,
as
I share them across threads, but do leave them to be garbage collected.
I
ran into index corruption issues when I explicitly closed them, since I
don't have any code keeping track of how many threads might be using a
given IndexSearcher.

I wonder if it's worth the effort of adding that code in, or can I be
ensured that when the IndexSearcher objects are garbage collected the
file
handles will be released?
