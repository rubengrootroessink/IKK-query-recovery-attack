Yep,

I created DelayCloseIndexSearcher just for this scenario and it's
running in production for about half a year now...

There's an usage example in the javadoc, but it can be optimised even
more (without touching the code that does the searches, handles the
hits, etc...).

In my production environment, isCurrent() is called in a separate
thread.  If it returns false, a new DelayCloseIndexSearcher instance is
created, some warming up is done and only then the existing one is
replaced and closeWhenDone is called on it.
