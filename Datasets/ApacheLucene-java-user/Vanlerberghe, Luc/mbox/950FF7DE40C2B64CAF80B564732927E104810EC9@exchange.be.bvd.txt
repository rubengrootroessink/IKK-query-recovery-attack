Is your Analyzer aware that that particular field does not need to be
tokenized?

During indexation, if a field is passed that is passed as
tokenize=false, the analyzer won't be called so the string will be
stored as-is.

During searching, the queryparser doesn't know which fields should be
tokenized or not and passes them all to your analyzer.

Your analyzer should pass a KeywordTokenizer when asked for a
TokenStream for that field. It passes the entire string as one token.

It's in the contrib area on svn:
See
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/analyzers/src/
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KeywordTokenizer.java

and
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/analyzers/src/
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KeywordAnalyzer.java

Something like:
public class MyAnalyzer extends Analyzer {
  public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName,
                                 final Reader reader) {
    if (fieldName=="myKeywordField") { // fieldNames are "intern"ed so
== can be used.
      return new KeywordTokenizer(reader);
    } else {
      // original analyzer code...
    }
  }
}

That should also solve the issue in Luke...

Hi Dan,

What's the term? Could this be an analyzer problem? Are you using
the same analyzer for indexing and searching?
