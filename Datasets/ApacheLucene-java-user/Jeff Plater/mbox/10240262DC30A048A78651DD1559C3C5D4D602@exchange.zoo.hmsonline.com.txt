Thanks - I tried it out and it seems to work for "Philadelphid~0.75 PA" but I can't get it
working for "Phil* PA" yet.  Perhaps it is an issue with my Analyzer (I am using WhitespaceAnalyzer)?.
 Have you used it with wildcard before?

What you are looking for is ComplexPhraseQueryParser [1] and implemented in Lucene 2.9.0.
It uses SpanQuery family. 
It supports "Phil* PA"~10 as well as "Philadelphid~0.75 PA".
Ranges, OR, fuzzy and wildcard inside proximity (phrases).
