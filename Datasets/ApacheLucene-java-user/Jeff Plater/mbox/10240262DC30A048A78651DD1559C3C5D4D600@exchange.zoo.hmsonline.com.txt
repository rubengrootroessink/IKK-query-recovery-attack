SUBJECT: Edit distance and wildcard searching with PhraseQuery
DATE: 11 Nov 2009

Hi,

 

I am trying to figure out a way that I can query a Lucene index for a
phrase but have some fuzziness (edit distance and/or wildcard) applied
to the individual terms.  An example should help explain what I am
trying to do:

 

Index contains:

Philadelphia PA

 

Search is done on:

Philadelphid PA

 

I want it to result in a hit - basically something like
"Philadelphid~0.75 PA" (that syntax is not valid but explains what I am
looking for).  Similarly, I would like to be able to do something like
"Phil* PA" and get a hit as well.

 

Does anyone know how I can accomplish this?  Right now I am having to
hit a look up table to translate the city before searching against the
main index - not a fan of this option.

 

Thanks.
