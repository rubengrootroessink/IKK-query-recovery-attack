SUBJECT: Sort fields shouldn't be tokenized
DATE: 16 Nov 2009


I am looking at adding some sorting functionality to my application and
read that Sort fields should not be tokenized - can anyone explain why?
I have code that is tokenizing the sort fields and it seems to be
working.  Is it just because some tokenizing can change the value (like
remove stop words and such) which can produce an invalid sort order?
Thanks.

-Jeff
