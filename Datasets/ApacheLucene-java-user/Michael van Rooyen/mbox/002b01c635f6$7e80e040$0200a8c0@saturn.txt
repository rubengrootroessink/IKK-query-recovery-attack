Thanks Otis.  All the documents were written in a using the same 
IndexWriter, without ever closing it.  Is this what could be responsible for 
the documents not being in the segmens file, or is this bad practice?  Maybe 
I should use a writer for a batch of documents (1000 or so maybe?), and then 
discard it and start with a fresh one.  Would this help?
