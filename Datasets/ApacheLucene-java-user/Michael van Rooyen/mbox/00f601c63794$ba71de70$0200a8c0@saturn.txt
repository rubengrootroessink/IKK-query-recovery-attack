I'm using Lucene 1.4.3, and maxBufferedDocs only appears to be in the new 
(unreleased?) version of IndexWriter in CVS.  Looking at the code though, 
setMaxBufferedDocs(n) just translates to minMergeDocs = n.  My index was 
constructed using the default minMergeDocs = 10, so somehow this doesn't 
seem to be the culprit that caused all 2 million+ documents to be missing 
from the crashed index.  It seems more likely that none of the index files 
were "registered" in Lucene's segements file.  Is there perhaps some other 
trigger that causes Lucene to "register" the indexes in the segments file, 
or is there some way of flushing the segments file every so often to ensure 
that it's list is up to date?  Thanks again for your assistance.

Michael.
