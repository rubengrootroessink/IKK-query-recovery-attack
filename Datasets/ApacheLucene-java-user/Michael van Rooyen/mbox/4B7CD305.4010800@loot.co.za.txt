Just looking at that bug report, the links provided show that those 
errors occurred with Lucene 2.3.x on JRE 1.6.0.  If it were that JRE bug 
causing the EOF problem, I would have expected to get errors while we 
were using 2.3.2, but we used that for over a year on the same JVM 
(1.5.0_06) without a single error.

What's interesting is that whatever error was in the index will 
disappear once the faulty segment is merged in the next cycle, so it's 
quite possible (and perhaps likely in a heavily updated index) that by 
the time the index is checked, the corruption will be gone.  In this 
case, it may be reported as an EOF exception on a good index, and I've 
seen a few of those in the mail archives.  I suspect that if the merge 
process were more pedantic in not merging segments unless they are 
completely without error (including the deleted docs counts), then a lot 
more users might start encountering this problem.
