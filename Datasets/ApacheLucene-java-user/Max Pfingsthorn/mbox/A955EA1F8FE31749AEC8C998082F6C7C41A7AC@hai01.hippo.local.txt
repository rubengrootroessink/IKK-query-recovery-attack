Hi,

when IndexSearcher.search gives you a Hits object back, all results are already sorted by
their score, which is computed internally using the Similarity. You can access it via Hits.score(n)
(see http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Hits.html). This is also
shown in the demo in org.apache.lucene.demo.SearchFiles from SVN. (see http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/src/demo/org/apache/lucene/demo/SearchFiles.java?rev=150739&view=markup).

Hope that helps.

Ok.  So if I get 10 Documents back from a search and I want to get the top 5 weighted terms
for each of the 10 documents what API call should I use?  I'm unable to find the connection
between Similarity and a Document.

I know I'm missing the elephant that must be in the middle of the room.  Or maybe it's not
there.
Is what I'm trying to do do-able?

Thanks,

Andrew

Hi,

DefaultSimilarity uses exactly this weighting scheme. Makes sense since it's a pretty standard
relevance measure...

Bye!

If I have search results how can I calculate, using lucene's API,  wi = tfi * IDFi for each
document.

wi    = term weight
tfi    = term frequency in a document
IDFi = inverse document frequency = log(D/dfi)
dfi   = document frequency or number of documents containing term i
D    = number of documents in my search result

Thanks,

Andrew
