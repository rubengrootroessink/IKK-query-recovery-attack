Hello!

Ehem, I have to apologize. It was my stupidity that caused this problem. I simply mixed up
field names... I did the deletion of items in a superclass, which of course didn't know about
the change in the uri field name. Duh! Everything works now, just like it should.

Sorry again! Thanks for bearing with me though!

Could you work up a test case that shows this issue?  From all I can  
see, you're doing the right thing.  Something is amiss somewhere though.

Same thing in this case.  new Field(name, value, true, true, false)  
is the same as Field.Keyword(name, value)

Nothing comes to mind from what I've seen thus far.  An easily  
runnable example demonstrating this issue would be the next step.
