Hi

You could use the ParalellReader for this if you have all documents in all languages. Then,
the metadata fields can be stored in one of the field data files, while each languages gets
its own field data file...

You can in both cases. In the second, you need to expand the query (ie 
searching for carrot would search text_en:carrot or text_cn:carrot", 
which, I think is fair as long as you don't a two kilometer's list of 
languages.

If you separate the indices you won't, as far as I know, be able to 
query simultaneously (e.g. some text which, as well, is new 
enough....).
