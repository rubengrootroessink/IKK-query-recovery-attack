DATE: 20 May 2005

Hi!

I was wondering if Lucene has any sort of functionality to distribute indices so that different
fields are stored in separate indices but they still refer to the same document. This would
be great for a situation where there are many large documents which have frequently changing
properties. Content and properties could be indexed separately. Even different sets of properties
could be combined in maybe different MultiSearcher instances to speed up querying...

Any ideas on this?

Best regards,
