Hi!

Thanks for all the replies. I do know that the readers should be reopened, but that is not
the problem. I try to remove some docs, and add their new versions again to incrementally
update the index. After updating the index with the same document twice, I opened the index
in luke. There I saw that the file's uri was present three times in the uri field. So, I concluded,
it didn't delete the docs right as there are in total three documents which contain this term,
right? By the way, Reader.delete() returned 0 as well.

I thought I used Field.Keyword(), but actually I use

doc.add(new Field(URI_FIELD, uri, true, true, false));

to add the uri to the doc. I can see it in luke, and even find the docs when searching for
it (using the KeywordAnalyzer).

Any ideas?

Thanks!
max

How do you know nothing was deleted? Are you aware that you need to re-open 
your IndexSearcher/Reader in order to see the changes made to the index?
