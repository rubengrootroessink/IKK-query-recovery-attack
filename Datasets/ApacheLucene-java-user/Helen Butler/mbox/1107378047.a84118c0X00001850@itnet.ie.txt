now..Thanks for your help

Helen,

I downloaded lucene-1.4.3.zip myself from one of the mirrors
(http://apache.essentkabel.com/jakarta/lucene/binaries/)

It contains the lucene demo's, and not the java sources.

The lucene-1.4.3.tar.gz there has the same problem.

It seems something is wrong with the 1.4.3 distribution.

When you need the lucene 1.4.3 jar you can download it from the above mirror,
it looks ok. to me.

In case you have done something like this before:

The following command (on a single line) will checkout the source files from cvs
into directory lucene-1.4.3 (make sure that directory is empty beforehand):

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic checkout -r lucene_1_4_3 -d lucene-1.4.3
jakarta_lucene

In there you can correct the build.xml file and do:

ant compile

to compile the source code.

Regards,
Paul Elschot
