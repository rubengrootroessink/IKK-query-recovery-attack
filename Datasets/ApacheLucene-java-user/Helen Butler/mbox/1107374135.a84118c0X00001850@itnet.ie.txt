Hi Paul,

Thanks for your quick response.

The Build.xml was obtained from the Lucene-1.4.3.zip that I downloaded from the apache website.

I changed the version in the xml file as you suggested, however the error persists.

Kind Regards,
Helen Butler

It seems the java source files were not extracted.

How did you obtain the build.xml file?

Once the compilation works, you'll notice that the lucene jar being built
has a 1.5 version number because of an incorrect version number
in the 1.4.3 build.xml.
You need to correct the version property in the build.xml file:
  <property name="version" value="1.4.3"/>
