SUBJECT: Size limit for indexing ?
DATE: 9 Oct 2002

Hi,

I use lucene 1.2 and I index a text document wich size is near 500 ko.
(I use Field.UnStored method)
It seems that only the beginning of this document is indexing !
If I search a term that is at the end of this document, I don't find it (but
If find term at the beginning).
So, I split my document in 2 parts and index them, and now it works fine.

Is there a limit size for indexing a document ?

Thx.
