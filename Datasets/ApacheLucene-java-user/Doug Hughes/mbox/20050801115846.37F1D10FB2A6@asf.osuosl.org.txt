Oh!!! So *that's* what the documentation is for! ;)

Thanks for pointing that out.  Sometimes you get so frustrated with a
problem you fail to notice the obvious solution.

: However, when I search either the path or url fields on this index for
those
: values I'm not getting any results.  Here's an example:

: Query q = new TermQuery(new
: Term("http://cfdocs.office.alagad.com/htmldocs/00000001.htm", "url"));

simple mistake - the constructor for a Term takes the field name first,
then the value.
