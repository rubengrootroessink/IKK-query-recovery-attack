I agree...

I also installed 1.2-rc3 from source recently (new computer).  And ran
into the same problems.

One other suggestion I might add is adding a default task to the build.xml
that prints your options.

For example, in the source distribution for log4j, when doing

$ ant

in the dir where the build.xml file is located, you get a general usage
message showing all the available tasks and a short description of each.
