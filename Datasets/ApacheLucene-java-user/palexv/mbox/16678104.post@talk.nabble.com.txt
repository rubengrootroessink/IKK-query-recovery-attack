Hi all.
I have an index with a set of phrases(one or several words).
I need to make search for these phrases.

I am confused as I can not find a good way to search for phrases. 
For example I need to search for "java de*" and recieve "java developers",
"java development", "developed by java" etc.

Can I do this using lucene? What Query/Analyzer should I use? Should I
tokenize field in index?
