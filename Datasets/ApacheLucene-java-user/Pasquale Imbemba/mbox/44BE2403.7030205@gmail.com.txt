Hi,

I am checking a txt file with entries against an index generated with 
Lucene. Of the enclosed Searcher.java class, I use the isInLex(String 
noun) method, i.e. I read every line of the txt file and compare using 
isInLex(String noun) against the index. If it's contained it returns 
true otherwise it returns false.

The entire comparison is started from the enclosed Merger.java class. I 
read here 
(http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-307?page=comments#action_12417477) 
and after that I tried to close the reader (is.close() in the 
Searcher.java class), but the problem persists.

I would be grateful for some tip as this is my first approach to Lucene...

tia
Pasquale
