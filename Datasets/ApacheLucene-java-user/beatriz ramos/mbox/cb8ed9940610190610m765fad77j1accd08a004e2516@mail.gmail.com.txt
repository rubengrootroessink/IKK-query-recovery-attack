SUBJECT: implementing our own Scorer (BM25)
DATE: 19 Oct 2006

Hello,
I'm trying to implement my own scoring algorithm with Lucene but I don't get
any results.

Lucene documentation explains how to implement new scoring, modifying Query,
Weight and Scorer classes. I have tried this but doesn't work

Do you have any idea?
I need some example to understand the process and modifications

Thanks
