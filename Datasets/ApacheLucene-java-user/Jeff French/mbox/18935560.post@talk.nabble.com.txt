SUBJECT: Query to ignore certain phrases
DATE: 11 Aug 2008


We're trying to perform a query where if our intended search term/phrase is
part of a specific larger phrase, we want to ignore that particular match,
but not the entire document (unless of course there are no other hits with
our intended term/phrase). For example, a query like:

    "white house" UNLESS "russian white house"

should not produce a match on the phrase:

    "russian white house"

but should match:

    "white house"

Where this differs from the NOT operator is that we don't want to rule out a
document just because it contains "russian white house", we just want to
ignore the hit, so that this phrase:

    "... in the russian white house as opposed to the american white house
..."

would return the document.

Can this be accomplished using Lucene or Qsol QueryParser syntax, or do we
need to write something custom?
