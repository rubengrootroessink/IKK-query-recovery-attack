Spencer, it seems inefficient to me too, but that's pretty much what I did
for tables embedded within a document. 

I used a SAX parser to parse the document and kept track of the table
elements I saw. When I received an endElement, I added the text I had
buffered up in the characters() method to the buffer for each parent
element. Then I removed the current element and added its content as a
Field.

I should add that I am also fairly new to Lucene, so just because I did it
that way doesn't mean it's the best or even a good way.
