SUBJECT: Nested concept fields
DATE: 13 Aug 2007


I'm trying to index concepts within a document, and search them within the
context of a multivalued field. I'm not even sure it's possible with the
QueryParser or QsolParser syntax. Does anyone know if it is / is not
possible? If not, is it conceptually possible using the Query API?

What I'd like to do: I'm currently indexing sentences as individual 'sent'
fields. I plan to create indices on other information I parse out of a
document (e.g. numerics, people names, company names). Suppose I call my
numeric index 'num'. Then I would like to do something like this (in search
pseudocode):

	sent:(expired num[1 TO 5] "days ago")

I don't see how to do this using either Lucene's QueryParser or the
QsolParser. Is it possible to do it using the Query API (and the appropriate
indexing changes)?

Thanks for any pointers.
