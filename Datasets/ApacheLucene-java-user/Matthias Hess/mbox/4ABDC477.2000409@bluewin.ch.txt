SUBJECT: Storing a Lucene Index on a SAN Storage: good idea?
DATE: 26 Sep 2009

Hello

We are currently implementing our first Lucene project. We are building 
an application which will index public Records on the internet, about 
200'000 documents, each document is about 150 k in size. Our customer 
would like to store the Lucene index on a SAN disk.
We recommended the use of high speed local disks, but our customer would 
prefer SAN for their better managability.

Does anybody have good or bad experiences with SAN disks?
Are there parameters like #read operations, data read rate or whatever, 
which must be met to have a performance which rivals a good "local disk"?

Thanks for sharing your ideas and opinions!

Kind Regards
Matthias Hess
