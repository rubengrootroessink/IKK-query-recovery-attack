SUBJECT: Lucene Logo? (high resolution)
DATE: 19 Jan 2006

Hello,

I've created an Semantic Desktop application using Lucene. For a 
presentation I'd like to create a poster. Unfortunately I haven't found 
any high resolution version (or vector graphic) of the Lucene logo. At 
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/docs/images/ only a 
few GIFs are available. Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Daniel
