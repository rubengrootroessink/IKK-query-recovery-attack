Yes, the document creation is out of  my hands.

And in addition, the html documents mayn't be from single web site. The
number of
websites are dynamic.  Even in the case of single web site, there are
different apps each having its own layout etc.

So, am not sure if longest common prefix/suffix would work.  Any further
thoughts on this ?

thanks & regards
Ramesh
