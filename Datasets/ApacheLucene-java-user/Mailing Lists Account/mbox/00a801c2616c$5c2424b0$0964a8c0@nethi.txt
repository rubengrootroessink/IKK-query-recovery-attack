SUBJECT: Is Lucene suitable for one-time index and one-time search ?
DATE: 21 Sep 2002

Hi,

I need to search a bunch of documents.Each document needs to be searched
only once. That means once I build the index and search it, I have no need
for that index and the document again.

The number of documents to be searched in the above process can be very
large. If this process needs to be repeated on a regular basis, was
wondering if I can use Lucene ?

In that case, would creating the index in memory, run the query and
discarding the in-memory index (RamDirectory) be the right approach ?

thanks
Ramesh
