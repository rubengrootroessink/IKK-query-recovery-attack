SUBJECT: Phrase queries with wildcards - Do they work ?
DATE: 14 Feb 2003


WIth 1.2 release, do the phrase queries containing wild cards such as
"microsoft app*" actually work ?
I couldn't get it to work even though the couple of posts in the mailing
lists reported success.

I observed that query parser recognizes the above query as Phrase query. Is
there any work-around until
the query parser is fixed ?

I had no success with nightly build of 14th Feb 2003 also.  I noticed that
there is a Test class TestPhrasePrefixQuery.java
that shows how to use PhrasePrefixQuery, which is probably needed for the
above query to work correctly.

regards
Ramesh
