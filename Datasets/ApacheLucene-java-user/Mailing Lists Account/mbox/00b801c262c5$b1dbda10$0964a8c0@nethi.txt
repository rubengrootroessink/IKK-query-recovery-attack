SUBJECT: Re: Is Lucene suitable for one-time index and one-time search ?

Thanks Doug for the quick reply.


In the simplest case, I have a document and I need to know if it contains
certain terms or a combination of terms with AND/OR/Phrases etc(Much like
Lucene query. Infact, Lucene queries meet my requirements very well).  In
some cases, I may have more than one document. However, the process is
pretty much same. Unlike other lucene apps, unce I find that these
document(s) either contain or donot contain the terms, I have no use for the
index and hence I need to drop all created indices.  Next time I search, the
documents and the query are totally different.

In effect, what I am trying to do is 'Find in a File(s)' but with one or
more terms( containing AND/OR/phrases as operators.)

It appears to me that the lucene as all pieces to solve this. That is,
extract the terms, index the document and run the query to see if the
document is returned in the results.

If lucene is an overkill for my kind of app, what are the other approaces to
search a document with a query much similar to what Lucene suppports it. Can
that avoid creating indices ? I really appreciate any pointers.

thanks & regards
Ramesh
