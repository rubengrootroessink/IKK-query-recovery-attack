SUBJECT: Phrase query and porter stemmer
DATE: 12 Feb 2003

Hi,

I use PorterStemmer with my analyzer for indexing the documents.
And I have been using the same analyzer for searching too.

When I search for a phrase like "security" AND database, I would like to
avoid matches for
terms like "secure" or "securities" .  I observed that Google and couple of
search engines do
not return such matches.

1) In otherwords, in a single query, is it possible not to choose porter
stemmer for phrase queries and
    use for other queries (such as Term query etc)

2) As an alternative, is it advisable to manually construct a PhraseQuery by
adding terms without appling porter
   stemmer ?

regards
Ramesh
