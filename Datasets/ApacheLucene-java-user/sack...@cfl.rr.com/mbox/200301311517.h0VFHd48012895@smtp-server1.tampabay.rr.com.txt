Unfortunately, It doesn't extract text from Word 2,4,5,6 documents only version 
97 and greater. 

Another problem is that your second stacktrace refers to code that isn't even 
called through the text extraction library I gave a url for. That is HDF code 
from the POI project. Although I am the author of HDF, go back and read my 
post, it refers to a library at http://www.textmining.org

If you send me documents that do not work. I will tell you why they do not work 
and attempt to fix the problem. In either HDF or the textmining.org library. In 
my experience, documents that cannot be parsed are either RTF documents or from 
older versions of Word.
