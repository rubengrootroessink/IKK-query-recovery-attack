SUBJECT: anyone interested in taking over textmining.org?
DATE: 9 Feb 2006

The TextMining.org website keeps getting hacked and I don't have the 
time to upgrade postnuke to a more secure version. Also, because of 
legal reasons I can't maintain the software. I am more than willing 
to "hand-off" the project to lucene or someone else. It's an apache 2 
license so anyone can branch at anytime and use any license they want. 
However, if someone wants to take over and gets my seal of approval, I 
will make the textmining.org home page redirect to your site. 

It extracts text from Word documents pretty solidly. If there are 
problems, they are caused by fast-saved files or files saved with the 
doc extensions that aren't actually Word documents (rtf, html). Unlike 
POI, it supports Word 6.0/95 documents. There are many ways it can be 
improved but they are trivial changes in my opinion. The core logic is 
solid and is used in commercial/gov't applications. 

Send me an email directly if you are interested.
