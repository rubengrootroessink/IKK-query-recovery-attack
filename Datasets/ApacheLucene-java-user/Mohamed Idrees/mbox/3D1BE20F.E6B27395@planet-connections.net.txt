DATE: 28 Jun 2002

Greetings to Everyone !

I understand from Lucene FAQ and the forum discussion that Lucene supports
internationalization.  I am now curious to know how does this being
implemented for different languages like, in my case, for Arabic.

Hope someone can clarify and probably provide me with a sample demo.

Thanking you in advance.
