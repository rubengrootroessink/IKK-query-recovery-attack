Thanks for the reply.. I'll take a look at filters.

So in my "Charles Dickens starting with m" use case, should I make a filter
for "Charles Dickens" and then do a prefix query on title passing "m"...?

i.e. rewrite the quick query as a filter so the prefix and wildcard queries
work against a smaller index.

Or have I got this the wrong way around :-S
