SUBJECT: Re: Doc IDs via IndexReader?
DATE: 23 Jul 2009

Hi,

Thanks Shai and Mike for your suggestions. I went with Shai's second
approach. However, I'm confronted with this now:

After deleting that document from the index, I also delete it from a
copy of the directory that contained the original documents. With
this, I expected that both the directory as well as the index, both
shouldn't have had the document. More precisely, I have taken this
updated directory and take each document in that directory and convert
it to a query. I then send this query to the index via IndexSearcher
and examine the hits for each document. For some reason, I get a
document which I had deleted from the index (via IndexReader). Is
there any valid explanation for this? How can I be assured that the
index will not contain that document. Here's the code snippet I am
experimenting this with (hopefully things are self explanatory):


        System.out.println("Documents which are in the whitelist :
"+docsEncounteredNames.toString());
    	IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(indexDir);
    	
    	for(int doc_itr=0; doc_itr < reader.maxDoc(); doc_itr++)
    	{
    		if(docsEncountered.contains(doc_itr))
    		{
                       //skip if I encountered this document
    			continue;
    		}
    		else if (!reader.isDeleted(doc_itr))
    		{
    			System.out.println("Deleting document with name:
"+reader.document(doc_itr).get("filename"));
    			File docToDelete = new
File(orgDocsDir+"/"+reader.document(doc_itr).get("filename"));
    			reader.deleteDocument(doc_itr);
    			System.out.println("Also deleting original document
"+docToDelete.getCanonicalPath());
    			docToDelete.delete();
    		}
    	}

Best,
Anuj
