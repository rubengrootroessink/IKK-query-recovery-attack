SUBJECT: Does lucene works with NFS?
DATE: 2 May 2006

Hello:
 
We are developing a WebSphere application using Lucene. Can we use the
following architecture?
 
1. Store the index in a NFS file system which mount to all four UNIX
machines
2. The WebSphere application just perform search (read only access to the
index on NFS). 
3. One of the four machines has a cron job that run every night to update
the index on the NFS.
 
Is this articture safe? The alternative is copy the index on all 4 machines.
Then each machine also need a cron job to run every night to update the
index.
 
Which architecture do you recomend?
