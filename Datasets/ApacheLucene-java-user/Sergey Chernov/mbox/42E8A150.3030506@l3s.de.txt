SUBJECT: Index scalability, IDF normalization for distributed indices
DATE: 28 Jul 2005

Hi all,

I would like to know, if I use LUCENE in distributed environment, e.g. 
on two indices on different document sets and in different locations, 
does Searcher use local IDF values for every index separately during 
query execution or it computes and uses one global IDF value?

Another question, does LUCENE scale well to millions and dozens of 
millions documents?

Best regards,
Sergey Chernov
