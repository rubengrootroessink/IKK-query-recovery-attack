Hi there,

at the open-source project mmm we provide a generic search-solution based on lucene:

http://m-m-m.sourceforge.net/maven/mmm-search/

This covers the typical gaps like indexing binary documents as well as providing
an example web-frontend with paging and all those features.
This allows to get a search-solution with lucene (for documents indexed from
local disc) up and running in 5 minutes. At the moment we do not yet have a
release so you need to checkout from subversion and build the project with maven
what will take a lot longer, but this is just a matter of time...

If you like it, I would be very pleased if you put a link at your contributions:

http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/contributions.html

Thanks
  JÃ¶rg
