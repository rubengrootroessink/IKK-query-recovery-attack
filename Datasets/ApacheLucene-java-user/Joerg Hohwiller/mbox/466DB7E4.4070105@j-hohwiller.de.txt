Thanks for the info.
I see two categories on that wiki page.
What I miss is a category for projects that provide add-ons, tools, or other
value to lucene (e.g. Luke is a cool Tool, very useful. It is listed at
contributions but not on the wiki PowerdBy site). Should I create an account and
simply add such a category?
