SUBJECT: switching between Query parsers
DATE: 14 Apr 2011

Consider this case : 

Lucene index contains documents with these fields : 
title
author
publisher

I have coded my app to use MultiFieldQueryParser so that it queries all
fields. 
Now if user types something like "author:tom" in search box, how do I make
it go with only that field ?
