SUBJECT: Highlighting a phrase with "Single" <SPAN>
DATE: 6 Apr 2011

If there is a phrase in search, the highlighter highlights every word
separately.. 
Like this : 


I love Lucene


Instead what I want is like this : 


I love Lucene 


Is there a way to ask Lucene do this ? I know we could ask css or jquery to
do the task, but whats the point ? right ? 


So, is there a way to ask the highlighter to do this ?
