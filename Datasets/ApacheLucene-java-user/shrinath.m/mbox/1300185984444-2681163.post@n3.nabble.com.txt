SUBJECT: How to do an all field search without using a "catchall" field or "MultiFieldQueryParser" ?
DATE: 15 Mar 2011

Catchall field has its own disadvantages of increasing index size. 
MultiFieldQueryParser has to know the field names before hand. 

How do I do a multi field search 
- without knowing fields in the index
- without having a CatchAll field 


PS : I went through the Lucene in Action book, and in chapter 13 ( SIREn
case study ), he says SIREn does it. I also wanted to know how can I do the
same with similar efficiency ?
