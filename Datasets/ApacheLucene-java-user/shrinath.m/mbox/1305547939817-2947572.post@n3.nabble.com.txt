LoL :) the explanation of XY problem is good one, but thats not my case... 
I must agree, my first idea was on docid itself, but I don't stress on
docid, it can be on any field for that instance, the way it works is the
same. 

so stress in the question is on how to do it, not which field I do it on... 

Apologies for not being clear in the question, I tried to keep it very
simple, but failed to give essential info...
