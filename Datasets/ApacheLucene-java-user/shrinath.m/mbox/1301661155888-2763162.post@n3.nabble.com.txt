SUBJECT: Difference between regular Highlighter and Fast Vector Highlighter ?
DATE: 1 Apr 2011

I was wondering whats the difference between the Lucene's 2 implementation of
highlighters... 
I saw the javadoc of FVH, but it only says "another implementation of Lucene
Highlighter" ...

Can someone throw some more light on this ?
