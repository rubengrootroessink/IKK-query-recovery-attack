Well, at the end of the day its either I make an array of Boolean.Occur
or I make an array of Queries to go with the fields right ?
Nothing helps me from creating an unnecessary array of repetitive elements ?
:(

So if I have 2 fields "name" and "address",
and if the query is "shrinath",

then there should be arrays like this :
    private static String[] fields = {"name", "address"};
    private static BooleanClause.Occur[] flags= {BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,
BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD};
and the parse method should go like this :
MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, s, fields, flags, new
StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, Collections.emptySet()));

:(
