SUBJECT: Best way to find if a document exists, using Reader ...
DATE: 14 Jan 2005

Hi luceners,
Using Reader, whats the best (fastest) way to find if a documents exists with a given term.
The term is unique ID, meaning, with that term, atmost one document can exist.

I have seen 2 appropriate methods of Reader. docFreq(Term) and termDocs(Term). docFreq should
return either 0 or 1 in my case and termDocs should return TermDocs of size 0 or 1. But I
was not sure which method is faster. All I want to find is if a document exist.

The actual reason I want to do is, I want to delete a document with the given GUID. It looks
like delete(Term) has some overhead. So I thought I can look up the document and delete it
only if it exists. Since I will be dealing with millions of documents, most of which are new
documents. But I don't know if a document already exists in lucene index. So I was calling
Reader.delete(Term) on each documen before adding it. This means I am calling delete method
millions but there are possibly 99.9% of new document in that million docs.

Does it makes sense to call docFreq or termDocs (which ever is faster) before calling delete?

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Praveen
