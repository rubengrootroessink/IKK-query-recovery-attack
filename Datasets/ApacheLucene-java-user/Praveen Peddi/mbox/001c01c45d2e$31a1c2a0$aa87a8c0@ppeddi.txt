SUBJECT: Do we really need CJKAnalyzer to search japanese characters
DATE: 28 Jun 2004

Hello all,
You will have to excuse me if the question looks dumb ;)

I didn't use CJKAnalyzer and I could still search japanese characters.
Actually I used it first but then I thought of testing with just the
standard analyzer. It worked with standard analyzer also.

I was able to search the metadata of our objects that has chinese and
japanese characters.

I think lucene is internally storing unicode characters. So should it matter
if its standard analyzer or CJK analyzer?

When do we have to use CJKAnalyzer really?

Praveen
