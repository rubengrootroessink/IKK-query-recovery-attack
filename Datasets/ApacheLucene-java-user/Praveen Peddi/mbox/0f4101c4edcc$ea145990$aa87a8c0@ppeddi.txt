SUBJECT: sorting on a non english based locale field
DATE: 29 Dec 2004

Hi fellow luceners,
I was looking at the lucene sorting code and it looks like lucene does consider locale into
account while sorting. So I assume lucene already handles for strings.

But in my case, I wrote my own SortComparator (StringIgnoreCaseSortComparator) to achieve
sorting similar to explorer sorting. Because lucene uses java's string.compareTo method and
that considers  "case" of each character, I can't use lucene's default string sorting.

The question is, how do I integrate Locale into my StringIgnoreCaseSortComparator while comparing
strings. Lucene's code gets the locale from SortField but I don't have access to SortField
in this comparator.

Any ideas???? Should StringIgnoreCaseSortComparator be just knowing the locale at the time
of instantiating?
