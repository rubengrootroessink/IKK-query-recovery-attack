SUBJECT: sorting tokenized field
DATE: 10 Dec 2004

I read that the tokenised fields cannot be sorted. In order to sort tokenized field, either
the application has to duplicate field with diff name and not tokenize it or come up with
something else. But shouldn't the search engine takecare of this? Are there any plans of putting
this functionality built into lucene?
