The solution you suggested is exactly as I expected and I already thought
about implementing it. But the problem is the memory in efficiency. Somce
times titles are huge. And with i18n, title can be in japanese, chinese or
any language which takes mroe memory than english.

Ok. how about taking the first token of the title and using it just for the
sake of sorting. Does anyone see any problem with it? This solution saves
atleast some memory, compared to the other solution.

important feature in our application. But we found that lucene does not
support out of box, we had to implement sorting by score and doc id
programatically which is kind of useless for us. So I thought lucene's new
sorting feature will best suit now. But unfortunately, the field called
"title" is tokenized currently. And this is done purposefully because users
would want to search partial matches (or rather search on multiple words of
the title). So if we make it un tokenized we may lose an improtant
functionality.
