SUBJECT: Re: Moving from a single server to a cluster
DATE: 8 Sep 2004

We went thru the same scenario as yours. We recently made our application
clsuterable and I wrote our own version of jdbc directory (similar to the
SQLDirectory posted by someone) with our own caching. It was great for
searching for indexing had become a real bottleneck. So we have decided to
move back to file system for non-clustered apps. I am still trying to figure
the best way (whether using a RemoteSearcher or manage multiple index). I
already tried multiple index and we didn't really like the solution of
maintaining multiple copies. It requires more space, more maintaineance, all
index needs to be in sync etc.

I will be glad if I can get the best answer for this. Did anyone try
RemoteSearchable and how is it compared to multiple index solution?

 Nader: I would appreciate if you can send me the docs.

Would it be cheeky to ask you to post the docs to the group?  It would be
interesting to read how you've tackled this.

Hey Ben,

We've been using a distributed environment with three servers and three
separate indecies for the past 2 years since the first stable Lucene
release and it has been great, recently and for the past two months I've
been working on a redesign for our Lucene App and I've shared my
findings and plans with Otis, Doug and Erik, they pointed out a few
faults in my logic which you will probably come across soon enough that
mainly have to do with keeping you updates atomic (not too hard) and
your deletes atomic (a little more tricky), give me a few days and I'll
send you both the early document and the newer version that deals
squarely with Lucene in a distributed environment with high volume index.

Regards.
