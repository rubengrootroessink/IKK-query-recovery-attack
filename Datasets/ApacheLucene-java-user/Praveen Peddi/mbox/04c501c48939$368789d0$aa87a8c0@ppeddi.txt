Infact CJK analyzer also works well with indian languages. Since CJKAnalyzer
considers the multi byte characters as special case, it works with most
asian multi byte characters. I introduced CJKAnalyzer for japanese text
search and we also tested with hindi and telugu languages. All our search
test cases passed.
Give CJKAnalyzer a try. You will find it a better analyzer than the standard
(for any asian language).
