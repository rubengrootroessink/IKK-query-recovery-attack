SUBJECT: Compile errors in FrenchAnalyzer
DATE: 2 Jul 2004

I get compile time errors with FrenchAnalyzer in the constructor with file name and the method
setStemExclusionTable.
Unhandled exception type IOException

How do I fix these errors? Should I just throw IOException or catch the exception in the method
and ignore.

I am using lucene 1.4 final.
