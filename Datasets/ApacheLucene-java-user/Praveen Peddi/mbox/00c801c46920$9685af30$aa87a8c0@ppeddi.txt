SUBJECT: wierd error in weblogic due to lucene
DATE: 13 Jul 2004

Hello,
I am seeing wierd problem with weblogic when I have lot of data in lucene. Wehave a concept
of content objects and each content object maps to a lucene document. We tested with 500K
objects and lucene even though indexed fine, was creating problems while searching. 

When we spawned 25 searches at the same time on weblogic app server, weblogic started un deploying
the application. Its wierd, isn't it?

The reason I think lucene is causing this problem is, the root exception given by weblogic
is related to number of files open (see below for the exception).

Did anyone see this problem before? Is lucene capable of handling 500K documents?

Why would lucene un deploy the application

Any help is appreciated.
