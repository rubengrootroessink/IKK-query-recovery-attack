SUBJECT: Index files in jar
DATE: 29 Aug 2005

Hello,

I have a set of index files that I'd like to distribute with my Java 
application. The only way this seems practical is to place the index files 
in a jar file. I tried this, but the search choked when I told IndexSearcher 
the index path inside the jar file ( and placed the jar file path in the 
CLASSPATH ).

Any ideas on wrapping my index files inside a jar file?

Thanks in advance for any help.

-Tom
