SUBJECT: index files in jar file
DATE: 26 Aug 2005

Hello,

I have a set of index files that I'd like to distribute with my Java 
application. The only way this seems practical is to place the index files 
in a jar file. I tries this, but the search choked when I told IndexSearcher 
the index path inside the jar file ( and placed the jar file in the 
CLASSPATH.

Anybody out there successfully put their index files in a jar file?

Thanks in advance for any advise.

-Tom
