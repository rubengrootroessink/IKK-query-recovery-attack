Thanks for the fast reply.  
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/branches/flex_1458/
I used the one above to checkout.  Hope it is fine.  Will see how it
works out.

My requirement is that I have a index into a DB row (100 million rows).
On some text fields I want to do  contains  search fast.  I hope this
will suit my needs.   Something like   screenName:*poker*

Hi Sriram,

This patch cannot be applied to 3.0 as it depends on a new Lucene branch
called flex. It depends on features, only added in version 3.1. So it
does not even apply on trunk, you have to checkout the experimental flex
branch first.

For 3.0 you, may try one of the early patches (the last without -flex in
name) in this issue, but they will never go into lucene 3.1, instead the
flex branch will hopefully merge with trunk, soon. Also the non-flex
patches are not so performant, because the performance increases only
with flexible indexing API.

Uwe
