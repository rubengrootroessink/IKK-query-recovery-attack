DATE: 27 Jan 2010

I tried on the flex brach and it  seems to be working well. This is the
general pattern I am following  (both for prefix queries and queries of
the sort   ".{0,3}poker.*".   I am assuming I could just use this as
part of a larger BooleanQuery. 

AutomatonQuery aq = new
RegexpQuery(newTerm("123.*poker.*"));//".*ument"));
aq.setRewriteMethod(MultiTermQuery.CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO_REWRITE_DEFAULT);
TopDocs td = searcher.search(aq, 10);
ScoreDoc[] sd = td.scoreDocs; 

Begin loop ...
System.out.println ("Doc : " + searcher.doc(sd[i].doc).get("data"));
End loop


Can I just use this production or need to wait till this is officially
released ?

Hi Sriram,

This patch cannot be applied to 3.0 as it depends on a new Lucene branch
called flex. It depends on features, only added in version 3.1. So it
does not even apply on trunk, you have to checkout the experimental flex
branch first.

For 3.0 you, may try one of the early patches (the last without -flex in
name) in this issue, but they will never go into lucene 3.1, instead the
flex branch will hopefully merge with trunk, soon. Also the non-flex
patches are not so performant, because the performance increases only
with flexible indexing API.

Uwe
