DATE: 23 Dec 2004

I think there are several problems. 

1) First of all, there are both CFS files and standard (non-compound) files
in this directory, and all of them have recent update dates, so I assume
they are all being used. My code never explicitly sets the compound file
flag, so I don't know how this happened.

2) Is there a way to force all files into compound mode? For example, if I
set the compound setting, then call optimize, will that recreate everything
into the CFS format?

3) There are several other large .CFS files in this directory that I think
have somehow become detached from the index. They have recent update dates
-- however, the last time I ran optimize these were not touched, and they
are not being updated now. I know these segments have valid data, because
now when I search I am missing large chunks of data -- which I assume is in
these detached segments. So my thought is to edit the 'segments' file to
make Lucene recognize these again -- but I need to know the correct segment
size in order to do this. So how do I determine what the correct segment
size should be?

Why are you sure it's corrupted? Are the *.cfs file and the other files 
types mixed in one directory? Then that's the problem: if you have *.cfs, 
segments, and deletable, nothing else should exist in that directory or 
Lucene will get confused.
