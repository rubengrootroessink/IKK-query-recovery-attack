SUBJECT: OutOfMemory error during optimize
DATE: 22 Dec 2005

I am periodically getting "Too many open files" error when searching. Currently there are over
500 files in my Lucene directory. I am attempting to run optimize( ) to reduce the number
of files. However, optimize never finishes because whenever I run it, it quits with a Java
exception OutOfMemory error. I have tried using the -Xmx and -Xms switches to increase heap
size, but that has not helped.
 
Any suggestions?
