I am getting a fatal exception on Windows 2000 Server when performing a
search. Upon call to IndexSearcher.search( ) with a large query I see this
error from the JVM:

Unexpected Signal : EXCEPTION_FLT_STACK_CHECK (0xc0000092) occurred at
PC=0xA2D4
16
Function=[Unknown.]
Library=(N/A)

NOTE: We are unable to locate the function name symbol for the error
      just occurred. Please refer to release documentation for possible
      reason and solutions.

I am using Lucene 1.4.3 and JRE 1.4.2_06. Has anyone had an experience like
this? Any suggestions to work around or troubleshoot?
