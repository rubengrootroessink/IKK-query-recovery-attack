No, I didn't change the source code at all. Has anyone ever seen this error
with Lucene 1.4.3? I am unsure how to troubleshoot further, since the error
occurs within the call to search().

A similar message appeared for me on linux. I would recommend doing a

ant clean (or something similar.)
ant jar
ant war

if you changing the source code. Did you change your source code?
