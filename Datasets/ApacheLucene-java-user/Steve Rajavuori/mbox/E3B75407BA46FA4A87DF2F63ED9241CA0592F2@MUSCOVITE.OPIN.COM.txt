SUBJECT: Rebuild and corruption
DATE: 28 Jul 2004

Has anyone had any experience with their index getting corrupted by an
abnormal termination? We have occasionally seen problems occur when our
program gets killed abnormally -- e.g. power loss. Here's an example of what
we saw on one of these occasions:

2004-07-21 14:19:04.317] Error in IndexWriter [12]
java.io.IOException: read past EOF
	at org.apache.lucene.store.InputStream.refill(Unknown Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.store.InputStream.readByte(Unknown Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentMerger.mergeNorms(Unknown Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentMerger.merge(Unknown Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.mergeSegments(Unknown Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.maybeMergeSegments(Unknown
Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.addDocument(Unknown Source)


I have two questions. 

1) Can anyone recommend the best way to avoid any possibility of corruption
in the case where an IndexWriter doesn't get closed properly? (It seems that
termination during a merge operation is the most vulnerable point.)

2) Is there any way to recover a corrupted index, other than rebuilding from
scratch?
