SUBJECT: How to get values that produced hits
DATE: 10 May 2005

I have some cases where a user submits a Boolean query that could have many terms -- e.g. "A=1
OR B=2 OR C=3", etc. When I retrieve the hits I want to be able to retrieve the value the
produced the hit. In other words, I want to know if it was "A=1" that produced this hit, or
was it "B=2". How can I get this information for my Hits?
