SUBJECT: Memory leak in Lucene 1.4?
DATE: 6 Oct 2004

Is anyone aware of memory leaks in Lucene 1.4? I have an application that
has been running fine with Lucene 1.2. I can write indexes for days and it
never consumes more than 14 Meg of memory. When I compile the SAME CODE with
Lucene 1.4 the application will consume memory until all available heap is
used and the application dies with OutofMemory exception.
 
Any ideas?
