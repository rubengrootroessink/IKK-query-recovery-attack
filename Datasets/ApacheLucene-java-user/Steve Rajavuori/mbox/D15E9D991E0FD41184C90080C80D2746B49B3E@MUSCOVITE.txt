SUBJECT: RE: Files getting deleted when optimize is killed?
DATE: 14 Jul 2003

Upon further examination what I found is this:

- Killing the process while optimize() is still working does NOT cause the
index files to be deleted, HOWEVER --

- Once the index is opened again by a new process (now apparently in an
unstable state due to the incomplete optimize()), at that time all existing
files are deleted and only a file called "segments" remains.

I highly doubt it.

Same as above.  You can create an artificial, large index for testing
purposes.  Call optimize once in a while, and then kill the process.  I
don't think Lucene will remove your files.
