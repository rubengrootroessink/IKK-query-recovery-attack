Thanks. I am trying to repair a corrupted 'segments' file. I am attempting
to manually edit the file to add some missing segment names, but I need to
add the correct segment size for each. Can anyone tell me how to determine
the correct segment size (number of documents in the segment) by looking in
either a .CFS file, or in the appropriate file in a non-compound segment?

Steve

uuuh, you're right, it is not documented at fileformats.html.
Since Lucene 1.4, the individual index files are stored per default 
within one single compound file which has the file extension .cvs . You 
can switch that behaviour off by setting the public static member 
IndexWriter.useCompoundFile to false.
