I'm pretty sure.  The other characters sorted according to the ASCII
sequence.  It's only the slash sorted before the space.  That's why I
wonder whether slash is treated differently.

Btw, this is the statement the sort field is added to the document.

	doc.add(Field.UnIndexed("_s" + sortField, sortableData ));

While I was debugging this statement using Eclipse, I could see what was
in sortableData.  One had "/" and the other a space in the same
position.

Regards,
Bob

Are you sure that the field is untokenized, and that you are sorting
in the correct direction?
