SUBJECT: The best Chinese Analyzer?
DATE: 8 May 2006

I have a question for those who have used Lucene to index and search for
Chinese Characters, what is the best Analyzer for the job?

I know all these three can do the job:

1. StandardAnalyzer
2. CJKAnalyzer
3. ChineseAnalyzer

What are the difference between these 3 analyzers?

TIA.

Regards,
Bob
