Hi Erik,

I am a new comer to this list and please allow me to ask a dumb
question.

For the StandardAnalyzer, will it have to be modified to accept
different character encodings.

We have customers in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.  Chinese data may come
in 3 different encoding:  Big5, GB and UTF8.

What is the default encoding for the StandardAnalyser.

Btw, I did try running the lucene demo (web template) to index the HTML
files after I added one including English and Chinese characters.  I was
not able to search for any Chinese in that HTML file (returned no hits).
I wonder whether I need to change some of the java programs to index
Chinese and/or accept Chinese as search term.  I was able to search for
the HTML file if I used English word that appeared in the added HTML
file.

Thanks,

Bob

Jian - have you tried Lucene's StandardAnalyzer with Chinese?  It
will keep English as-is (removing stop words, lowercasing, and such)
and separate CJK characters into separate tokens also.
