SUBJECT: Issue while creating Regular Expressions
DATE: 14 Aug 2008


I have a small problem. I will describe you the problem first ..I am working
on a search Engine now, in which the crawling is done using Heritrix and the
crawled data is the input for my Logic. while trying to index the ARC files
from Heritrix its not creating indexes in the desired format. The Expression
which Iam using to create the segments is like this   ^(.*)$\\n+  when
passing the filtered contents i;e after removing the Html tags.I created a
pattern using the above said regex and when passing the filtered contents
through the method to Match the pattern it returns 'false'. so Iam little
bit confused regarding which will be the exact regular expression . pls help
me with your suggestions.

Thanks
