SUBJECT: Using javacc for QueryParser.jj
DATE: 30 Jul 2003

Hello. I wanted to use the Highlighter from Maik Schreiber but i had a 
big problem:
In order to use it I need to change Lucene core . That's what I did but 
there is a file QueryParser.jj and I don't know how to compile it. I 
found that I have to use javacc but I don't know how. Can someone help 
me whih that?
