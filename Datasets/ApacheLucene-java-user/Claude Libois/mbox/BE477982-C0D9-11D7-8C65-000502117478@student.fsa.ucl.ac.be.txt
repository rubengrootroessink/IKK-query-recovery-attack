SUBJECT: Different Analyzer for each Field
DATE: 28 Jul 2003

My question is in the title: how can I use a different   Analyzer for 
each field of a Document object? My problem is that if I use 
LetterTokenizer for a field which contains a String representation of a 
number, after I can't delete it. Probably because this analyzer threw 
away my number. So I need to use whitespaceTokenizer for this field but 
I would like to use LetterTokenizer for the other. Can someone help me?
thank you
Claude Libois
