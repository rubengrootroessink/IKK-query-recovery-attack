DATE: 4 Dec 2003

Hello Karsten and Herb,

I would like to join Karsten in the club of sightly confused people
regarding what probabilistic and what vector space model is... :-)  I consistered
TF/IDF and cosine similarity so far as something which belongs to the VSM. The
standard similarity formula for probabilistic model also looks different from
TF/IDF...

Clarification would be appreciated. 

Cheers,
Ralf
