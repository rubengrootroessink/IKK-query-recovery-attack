SUBJECT: RE: Probabilistic Model in Lucene - possible?
DATE: 5 Dec 2003

I guess you mean "Modern Information Retrieval" ... I would be a little bit
careful since this book has theoretical glasses on. It might look more
difficult than expected. However I would like to discuss this further. How could it
be archived to get the values your are writing about? Any first ideas?

Cheers,
Ralf
