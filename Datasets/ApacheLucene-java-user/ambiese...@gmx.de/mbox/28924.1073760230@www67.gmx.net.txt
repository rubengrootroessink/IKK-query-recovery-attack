SUBJECT: HTML tag filter...
DATE: 10 Jan 2004

Hi group,

would it be possible to implement a Analyser who filters HTML code out of a
HTML page. As a result I would have only the text free of any tagging.

Is is maybe better to use other existing open source software for that? Did
somebody tried that here?

Cheers,
Ralf
