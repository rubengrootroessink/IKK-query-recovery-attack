SUBJECT: Collaborative Filtering API
DATE: 25 Nov 2003

Hello togehter,

I am asking this group because I think people here might know about this
since it is a similar approach. 

Is there a Java based API which assist developers of collaborative filtering
in their programs. With this I mean software, which does use user ratings
between items and provide ways (algorithsm, methods) to find users with similar
interests for prediction generation. Finding a API like Lucene would be
dream for me but any pointer to other API's (also in other programming lanuages)
to see and learn from would be appreciated.

Kind Regards
