SUBJECT: Boolean retrieval
DATE: 4 Jul 2009


This is about an experiment comparing plain Boolean retrieval with
vector-space-based retrieval.

I would like to disable all of Lucene's scoring mechanisms and just
run a true Boolean query that returns exactly the documents that match a
query specified in Boolean syntax (OR, AND, NOT). No scoring or sorting
required.

As far as I can see, this is not supported out of the box.  Which classes
would I have to modify?

Would it be enough to create a subclass of Similarity and to ignore all 
terms but one (coord, say) and make this term return 1 if the query 
matches the document and 0 otherwise?
