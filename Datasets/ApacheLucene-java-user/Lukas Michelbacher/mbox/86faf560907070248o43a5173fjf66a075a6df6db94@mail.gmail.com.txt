Yes I am. I had the same impression but I couldn't figure out a more
straightforward way.

> The bug in your code is that clause.getQuery().getString() is not producing terms that
are in your index - the first call to getTermsFilter passes the string Â "+f1:aaa +f1:bbb"
which is not a term in the index.

OK, thanks. I'll have look at that.

> Given the requirement is to ignore scoring I would recommend (as someone else suggested)
looking at the IndexSearch.search method that takes a HitCollector and simply accumulate all
results, regardless of score.

I think that's what I'm going to end up doing. I was just curious to
know what was wrong with my initial approach.

Thanks for your comments.
