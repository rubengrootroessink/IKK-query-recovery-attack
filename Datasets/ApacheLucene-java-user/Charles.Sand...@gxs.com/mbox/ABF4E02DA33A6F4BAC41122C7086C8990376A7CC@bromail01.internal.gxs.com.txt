Rob,
Not sure I have the answer to your question, but thought I would add my
observations.  According to the book "Lucene In Action", the default
index type is compound, although I did not find this mentioned in the
API docs.  However, my observations have been that this is not true.  At
least on my system it appears to build a multifile index at times.
Which has lead to other problems similar to what you are reporting.

I found the solution to my problem was to declare my index as compound.
	IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(indexDir, new
StandardAnalyzer(), false);
      writer.setUseCompoundFile(true); 

Now my index is built as compound and I no longer have "orphaned" index
files.

Hope this helps someone.
Charles

Subject: Compound / non-compound index files and SIGKILL

I've been indexing live data into a compound index from an MTA. I'm
resolving a bunch of problems unrelated to Lucene (disparate hangs in my
content handlers). When I get a hang, I typically need to kill my
daemon, alas more often than not using kill -9 (SIGKILL).

However, these SIGKILLs are leaving large temporary(?) files, which I
guess are non-compound index files transiently extracted from the
working .cfs
files:

-rw-r--r--    1  373138432 Jun  2 13:42 _18hup.fdt
-rw-r--r--    1      5054464 Jun  2 13:42 _18hup.fdx
-rw-r--r--    1              426 Jun  2 13:42 _18hup.fnm

-rw-r--r--    1  457253888 Jun  2 09:22 _15djq.fdt
-rw-r--r--    1      6205440 Jun  2 09:22 _15djq.fdx
-rw-r--r--    1              426 Jun  2 09:21 _15djq.fnm

They are left intact after restarting my daemon. Presumably they are not
treated as being part of the compound index. I see no corresponding .cfs
file for them. 

As a consequence of these - I suspect - I am getting a very large
overall disk requirement for my index, presumably because of replicated
field data.
My guess is that the field data in the orphaned .fdt files needs to be
regenerated.

In another index directory from a previous test run (again with
SIGKILLs), I have 98 GB of index files, with only 12 BG devoted to
compound files for the field index (.cfs). The rest of the disk space is
used by orphaned uncompounded index files; I see 51 GB devoted to
uncompounded field data (.fdt), 13 BG devoted to term positions (.prx)
and 13 BG devoted to term frequencies (.frq).

Here's my question:

How can I attempt to merge these orphaned into the compound index, using
IndexWriter.addIndexes(), or would I be foolish attempting this?
