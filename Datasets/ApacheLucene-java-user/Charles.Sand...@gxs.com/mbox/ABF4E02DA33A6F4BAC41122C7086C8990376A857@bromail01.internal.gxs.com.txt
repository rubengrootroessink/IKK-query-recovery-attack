I had this same problem.  I began calling
IndexWriter.setUseCompoundFile(true) when I open an IndexWriter and
before I index.  Since I have used this method call, I have not seen the
problem again.

Hope this helps.

I'm creating my index file and in the same time I try to do some
searches inside.
Sometimes I retrieve this error message:
"\\tradluxstmp01\JavaIndex\tra\index_FR\_335.fnm (The system cannot find
the file specified)"
What I have to do or what's happen?
