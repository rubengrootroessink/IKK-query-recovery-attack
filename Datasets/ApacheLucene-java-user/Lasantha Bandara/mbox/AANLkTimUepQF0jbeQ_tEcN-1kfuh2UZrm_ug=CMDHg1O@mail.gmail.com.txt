Hi,

When I searched for java projects that can be acceptable for GSOC 2011, I
found Lucene. It nicely matches with my interests. Could you please tell me
whether you are going to be there this time. If yes, what kind of ideas that
you will be present. I like to start quite earlier working on this project,
if you are going to participate.

Thank you.
