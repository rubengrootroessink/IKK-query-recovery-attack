Not to mention Lupy.

Hasn't it been relatively well-established that trying to create a  
performant search engine in a dynamic interpreted language is a show- 
stopper?  After several failed ports of lucene (I can add to this my  
own, unreleased, attempt) I just don't see the point, except as an  
academic exercise.   This is true even with selective optimization in  
c.  I think that the core engine needs to be in c/java to achieve  
feasibility--there's nothing stopping a cool dynamic language  
wrapping the core (see Lucy).

good luck,
-Mike
