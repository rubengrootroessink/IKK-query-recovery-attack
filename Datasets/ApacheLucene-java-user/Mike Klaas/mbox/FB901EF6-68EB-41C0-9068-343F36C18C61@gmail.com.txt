Wait--shouldn't the outer-most BooleanQuery provide most of this  
speedup already (since it should be skipTo'ing between the nested  
BooleanQueries and the outermost).  Is it the indirection and sub- 
query management that is causing the performance difference, or  
differences in skiptTo behaviour?
