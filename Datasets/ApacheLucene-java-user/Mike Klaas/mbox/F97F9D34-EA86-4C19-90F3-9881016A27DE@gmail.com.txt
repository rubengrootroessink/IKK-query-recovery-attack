Partitioning indices by term is an approach whose adoption (as far as  
I am away) is limited to academic projects.  Further, it is much more  
bandwdith intensive than the document partition approach (you have to  
do term-posting list intersections across machines, instead of  
locally).  With doc partitioning, you get the top X docs from each  
server, using almost no bandwidth.
