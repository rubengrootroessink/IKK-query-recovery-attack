Perhaps not.  Storing a field with norms occupies O(N) space,  
regardless of the number of document with non-zero norms.  There  
might be too much data for the os to cache and lucene to process  
efficiently.

There is not.  They are relatively costless if omitNorms=False

The experimental Payloads allows an optional boost to be stored along  
with term position.  This is the intended use case.
