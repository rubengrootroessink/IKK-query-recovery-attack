I'm sure Yonik can imagine such a world... that's what Solr provide
<g>.  Configure an analyzer for a field (or even separate index-time
and query-time analyzers) once, and never worry about it again.

Note that you don't need a fixed _number_ of fields to achieve these
benefits, just a fixed definition per unique field name.
