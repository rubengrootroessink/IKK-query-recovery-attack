Probably most of that still applies to some extent.  However, it is
unclear whether it will speed up your application.

First thing is to find out what your bottleneck is.  Looking at the
stats on your machine during indexing, is io-bound? cpu-bound? mixed?

There are various possible strategies, but they will come from
finely-tuning your proceed to meet the bottlenecks you are
experiencing.  If you are cpu-bound, then perhaps you can use less
intensive analyzers, or purchase a multi-cpu machine and index
threadedly.  If you are i/o bound, you could 1) buy faster disks, 2)
use a faster i/o backend (e.g. RAID-0), 3) created indexes on multiple
independent disks and merge later.
