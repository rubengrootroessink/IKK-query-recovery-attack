Let me try:

+(-A +B) -> must match (-A +B) -> must contain B and must not contain A
-(-A +B) -> must not match (-A +B) -> must not (match B and not contain A)

As chris mentioned, they don't mean much outside the rest of the
query... tack on "X Y " to both, and you get:

SHOULD contain X, SHOULD contain Y, MUST contain B, MUST NOT contain A

SHOULD contain X, SHOULD contain Y (effectively, MUST contain X or Y),
MUST NOT (contain B without containing A)

HTH,
