Stemming is a multi-step, lossy, one-way operation and  it does not
suprised me that none of these packages attempts the reverse
operation.

My suggestion is to create a reverse stemmer yourself by taking the
lexicon of your corpus, stemming all the terms, and inverting the map.
 At query time, a lookup can be performed using a trie or hashtable.
