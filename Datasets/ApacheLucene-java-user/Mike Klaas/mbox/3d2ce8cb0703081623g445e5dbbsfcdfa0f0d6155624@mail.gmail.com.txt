I don't know... hashing individual words is an extremely weak form of
security that should be breakable without even using a computer... all
the statistical information is still there (somewhat like 'encrypting'
a message as a cryptoquote).

Doron's suggestion is preferable: eliminate token position information
from the index entirely.
