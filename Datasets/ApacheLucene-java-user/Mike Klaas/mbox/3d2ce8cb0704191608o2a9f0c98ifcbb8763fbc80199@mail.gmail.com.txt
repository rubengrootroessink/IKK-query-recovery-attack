To be more specific: I'm implementing shingling (detection of near-duplicate documents) and
want to add the document fingerprint (which is based on the sequence of tokens) to the index.

can't easily update a document which is already indexed. The only way I could get this information
*before* adding a document to an index is to create a token stream manually (and then have
this happen all over again when the document is indexed). This isn't a satisfying solution.
Does anyone have any suggestions of how I could get the fingerprint information into the index?
I'd appreciate any input. Thanks!

You coudl write a custom tokenfilter which indexes the fingerprint as
the last token in the field as !fingerprint:123abfe2d3c23df23 or
similar.
