True.

I suppose it also depends on how much access the user has to the
index.  If they have access to the physical index and means of
querying it, then they have access to the hashing algo (and/or key)
and so it is worthless.  If they don't, and their access is strictly
through queries, then I don't see what help hashing will provide, as
the result of any given query should be the same, hashing or not.

You could also do both.  Another thing that might help is relatively
aggressive stop word removal.  All these measures will raise the
"discouragement" bar slightly.
