DATE: 25 Sep 2009

Hi,

I've read that it is possible to update the index while another thread has a reader open.


Now let's say the reader is trying to reopen the index (using its reopen method) and at the
very same time, the write its committing its 500MB changes to the index. My question is, what
happens in this situation? What index does the reader end up having if it tries to open the
index while the writer is modifying it?

Any feedback will be much appreciated,

Klaus.
