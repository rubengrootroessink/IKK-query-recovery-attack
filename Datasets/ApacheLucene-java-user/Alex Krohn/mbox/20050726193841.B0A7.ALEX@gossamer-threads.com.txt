Hi,

I've added the Lucene mailing lists to our searchable archive found
here:

	http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/

The search is, of course, powered by Lucene. =) I hope you find it
useful, and thanks for the great work! If you have any questions or
problems with it, please feel free to email me off list.

Cheers,

Alex
