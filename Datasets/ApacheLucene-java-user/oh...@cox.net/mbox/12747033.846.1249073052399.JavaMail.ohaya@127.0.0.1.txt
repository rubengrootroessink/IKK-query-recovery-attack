SUBJECT: Re: ThreadedIndexWriter vs. IndexWriter
DATE: 31 Jul 2009

Hi,

Sorry to jump in, but I've been following this thread with interest 
:)...

Am I misunderstanding your original observation, that 
ThreadedIndexWriter produced smaller index?  Did the ThreadedIndexWriter 
also finish faster (I'm assuming that it should)?

If the index is smaller, and everything else being good and equal, 
doesn't that mean that using ThreadedIndexWriter is a good thing?

Anyway, aside from checking that the # of documents were the same, have 
you looked at the index using something like Luke?  Does the contents of 
the index look the same in both cases, or were they different?  If 
different, how so (e.g., missing terms, etc.)?

Later,
Jim
