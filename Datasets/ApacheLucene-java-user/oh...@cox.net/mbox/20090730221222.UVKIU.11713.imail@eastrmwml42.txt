SUBJECT: Is there a list of "special" characters for standard analyzer?
DATE: 31 Jul 2009

Hi,

I was wonder if there is a list of special characters for the standard analyzer?  

What I mean by "special" is characters that the analyzer considers break characters.  For
example, if I have something like "foo=something", apparently the analyzer considers this
as two terms, "foo" and "something.

Thanks,
Jim
