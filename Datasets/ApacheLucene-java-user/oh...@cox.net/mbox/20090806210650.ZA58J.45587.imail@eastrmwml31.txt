SUBJECT: Re: Why does this search succeed with web app, but not Luke?

Phil,

Both my indexer and the webapp are basically from the Lucene demos, the indexer starting with
the IndexFiles.java demo code, so I think they're both using the StandardAnalyzer.

What appears in Luke, when I select "path" is just the filename part, without the extension,
i.e., the "xxxx" part.  

That's why I said in my original post that I was kind of surprised that doing a web query
for "path:xxxx.yyy" succeeded, i.e, in the path field in the index, there is no "xxxx.yyy",
just "xxxx".
