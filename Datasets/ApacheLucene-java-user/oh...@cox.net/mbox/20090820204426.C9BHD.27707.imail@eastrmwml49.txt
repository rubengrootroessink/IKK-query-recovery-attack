SUBJECT: Re: Possible to invoke same Lucene query on a String?
DATE: 21 Aug 2009

Hi,

I guess, that, in short, what I'm really trying to find out is:

If I construct a Lucene query, can I (somehow) use that to query a String object that I have,
rather than querying against a Lucene index?

Thanks,
Jim

Y" (document containing both term=X and term=Y), return the file path+name for the document.
 I also was displaying the terms associated with each sub-document by parsing the 'summary'
string.

the web app would display something like:

been asked, I need to query the 3 sub-strings from the 'summary', i.e., run the "term1a AND
term2a" query against the following strings:
