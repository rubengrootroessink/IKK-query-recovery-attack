SUBJECT: Scoring documents by position
DATE: 27 Oct 2006

Hi,

I'm quite new to Lucene but I've managed to get it to return quite
complex results. The problem is that the results aren't bringing up the
most relevant documents first.

Is it possible to score or boost a result document based on where a
search term appears in a field? Ie, if I search in a title field for
'OpenGL', is it possible to have results like 'OpenGL Guide' to be
scored highter then 'A Guide to OpenGL' ?

Any help appreciated!
Thanks,
Oli
