John,

You might take a look at a patch I submitted to lucene-dev this morning
(http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30429) . It's aimed at
pseudo-relevance feedback, so it automatically adds terms from an initial
answer set to a query, but of course you can do whatever you want with the
terms after they've been ranked. To rank terms and find the best descriptors
the Robertson Selection Value is employed.

Best regards,

Rene
