Hi Tom,
 the more i am getting responses in this thread the more i feel that our
application needs optimization.

350 GB and less than 2 seconds!!! That's much more than my expectation :-)
(in current scenario).

*characteristics of slow queries:*
 there are a few reasons for greater search time

 1.Two of our fields contain decimal values but are not NumericField :( .
These fields are searched as a range. Whenever the ranges are larger and/or
both the fields are used in search the search time and server load goes
high. I have already started work to convert it to NumericField - but
suggestions and experiences are most welcome.

2. When queries (without two fields mentioned above) have a lot of
words/phrases search time is high. E.g I took a query with around 80 unique
terms (not words) in 5 fields. These terms occur repeatedly and become total
225 terms (non-unique). This particular query took 4.2 seconds. the 15
indexes used for this query were of total size 5 G.
Are 225 terms (80 unique) is a very big number?

and yes, slow queries are always slow. yes but obviously high load will add
up to their slowness.




Here I have another curiosity about something I noticed.
If I have a query like following:


title:xyz title:xyz title:xyz title:xyz title:xyz title:xyz title:xyz
title:xyz title:xyz title:xyz title:xyz

*Will lucene search for the term 11 times or it will reuse the results of
first term?*

If later is true (which I think is), is there any particular reason or it
may be optimized inside lucene?
