DATE: 16 Apr 2010

Hi. I don't think you need a different analyzer. Read about
PhraseQuery<http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/PhraseQuery.html>.
If you are using parse() method of QueryParser. Enclose the searched string
in extra double quotes, which must obviously be escaped.

Query q = qp.parse("\"united states\"");
