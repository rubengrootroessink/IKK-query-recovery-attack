SUBJECT: Single filter instance with different searchers
DATE: 3 Nov 2010

Hi. We have a large index (~ 28 GB) which is distributed in three different
directories, each representing a country. Each of these country wise indexes
is further distributed on the basis of last update date into 21 smaller
indexes. This index is updated once in a day.

A user can search into any of one country and can choose last update date
plus some other criteria.

When the server application starts, index readers and hence searchers are
created for each of the small indexes (21 x 3) and put in an array.
Depending on the option (country and last update date) chosen by user we
pick the searchers of correct date range/country and create a new
ParallelMultiSearcher instance.

Now my question is - can I use single filter (caching filter) instance for
every search (may be on different searchers)?
===================================================================================

e.g
for first search i create an filter of experience 4 years and save it.

if another search for a different country (and hence difference index) also
has same experience criteria, i.e. 4 years, can i use the same filter
instance for second search too?

i have tested a little for this and surprisingly i have got correct results.
i was wondering if this is the correct way. or do i need to create different
filters for each searcher (or index reader) instance?

Thanks in advance.
