SUBJECT: One Field!
DATE: 15 Jul 2004

I have an index with multiple fields. Right now I am using MultiFieldQueryParser to search
the fields. This means that if the same term occurs in multiple fields, it will be weighed
accordingly. Is there any way to treat all the fields in question as one field and score the
document accordingly without having to reindex.

Thanks.
