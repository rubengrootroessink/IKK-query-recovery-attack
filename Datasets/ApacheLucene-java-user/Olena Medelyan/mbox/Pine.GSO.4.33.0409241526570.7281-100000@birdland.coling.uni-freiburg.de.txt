SUBJECT: Using Proximity for Ranking
DATE: 24 Sep 2004

Dear Lucene-Users,

is there any possibility to use proximity for long queries (10 and more
terms) automatically? I need a kind of ranking feature, that would give
higher relevance scores to those documents, that contain query terms (or
some of query terms) with a lower distance between them. I know that I can
use the slop operator for phrase search ("red fox"~3), but what I need
should work for partial matching as well.

Thanks in advance for your help,
