DATE: 29 Jan 2010

"When searching with a query as a multi term query, users can further reward
documents matching more query terms through a coordination factor:
*coord-factor(q,d)
"

*How we configure this factor?
I am needing if documents matching more term queries then their score are
higher.

Please show me more details. Thanks 1
