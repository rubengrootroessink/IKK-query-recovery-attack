SUBJECT: Re: Recommend a example to implement an analyzer with parsing	Camelcase
DATE: 7 Feb 2010

Hi Ahmet,
I have ever known WordDelimiterFilterFactory, but never use Solr.
But how to download this class.
Can I use it in Lucene 3.0, or extends Analyzer with overloading its
methods.
Sorry If my questions are too details.
