Hello Dinh,
Thank you very much for your answer,

Before examize deeply Class "MoreLikeThis", I have got one more issue:
To work with my idea,
I need implementing a Vector Space Model by using Lucene Library.
so that I can compare every document in the SET of Docs
with a query (or include several terms, long as text document).

"MoreLikeThis" can do it with the same mechanism?
If not, please show me how to implement a Lucene query that including many
terms.

Again, thank you much!
