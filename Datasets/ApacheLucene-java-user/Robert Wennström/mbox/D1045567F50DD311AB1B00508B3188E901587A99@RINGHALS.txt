SUBJECT: RE: OutOfMemoryError with boolean queries
DATE: 19 Mar 2003

Sorry. I wasn't verbose enough.

I use the default memory settings. But my issue was the core structure of Lucene
taking up (it seems to me) more memory than it would have to, if it had a
different approach.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that BooleanQuery stores all hits
(as Bucket objects) from all terms in the query even if it is a simple  war* AND
wash* AND sad*. Instead of looking for wash* just in the war* hits (and then
looking for sad* in the remaining hits) it makes three separate searches, which
would be a waste of memory.

----- test output begins -----

Index size = 55000
Query: a*
Total memory before: 2031616
Searching for: a* (org.apache.lucene.search.PrefixQuery)
Total memory after: 55128064
53527 total matching documents (1984ms)
Query: e*
Total memory before: 55128064
Searching for: e* (org.apache.lucene.search.PrefixQuery)
Total memory after: 55128064
52456 total matching documents (984ms)
Query: a* AND e*
Total memory before: 55128064
Searching for: +a* +e* (org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery)
Total memory after: 124882944
51267 total matching documents (2468ms)

----- test output ends -----

In my perfect world the memory allocation, when searching for  a* AND e*, should
not increase at all after the both separate searches  a*  and  e*, cause it
would just allocate space for a*-hits, and ignoring e*-hits that has no previous
hit.


My biggest index lies at 2,34 million documents during testing, but should grow
with approximately 10000 docs/day in production.
With that figure I wish for the best possible memory handling.


At the moment we use a search engine that, given the right question (or wrong),
consumes memory like a starving wolf and crashes the whole thing. The search
engine should be able to play with about 1GB RAM on the machine.
I just don't want the same possibilities of a crash with Lucene too.


I want to know if the Lucene developers feel that there are things to optimize
or if they have done everything like it should be from the start ?


thanks
