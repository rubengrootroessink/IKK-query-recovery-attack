SUBJECT: Wildcard search with my own analyzer
DATE: 15 Jul 2004

I wanted to support categories, and so I created my own analyzer so that:

Root Category||My Category||Some Other Things

Would be split up into three terms split by ||, and I wanted it to stay 
case sensitive.

If I do a search for:

categories:"Root Category"

it works fine. But if I do a search for:

categories:"Root Cate*"

it doesn't find it.

What do I need to do so that wildcard searching will work on this? I am 
using the same analyzer for indexing and searching (otherwise the first 
search wouldn't work either).

Thank you,

Joel Shellman
