SUBJECT: IndexSearcher usage and caching?
DATE: 12 Jul 2004

I'm working on a document management system using lucene to search 
through all the documents.

This means that I'll be adding/updating/deleting documents at the same 
time searches are going on.

I thought to create an IndexSearcher and reuse it throughout, but that 
doesn't seem to work. If I do a search, then add a document, and do 
another search with the same IndexSearcher, it won't find the newly 
added document.

I'd rather not have to create a new IndexSearcher for every query... do 
I have to?

Thanks,

-joel shellman
