SUBJECT: A Special SpanQuery
DATE: 22 Jun 2006

I am trying to make a SpanNearQuery that will contain a SpanNotQuery and 
running into a bit of difficulty. Has anyone worked with creating a 
variation of a SpanQuery or using special logic to make this work?
For example - (A B !C) in order with a slop of 1 should return results 
with A and B within 1 slop of each other and not have C after B within 
the slop left over from A to B. With this rule, A B E M F would return 
true, while A B E C J would be false.
Thanks!
Ben
