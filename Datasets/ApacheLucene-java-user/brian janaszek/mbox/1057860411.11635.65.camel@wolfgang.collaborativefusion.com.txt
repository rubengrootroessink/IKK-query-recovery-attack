Hi

Has anyone made the changes to the Lucene codebase/build process for the
latest version of JavaCC?  Version 2 is pretty hard to come by these
days (I managed to get a copy from one of the developers), but I also
tweaked the Lucene code to build with version 3...but that also required
downloading the lastest Ant build, since the JavaCC optional task was
also configured for version 2.

Thanks
b
