SUBJECT: SortField[] in search method (newbie)
DATE: 16 Sep 2004

Why can I search fields that aren't indexed without any problem, but if I ask for ordering
by one of these fields, I got a runtime exception?

I can't understand this behavior. I mean if I don't have any document indexed with these fields,
why can I search by these fields and I can't ask for ordering by one of them?
At the beginning I don't have any document at all, and I will need to order anyway, because
I don't know that.

Thanks.

Does it mean you indexed all "not null" fields?. I think you should change
your code so that you always index the fields you want to sort.

In any case, it looks like some of your documents have shortName not null
and not indexed. If you do not have any non-indexed shotnames in the index,
I don't think u would have got that error. But I may be wrong.

Aviran,
I can search in not indexed fields without any exception, but I can't order
by the same fields.
Besides,  I can't know in advance if they are indexed in my app, because I
index those fields that have some value, if it doesn't I don't add it to the
document.

What if I don't have any document indexed?

You can only sort on indexed field. (even more than that, it'll work
properly only on Untokenized fields, ie keyword).

Luceners,
My search looks up the whole entities. My entities are accounts, contacts,
tasks, etc. My searching looks up a group of entity's fields. This works
fine despite, I don't have indexed any entity in a document. But If I sort
by some fields from different entities, I get the following error.

field "shortName" does not appear to be indexed

The account's field I have indexed are

shortName,number,location,fax,phone,symbol

and I order by

shortName
----------------------------------------------------
without  any order

shortName,number,location,fax,phone,symbol

it works fine.
----
I don't understand the behavior because If I don't order the searching and I
don't have any document indexed, It works fine, but If I add an order I get
a runtimeException and I can't catch the exception  to solve the problem.
The only solution it's to index the whole fields' entitities once in a
document, but for me it's a patch.

Any idea,  it could help me out.

Thanks in advance.
