SUBJECT: problem with SortField[] in search method (newbie)
DATE: 15 Sep 2004

Luceners,
My search looks up the whole entities. My entities are accounts,
contacts, tasks, etc. My searching looks up a group of entity's fields.
This works fine despite, I don't have indexed any entity in a document.
But If I sort by some fields from different entities, I get the
following error.
 
field "shortName" does not appear to be indexed
 
The account's field I have indexed are
 
shortName,number,location,fax,phone,symbol
 
and I order by
 
shortName
----------------------------------------------------
without  any order
 
shortName,number,location,fax,phone,symbol
 
it works fine.
----
I don't understand the behavior because If I don't order the searching
and I don't have any document indexed, It works fine, but If I add an
order I get a runtimeException and I can't catch the exception  to solve
the problem. The only solution it's to index the whole fields'
entitities once in a document, but for me it's a patch.
 
Any idea,  it could help me out.
 
Thanks in advance.
