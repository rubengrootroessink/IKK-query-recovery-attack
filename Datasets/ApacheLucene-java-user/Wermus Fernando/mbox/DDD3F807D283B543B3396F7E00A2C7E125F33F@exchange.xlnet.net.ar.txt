Aviran,
	I can search in not indexed fields without any exception, but I can't order by the same fields.
	Besides,  I can't know in advance if they are indexed in my app, because I index those fields
that have some value, if it doesn't I don't add it to the document.
 
	What if I don't have any document indexed?

You can only sort on indexed field. (even more than that, it'll work
properly only on Untokenized fields, ie keyword).

Luceners,
My search looks up the whole entities. My entities are accounts, contacts,
tasks, etc. My searching looks up a group of entity's fields. This works
fine despite, I don't have indexed any entity in a document. But If I sort
by some fields from different entities, I get the following error.
 
field "shortName" does not appear to be indexed
 
The account's field I have indexed are
 
shortName,number,location,fax,phone,symbol
 
and I order by
 
shortName
----------------------------------------------------
without  any order
 
shortName,number,location,fax,phone,symbol
 
it works fine.
----
I don't understand the behavior because If I don't order the searching and I
don't have any document indexed, It works fine, but If I add an order I get
a runtimeException and I can't catch the exception  to solve the problem.
The only solution it's to index the whole fields' entitities once in a
document, but for me it's a patch.
 
Any idea,  it could help me out.
 
Thanks in advance.
