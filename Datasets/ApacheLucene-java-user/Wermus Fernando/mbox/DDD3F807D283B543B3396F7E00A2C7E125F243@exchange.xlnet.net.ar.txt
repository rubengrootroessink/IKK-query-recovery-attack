I have to search a string in 30 fields. I know how to do it in a long
way. I wanna know if exists a shorter way.
 
String for searching: what's your name?
Long way: +firstname:what's your name?  OR +lastname: what's your name?
OR .......
 
A shorter way: (firstname OR lastname OR ....):what's your name?
 
Is it possible? Our searching is always the same kind of searching.
 
Thanks in advance
