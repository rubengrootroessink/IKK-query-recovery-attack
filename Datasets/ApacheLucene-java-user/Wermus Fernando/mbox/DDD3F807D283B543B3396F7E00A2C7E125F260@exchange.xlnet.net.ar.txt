Luceners,
I have elements (accounts, contacts, task, events) where I have to find
in any field a word ("hello" for example). Which is the best way to do
that with Lucene?
 
In other words,
I have several elements where I have to search a Word. I can make one
search and then order the hits to separate the elements. The another
option is to make as much searching as elements I have. Which one of
these options is better?
 
I'm using MultiFieldQueryParser
