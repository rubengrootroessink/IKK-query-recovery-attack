I have test my app with snowball for english. But I'm doing something
wrong because I can't get any result from hit.
 
If I index "lazy" with English snowball when I see the word in Luke it
shows "lazy" (I've read that Luke show the file as is). When I do the
search for the word "laziness" the snowball English change for "lazi"
but it doesn't seem to add any * . So I can't get any hit.
 
If I search for 
 
laziness
 
The result using MultiFieldQueryParser
 
description:lazi
 
0 hits
 
I am supposed to index the word "lazy" as tokenized, unindexed or
something like this to get a hit. I have a similar problem when sorting,
it ask for being untokenized.
 
What am I doing wrong?
 
How can I use Luke to look up words using snowball English?
 
thanks
