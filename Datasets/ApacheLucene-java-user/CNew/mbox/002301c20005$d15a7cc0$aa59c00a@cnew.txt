I can't help but notice the similarities between this effort and the new POI
project at apache (jakharta).

A lot of the language, vision, etc. maps directly... just substitute "Adobe
PDF" for "Microsoft Excel." and you have a lot of your requirements and
perhaps your solution architecture.

POI seeks to both read and write.  But on the read-side they use an
event-callback technique - similar in concept to SAX for XML.  Sounds like a
nice way to do this sort of thing.

And of course, there is the Lucene connection.  They mention Lucene
specifically as a project that needs binary level read access to MS Office
documents.

but I think that PDF is even more mentioned in this list.
