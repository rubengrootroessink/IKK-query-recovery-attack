I use XmlBeans to "unmarshall" an XML file into Java objects, from which 
you can easily retrieve the textual values of any element to be used for 
indexing.

See http://xmlbeans.apache.org/ for more information on this library. 
There are various similar libraries but I find XmlBeans superior in speed, 
memory usage, and ease of programming model.

Hi,

   Just wondering is there anyone used Digester to extract xml content and
index the xml file? Is there any source that I can refer to on how to
extract the xml contents. Or is there any other xml parser is much easier 
to
use?

   Thanks

regards,
Wooi Meng
