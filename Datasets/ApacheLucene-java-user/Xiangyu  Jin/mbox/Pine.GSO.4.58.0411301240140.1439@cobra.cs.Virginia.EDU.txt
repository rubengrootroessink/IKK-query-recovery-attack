SUBJECT: Does Lucene perform ranking in the retrieved set?
DATE: 30 Nov 2004


THis might be a stupid question.

When perform retrieval for a query, deos Lucene first get
a subset of candidate matches and then perform the ranking
on the set? That is, similarity calculation is performed only
on a subset of the docuemnts to the query.

If so, from which module could I get those candidate docs,
then I can perform my own similarity calculations (since
I might need to rewrite the normalization factor, so
only modify the "similarity" model seems will not
work).

Or, is there document describe the produre of how Lucene
perform search?

thanks
