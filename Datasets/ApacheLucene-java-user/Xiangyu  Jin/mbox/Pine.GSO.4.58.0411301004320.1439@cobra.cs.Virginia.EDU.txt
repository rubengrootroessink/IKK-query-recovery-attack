I also have the same task as you do. According to my understanding,
suppose their are N documents, your approach will take N^2 similarity
calculations.

Although there are N(N-1)/2 distinct document pairs,
the similarity calculation (according to my understanding) in Lucene is
asymmetric, so this means you have to calculate N(N-1) similaries.
Therefore, seems your approach is not so redundant since you have to
calculate O(N^2) order of similarities.
