SUBJECT: Atomic updates on Lucene index document?
DATE: 15 Apr 2005

Hi all,

As far as I know, I don't find any Lucene API for updating an index document. What I have
to do is to delete the existing index document and insert a new one. However, this is going
to be 2 separate operations (delete and update). If the first operation suceeds while the
second operation fails, I don't see an easy way to roll back the changes. Does any one have
ideas on how to implement automic update in Lucene?

Thanks,
Terence
