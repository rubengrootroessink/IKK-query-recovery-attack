SUBJECT: Question on QueryParser.parse()
DATE: 14 May 2004

I am trying to create a query object using the QueryParser for the search word "A+". However,
it always returns a Null object back. My code is stated below:

    Query q = QueryParser.parse("A\+", "myIndex", new StandardAnalyzer());

I've also tried the following query strings, but none of them returns the query object back.

    myIndex: A\+
    myIndex: "A\+"
    myIndex: "A+"

Does anyone know the solution?

By the way, I am using Lucence 1.4 RC3.

Thanks,
Terence
