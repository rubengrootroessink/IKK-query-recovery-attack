SUBJECT: Storing Stemmed and Original Tokens
DATE: 22 Jan 2007

Hi All,

I'm using the SnowballAnalyzer to "stemm" tokens - which is working fine!

Now I got the requirement to also keep the original Tokens in the index 
for search. According to this 
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200302.mbox/%3C187D6D956106D84E9D8B280F6458FE140F5B2A@merc12.na.sas.com%3E

Mail, I extended the SnowballAnalyzer
in the way Eric described it.

Does anyone has experience in storing stemmed and original tokens in the 
same field and same position? Is it the "right" way to do it?

I also found some Discussions about storing stemmed tokens in an extra 
field, but that would mean I would have to rewrite the query ...


thanks
hannes
