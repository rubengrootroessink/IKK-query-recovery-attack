SUBJECT: Advice on indexing content from a database
DATE: 5 Jan 2005

Hi

I'm working on integrating lucene with a cms. All the data is stored in a
database. I'm looking at about 2 million records. Any advice on an
effective technique to index this (incrementally or using threads) that
would not overload my server.

Thanks

Aneesha
