SUBJECT: LUCENE-843 Release
DATE: 30 Jul 2007


Hi guys,

Do you think LUCENE-843 is stable enough? If so, do you think it's worth to
release it with probably LUCENE 2.2.1? It would be nice so that people can
take the advantage of it right away without risking other breaking changes
in the HEAD branch or waiting until 2.3 release.

Thanks,
--
