SUBJECT: Re: Lucene 2.9 RC2 now available for testing
DATE: 9 Sep 2009

I've been testing 2.9 RC2 lately and comparing query performance to 2.3.2.
I'm seeing a huge increase in throughput (2x-10x) on an index that was built
with 2.3.2. The queries have a lot of BoostingTermQuerys and boolean clauses
containing a custom scorer. Using JProfiler, I observe that the improvement
is due to a huge reduction in the number of calls to TermDocs.next and
TermDocs.skipTo (about 65% fewer calls). Since the custom scorer is somewhat
expensive and frequent in these queries, the improvement is quite noticable.

Have there been a lot of optimizations in the IndexSearcher/skipto/next
logic since 2.3.2?
Should I expect to see even more query improvement by building the index
with 2.9?  (pinch me!)
Good stuff!

Thanks,
Peter
