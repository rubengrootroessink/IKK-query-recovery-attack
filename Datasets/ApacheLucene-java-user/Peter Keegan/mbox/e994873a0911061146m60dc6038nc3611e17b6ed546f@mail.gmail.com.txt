DATE: 6 Nov 2009

Here's a new scenario:

1. JVM 1 creates IndexWriter, version 1
2. JVM 2 creates IndexReader, version 1
3. JVM 1 IndexWriter calls prepareCommit()
4. JVM 2 IndexReader.isCurrent() returns false

In step 4, I expected 'isCurrent' to return true until the IndexWriter had
committed in JVM 1. Is this the correct behavior?
