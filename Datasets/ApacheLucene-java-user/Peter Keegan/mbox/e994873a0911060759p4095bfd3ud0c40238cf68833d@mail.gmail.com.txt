SUBJECT: 2 phase commit with external data
DATE: 6 Nov 2009

I'm trying to use a two phase commit involving a Lucene index and an
external file derived from the index.
Here are the steps:

1. prepare commit on Lucene index
2. prepare commit on external file
3. commit Lucene index
4. commit external file

Step 2 requires an IndexReader with access to the 'prepared' Lucene index,
but I don't see any methods for this. Is there a way to read the prepared
index? I really only need access to a stored field. I'm using Lucene-2.9

Thanks,
Peter
