Otis,

The Lucene components for this beta are running on 4 dual core AMD Opteron (
2.6GHZ) processors, for a total of 8 CPUs. It has 32GB RAM, although 16GB
would probably suffice. The query rate is currently quite low probably
because of the low visibility of the beta page. We haven't measured QPS
rates for this configuration, yet, but if you look at some of my previous
posts, you'll see some QPS data on somewhat similar hardware. I think that
actual rates will be lower, though, because the complexity of the queries,
counting, sorting, etc have increased.
