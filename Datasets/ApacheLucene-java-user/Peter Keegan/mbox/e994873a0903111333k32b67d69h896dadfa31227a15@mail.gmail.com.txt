This is currently the only way to boost a term via payloads.
BoostingTermQuery extends SpanTermQuery.

Yes, this is the case I meant. To the casual observer, they both appear to
be "exact matches' with respect to term frequency. However, I realize that
the first query would score higher than the 2nd if all 4 terms were indexed
at the same position. I guess this is part of the point you're making about
spans. Would a plain PhraseQuery behave this way, too?
