SUBJECT: Re: question about custom sort method
DATE: 17 May 2006

Suppose I have a custom sorting 'DocScoreComparator' for computing distances
on each search hit from a specified coordinate (similar to the
DistanceComparatorSource example in LIA). Assume that the 'specified
coordinate' is different for each query. This means a new custom comparator
must be created for each query, which is ok. However, Lucene caches the
comparator even though it will never be reused. This could result in heavy
memory usage if many queries are performed before the IndexReader is
updated.

Is there any way to avoid having lucene cache the custom sorting objects?
