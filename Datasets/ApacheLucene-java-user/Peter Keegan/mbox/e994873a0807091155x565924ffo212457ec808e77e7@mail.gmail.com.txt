SUBJECT: Payloads and SpanScorer
DATE: 9 Jul 2008

If a SpanQuery is constructed from one or more BoostingTermQuery(s), the
payloads on the terms are never processed by the SpanScorer. It seems to me
that you would want the SpanScorer to score the document both on the spans
distance and the payload score. So, either the SpanScorer would have to
process the payloads (duplicating the code in BoostingSpanScorer), or
perhaps SpanScorer could access the BoostingSpanScorers, or maybe there's
another approach.

Any thoughts on how to accomplish this?

Peter
