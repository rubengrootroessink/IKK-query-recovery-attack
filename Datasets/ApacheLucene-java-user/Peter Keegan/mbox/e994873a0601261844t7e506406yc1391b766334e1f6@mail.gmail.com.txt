Ray,

The short answer is that you can make Lucene blazingly fast by using advice
and design principles mentioned in this forum and of course reading 'Lucene
in Action'. For example, use a 'content' field for searching all fields (vs
mutli-field search), put all your stored data in one field, understand the
cost of numeric search and sorting. On the platform side, go multi-CPU and
of course 64-bit if possible :)

Also, I would venture to guess that a lot of search bottlenecks have nothing
to do with Lucene, but rather in the infrastructure around it. For example,
how does your client interface to the search engine? My results use a plain
socket interface between client and server (one connection for queries,
another for results), using a simple query/results data format. Introducing
other web infrastructures invites degradation in performance, too.

I've a bit of experience with search engines, but I'm obviously still
learning thanks to this group.
