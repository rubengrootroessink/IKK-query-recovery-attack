SUBJECT: theoretical maximum score
DATE: 9 May 2008

Is it possible to compute a theoretical maximum score for a given query if
constraints are placed on 'tf' and 'lengthNorm'? If so, scores could be
compared to a 'perfect score' (a feature request from our customers)

Here are some related threads on this:

It seems that if 'tf' is limited to a max value and 'lengthNorm' is a
constant, it might be possible, at least for 'simple' term queries. But Hoss
says that things get messing with complicated queries.

Could someone elaborate a bit? Does the index contain enough info to do this
efficiently?
I realize that scores values must be interpreted 'carefully', but I'm seeing
a push to get more leverage from the absolute values, not just the relative
values.
