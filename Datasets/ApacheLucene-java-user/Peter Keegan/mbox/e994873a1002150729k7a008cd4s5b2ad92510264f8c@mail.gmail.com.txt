SUBJECT: PayloadNearSpanScorer explain method
DATE: 15 Feb 2010

The 'explain' method in PayloadNearSpanScorer assumes the
AveragePayloadFunction was used. I don't see an easy way to override this
because 'payloadsSeen' and 'payloadScore' are private/protected. It seems
like the 'PayloadFunction' interface should have an 'explain' method that
the Scorer could call. Any thoughts?
