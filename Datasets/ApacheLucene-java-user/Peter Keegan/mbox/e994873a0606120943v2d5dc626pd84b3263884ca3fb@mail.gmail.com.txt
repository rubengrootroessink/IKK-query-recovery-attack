I'm seeing query throughput of approx. 290 qps with OpenBitSet vs. 270 with
BitSet. I had to reduce the max. HashDocSet size to 2K - 3K (from 10K-20K)
to get optimal tradeoff.

no. docs in index: 730,000
average no. results returned: 40
average response time: 50 msec (15-20 for counting facets)
no. facets: 100 on every query

I'm not using the Solr server as we have already developed an
infrastructure.
