SUBJECT: term counts during indexing
DATE: 30 Oct 2003

Is there a simple and efficient way of determining the number of tokens
added
to a document after adding each field ('Document.add), as a result of the
actions
of the Analyzer, without having to re-parse the field?

Alternatively, is there a way to determine the number of tokens added after
adding the document to the index ('IndexWriter.addDocument')?
