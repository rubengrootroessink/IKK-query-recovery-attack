SUBJECT: Combining TopFieldCollector with custom Collector
DATE: 11 Mar 2010

Is it possible to issue a single search that combines a TopFieldCollector
(MultiComparatorScoringMaxScoreCollector) with a custom Collector? The
custom Collector just collects the doc IDs into a BitSet (or DocIdSet). The
collect() methods of the various TopFieldCollectors cannot be overridden.

Thanks,
Peter
