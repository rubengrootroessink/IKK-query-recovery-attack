SUBJECT: Re: Sorting by Score
DATE: 27 Feb 2007

I'm building up the Sort object for the search with 2 SortFields - first is
for the custom rounded scoring, second is for date. This Sort object is used
to construct a FieldSortedHitQueue which is used with a custom HitCollector.
And yes, this comparator ignores the field name.

The constructor doesn't complain, but FieldSortedHitQueue expects a field
name when it tries to locate the comparator from the cache:

    at org.apache.lucene.search.FieldCacheImpl$Entry.<init>(
FieldCacheImpl.java:60)
    at org.apache.lucene.search.FieldSortedHitQueue.lookup(
FieldSortedHitQueue.java:157)
    at org.apache.lucene.search.FieldSortedHitQueue.getCachedComparator(
FieldSortedHitQueue.java:185)
    at org.apache.lucene.search.FieldSortedHitQueue.<init>(
FieldSortedHitQueue.java:58)
