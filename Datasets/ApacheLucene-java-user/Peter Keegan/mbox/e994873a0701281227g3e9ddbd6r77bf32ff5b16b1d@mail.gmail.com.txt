Correction:
We only do the euclidan computation during sorting. For filtering, a simple
bounding box is computed to approximate the radius, and 2 range comparisons
are made to exclude documents. Because these comparisons are done outside of
Lucene as integer comparisons, it is pretty fast. With 13000 results, the
seach time with distance sort is about 200 msec (compared to 30 ms for a
simple non-radius, date-sorted keyword search).
