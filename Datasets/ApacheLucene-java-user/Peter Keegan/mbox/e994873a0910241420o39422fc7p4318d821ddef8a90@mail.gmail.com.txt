SUBJECT: IO exception during merge/optimize
DATE: 24 Oct 2009

I'm sometimes seeing the following exception from an operation that does a
merge and optimize:
 java.io.IOException: background merge hit exception: _0:C1082866 _1:C79
into _2 [optimize] [mergeDocStores]
I'm pretty sure that it's caused by a temporary low disk space condition,
but I'd like to be able to confirm this. It would be nice to have the java
exception included in the Lucene exception. Any way to get this?

Peter
