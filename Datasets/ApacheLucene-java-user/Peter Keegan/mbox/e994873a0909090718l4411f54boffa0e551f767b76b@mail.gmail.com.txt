It's no more expensive than 'next'. The scorer's 'skipTo' and 'next' methods
call  termdocs.skipTo or termdocs.next to get the next 'candidate' doc. This
just checks a BitVector to find the next non-deleted doc. But the scorer
must visit some metadata (RAM resident) for each candidate doc, which is the
most expensive part. So, reducing the number of calls to the scorer's 'next'
and 'skipTo' methods is always a win.  Since the custom scorer is the
bottleneck with both versions of Lucene (according to JProfiler), the
improvements here are going weigh much more.
