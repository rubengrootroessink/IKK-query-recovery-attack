SUBJECT: Payloads and PhraseQuery
DATE: 27 Jun 2007

I'm looking at the new Payload api and would like to use it in the following
manner. Meta-data is indexed as a special phrase (all terms at same
position) and a payload is stored with the first term of each phrase. I
would like to create a custom query class that extends PhraseQuery and uses
its PhraseScorer to find matching documents. The custom query class then
reads the payload from the first term of the matching query and uses it to
produce a new score. However, I don't see how to get the payload from the
PhraseScorer's TermPositions. Is this possible?
