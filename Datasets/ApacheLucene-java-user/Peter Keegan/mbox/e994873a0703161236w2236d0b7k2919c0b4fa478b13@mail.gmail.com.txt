Dan,

The filtering is done in the HitCollector by the bounding box, so the only
hits that get collected are those that match the keywords, the bounding box,
and some Lucene filters (BitSets) (I'm probably overloading the word
'filter' a bit). So, the only hits from the collector that need to be sorted
are those that are roughly within the search radius. When the search radius
gets larger, a new bounding box is computed for that query. Make sense?
