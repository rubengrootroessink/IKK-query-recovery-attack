I am doing a performance comparison of Lucene on Linux vs Windows.

I have 2 identically configured servers (8-CPUs (real) x 3GHz Xeon
processors, 64GB RAM). One is running CentOS 4 Linux, the other is running
Windows server 2003 Enterprise Edition x64. Both have 64-bit JVMs from Sun.
The Lucene server is using MMapDirectory. I'm running the jvm with
-Xmx16000M. Peak memory usage of the jvm on Linux is about 6GB and 7.8GB on
windows.

I'm observing query rates of 330 queries/sec on the Wintel server, but only
200 qps on the Linux box. At first, I suspected a network bottleneck, but
when I 'short-circuited' Lucene, the query rates were identical.

I suspect that there are some things to be tuned in Linux, but I'm not sure
what. Any advice would be appreciated.

Peter
