SUBJECT: Re: Scoring results?!
DATE: 30 Aug 2007

If I use BoostingTermQuery on a query containing terms without payloads, I
get very different results than doing the same query with TermQuery.
Presumably, this is because the BoostingSpanScorer/SpanScorer compute scores
differently than TermScorer. Is there a way to make BoostingTermQuery behave
like TermQuery for terms without payloads?
