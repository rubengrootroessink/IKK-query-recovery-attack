SUBJECT: Use of AllTermDocs with custom scorer
DATE: 16 Nov 2009

I have a custom query object whose scorer uses the 'AllTermDocs' to get all
non-deleted documents. AllTermDocs returns the docId relative to the
segment, but I need the absolute (index-wide) docId to access external data.
What's the best way to get the unique, non-deleted docId?

Thanks,
Peter
