Oops. I meant to say: Does this mean that an IndexSearcher constructed from
a MultiReader doesn't merge the search results and sort the results as if
there was only one index?

A quick test indicates that it does merge the results properly, however
there is a difference in the order of documents with equal score. The
MultiSearcher returns the higher doc first, but the IndexSearcher returns
the lowest doc first. I think docs of equal score are supposed to be
returned in the order they were indexed (lower doc id first).
