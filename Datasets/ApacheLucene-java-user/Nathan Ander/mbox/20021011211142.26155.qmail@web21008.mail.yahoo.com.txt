Hi all,

I'm building a web crawler, and would like to use Lucene to extend some of the indexng capabilities.
I am using Jetty, but the documentation only talks about TomCat configuration. Can anyone
help?

As a note, I have already built the crawling application and indexing functionality, but would
simply like to replace some of it with the more sophisticated crawling features in Lucene.

Thanks

aj
