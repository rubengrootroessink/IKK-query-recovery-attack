LARM is a web crawler project in Lucene Sandbox.
Consider using that for your application.
Lucene doesn't require a servlet container, but if you want to present
the search results or expose something else via the Web interface
you'll need something like Jetty, Tomcat, Resin, etc.
Servlet container and Lucene are really independent, and configuring
one doesn't really depend on the other.
