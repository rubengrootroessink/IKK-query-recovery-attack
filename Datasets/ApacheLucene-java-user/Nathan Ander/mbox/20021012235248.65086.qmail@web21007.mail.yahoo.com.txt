Hi,
Thanks for the response. Yes, I agree Jetty is much better. I have an application that reads
unstructured documents and structures the information into a knowledgebase using NLP and AI
heuristics. The primitive crawler I have now is just a script that connects to and reads whatever
URI I point it against. So I want to bring in Lucene to handle the crawling and data acquisition,
while my program deals with the indexing.
The documentation says that lucene needs a server "container", which I assume would be Jetty
in my case, but I can't figure out how to plug the two together.
