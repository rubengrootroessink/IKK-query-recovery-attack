SUBJECT: require that top results includes a certain percentage from each source
DATE: 6 Jul 2010

Hello!

I'm new to using lucene and was hoping to get advice on best practices  
to solve the following problem.

I have a set of documents each coming from their own source.  I want  
to require that the top K docs have a minimum of n relevant docs from  
certain sources.  For example, lets say I need to include 25 results  
from source A in the top 100.  If after the boolean filter there are 0  
results from source A then I do not have to include anything.  But if  
after ranking there are less than 25 in the top 100 results and there  
are 25 (or more) results from source A after the boolean filter then I  
should rearrange the result set so that 25 from source A appear in the  
top 100.


Thanks,
Aaron
