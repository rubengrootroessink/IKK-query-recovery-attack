SUBJECT: No.of Files in Directory
DATE: 30 Jun 2005

Hi All
 
In my webapp i have people uploading their documents. My server is windows/tomcat. I am thinking
there will be a limit on the no of files in a directory. Typically apllication users will
load 3-5 page word docs.
 
1. How does one design the system such that there will not be any problem as the users keep
uploading their files, even if a million files are reached.
2. Is there a sample application that does this.
3. Should I have lucene update index after each upload or should I do it like once a day.
 
Thanks
Bib
