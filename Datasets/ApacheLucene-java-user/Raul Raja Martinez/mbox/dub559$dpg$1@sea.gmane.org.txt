Thanks Chris I'll provably try passing the MultiSearcher instance as a 
parameter so that I can use subDoc and so.
It makes sense though to have a getIndex() method inside hit or document
that returns some information about where that hit or document belongs 
to. Do you think that is reasonable to file a JIRA petition for this, 
I'm new to Lucene and I don't know what are the policies around these 
matters.
