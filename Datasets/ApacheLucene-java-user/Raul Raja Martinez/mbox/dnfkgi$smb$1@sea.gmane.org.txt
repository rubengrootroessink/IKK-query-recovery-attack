SUBJECT: Re: where to store the index
DATE: 10 Dec 2005

first thanks for your response Dan,

It I'll be around 5.000 database records with three indexed fields:
id, title(1 line) and description(around three lines). I was even 
considering using the in memory feature for faster access but I'm new to 
lucene and I'don't know if that I'll cause my problems in the future.

Any help appreciated

best regards.

Raul.
