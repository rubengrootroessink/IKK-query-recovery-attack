SUBJECT: Re: Reindexing
DATE: 8 Feb 2006

Hi Eric, I'm in the same situation, I wouldn't normally ask something 
related to hibernate here but I posted something similar in the 
hibernate forums on Jan 16th but still haven't got any response.

http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=954137&highlight=lucene

It is really obvious that if they offer lucene indexing out of the box 
with the hibernate release, people would have to index all their 
persistent objects that were already in the database before.

Any hint is highly appreciated.
