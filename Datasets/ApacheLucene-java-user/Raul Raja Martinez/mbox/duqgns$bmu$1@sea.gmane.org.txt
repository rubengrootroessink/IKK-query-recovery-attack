DATE: 10 Mar 2006

Hi,

Unfortunately I can't change the way things are indexed, so I guess I 
need some short of utility class that will turn Martínez into 
Mart&iacute;nez and then just search for that term.

I have also this problem using the StandardAnalyzer:

If I search for "c&aacute;diz" in luke the query gets parsed as 
"c&aacute diz" it changes ";" for " ". I would like to know which 
symbols are not to be used in the search and how to scape them.

What would be the right query to find "c&aacute;diz"?

Thanks.

Raul
