SUBJECT: Best practice for searching html
DATE: 9 Mar 2006

Hi I have a lot of html indexed such as:

Mart&iacute;nez

Of course my users are gonna search for Mart√≠nez and they're not gonna 
get a match.

Is there a common approach to solve this kind of problem in lucene, 
Maybe some utility class or something?

Any help is appreciated.

Best regards.

Raul.
