SUBJECT: Re: Search on many indexes at once
DATE: 4 Mar 2006

Thanks I found some info in Lucene in action about Multisearcher and I 
got this working, I just need to know how to get from a resulting hit 
which index the hit belongs to. I have News, Channels, Categories and 
Images as different Indexes and I need to link to one page or another 
based on whether a hit belong to an index or not.

Any ideas?
