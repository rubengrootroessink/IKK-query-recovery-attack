Hi Greg,
Thanks. We are actually running against 4 segments of 4gb so about 20 
million docs. We cant merge the segments as their seems to be problems with 
out linux box , with having files over about 4gb. Not sure why that is.

If I was to upgrade to 8gb of ram does it seem likely this will double the 
amount of docs we can handle, or would this provide an exponential increase?

Thanks

Leon
