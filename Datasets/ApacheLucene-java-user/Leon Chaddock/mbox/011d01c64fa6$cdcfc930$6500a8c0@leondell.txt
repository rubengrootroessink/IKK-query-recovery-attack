Hi Chris,
You said:
" 5 word occurances in a 10 word document would probably score the same as 
those 5 words in a 20 word document"

OK so If I set this option would this mean no of occurences was a major 
factor so that:

A phrase occurs 1 time in a 3 word document would be a lower rank than A 
phrase occurs 5 times in a 30 word document as there are more occurences 
irrespective of the doc size.

Have I understood correctly, I know there are other factors but I am just 
interested in general. It is very important to me to stop two word documents 
with the phrase occuring only once ranking higher than  100 word documents 
with the phrase occuring 10 times.

Many thanks for your help

Leon
