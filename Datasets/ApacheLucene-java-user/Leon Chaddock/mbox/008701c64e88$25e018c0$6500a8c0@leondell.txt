SUBJECT: Changing ranking
DATE: 23 Mar 2006

Hi,
At present lucene seems to rank very short documents over longer documents 
where the phrase occurs more regularily for instance which the search term 
"cat"

"the cat went home"

ranks higher than

"the black cat when home past some other cats, on cat street"

Is there anyway I can change luicene to rank longer documents with more 
phrase occurences higher

Many thanks

Leon
