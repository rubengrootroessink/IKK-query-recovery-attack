SUBJECT: Query rewriting/optimization
DATE: 21 May 2009

Hi,
 I am wondering if Lucene internally rewrites/optimizes Query. I am 
programatically generating Query based on various user options, and 
quite often I have BooleanQueri'es wrapped inside BooleanQueries etc.
Like,
 ((Src:Testing Dst:Test) (Src:Test2 Port:http)).
In this case, would Lucene optimize to remove the unwanted 
BooleanQueries ? Or more importantly, would these extra BooleanQueries 
cause any performance problems and should I fix my code to have a better 
Query ?

Thanks,
 ~preetham
