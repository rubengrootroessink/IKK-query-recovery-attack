SUBJECT: Getting Top n term for a given field for a given time period
DATE: 21 Apr 2009


Hi,
I have a lucene index which has 20 mil documents. Each document has a 
timestamp field and a source field. I am interested in finding the top n 
sources for a given hour (based on the timestamp). I know we can get the 
top n sources fields easily using the IndexReader API, but was wondering 
if I can get that top n for a certain period of time ?

Thx,
~preetham
