SUBJECT: Combining results of multiple indexes
DATE: 17 Dec 2008

Hi,
 I am new to Lucene. I am not using it as a pure text indexer.

 I am trying to index a Java object which has about 10 fields (like id, 
time, srcIp, dstIp) - most of them being numerical values.
 In order to speed up indexing, I figured that having two separate 
indexers, each of them indexing different set of fields works great. So 
I have the first 5 fields in index1 and the remaining in index2.

 Now, I want to have boolean AND query's looking for values in both 
indexes. Like f1=1234 AND f7=ABCD.f1 and f7 and present in two separate 
indexes. Would using the MultiIndexReader help ? Since I am doing an 
AND, I dont expect that it would work.

Thanks,
 ~preetham
