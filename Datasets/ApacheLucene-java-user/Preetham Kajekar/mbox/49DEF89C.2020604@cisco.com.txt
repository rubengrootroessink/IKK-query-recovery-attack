SUBJECT: MultiSearcher query with Sort option
DATE: 10 Apr 2009

Hi,
 I am using a MultiSearcher to search 2 indexes. As part of my query, I 
am sorting the results based on a field (which in NOT_ANALYSED). 
However, i seem to be getting hits only from one of the indexes. If I 
change to Sort.INDEX_ORDER, I seem to be getting results from both. Is 
this a know problem ?

Thanks,
 ~preetham
