I have a java object which has about 10 fields. However, the fields are 
not fixed. The java object is essentially a representation of Syslogs 
from network devices. So different syslogs have different fields. Each 
field has a unique id and a value (mostly numeric types, so i convert it 
to string). There are some fixed fields. So the object is a list of 
fields which is produced by a parser.
I am trying to index using two indexers in two separate threads- one for 
fixed and another for the non-fixed fields. Except for a unique id, I do 
not store the fields in Lucene - i just index them. From the index, i 
get the unique id which is all I care about. (the objects are stored 
elsewhere and can be looked up based on this unique id).
I did try using a single indexer, but things were quite slow. Getting 
high throughput is crucial and having two indexers seemed to do very 
well. (more than twice as fast)

Further, the index will never be modified and I can have just one thread 
writing to the index. If there are any other performance tips would be 
very helpful. I have already looked at the wiki link regarding 
performance and using some of them.

Thanks,
