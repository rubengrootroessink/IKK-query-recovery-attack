SUBJECT: Regex for legal user search input
DATE: 27 Jul 2005

Is there a way to allow users to use + and - and special operators in
free-text searches, but also allow them to search for a last name like
Smith-Jones? (which I'd have to escape?)

Is there a regular expression to determine/fix this kind of user input
so it is queryparser-legal?

Ie they can't just type * or + in the search box.

How are y'all handling this kind of thing?

Derek
