Okay, I figured out how to use JAR, extracted all the files from
lucene-1.4.3.jar, added the MoreLikeThis classes in the appropriate
folder, recreated and replaced the JAR. Since Lucene is my first
exposure to Java I am pretty proud of myself at this point.

The only thing that still wasn't working was the setFieldNames function,
so I just set it to NULL in the .java code, recompiled and recreated the
.jar and now it is working! And doing a good job, too!

Thanks!

Derek

If you put it in the right package directory under WEB-INF/classes then
it should work (provided all the dependencies it has are in WEB-
INF/lib, which may just be the Lucene JAR file).  The package is
org.apache.lucene.search.similar, so it should go in WEB-INF/classes/
org/apache/lucene/search/similar.  I recommend you put this under your
webapps WEB-INF/classes directory, not in a common directory to your
container.

You should use org.apache.lucene.search.similar.MoreLikeThis
