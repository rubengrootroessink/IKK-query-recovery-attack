I changed to RangeFilter and now everything works fine. I havn't noticed any change in performance
so I'm happy. Strange with the constantrangequery though...

that sort sees them as Integers and discards the last four numbers since an integer isn't
large enough. I tried using SortField.STRING instead but then constantrangequery breaks (date:[200501010101
TO 200601010101] returns 0 hits).

Using SortField.STRING should work, both with sorting and range
queries via RangeFilter or ConstantScoreRangeQuery.
