SUBJECT: Get the preceding and following terms
DATE: 19 Oct 2007

Hello,

I'm trying to create a suggestion tool based on Lucene. From a term in 
the index, i'd like to know the terms that often precede and follow this 
term in the indexed documents (NOT according to the alphabetical order).

I know that Lucene stores the term positions but I don't know how to use 
this piece of information.

Thanks,

Fabrice
