SUBJECT: Cannot access hits
DATE: 24 Mar 2004





Greetings.  I have recently had to re-install my web server.  Once
completed, however, I cannot get the Lucene search to work. It worked
before the crash and it works on my laptop.  When conducting searches now,
I get the following message:

org.apache.cocoon.ProcessingException: Cannot access hits:
java.io.IOException: Permission denied

for full message see:

Can anyone suggest a place to start looking to add the correct permissions?

Thank you,

Russell
