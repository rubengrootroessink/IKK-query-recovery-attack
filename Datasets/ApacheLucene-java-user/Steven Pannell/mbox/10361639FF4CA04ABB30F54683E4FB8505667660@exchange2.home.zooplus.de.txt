Hi,

Basically you can update/delete and read an index simultaneously.

When you start to read the index and then update/delete the index, the
current read process will continue reading with the old data before the
delete took place.  A little bit like a transaction on the database.

You don't have to do anything, just use the standard lucene classes.
