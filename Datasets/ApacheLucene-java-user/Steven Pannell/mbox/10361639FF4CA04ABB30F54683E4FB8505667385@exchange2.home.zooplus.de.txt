Hi,

Seems the JDBCDirectory did exist, but sadly the link is no longer working:

http://ppinew.mnis.com/jdbcdirectory/


newsgroup link - 

http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg10689.html

But with the SQLDirectory and the DBDirectory I am sure I can knock
something up now.

Steve.
