SUBJECT: Database File Store (SQLDirectory?)
DATE: 26 Oct 2005

Hi,

I'm looking to try and store my index into an oracle database.  Has anyone
done this before?  I did find something in the archive referring to the
SQLDirectory.java file by Marc Kramis. But there does not seem to be any
download or further references to this implementation.  Does anyone have it?
or are there perhaps any other implementations to get me started?

thx.
Steve.
