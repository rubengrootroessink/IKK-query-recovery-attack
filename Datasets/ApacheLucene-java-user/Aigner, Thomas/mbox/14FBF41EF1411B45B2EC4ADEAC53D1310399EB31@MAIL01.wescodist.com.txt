DATE: 11 Aug 2005

Please forgive my jumping on this thread, but I have a similar issue.  I
have a server process on Linux that creates the java process (java
-Xms256m -Xmx512m -jar Suchmaschine.jar).  The problem is that after the
processing is done, the memory is retained.  Is there a collection
argument that would shrink the java memory pool back down to the min?

Thanks,
Tom

And if you look at the size of your JVM, does it really use all 512 MB?
If it does not, maybe you can try this:

  java -Xms256m -Xmx512m -jar Suchmaschine.jar

If that doesn't help, it would be good to run this under a profiler and
see what eats your memory.

P.S.
I recall reading that using the same amount for Xms and Xmx results in
better performance.  Also, consider using -server option (Hotspot), if
you are using Sun's JVM.
