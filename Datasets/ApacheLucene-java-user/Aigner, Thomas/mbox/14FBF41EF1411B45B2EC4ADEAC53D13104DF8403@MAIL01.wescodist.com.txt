Hi all,
	Is anyone experiencing possible memory problems on LINUX with
Lucene search?  Here is our scenario, we have a service that lives on
LINUX that takes all incoming request through a port and does the
search.  Only 1 IndexSearcher is instantiated to do this from our
service.  When I run a ps and grep for java it shows only 1 java process
running.. however, when 4 users log into our program and start to search
at the same time, 4 java processes show up on TOP (and I can't see their
parent PID from the top command), but still only 1 java on ps.  
	My company fears that each process is being allocated 128M
memory and is running the box out of memory (when the service is started
we allocated 10 - 128M from the java call).  I am still in the process
of testing with our system guys and having the data analyzed with a 3rd
party, but was curious as to your findings..

Thanks ahead of time,
Tom
