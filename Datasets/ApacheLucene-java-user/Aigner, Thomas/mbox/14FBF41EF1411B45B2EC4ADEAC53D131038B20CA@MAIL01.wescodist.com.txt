Hi all,
	I have a Punctuation Filter that filters out certain criteria
(ex. - and /).  This filter is called whenever I search for normal
items.. Search 56-TXT 
The filter does not seem to be called when I search for 56-TXT* even
though I use my extended analyzer which has the filter in it so the
items are not found due to the token being 56TXT due to the filter.

Any ideas?

Thanks all,
Tom
