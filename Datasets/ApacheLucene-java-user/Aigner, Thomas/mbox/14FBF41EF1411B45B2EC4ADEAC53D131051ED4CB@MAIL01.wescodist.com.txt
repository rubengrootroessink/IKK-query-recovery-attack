Subject: 1.9 lucene version


Hello all,
	I have a couple of questions for the community about the 1.9
Lucene version.  As I understand it, this has not been released and I
can't find an approximate date for release (I know you can download the
development version and compile it).  I see a nightly build going on
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html), but I can't seem to
find a release date.

	So,
		1) Anyone know a release date for 1.9?
		2) Also, if this is not a soon time, is anyone actually
using 1.9 in production?
		3) General question on improvement: memory - has there
been any memory improvements as well in 1.9

Thanks all!
Tom
