Daniel,
Thanks for the response.  I sure hope there is an easy way around this..

1) How can you get the wildcard (* at beginning or the end) to use a
specialized filter? (i.e. Punctuation filter, or synonym filter, Or
stemmer?) 

Thanks all,
Tom

The specified analyzer if not used for wildcard, fuzzy, and prefix
queries.
