Thanks Grant and Erik for your suggestions.  I will try both of them and
let you know if I see a marked increase in speed.

Have you done any profiling to identify hotspots in Lucene versus  
your application?

You might look into the FieldSelector code (used in IndexReader) in  
the Trunk version of Lucene could be used to only load the fields you  
are interested when getting the document from disk.  This can be  
useful if you have large fields that are being loaded that you don't  
necessarily need (thus skipping them).

Also, do you need the BufferedWriter construction and check in side  
the loop?  Probably small in comparison to loading, but  It seems  
like it is only created once, why have it in the loop?
