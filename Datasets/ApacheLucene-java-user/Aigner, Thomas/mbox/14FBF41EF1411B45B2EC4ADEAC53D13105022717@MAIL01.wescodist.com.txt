SUBJECT: Number Searches vs Character
DATE: 30 Jan 2006


I am curious what would be the difference between searching for a number
verses a character.

I have a large index consisting of a few fields (So index would look
something like:  " 123123123 my description my catalog"
	
Searching for 12* is much slower than searching for de*
I don't have any issues searching for 3 or more characters.. just 1 or 2
and the wildcard.
	Stored this way: doc.add(Field.Text("allindex", all,true));
	Using 1.4.3

Any reason why that would be and how I can help speed that up?
