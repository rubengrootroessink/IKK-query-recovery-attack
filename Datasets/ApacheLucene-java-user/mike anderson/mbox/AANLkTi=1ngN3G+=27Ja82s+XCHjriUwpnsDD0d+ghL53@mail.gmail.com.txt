SUBJECT: Re: [POLL] Where do you get Lucene/Solr from? Maven? ASF Mirrors?
DATE: 21 Jan 2011

[x] ASF Mirrors (linked in our release announcements or via the Lucene

[] Maven repository (whether you use Maven, Ant+Ivy, Buildr, etc.)

[x] I/we build them from source via an SVN/Git checkout.

[] Other (someone in your company mirrors them internally or via a
downstream project)
