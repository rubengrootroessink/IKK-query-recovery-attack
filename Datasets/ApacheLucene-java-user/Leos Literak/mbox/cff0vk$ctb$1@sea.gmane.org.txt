SUBJECT: boost keywords
DATE: 12 Aug 2004

Hi,

I use lucene at my webzine to index articles
and other materials. I want to add new feature
to articles - keywords (author of the article
will specify them). Then I'd like to configure
lucene to use these keywords in search. But how
to achieve that? I have no clue ...

Thanks for hints

Leos

(It would be useful if there were lucene "patterns"
page. E.g. if you wish to do A, then use B practice)
