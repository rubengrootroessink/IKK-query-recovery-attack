SUBJECT: how to forbid prefetching found Documents?
DATE: 7 Jan 2006

Hello,

I found in Lucenebook, that searching always reads
first first 100 documents. I take a look to java
source code and found that in Hits.java. I cannot
find any easy way, how to forbid this behaviour.

motivation: my page size is 30. It is useless to
read 100 documents, when I will display only small
portion of it. And imagine, that user is on fourth
page - reading first 100 document is waste of time.

Thanks for your idea

Leos
