SUBJECT: no results for date field
DATE: 6 Jul 2005

Hi,

I've added to index date field:

     public Field setCreated(Date date) {
         Field field = Field.Keyword(CREATED, date);
         document.add(field);
         return field;
     }

Now I try to search according to documentation:

created:[20040101 TO 20050707]

But there is no hit. Using luke I realized, that
this field has such most frequent values:

0d0xug8go
0cl92izmg

etc.

What am I doing wrong? Is syntax for date range queries
locale specific? I have not found an answear from documentation
or google search.

Thanks

Leos
