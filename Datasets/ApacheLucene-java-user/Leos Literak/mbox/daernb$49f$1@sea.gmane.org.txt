SUBJECT: highlighter to use with 1.4.3?
DATE: 5 Jul 2005

Hi,

I'd like to play around with highlighter.
I downloaded one from sandbox, but it doesn't
compile against lucene stable 1.4.3.

highlight/TokenSources.java:19: cannot find symbol
     [javac] symbol  : class TermVectorOffsetInfo

Is there some package that can be used with lucene 1.4.3
distribution? If not, please think of us poor users,
that don't live on cutting edge and all that they need
is some ZIP or TAR to download :-)

Leos
