Thanks Erick ,

   i understand the issue , but my doubt is when you search for a keyword
which is originally a single word, for example , metacity is really single
keyword . when i search for meta city am not able to get the results , this
is what my doubt , 

 if you goto google and search for meta city , it'll give you the results
for metacity , how do i solve this issue ? is there any concepts behind
indexing ?? please anyone let me know
