SUBJECT: reading index
DATE: 7 Aug 2009


hello all,

              thanks to lucene. Am using lucene 2.4.0 for my application. My
doubt is , can i read the index for many number of times? i mean , i've a
search application which reads the index , which is 300MB in size, am
reading my index at every time the user hits the page . Is it good to read
index at every time? or else is there any caching technique to handle  this?
