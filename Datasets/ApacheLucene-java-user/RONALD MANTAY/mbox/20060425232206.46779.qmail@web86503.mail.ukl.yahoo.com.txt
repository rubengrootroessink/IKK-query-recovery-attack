SUBJECT: performance differences between 1.4.3 and 1.9.1
DATE: 25 Apr 2006

Hi chaps ,
   
  I ran the same search code with lucene-1.4.3.jar and then with lucene-core-1.9.1.jar
   
  The good news is there appeared to be a performance improvement with 1.9.1 both with single
index searching both exact and fuzzy mode, 
   
  However when searching muliple indexes with multiSearcher and with a FuzzyQuery with a prefixLength
of 1. The search against 3.7m documents spread over 23 indexes (due to the natural grouping
of the data) the time changed from 800ms to 4500 ms.
   
  Has any one else had similar observations ? any Ideas on how to address it ?
   
  Regards
