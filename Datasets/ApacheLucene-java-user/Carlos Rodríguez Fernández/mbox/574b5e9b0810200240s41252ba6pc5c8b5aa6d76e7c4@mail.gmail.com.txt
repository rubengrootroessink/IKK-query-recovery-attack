How can I get the boost value of the subqueries "TermQuery" from a
BooleanQuery?
In the Similarity ecuation
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_1_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html
I don't know how I can get the t.getBoost() value.

Could you help me?

I need it because I need to recalculate the scores of the documents which
were got from differents crawls. MultiReader is not the solution for me :).

Thanks!
Carlos
