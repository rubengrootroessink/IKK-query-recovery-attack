Hi Mike,

Yes you are right, when we run the optimize(), it creates one large 
segment file and makes the searching faster. But  the issue is our index 
keeps growing every minute as we download documents add to the index, so 
we cannot call optimize so often. The indexing seemed to be fine till we 
migrated to lucene 1.9.1.

I just compared the IndexWriter classes in 1.4.3 and 1.9.1 versions and 
found that there are some changes wrt to creating new segments. Any idea 
if that has impacted indexing? Has anyone else faced a similar issue 
with the new version of lucene?
