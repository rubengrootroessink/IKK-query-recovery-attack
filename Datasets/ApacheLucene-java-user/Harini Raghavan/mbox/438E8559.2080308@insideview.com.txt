SUBJECT: Re: how to control terms to be highlighted?
DATE: 1 Dec 2005

Hi Mark,

It would be great if you can make this change and send the
QueryTermsExtractor class. I am invoking the QueryScorer(Query)
contructor. Should I use QueryScorer(Query query, IndexReader reader,
String fieldName) instead for this to work?

Thanks,
Harini
