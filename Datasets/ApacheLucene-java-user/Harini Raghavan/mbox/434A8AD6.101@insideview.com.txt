SUBJECT: Lucene search is very slow
DATE: 10 Oct 2005

Hi,
I am using lucene for search functionality in my j2ee application using 
JBoss as app server. The lucene index directory size is almsot 10G. The 
performance has been quite good until now. But after the last deploy, 
when the server was restarted , the lucene search has become very slow. 
It takes almost 3-4 mins for simple searches on the index. There has 
been no changes to the application in the new build.
Does anyone have an idea what could be wrong?
Thanks,
Harini
