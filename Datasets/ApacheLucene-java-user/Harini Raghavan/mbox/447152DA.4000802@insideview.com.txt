SUBJECT: indexing in lucene 1.9.1
DATE: 22 May 2006

Hi All,
We have recently upgraded from lucene 1.4.3 to lucene 1.9.1 version. 
After the upgrade, we are facing some issues:
1. Indexing seems to be behaving differently. There were more than 300 
segment files(.cfs) in the index and the IndexSearcher is taking forever 
to refresh the index. Have there been any changes in 1.9.1 wrt default 
values for merging segment files/ indexing?
2. Our application downloads documents and indexes them every min as a 
continuous process. So, we have a Quartz job that refreshes the Index 
Searcher every 4 hours. Would this have any effect on the indexing 
process/ add more no of segments?
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Harini
