SUBJECT: OutOfMemory errors while indexing large documents
DATE: 25 Jul 2005

Hi All,
I am using lucene to index large documents(HTML pages). The application is 
running on JBoss and MySQL on UNIX. The indexing is throwing OutOfMemory 
errors beyond a certain point. I am not sure why this is happening. I am 
using the default IndexWriter properties, but the lucene documentation 
mentions about setting the max field length on the IndexWriter to some 
optimum value for large documents. Is anyone aware of any optimum settings 
for maxFieldLength, mergeFactor, minMergeDoc and maxMergeDoc?
Thanks,
Harini
