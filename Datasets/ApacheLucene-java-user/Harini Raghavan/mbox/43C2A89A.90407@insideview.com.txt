SUBJECT: highlighting phrases
DATE: 9 Jan 2006

Hi All,

I am using the highlighter package to highlight my search results. The 
query I am passing to the Highlighter is:
+(Content:"Apple Computer" Content:"Apple Comp") +(Title:"Apple 
Computer" Title:"Apple Comp")
But the Highlighter is highlighting even occurances of terms 
'Computer'/'Comp'. Anyone knows how to make sure
that only phrases are highlighted, not just the individual terms?

Thanks,
Harini
