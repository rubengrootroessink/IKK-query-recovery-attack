SUBJECT: Re: Query Scoring
DATE: 2 Jan 2006

Yes I was refering to how IDF is used in the Highlighter code to find 
out how to prioritize fragments of the documents.

My requirement is to show the relevant fragments of the news article for 
each company along with the search results. But the highlighter api 
sometimes picks up the fragments which are not so relevant to the news 
article/company. I would like to know if there is anyway that I can 
modify the scoring/ranking of these fragments in such a way that the 
news items in which a company name & keywords in the headline gets 
assigned a very strong relevancy ranking,  closely followed by a company 
name mention in the first paragraph and a  multiple-mention within the 
entire story. Something like headline =   5 points,  first paragraph = 
four, etc.

Thanks,
Harini
