SUBJECT: Delete document with keyword field
DATE: 11 Mar 2007

Hi All,

I have a lucene index with many fields, one of which is a Keyword field IS.
The values stored in this field are the document ids like _839930494,
_839930492.
But I am unable to delete  the documents using this id. Is this something to
do with the underscore? Can someone suggest how I should delete these
documents?

Thanks,
Harini
