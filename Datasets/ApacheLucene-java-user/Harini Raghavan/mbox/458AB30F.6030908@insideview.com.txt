SUBJECT: Merge Index Filling up Disk Space
DATE: 21 Dec 2006

Hi All,

I am using lucene 1.9.1 for search functionality in my j2ee application 
using JBoss as app server. The lucene index directory size is almost 20G 
right now. There is a Quartz job that is adding data to the index evey 
min and around 20000 documents get added to the index every day.When the 
documents are added and the segments are merged, the index size 
increases and sometimes grows to more than double its original size. 
This results in filling up the disk space. We have allotted a f/s size 
of 50G and even that is not sufficient at times. Is there an optimum 
vales for the f/s size to be allotted in such scenario.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
 
Thanks,
Harini
