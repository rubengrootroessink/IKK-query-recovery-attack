SUBJECT: Re: Lucene 2.2 + Not Merging Segments
DATE: 24 Jul 2007

I figured out the problem. The issue had nothing to do with Lucene 2.2. I
had accidentally reset the default mergeFactor to 1000. This was the reason
it was not merging the segments. With the default mergeFactor, the indexing
is working perfectly fine.

Thanks,
Harini
