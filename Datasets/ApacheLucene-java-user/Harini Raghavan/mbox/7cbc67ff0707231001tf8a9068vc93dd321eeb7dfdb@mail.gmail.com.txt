SUBJECT: Lucene 2.2 + Not Merging Segments
DATE: 23 Jul 2007

Hi All,

I just upgraded my application to use lucene 2.2. Prior to this, I was using
lucene 1.9.1 and the addDocument method in the IndexWriter used to keep
merging smaller segments while adding new documents depending on the
mergeFactor. I was using the default mergeFactor settings. But after the
upgrade, when I add documents, every time it is creating a new segment and
not merging the older ones. Within 2 hours of running, it had created over
1000 segments. I verified the IndexWriter in the new source and it seemed to
me that there is no change to the default values.

Has anything else changed that would affect the
IndexWriter.addDocumentbehaviour? Can someone shed some light on this.

Thanks,
Harini
