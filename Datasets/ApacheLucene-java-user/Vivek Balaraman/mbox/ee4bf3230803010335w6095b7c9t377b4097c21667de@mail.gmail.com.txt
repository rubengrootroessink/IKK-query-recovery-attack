DATE: 1 Mar 2008

We've been working on Sentiment Analysis. We use GATE and Wordnet for the
lexical / semantic analysis and J Free Charts for the visualization. The
domain is reviews on retail banking and in general our accuracy is around
75% and recall around 25%

We tried out lingpipe as well which also gave good results.
