DATE: 16 Oct 2008

hi dears

i have a question of Lucene

i have on index with 1,000 document with id field(String:UUID) and one
indexSearcher for search on it,
after that, i start one IndexWriter that writes 1,000,000 new document in to
index,
now if i do not update IndexSearcher, can i search on first 1,000 document
without problem??

thanks and sorry for bad English
Mahdi
