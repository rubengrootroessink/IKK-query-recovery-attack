SUBJECT: Re: ShingleFilter failing with more terms than index phrase
DATE: 14 Jul 2010

Hi Steve,

Thanks for your kind response. I checked PositionfilterFactory
(re-index as well) but that also didn't solve the problem. Interesting
the problem is not reproduceable from Solr's Field Analysis page, it
manifests only when it's in a query.

I guess the subject for this post is not very correct, it's not that
ShingleFilter is failing but -- using ShingleFilter, there is no score
provided by the shingle field when I pass more terms than the indexed
terms. I observe this using debugQuery.

I had actually posted to solr-user but received no response yet.
Probably because the problem is not clear at first glance. However,
there's an example I have put in the mail for someone interested to
try out and check if there's a problem. Let's see if I receive any
response.

-Ethan
