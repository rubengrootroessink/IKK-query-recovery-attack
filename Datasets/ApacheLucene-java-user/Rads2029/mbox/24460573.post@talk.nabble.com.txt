SUBJECT: Re: Modifying score based on tf and slop
DATE: 13 Jul 2009


Hi all,

I modified the setFreqCurrentDoc method of SpanScorer  as follows: 
( Frequency is updated only for the shortest span )

 int minMatchLenght=-1;
	    do {
	      int matchLength = spans.end() - spans.start();
	      if(minMatchLenght==-1)minMatchLenght=matchLength;
	      else if(minMatchLenght>matchLength)minMatchLenght=matchLength;
	      more = spans.next();
	    } while (more && (doc == spans.doc()));
	    freq = getSimilarity().sloppyFreq(minMatchLenght);

Now, if a term occurs more than once in my search field, my score is not
boosted up- This is what I want. 
However , just for overriding this one method, I had to create the following
new classes

1)CustomSpanScorer extending Scorer ( setFreqCurrentDoc  is overriden)
2)CustomSpanWeight extends SpanWeight ( scorer is overriden to use
CustomSpanScorer )
3)CustomSpanQuery extends SpanQuery( createWeight is overriden to use
createWeight)
4) CustomSpanNearQuery extends CustomSpanQuery ( All methods are repeated)
5)CustomNearSpansOrdered  - No change from  NearSpansOrdered 
6)CustomNearSpansUnOrdered  - No change from  NearSpansUnOrdered

Please let me know if this is the correct way to go about this
