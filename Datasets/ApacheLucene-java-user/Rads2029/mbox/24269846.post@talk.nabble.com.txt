SUBJECT: Re: Modifying score based on tf and slop
DATE: 30 Jun 2009


Restarting this thread. 
I did try out the soln mentioned by Simon below, however that did not work.
As changing the tf implementation to return 1, adversely affected by span
scoring . ie, the slop distance does not affect score if i make tf as 1. 

I had found a work around in some other way, but that has a hole. I really
have no way other than to find a solution for this. :(

To summarize, how to make sure tf does not affect the scoring but the span
should still affect the scoring?
