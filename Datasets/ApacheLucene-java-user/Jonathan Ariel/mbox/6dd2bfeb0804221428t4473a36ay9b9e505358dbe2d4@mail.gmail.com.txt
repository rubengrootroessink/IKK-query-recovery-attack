SUBJECT: MoreLikeThis over a subset of documents
DATE: 22 Apr 2008

Is there any way to execute a MoreLikeThis over a subset of documents? I
need to retrieve a set of interesting keywords from a subset of documents
and not the entire index (imagine that my index has documents categorized as
A, B and C and I just want to work with those categorized as A). Right now
it is using docFreq from the IndexReader. So I looked into the
FilterIndexReader to see if I can override the docFreq behavior, but I'm not
sure if it's possible.

What do you think?

Jonathan
