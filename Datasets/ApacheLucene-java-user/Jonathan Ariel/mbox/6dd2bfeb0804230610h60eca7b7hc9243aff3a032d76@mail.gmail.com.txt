SUBJECT: Re: MoreLikeThis over a subset of documents
DATE: 23 Apr 2008

Yes, it will be too much to do in real time, but it is a good idea tough.

I don't know if a vector of term frequencies is stored with the document.
Because I could search on the index to get the subset of documents and then
take the term frequencies from there.
In that case I could change MoreLikeThis to receive a set of term
frequencies, instead of an IndexReader, and use that to do all the process.

Anyone knows if a document contains for his fields the term frequencies?
