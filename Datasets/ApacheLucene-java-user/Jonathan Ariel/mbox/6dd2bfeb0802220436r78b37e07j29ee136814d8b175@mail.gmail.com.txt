SUBJECT: MoreLikeThis jar doesn't contain classes
DATE: 22 Feb 2008

Hi,
I've downloaded Lucene 2.3.0 binaries and in the contrib folder I can see
the Similarity package, but inside the Jar there are no classes!
Downloading the sources I ran into the same issue.

Am I doing something wrong? Where should I get the MoreLikeThis classes
from?

Thanks!

Jonathan
