SUBJECT: MoreLikeThis patch to support boost factor
DATE: 23 Apr 2008

This is a patch I made to be able to boost the terms with a specific factor
beside the relevancy returned by MoreLikeThis. This is helpful when having
more then 1 MoreLikeThis in the query, so words in the field A (i.e. Title)
can be boosted more than words in the field B (i.e. Description).

Any feedback?

Jonathan
