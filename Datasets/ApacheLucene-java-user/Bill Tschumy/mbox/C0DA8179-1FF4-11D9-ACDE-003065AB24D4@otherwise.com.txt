Ahem...  right...  My next version will do a better job with PDF and 
RTF files.  I've looked at pdfBox, but the jar file is so big that I 
hate to burden my users by incorporating it.  Any chance of getting a 
smaller version that just does the text extraction?  Your jar file is 
more than twice the size of my entire application including 
documentation.  I really would like to solve this problem.
