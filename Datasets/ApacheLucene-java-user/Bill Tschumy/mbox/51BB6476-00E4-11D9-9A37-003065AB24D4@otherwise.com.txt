SUBJECT: Use of "+" and "-" in queries
DATE: 7 Sep 2004

I don't understand the difference in using + and - in queries compared 
to using AND and NOT.  Even the Query Syntax document seems a bit 
confused.  In the section on the NOT operator it says:

 > To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" but not 
"jakarta lucene" use the query:
 >
 >
