Tom,

I've recently released Parsnips for Mac, Windows and Linux.  It is a  
drag and drop app for storing and indexing bits of text and other file  
types.  It uses Lucene underneath.  I'm thinking about extending it in  
the direction that Google Desktop is going and automatically index  
certain file types and directories in your system.

For more info about Parsnips see:
