SUBJECT: Misbehaving query string
DATE: 19 Jul 2004

I would think the following strings passed to the QueryParser should 
yield the same results:

#1:   +telescope AND !operate

#2:   (+telescope) AND (!operate)

However the first string seems to give the correct results while the 
second gives "zero" hits.  Am I misunderstanding something or is there 
a bug?
