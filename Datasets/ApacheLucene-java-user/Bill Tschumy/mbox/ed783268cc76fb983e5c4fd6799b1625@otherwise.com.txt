Daniel,

Thanks for responding on this thread.  I doubt the copy was made while 
the index was being updated and I don't see any indication of a crash.

Just for my clarification, if I update the index, but don't close the 
IndexWriter (because I may need it again soon), can the index on disk 
be left in an inconsistent state?  Do I need to close the IndexWriter 
to assure the index is OK in disk?

It is imperative I figure out what is going on.  I can't take the risk 
of my customer's data becoming corrupted due to my error.

Bill
