DATE: 3 Feb 2005

No one has yet mentioned using ParserDelegator and ParserCallback that 
are part of HTMLEditorKit in Swing.  I have been successfully using 
these classes to parse out the text of an HTML file.  You just need to 
extend HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback and override the various methods 
that are called when different tags are encountered.
