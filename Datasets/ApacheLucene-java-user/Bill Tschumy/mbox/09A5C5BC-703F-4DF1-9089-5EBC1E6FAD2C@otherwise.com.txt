SUBJECT: Segments file format
DATE: 27 Oct 2005

I have been trying to reconstitute a corrupted index.  I have been  
looking at the segments file with a hex-editor and its format doesn't  
seem to quite agree with the description found at:
<http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/fileformats.html>

It indicates the segments file looks like this:
Segments --> Format, Version, SegCount, <SegName, SegSize>SegCount

However, the couple I have looked at all have an additional  
undocumented UInt32 (probably) field after the Version field.  What  
is this and why is it not in the documentation?

Here is the hex from a small segment file to show you.  The 00 00 00  
4E at the end of the first line seems like it should not be there.   
Am I mis-reading something?

FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 28 00 00 00 4E
00 00 00 04 02 5F 6A 00 00 00 0A 03 5F 31 33 00
00 00 0A 03 5F 31 6E 00 00 00 0A 03 5F 32 35 00
00 00 09
