SUBJECT: Penalty for storing unrelated field?
DATE: 28 Jan 2005

I have an index containing a lot of documents with common fields.  Is 
there any speed/space penalty for adding an unrelated document with a 
totally unrelated field?  I want to store a version number and maybe a 
few other bits of meta-info in the index.  I just want to make sure 
that adding the unrelated field to a single doc won't cause all the 
other documents to increase their storage space.  I would guess not but 
thought I'd better ask.
