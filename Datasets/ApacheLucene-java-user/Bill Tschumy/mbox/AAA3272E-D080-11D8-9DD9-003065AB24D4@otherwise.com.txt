SUBJECT: Deleting a Doc found via a Query
DATE: 8 Jul 2004

I must be missing something here, but I can't see an easy way to delete 
a Document that has been found via searching.  The delete() method of 
IndexReader takes a docNum.  How do I get the docNum corresponding to 
the Document in the Hits?

I tried scanning through all the Documents using IndexReader's 
document(i) method, testing for equality (==) with my queried Document, 
but it wasn't found.  I assume this is because the Documents returned 
in Hits are copies of the Documents the document() method returns.
