I need to analyze these values since I also want the benefits
porterStemmer.  The problem with using PhraseQuery is that I don't
always know the slop.  I may have values like "value4 ddd aaa".  It's a
tricky problem because I think Lucene sees all these values as one long
value for the field "option".

Or else just make sure that you use PhraseQuery to hit this field when
you
want "value1 aaa".  If you don't tokenize these pairs, then you will
have to

do prefix/wildcard matching to hit just "value1" by itself (if this is
allowed
by your business logic).
