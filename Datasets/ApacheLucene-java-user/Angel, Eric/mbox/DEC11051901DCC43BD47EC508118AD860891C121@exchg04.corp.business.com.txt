Hi Eric,

  Different Query classes have different options on whether they can
score
docs out of order, or if they always proceed in order, so the way to
make
sure
you're choosing the right value, if you don't know which you need, is to
ask
your Query (or more appropriately, it's Weight):

   Query query = myBuildQueryMethod();
   IndexSearcher searcher = myBuildSearcherMethod();
   Weight weight = query.weight(searcher);
   boolean allowOutOfOrder = weight.scoresDocsOutOfOrder();

   TopScoreDocCollector coll = TopScoreDocCollector.create(numHits,
allowOutOfOrder);
   searcher.search(weight, (Filter) null, coll);
