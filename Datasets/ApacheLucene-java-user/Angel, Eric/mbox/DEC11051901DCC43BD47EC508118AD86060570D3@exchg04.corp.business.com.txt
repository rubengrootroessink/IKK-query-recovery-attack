You can simply call IndexWriter.addDocument() for new jobs and
IndexWriter.updateDocument

http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWri
ter.html

Also, don't forget to optimize your index.  Depending on your volume,
you might want to optimize during slow traffic.

Subject: Lucene index updation and performance


I am working on a job portal site and have been using Lucene for job
search
functionality. 
Users will be posting a number jobs on our site on a daily basis.We need
to
make sure that new job posted is searchable on the site as soon as
possible. 
In this context, how do I update Lucene index when a new job is posted
or
when an existing job is edited? 
Can lucene index updating and search work in parallel? 

Also,can I know any tips/best practices with respect to Lucene
indexing,optimizing,performance etc? 

Appreciate ur help! 

Thanks!
