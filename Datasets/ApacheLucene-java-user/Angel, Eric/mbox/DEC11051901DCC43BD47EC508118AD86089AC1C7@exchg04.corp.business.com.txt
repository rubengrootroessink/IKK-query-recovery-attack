SUBJECT: querying multi-value fields
DATE: 12 Oct 2009

I have documents that store multiple values in some fields (using the
document.add(new Field()) with the same field name).  Here's what a
typical document looks like:

 

doc.option="value1 aaa"

doc.option="value2 bbb"

doc.option="value3 ccc"

 

I want my queries to only match individual values, for example, a query
for "value2 bbb" would return the above document, but a query for
"value1 ccc" should not.  Is this at all possible in lucene at query
time?  Could payloads be used for this?
