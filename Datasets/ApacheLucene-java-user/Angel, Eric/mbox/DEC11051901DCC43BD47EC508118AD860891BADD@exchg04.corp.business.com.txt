SUBJECT: 2.9: TopScoreDocCollector
DATE: 8 Oct 2009

According to the documentation for 2.9,
TopScoreDocCollector.create(numHits, boolean), the second parameter is
whether documents are scored in order by the input - How do I choose?
In other words, how would I know if the documents are scored in order or
not?
