SUBJECT: Remove Docs from Index
DATE: 10 Jan 2007

Hi People!

My app needs to update documents from index, so I have to remove and 
insert again, all right?

First I wrote this code:
---
        IndexReader reader = null;
        try
        {
            String index = Webp.getProperty("webp.search.indexFolder");
            Directory directory = FSDirectory.getDirectory(index, false);
           
            reader = IndexReader.open(directory);
            reader.delete(new Term("contentPid", 
String.valueOf("C_"+content.pidObject())));
        }
        ....
---

But It's not working well.. I want to use de method 'reader.delete(int)' 
but I can't discover the document 'ID' to use as parameter.
I wrote some code to return the documents that I have to delete. How can 
I get that ID?

Thanks!
