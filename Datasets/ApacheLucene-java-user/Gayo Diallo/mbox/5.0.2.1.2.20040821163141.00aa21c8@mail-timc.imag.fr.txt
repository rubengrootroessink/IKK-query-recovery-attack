SUBJECT: Index of terms hierarchy
DATE: 21 Aug 2004

Hello,

I wish to build a second index "on top" of the lucene index of simple term
using a list of predefined terms (which can be more than one word)
  contained in an hierarchy like a thesaurus.
  Has some one already did that ?

Best regards
Gayo
