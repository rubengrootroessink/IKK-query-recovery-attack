SUBJECT: Retrieving payloads for terms matched by a query
DATE: 22 May 2009

Hi,

I may be missing something obvious, but how do I get the payloads for
the specific token positions that were matched by a query?

For example, if I have a phrase query like "A keyword B" that matches
the field "A keyword B A", I can get the payloads for A and B with
IndexReader.termPositions(), but that doesn't tell me which of the two
positions of A matched the query.  I can kind of work back to it, but
it quickly becomes difficult for more complex queries.

Here's what I'm trying to accomplish: I have several entity classes,
I'd want to create an index using the class names as tokens, and
storing the specific entity ids in the payloads.  That way, I should
be able to run queries in terms of the classes (ie '"CLASS_A
CLASS_B"~10 NOT CLASS_C', etc) and then report the actual entities for
the matching documents. (I realize I'll need custom tokenizers/filters
to identify and tag the entities and handle class references in
queries, but that part seems pretty straightforward).

Does this sound workable?

Thanks,
Dmitri
