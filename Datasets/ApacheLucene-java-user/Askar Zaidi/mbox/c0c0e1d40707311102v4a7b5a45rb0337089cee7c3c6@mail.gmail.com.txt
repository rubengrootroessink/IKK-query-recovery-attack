SUBJECT: Re: Lucene Field score value
DATE: 31 Jul 2007

To be more specific:

I want to retrieve the scores of individual fields inside a document so that
I can manipulate the score of one field. This is the requirement of my
application. After the manipulation I can add these scores and then show the
total.

thanks,

AZ
