DATE: 31 Jul 2007

Hey guys,

I was wondering if there is a way to retrieve score of a field in a document
?

If my document looks like this:

{itemID},{field 1},{field 2}

I'd like to get score of individual fields 1 and 2 rather than the score of
the entire document.

Is it possible ?

thanks,
AZ
