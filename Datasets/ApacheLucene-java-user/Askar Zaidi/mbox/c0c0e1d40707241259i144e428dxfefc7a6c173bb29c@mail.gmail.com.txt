SUBJECT: FieldCache for Search
DATE: 24 Jul 2007

Hey Guys,

>From what I understand, FieldCache is used to store only the field required
for search. I am using a Document object and then using doc.get("item"). One
of my fields is HUGE, so using Document will slow things down.

How can I use FieldCache ? an example ?

thanks,
AZ
