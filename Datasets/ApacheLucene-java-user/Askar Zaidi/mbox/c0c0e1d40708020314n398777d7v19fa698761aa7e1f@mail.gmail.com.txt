SUBJECT: Do AND + OR Search in Lucene
DATE: 2 Aug 2007

Hey Guys,

Quick question:

I do this in my code for searching:

queryParser.setDefaultOperator(QueryParser.Operator.AND);

Lucene is OR by default so I change it to AND for my requirements. Now, I
have a requirement to do OR as well. I mean while doing AND I'd like to
include results from OR too ... but they'll be much lower ranked than the
AND results.

Is there a way to do this ?

thanks,
AZ
