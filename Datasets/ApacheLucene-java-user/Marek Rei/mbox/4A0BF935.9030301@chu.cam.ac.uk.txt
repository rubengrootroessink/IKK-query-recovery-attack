Hi,

I'm rather new to Lucene and could use some help.

My Analyzer uses a set of filters (PorterStemFilter, LowerCaseFilter,
WhitespaceTokenizer). I need to replicate the effect of these filters
outside of the normal Lucene pipeline. Basically I would like to input a
String from one end and get a processed String or String[] from the
other end.

Is there a good way to do this? I'm trying to figure it out myself but
in case I fail, maybe someone from here could give some advice?

Thank You!
Marek
