SUBJECT: times of match in a document
DATE: 28 May 2007

Hi,

I use lucene in my project and it works well.

Now I hope that the search result presenting to the user include the times
of the keyword match in a document.

Is there someone do this before,Or is there any code example for this...

Thanks in Advance.
Anny
