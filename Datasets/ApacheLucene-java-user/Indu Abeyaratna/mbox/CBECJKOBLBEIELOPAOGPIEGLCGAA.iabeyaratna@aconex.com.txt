SUBJECT: Query text Tokenize issue
DATE: 27 Jul 2005


I have a field index as keyword. And have two records "J400-C-V1-S10-T1" and
"J400-C-V-S10-T1"

When I search for  "J400-C-V1-S10-T1", it returns me matching record, but
when I Search for "J400-C-V-S10-T1" it doesn't return the matching one.

Further I found that "J400-C-V-S10-T1" is incorrectly tokenised to "J400-C"
and "V-S10-T1" but nothing like that happened to "J400-C-V1-S10-T1".

This happens when there is combination like "?-?-" and its get tokenised
into "?" and "?-".

I attached test case for further clarification.

I am using StandardAnalyser and query parser.

Is this a bug in the lucene or JavaCC??  Or am I missing something here? any
suggestion to get away with this?
