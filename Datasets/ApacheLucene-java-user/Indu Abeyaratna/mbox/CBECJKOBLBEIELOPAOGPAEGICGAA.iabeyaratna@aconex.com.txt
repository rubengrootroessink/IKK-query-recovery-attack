DATE: 26 Jul 2005

I have a question related to this.

when I search for wildcard "*11" IndexSearcher throws an exception but when
I tries "\**11" it works.

I couldn't find any documentation related to this. What could be the reason
for this?

I am using QueryParser and StandardAnalyser

And the query it generate looks like : "+orgId:9146 +isRegistered:1
+docNo:**11"

Regard,
Indu

Hi Derek,

My guessing is that ":" is special, QueryParser
may regard ":" as for qualifying a field, we may
need to escape this special symbol as:

"GM\:Systems"

as query string.

You can use Luke to see what got indexed.  This will tell you what the
Analyzer did.
You can then use QueryParser from the command line (it's got a main
method), give it your input, and see what it returns.  This will tell
you what QueryParser+Analyzer did.  Oh, you use MFQP.  It may have a
main method, too, I'd have to check... To simplify, try getting it
working with the regular QueryParser first.
