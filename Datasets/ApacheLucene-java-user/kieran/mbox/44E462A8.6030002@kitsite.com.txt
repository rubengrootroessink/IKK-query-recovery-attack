SUBJECT: Re: Lucene/Tomcat Memory Leak Issue
DATE: 17 Aug 2006

The source code is there to look at, modify, and/or compile yourself ;-)
Any "grave concerns" should be addressable by examining the contents of 
the patch.
The change is pretty minor. As far as problems are concerned: in some 
circumstances, there could (arguably) be a performance overhead.
We use it in a production environment; an array of 6 sun blade servers 
that was running out of memory regularly. This patch stopped this bug.
Our particular installation uses the RAMDirectory class to load indexes. 
This appears to vastly speed up the occurrence of the out of memory 
exceptions, but I don't think it's crucial.
If you want any more details, you're welcome to email me either on or 
off-list.
