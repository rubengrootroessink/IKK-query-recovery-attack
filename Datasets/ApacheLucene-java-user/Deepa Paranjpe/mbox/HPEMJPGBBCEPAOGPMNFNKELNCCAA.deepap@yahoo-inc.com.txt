SUBJECT: Lucene index in memory
DATE: 15 Feb 2007

Hi all,

I want to understand how lucene searches its index -- does it load the whole
index into memory at once? Is there any way to make sure that it does so.

I want to optimize maximally on the search time required by lucene on over
~7M short documents. The queries that I deal are 6 to 7 tokens on an
average.

Your help on this will be appreciated.

-Deepa
