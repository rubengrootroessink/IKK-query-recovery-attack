SUBJECT: Maven2 Lucene 1.9 package
DATE: 28 Feb 2006

Hi all,


I need an official Maven2 package and wanted to build one. Then I saw
the following in the documentation of Maven:

"Maven partners

The following sites sync automatically their project repository with the 
central one. If you want a project from any of this sites to be uploaded 
to ibiblio you'll have to contact the project maintainers.

     * The Apache Software Foundation
     * Codehaus
     * MortBay Jetty
     * OpenSymphony
     * OS Java
"

I wonder if somebody did it before or if somebody of the core developers
wants to take the responsability to build one?


With kind regards

Andreas Baumann
