        HashSet terms = new HashSet();
        query.rewrite(reader).extractTerms(terms); 

Ok, but this delivers every term, not just a list of words the Levenshtein
algorithm produced with similarity. Regarding to the posts here in my opened
thread, you guis seem to be experienced programmers so, why you can't post a
code snippet as an example?
I'm asking that because probably I'm not so experienced in Lucene like you
and having an exaple would help .

Cheers
