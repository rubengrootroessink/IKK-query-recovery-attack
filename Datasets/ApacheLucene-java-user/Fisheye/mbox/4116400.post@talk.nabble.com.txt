SUBJECT: fuzzy sentence search
DATE: 27 Apr 2006


Is it possible to search sentences, more than one word at a time, or phrases
with fuzzy search?

I have implemented fuzzy search, if I only search one single word it works
fine, but if I start searching more than one word or a sentence it does not
find anything...strange, when I set the relevance for fuzzy search to 20% or
very low, something is found but not really that what I want...with
relevance set to 80%, nothing is found when I do fuzzy search with multiple
words...
