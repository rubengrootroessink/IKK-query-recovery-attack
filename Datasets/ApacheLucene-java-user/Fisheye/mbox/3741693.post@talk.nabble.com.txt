SUBJECT: Custom hit score
DATE: 4 Apr 2006


I want to have a simple hit score for every document where the query has been
found. E.g. if the query word was found 3 times in a document, this doc
should have 100% score, next document with 2 times should have 90% and so
on...

Normal hit score used by Lucene seems to be strange so I only want to know
how many times a query text appears in a document. With that information,
then I can make my own simple ranking...

Does someone know how this works in Lucene?

thx
