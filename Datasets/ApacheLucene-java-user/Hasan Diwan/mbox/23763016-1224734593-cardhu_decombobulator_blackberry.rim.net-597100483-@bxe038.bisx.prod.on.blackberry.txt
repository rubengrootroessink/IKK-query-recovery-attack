I seem to recall running the SimpleQueryParser first. If that throws an Exception, I then ran
it with the RegexQueryParser with a reduced score. Hth

Subject: How to use regexQuery along with fuzzy logic capabilities


Hi, 
 
I want to use lucene for a simple search engine. If I use the code like
this, 
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(field, analyzer);
Query query = parser.parse(line);
searcher.search(query) 
above code doesn't give me regular expression search power, while at the
other hand if I use the below code, 
RegexQuery rexquery = new RegexQuery(new Term(field, line));
searcher.search(rexquery)., 
I don't get the fuzzy logic and other search abilities which I get using
the analyzer.
 
I am not java expert, could you please give me a simple example on this
? 
 
thanks
Aashish Agrawal
