SUBJECT: Email Indexing
DATE: 27 Oct 2010

I'd like to provide myself with a searchable index of email. I'm
familiar with the Javamail library, so will use this to fetch the
mail. Anyone out there done any indexing of email? On Sourceforge,
there's zoe[1], which hasn't had a release since 2004, and a couple of
other projects. I'm also seeing something about sphinx, which reads
like another indexing platform(?). Any advice regarding this is
appreciated.
