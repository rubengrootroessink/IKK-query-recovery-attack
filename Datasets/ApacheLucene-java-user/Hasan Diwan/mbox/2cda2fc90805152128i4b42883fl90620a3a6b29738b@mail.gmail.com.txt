  public final Hits search(Query query) throws IOException {

this will not print all results, according to [2]. I would like it to.

By default, lucene will not display low-scoring results -- how you set
this minimum score is beyond a cursory glance at the source code --
I'd like lucene to return all matching documents, irrespective of hit
score. Many thanks for the help.
