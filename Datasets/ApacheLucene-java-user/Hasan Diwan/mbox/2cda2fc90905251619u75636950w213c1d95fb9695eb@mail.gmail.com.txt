// query contains the query string, and doc contains the string
corresponding to the document contents
public String resultPhrase() {
   int queryPosition = doc.indexOf(query);
   int numberOfWords = 20; // get 20 words on either side of query
   String [] words = doc.split("\s");
   ArrayList wordList = new ArrayList();
   String[] queryWords = query.split("\s");
   String ret = new String();
   for (int i = wordList.indexOf(queryWords[0])-numberOfWords; i!=
wordList.indexOf(queryWords[0]+numberOfWords;i++) {
      if (words[i] == null) continue;
      ret += words[i];
   }
   return ret;
}
This isn't tested, but let me know how it works, this doesn't use
anything beyond what is in the JDK.
