標題: [Lucene] XML Indexing
收件人：: lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org

XMLIndexingDemo seems not able to index traditional Chinese characters. I can only search
for English text and not Chinese. In fact, my XML document contains both Chinese and English
text. How can I fix this problem? Is it necessary for me to convert the Chinese characters
in BIG5 to UTF-8 before doing the file indexing? If it is, then how can we do it? This problem
won't happen on indexing bilingual HTML files (Chinese & English) with Lucene Demo HTML
parser.
