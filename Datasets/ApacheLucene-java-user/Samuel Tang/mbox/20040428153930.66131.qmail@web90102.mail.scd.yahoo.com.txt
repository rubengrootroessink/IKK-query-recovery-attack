SUBJECT: [Lucene] XML Indexing
DATE: 28 Apr 2004

XMLIndexingDemo seems not able to index traditional Chinese characters. I can only search for
English text and not Chinese. In fact, my XML document contains both Chinese and English text.
How can I fix this problem? Is it necessary for me to convert the Chinese characters in BIG5
to UTF-8 before doing the file indexing? If it is, then how can we do it? This problem won't
happen on indexing bilingual HTML files (Chinese & English) with Lucene Demo HTML parser.
