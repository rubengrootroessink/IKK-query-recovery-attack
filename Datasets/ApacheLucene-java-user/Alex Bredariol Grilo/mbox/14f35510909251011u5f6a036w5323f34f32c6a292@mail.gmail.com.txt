Hi,
I'm new to Lucene and I'm trying to do some stuff with Lucene but I have
some problems.

I have some documents, in which some contain the word notebook written
separated,  e.g. "some dummy words note book other dummy words". And I'd
like that when I search notebook, these documents could be found and I'd
like to do it for a general case, like trying to search the words joining
the word before or after.

How could I do that? Is there an analyzer which tokenize like that?

Thank you


Alex
