Worked for me. 
I added my jar to the classpath and my analyzer appeared in the analyzers list in the search
tab as well as in the analyzers list in the plugins tab.

I am using Luke v 0.5 (2004-05-25)

Sorry for the slightly off topic post, but I have a need to use luke with my
Analyzer.  Has anyone done this?  I have added a jar file to my classpath,
but that didn't help.

Thanks in advance
Rob
