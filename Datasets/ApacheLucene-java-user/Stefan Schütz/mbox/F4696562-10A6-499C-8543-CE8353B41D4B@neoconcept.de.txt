SUBJECT: Problems with Queries which contain '_'  and wildcards
DATE: 13 Dec 2006

Hi,

first let me explain the situation:

We have to index an document, which contains a field "file" to store  
filenames.
Sometimes filenames contain an underscore or an minus (_ or -). =>  
e.g. foo_bar.doc
Indexing is'nt the problem so far.

But if we now try to search for "foo_b*" the QueryParser crashes with  
following exception:

org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException: Cannot build  
PrefixQuery with analyzer class  
org.apache.lucene.analysis.de.GermanAnalyzer - token was consumed


Same problem occurs if i use the StandardAnalyzer.
To replace underscores in filenames is not a solution because we have  
many other fields
which can contain underscores. :(

Is there anybody who knows this problem or knows a solution for this?

thx in advance.
Stefan
