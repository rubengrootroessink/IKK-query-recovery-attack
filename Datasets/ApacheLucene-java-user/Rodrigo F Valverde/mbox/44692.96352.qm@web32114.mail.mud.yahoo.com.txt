DATE: 24 May 2007

Hi all!

I implemented a searcher with Lucene and i´m trying to search two words, the both into the
same text file, but...i can´t!

When I search the first word and the second separated, everithing happens ok, but when together,
with or wtithout "AND" or "+"...nothing is found! :(

Can somebody help me?
