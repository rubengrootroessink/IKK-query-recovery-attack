SUBJECT: optimeze() is not merging into single file?
DATE: 1 Jun 2004

I optimize and close the index after that, but don't get just one .cvs 
file as it promised in doc. Instead of it I see something like small 
segments and a couple of big.
This weird behavor seems started since i changed from v 1.4-rc2 to 
1.4-rc3.
Before I got just one cvs segment . Any ideas?
Thanks in advance
J.
