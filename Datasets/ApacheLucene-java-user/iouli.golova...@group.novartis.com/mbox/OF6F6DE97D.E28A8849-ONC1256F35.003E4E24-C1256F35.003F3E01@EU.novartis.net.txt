SUBJECT: Need advice: what pdf lib to use?
DATE: 22 Oct 2004

Hello all,

I need a piece of advice/experience..

What pdf parser (written in java) u'd recommend?

I played now with PDFBox-0.6.7a and would not say I was satisfied too much 
with it

On certain pdf's (not well formated but anyway readable with acrobate)  it 
run into dead loop (this I could fix in code),
and on one file it produced "out of memory error" and killed jvm:( (this 
problem I could not identify yet)

After all the performance was not too great as well: it took c. 19 h. to 
index 13000 files (c. 3.5Gb)

Regards,
J.
