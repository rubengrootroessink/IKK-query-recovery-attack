Hello!

>before scewing tomcat too much...

A little late but probably good advice thankfully it hasn't gone wrong

>1.make it sure both indexing and reading processes use the same locking
>directory (i.e. set it explicitly, take a look in wiky how to)

working on this not so good at Java yet (until recently I mostly worked on 

Php) , looked on the wiki "how to's" could you be more specific as I 
couldn't find much on locking directories. But I will struggle on

Here is the simplest way to do it:
System.setProperty("java.io.tmpdir",tmpdir);
Just drop this line in indexing and quering modules. You'll  see after 
that smth. like lucene-bla-bla.lock files. In case processs is stumling 
You might delete them manually.

>2. try to execute queries from command line and see what happends

I only exectute from the command line, so so all the info in previous 
posts 
is what happens

Wait a minute, indexing is from command line but quering from tomcat or 
what?!

>3. in case your queries use sorting, there is a memory leak it 1.4.1 ->
>upgrade to 1.4.2

My queries do use sorting!

Congratulations! This is definitly an issue - sever will be out of memory 
and probably out of open file descriptors pretty quick, so You are half a 
way to success.:)

 So I have placed the 1.4 final jar onto my 
classpath and have started 'another' index, as the company I work for is 
moving home tomorrow may not be able to tell you if that worked till next 
week mind.

To Dan, the increased memory allocation for Tomcat didn't work 
unfortunately 
but I do  know a lot more about catalina_opt and Tomcat now which has 
proved 
handy for other things.

cheers for all the advice people will keep you posted if I make a 
breakthrough
thanks for your patience, regards,

JT
