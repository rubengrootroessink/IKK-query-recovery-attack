OK, but even in this case parsing the doc would not be a violation, 
because actually what we need for lucene is just collection of terms. Has 
nothing to do with printing or copying of _text_ pieces.
As long You provide method returning just Document (I mean lucene 
document) permissions specified by the author of the PDF document are respected

In order to write software that consumes PDF documents you must agree to a
list of conditions.  One of those conditions is that permissions specified
by the author of the PDF document are respected.

PDFBox complies with this statement, if there is software that does not
then they are in violation of copyright law.

That being said, PDFBox is open source so a user could make modifications
to the source code, or as a PDF library could change permissions on a
document.
