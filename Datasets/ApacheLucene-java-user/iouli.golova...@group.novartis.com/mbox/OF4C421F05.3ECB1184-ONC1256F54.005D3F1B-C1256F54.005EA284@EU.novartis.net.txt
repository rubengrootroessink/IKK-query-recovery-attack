SUBJECT: Index in RAM - is it realy worthy?
DATE: 22 Nov 2004


I did following test:
I created  the RAM folder on my Red Hat box and copied   c. 1Gb of indexes
there.
I expected the queries to run much quicker.
In reality it was even sometimes slower(sic!)

Lucene has it's own RAM disk functionality. If I implement it, would it
bring any benefits?

Thanks in advance
J.
