Thanks everybody for responds.

What else can essentially improve queries performance?
(I do not speak now about such things as keeping index optimized etc. - 
it's clear)

As I experiensed on my 2 cpu box,  during the query execution both 
processors were realy busy. The question is would it accelerate speed if I 
get 4 cpu box, 10 cpu...
I mean real performance boost (at least factor 10), not just %-ge.

Whould it help if I play with different query formulation, i.e.  "a and (b 
or c)" instead of  "(b or c) and a"

Regards,
j.

Also another note is that doing an index merge in memory is probably 
faster if you just use a RAMDirectory and perform addIndexes to it.

This would almost certainly be faster than optimizing on disk but I 
haven't benchmarked it.
