I rechecked  the results. Here they are:

IndexWriter compiled with v.1.4-rc2 generates after optimization
_36d.cfs    3779 kb

IndexWriter compiled with v.1.4-rc3 generates after optimization

_36d.cfs   3778 kb
_36c.cfs    31 kb
_35z.cfs    14 kb
_35o.cfs   14  kb
.....
....etc.

I both cases segment file contains _36d.cfs

Looks like new version just "foget" to clean up

I optimize and close the index after that, but don't get just one .cvs 
file as it promised in doc. Instead of it I see something like small 
segments and a couple of big.
This weird behavor seems started since i changed from v 1.4-rc2 to 
1.4-rc3.
Before I got just one cvs segment . Any ideas?
Thanks in advance
J.
