SUBJECT: PorterStemAnalyzer versus SnowballAnalyser?
DATE: 28 Sep 2004

I use PorterStemAnalyzer provided by Otis (see 
http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/01/15/lucene.html?page=2,),
in 
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contributions/snowball/there 
are another implementations of porter algoritm. 
>From the first glance it looks some how very different.

What the difference/advantage/disadvantage in using Otis code or  one from 
lucene-sandbox Snowball

Thanks in advance
J.
