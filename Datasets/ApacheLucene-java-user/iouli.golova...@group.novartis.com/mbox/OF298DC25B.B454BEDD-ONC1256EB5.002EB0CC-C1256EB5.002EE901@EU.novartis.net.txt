Yes I'm on windows, but... I got this result  without searching parallely.
Moreover, with 1.4-rc2 I got just one file as promised.

If you're on windows that's presumably the same situation as for old index
files of a non compound index after optimization.
The files cannot be deleted as long as they are open by a searcher.
So lucene has to delay the deletion, which I guess deletetable is used
for.
On unix/linux you shouldn't see the old files anymore, though they are
still
there (the files which are independet from the directory entries), and will
be
removed by the system, when they are closed by the last process that had
them open.
