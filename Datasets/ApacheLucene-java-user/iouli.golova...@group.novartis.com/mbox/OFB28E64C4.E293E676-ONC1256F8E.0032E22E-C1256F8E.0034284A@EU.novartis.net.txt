Erik,Otis,*,

Why IndexReader.lastModified(index) is depricated?

It's always a good idea to know when the index changed last time, for
example for queries reload, optimization etc.
IndexReader.getCurrentVersion(index) introduced as alternative is not the
same, cause I'd like to know not just the version,ie the fact my index got
modified, but the stamp as well (for example index was modified but it
happened just for couple of min. -> I wait and do nothing)
Clear I can get the time from index file but it's not nice.

Regards
j.
