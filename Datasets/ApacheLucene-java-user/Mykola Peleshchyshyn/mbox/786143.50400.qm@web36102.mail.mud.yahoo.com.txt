SUBJECT: Range search in dependent collections
DATE: 23 Feb 2009

Hello,
I'm new to Lucene and I have the following problem:

I have a Users with first name, last name etc. and User Jobs (collection) with job title,
start date, end date.

I need to perform search on all user fields (fist name, last name etc) and job fields (job
title and optionally start date and end date).

What would be the best way to index and search this data?

Thank you,
Mykola Peleshchyshyn
