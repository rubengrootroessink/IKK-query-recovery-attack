SUBJECT: Boost factor in MultiFieldQueryParser
DATE: 17 May 2006

Hi all,

I am evaluating Lucene 1.9 for a search application. I am using
MultiFieldQueryParser for searching across fields and everything works fine.
However, we have a new requirement where certain fields need to be boosted
while searching. To complicate matters, users can specify fields while
searching (e.g. "title:hybrid content:vehicle").

I came across this enhancement request (
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32115) that appears to
address the boosting issue (Please see attached sample code to illustrate
the problem. NewMultiFieldQueryParser is the enhanced version of
MultiFieldQueryParser as per the enhancement request. I used
lucene-core-1.9.1.jar to test the code). For all simple searches (i.e. when
I don't mention a field while searching), it appears to work - explain
output follows:

However, when the search term includes a field (e.g. "title:hybrid
content:vehicle"), boosting for the terms does not seem to work:

Can you please suggest how to tackle the issue?
