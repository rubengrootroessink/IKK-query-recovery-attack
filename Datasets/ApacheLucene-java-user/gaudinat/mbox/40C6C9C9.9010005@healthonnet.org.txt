SUBJECT: Proximity Searches  behavior
DATE: 9 Jun 2004

What does exactly happen with three words or more when we do a proximity 
search?
such as:  "lucene jakarta best"~10
Is each word can be at a distance of  10 of each others, or is there an 
other behaviour?

By the way, I would like to know  if someone use this lucene feature 
regularly?
For my part I would like to use this feature to improve the precision of 
the finding documents by using the word position.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Arnaud.
