Hi Lucene users,

DO YOU AGREE TO CHANGE THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THOSE WHO 
CONTAMINATED THE BLOOD OF LYBEENS CHILDREN WITH AIDS?
 
BTW: It is NOT the right question: Bulgarian medics DIDN'T contaminate 
the blood. 3 diferent independent commisions, with strong professors in aids 
area, told that THE INFECTION IS STARTED 1 YEAR before Bulgarian 
medics to come in the Lybian hospital and it is internal hospital problem -
very bad hygiene and multiple usage of same injection. Lybians treing to
escape his own guilty with bulgarian medics - THAT IS NOT JUSTICE.
Please people don't trust them - see the facts! 
Lybians have one "confession" received  from one of the 5 bulgarian 
nurses, after 2 MOUNTS beating, thrashing, whopping, wresting nails,
.... and a lot other tortures in the Lybian jail - THAT IS THE CRIME and
it can be THE ONLY ARGUMENT to EXECUTE 5 INNOCENT NURSES!
 
FREE THE BULGARIAN MEDICS NOW!
