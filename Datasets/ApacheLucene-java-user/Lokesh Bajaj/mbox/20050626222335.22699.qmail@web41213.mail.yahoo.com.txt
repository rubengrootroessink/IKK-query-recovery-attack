Thanks for the idea. I have tried with both 512m and 1024m with the same results. I also turned
on verbose gc logging. Once I see this slowdown, the gc is running only once every 12 minutes
or so and finishes in less than 0.005 seconds.
 
Its basically stuck at 100% cpu usage, but doesn't seem to be doing anything useful.

Does you JVM have enough heap (e.g. -Xmx500M)? Java gets slow if it's busy 
with garbage collection.
