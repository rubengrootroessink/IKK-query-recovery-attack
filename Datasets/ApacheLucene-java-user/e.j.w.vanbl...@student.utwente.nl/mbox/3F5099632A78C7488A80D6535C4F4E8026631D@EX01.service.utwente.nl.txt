SUBJECT: index word files ( doc )
DATE: 23 Mar 2007

Hello,
 
I am planning to index Word 2003 files. I read I have to use Jakarta Apache POI, but I also
read on the POI site that their work with doc's is in an early stage.
 
Is POI advisable? Or are there better alternatives?
Please give some advice.
 
Regards,
 
Erik
