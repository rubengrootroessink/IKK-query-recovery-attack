SUBJECT: Questions on index locking
DATE: 29 Jan 2002

Hey all,

I'm integrating the newest version of Lucene into our codebase, and ran
into a few questions about the directory locking. First, I'd like to
suggest that it might help to add some comments to the Javadocs of
IndexReader and IndexWriter about when directories are locked and what
it means. Second, is there a particular exception I can catch when
trying to open a directory to handle if a lock is already on that dir?
Would it make sense to add a DirectoryLockedException or something
similar?

Regards,
Matt
