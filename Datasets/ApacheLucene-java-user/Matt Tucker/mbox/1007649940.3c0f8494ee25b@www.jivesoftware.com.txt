Jeff,

We've been using Lucene as a part of our product Jive Forums 
(http://www.jivesoftware.com) for about a year now. So, that means it's in use 
on thousands upon thousands of our customer's production websites including 
Sun, Sony Music, and many others. I'd be happy to provide more detailed 
information about our integration if you'd like. Lucene has been great for us 
and we never mind raving about it. :)

Regards,
Matt
