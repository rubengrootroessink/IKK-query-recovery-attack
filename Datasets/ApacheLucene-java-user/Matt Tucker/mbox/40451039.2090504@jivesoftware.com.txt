Clandes,

I'm not sure what the "body" field is that you're indexing. If it's a 
database record, one option may be to store the database primary key for 
the record as a field value -- basically a document ID. In that case, 
you would do the search and get back matching document ID's. You could 
then pull the bodies from the database and send them through the 
hilighting routine without ever needing to store the full body value in 
Lucene.

Regards,
Matt
