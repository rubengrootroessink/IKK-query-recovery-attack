SUBJECT: Lucene index limit
DATE: 24 Mar 2011

Is there some sort of default limit imposed on the Lucene indexes?
I try to index 50k or 60k documents but when I use Luke to go inside
the index and check the total # of entries indexed, it shows that
there are only 32768 entries.
It seems liek some sort of limit ... what should I look at to adjust
this behavior?

Thanks,
- Pulkit
