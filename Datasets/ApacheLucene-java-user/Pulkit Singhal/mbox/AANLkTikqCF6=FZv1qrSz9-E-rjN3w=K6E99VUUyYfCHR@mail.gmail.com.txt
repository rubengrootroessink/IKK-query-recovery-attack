SUBJECT: How to close the wrapped directory implementation
DATE: 17 Sep 2010

With RAMDirectory we have the option of providing another Directory
implementation such as FSDirectory that can be wrapped and loaded into
memory:

Directory directory = new RAMDirectory(FSDirectory.open(new
File(fileDirectoryName)));

But after building the index, if I close the IndexWriter then the data
is still available for searches in the directory bean but nothing ever
gets written to the disk!

Is this a bug? Is there a workaround?

Or is this by design? Is the RAMDirectory constructor only meant to
read in data from the passed in argument? Or is it supposed to keep it
around and update it when closing?

Please write back, Thanks!
