SUBJECT: Does a IndexSearcher call incRef on the underlying reader?
DATE: 27 Oct 2010

Hello,

I have been looking at the SearcherManager example provided in the "Lucene
In Action 2nd Edition" book. It seems like a great way to manage
IndexReaders but I had a few questions about the Lucene API that poppedup
after reading it:

@Question: Does a IndexSearcher call upon an IndexReader's incRef() method
internally when the reader is passed in as an argument to the searcher's
constructor?
@Motivation: I ask because, if that is the case then I will need to make an
additional call to decRef(). Also the book claims that
"IndexSearcher.close() is a no-op if you provide an already opened
IndexReader when creating the IndexSearcher" so I guess I can't count on
that close() method to call the decRef() method for me and I must call it
myself?  Once again, I'm thinking of doing all this only if incRef() was
called on the reader in the searcher's constructor, which I'm hoping someone
will confirm for me.

Thanks,
- Pulkit
