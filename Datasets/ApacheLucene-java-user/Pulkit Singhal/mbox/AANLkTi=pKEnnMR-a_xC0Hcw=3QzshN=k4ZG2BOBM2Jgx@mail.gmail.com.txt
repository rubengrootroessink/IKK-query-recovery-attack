Greetings!

When using KeywordAnalyzer for indexing a field which has the
Field.Index.ANALYZED option selected.

Does the use of KeywordAnalyzer automatically mean that there is no
point in trying to set the index-time boosts on that field in the
document because it will be treated as a full token but without any
NORMS?

Or does the fact that I said used ANALYZED instead of
ANALYZED_NO_NORMS make some difference and I can get the index-time
boosts information stored the way I want?\
Even though I'm using a KeywordAnalyzer ...

Thanks for reading through my confusing question :)
