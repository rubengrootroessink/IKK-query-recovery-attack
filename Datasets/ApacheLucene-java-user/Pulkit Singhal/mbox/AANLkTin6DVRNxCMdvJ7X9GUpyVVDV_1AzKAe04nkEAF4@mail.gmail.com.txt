SUBJECT: Where to find non-English dictionaries, thesaurus, synonyms
DATE: 6 Jan 2011

Hello,

What's a good source to get dictionaries (for spellcorrections) and/or
thesaurus (for synonyms) that can be used with Lucene for non-English
languages such as Fresh, Chinese, Korean etc?

For example, the wordnet contrib module is based on the data set
provided by the Princeton based wordnet system but I'm wondering where
the Lucene users go for similar reliable source for other languages?

Thanks!
