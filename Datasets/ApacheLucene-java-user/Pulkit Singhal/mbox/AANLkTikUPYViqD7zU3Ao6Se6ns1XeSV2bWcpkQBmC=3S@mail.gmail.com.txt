SUBJECT: How to count entries in an index file?
DATE: 24 Sep 2010

Hello Everyone,

I want to load the indexed data from the file system using FSDirectory.
But I also want to be sure if something was actually loaded or if a
new empty directory was created and returned to me.
How can I count the # of entries in the Directory object returned to me?

Thanks!
