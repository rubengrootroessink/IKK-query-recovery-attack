SUBJECT: IndexWriters and write locks
DATE: 10 Nov 2010

Hello,

1) On Windows, I often shut down my application server (which has active
IndexWriters open) using the ctrl+c keys.
2) I inspect my directories on the file system I see that the write.lock
file is still there.
3) I start the app server again, and do some operations that would require
IndexWriters to write to the same directories again and it works!

I don't understand why I do not run into any exceptions?
I mean there is already a lock file present which should prevent the
IndexWriters from getting access to the directories ... no?
I should be happy but I'm not because other folks are able to get exceptions
when they bounce their servers an I'm unable to reproduce the problem and I
can't help them.

Any clues? Anyone?

Thank You,
- Pulkit
