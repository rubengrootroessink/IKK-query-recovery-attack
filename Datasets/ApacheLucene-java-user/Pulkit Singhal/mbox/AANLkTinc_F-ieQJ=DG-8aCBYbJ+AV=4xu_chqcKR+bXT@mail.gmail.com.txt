SUBJECT: Re: Does a IndexSearcher call incRef on the underlying reader?
DATE: 27 Oct 2010

@Question2: Also I was wondering what happens to the code that may have been
using the searcher which got swapped out in SearcherManager? Does that
IndexSearcher continue to run and when it finishes the GC is free to collect
it? OR will the fact that the reader for that searcher has had its last
decRef() call take the reader's internal count to 0 ... cause someone who is
paging through results to see the server choking with exceptions?
