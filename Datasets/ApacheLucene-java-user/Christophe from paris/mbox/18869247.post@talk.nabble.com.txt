Yes  markrmiller,the order is important
then 

 TokenStream result = new StandardTokenizer(reader);
    result = new StandardFilter(result);  
    result = new StopFilter(result, stoptable);    
    result = new ISOLatin1AccentFilter(result);
    result = new FrenchStemFilter(result, excltable);
    result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);

And finaly with ISOLatin1AccentFilter the result is good :)

tanks you.

Now go the polish search ^^
