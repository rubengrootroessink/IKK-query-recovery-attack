Spoken like a man who's been there. Hehe... Who hasn't...

I'm going to try storing a persistent manager class in the
ServletContext so I can access it from the various servlets. It's not a
100% solution, but I think it'll strike the right balance between
madness and a series of increasingly annoying if-statements. :-)

Unless there's a reason that's a bad idea... The only thing I can think
of is that I need to make sure that one servlet is responsible for
setting it up and disposing of it.

Not every servlet container will support the same cross context
methodology.
Most would say you're approach is an EJB with a life cycle outside of
the
interaction layer.

But honestly, you'll just spend the next few hours googling, pulling out
hair, buying a book on jboss
and then curse it, and do it this way in the end..
