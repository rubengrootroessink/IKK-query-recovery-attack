SUBJECT: Incorrect search result with PhraseQuery
DATE: 25 May 2009

hi,
has anyone stumble across this problem where PhraseQuery leads to
incorrect results? In my specific
case PhraseQuery would become equivilent to a set of disjunctive term
queries. However, upon restarting my application (inside tomcat)
PhraseQuery would work again. The logic that produces query objects is
held consistent.


any thoughts?

thanks!
