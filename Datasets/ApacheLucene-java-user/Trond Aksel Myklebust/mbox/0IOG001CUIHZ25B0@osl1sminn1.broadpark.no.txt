SUBJECT: Large queries
DATE: 16 Oct 2005

How is Lucene handling very large queries? I have 6million documents, which
each has a "docID" field. There is a total of 20000 distinct docID's, so
many documents got the same docID which consists of a filename (only name,
not path).

Sometimes, I must get all documents that has one of 10 docID's, and
sometimes I need to get all documents that has one of 10000 docIDs. Is there
any other way than doing a query: docID:(file1 file2 file3 file4..) ?
