Yonik,

Thanks for the input. We'll try this out.
And you're right - I tried to simplify our first operation's description.

If you want to avoid double-caching of norms, then you should call
getDocIdSet() for each segment reader, not the top level reader.

Aside: presumably you're actually doing something more advanced than
getting the hit count (and you just simplified your description
because it wasn't pertinent)... since you can get the hit count from
TopDocs.
