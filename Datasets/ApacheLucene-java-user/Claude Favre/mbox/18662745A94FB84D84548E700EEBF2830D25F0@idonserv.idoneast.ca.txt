SUBJECT: Velocity template
DATE: 1 May 2003

I was looking at the archive and could not find any help on using lucene
with velocity vm template as opposed to jsp.

 

I run the examples and the page that are return are jsp pages. I was
wondering if someone knew of a tutorial or sample on how to return the
search as a vm template.

 

Thank you

 

Claude
