SUBJECT: Boolean expression for no terms OR matching a wildcard
DATE: 10 Jul 2008

I need to perform a query for a term that may or may not have values,  
and I need to check for the conditions where either no terms are  
indexed OR any and ALL indexed terms match a wildcard.

For example, say the following values were indexed as terms in the  
field "myfield" in the three documents:

1) terms "abc123" and "abcdef123"
2) terms "abc123", "def123" and "abcdef123"
3) no terms

I want my query with a wildcard search of "+myfield:abc*123" to match  
on both 1 and 3 but NOT 2.

Is this possible?

Thanks,
   - Ron
