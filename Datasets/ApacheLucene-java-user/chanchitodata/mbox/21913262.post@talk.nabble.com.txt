SUBJECT: Memory Eaten up by TermInfo Instances in Lucene 2.4
DATE: 9 Feb 2009


Hi,

I have a weird problem. I use Lucene 2.4 in an web application(Tomcat
5.5.x), running uncer JDK 1.5. After a while (from 1 day to a couple
depending on traffic) all memory gets eaten up by a lot of TermInfo
instances. I have profiled the application and I can see that the TermInfo
instances does not get recovered by the GC. 
I also use Compass and have been posting on a thread in the Compass
forum(http://forum.compass-project.org/thread.jspa?threadID=215943&start=0&tstart=0),
thinking that it was Compass the held on to something in memory but we have
come into conclusion that it must be Lucene that keeps holding on the the
memory.

I have read the thread
http://www.nabble.com/OutOfMemory-Problems-Lucene-2.4---Tomcat-td20236834.html#a20236834
and tried to divide my index into smaller parts but with the same result. 

The index contains about 1.5Gb with around 2.7 Million documents and aprox.
30 Fields.
