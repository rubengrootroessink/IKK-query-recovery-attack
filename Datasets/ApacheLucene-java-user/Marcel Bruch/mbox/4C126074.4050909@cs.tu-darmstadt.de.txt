I agree. It would probably work out of the box with lucene's default 
scoring. Actually, I'm getting my feet wet with lucene using just the 
WhitespaceAnalyser and the schema you proposed. However, we want to 
experiment with different scoring functions, features and feature 
weights - thus, need full control over the scoring...

I think it is :-) It's tightly integrated into Eclipse where (i) it 
grabs your code of your current editor on demand, (ii) automatically 
creates and submits a query from it, and (iii) displays the best code 
examples directly aside your editor in a separate view. As soon as 
scoring works with Lucene you can test the first version in a week or two.

However, can I implement this scoring function with Lucene:
score(d,q) = \sum_{i \in I} w_i * f_i(d,q)

Thanks,
Marcel
