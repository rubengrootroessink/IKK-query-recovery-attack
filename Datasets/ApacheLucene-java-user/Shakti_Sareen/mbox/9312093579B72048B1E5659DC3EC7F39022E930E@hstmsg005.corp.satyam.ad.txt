DATE: 26 Nov 2007

Hi all,

The size of the folder where I am keeping the index files is 160 MB

containing 3277 documents.

That's not too much. If you are doing things right, search should not
take much time.

 

 

Below is the code :

String sNumber = null;

hits = searcher.search(query);

for (int i = 0;i < hits.length();i++) {

 doc = hits.doc(i);

 sdocNumber = doc.get("NUMBER");

 if (sNumber.equalsIgnoreCase(sdocNumber)) {

    LOGGER.info("Match found - " + sdocNumber);

    } 

}

 

 

Can anyone help???

 

Regards

Shakti Sareen
