Hi 

Can anyone help me with a code having a class which extends the
StandardAnalyzer and that analyzer should not tokenize the word across
hyphen

The thing is - StandardAnalyzer breaks on hyphen. You'll need to work
around
this by either extend StandardAnalyzer

>From StandardTokenizer's documentation (which is used by
StandardAnalyzer):
*   <li> *Splits words at hyphens, unless there's a number in the token,
in
which case
 *     the whole token is interpreted as a product number and is not
split.*

I've investigated StandardAnalyzer's tokenization and it doesn't look
simple
to disable that behavior. What you can do is extend StandardAnalyzer and
override its tokenStream method to create a TokenStream of your own. If
you
know your text is space separated, you can use StringTokenizer to split
the
text on spaces. If a token contains '-', don't break it, otherwise pass
it
forward the the TokenStream returned by StandardAnalyzer.

Maybe someone else has a better answer, but if you insist on using
StandardAnalyzer, I have a feeling it will be problematic.
