SUBJECT: help required ... ~ operator
DATE: 10 Dec 2007

Hi all,

     I am using StandardAnalyzer() to index the data. I am getting false
hits in ~ operator query.

Actual data is: "signals by magnets of different strength"
and when I am parsing a query: "signals strength"~2  , I am getting a
hit which is a false result.

I am using QueryParser.

Please help on this issue.

Thanks
Shakti Sareen
