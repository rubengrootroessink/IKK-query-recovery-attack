Hi 
I am using StandardAnalyser() to index the data.
But I want to do a like search on a word containing Hyphen
For example it want to search a word "soft-wa*"

I am getting no hits for that. It is said that if the hyphen is there in
the word, then we should include that word in the double quotes ("). But
enclosing the word in a double quotes (") means the exact word search.

How can I perform the like search on a word containing hyphen???????

Please help.

Regards,
Shakti Sareen
