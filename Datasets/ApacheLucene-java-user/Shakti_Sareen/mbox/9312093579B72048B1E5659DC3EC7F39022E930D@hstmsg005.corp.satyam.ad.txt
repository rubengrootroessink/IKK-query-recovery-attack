SUBJECT: how to increase the performance!!!
DATE: 26 Nov 2007

Hi all,

I am using Searching is taking a lot of time.

The size of the folder where I am keeping the index files is 160 MB
containing 3277 documents.

 

I am using... 

query = parser.parse("ANY");

hits = searcher.search(query);

 

How can I improve the performance of searching?

 

Regards
