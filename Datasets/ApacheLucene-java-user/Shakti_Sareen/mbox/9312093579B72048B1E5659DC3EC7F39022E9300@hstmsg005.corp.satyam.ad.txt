Hi 

 

I am facing problem in searching the word containing forward slash (/).

My index file contains more then one documents. 

On searching for the word "U/S" in the claims field I am getting hits.

But the word "U/S" is actually not there in the document.

 

Below is the code I am using for searching.

Analyzer analyzer = null;

                                analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();

                                IndexSearcher searcher = new
IndexSearcher(fIndexFolder.getAbsolutePath());

                                QueryParser parser = new
QueryParser("Claim",analyzer);

                                Query query = parser.parse("U/S");


                                Hits hits = searcher.search(query);

                                LOGGER.info("Hits of word U/S in claims
::::::::  " + hits.length());

                                for (int i = 0; i < hits.length(); i++)
{

                                                docum = hits.doc(i);

                                                LOGGER.info("file NUMBER
>>>>   " + docum.get("PatentNumber"));

                                }
