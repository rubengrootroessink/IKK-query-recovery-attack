Thanks for the advice.  I hadn't even noticed the Filter classes  
until very recently.  I really need to take the time to work  
methodically through LIA...

You know what, I was confusing Nutch and Lucene classes (as I've done  
before), in this case the IndexSearcher classes.  All I could find  
was the *Nutch* IndexSearcher's getExplanation() method, which I see  
sends toHtml() rather than toString() to its internal Lucene  
IndexSearcher.
