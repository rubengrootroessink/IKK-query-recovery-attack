Looking at the source, I see that Sort.INDEXORDER is simply an  
instance of Sort:

   public static final Sort INDEXORDER = new Sort(SortField.FIELD_DOC);

Haven't tried this myself, but you could create your own instance  
that uses a reverse sort:

   Sort reverseIndexOrder = new Sort(SortField.FIELD_DOC, true);

And use that wherever you were using Sort.INDEXORDER.
