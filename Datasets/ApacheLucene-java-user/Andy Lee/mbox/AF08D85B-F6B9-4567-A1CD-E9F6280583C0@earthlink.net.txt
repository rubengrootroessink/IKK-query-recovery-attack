Good to know, thanks.  I saw references to slop but didn't know what  
they meant.  I'll see if this is one way I could solve my problem.

Okay, I looked at the explanations and realized part of the problem  
was that I was applying a sort field to the search results, which I  
had forgotten.  So of course that affected the display order, duh.   
But I also do need to do some tuning, because I'm adding other stuff  
to the query that is also skewing the ranking.

It took me a while to figure out the differences between the  
searcher.explain() example in LIA and the latest changes to the API.   
It was a little annoying that I couldn't find a way to get plain text  
output -- it seems to be only HTML now.  Finally I wrote a  
convenience method that dumps the HTML to a file, which I view in a  
browser.

Thanks, Chris and Erik!
