OK... Hmmm. So then I should assume that, for more complete stemming,
there are no ready-made, easy-to-use dictionaries available under free
licenses? I guess I assumed that there would be, given the prevalence of
free software spelling checkers. Can't the data used by MySpell or the
likes be adapted? Or is it a very different sort of dictionary that
would be needed?

Thanks,
Andrew
