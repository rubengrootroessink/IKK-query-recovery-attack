Stephane,

Thank you for the ideas. I'm going about implenting idea 1 (I like the
idea of leaving the temp index around for recovery), but I have a
question reguarding your original index. Do you just copy over the
temp index and don't worry abou cleaning up the old index directory?

Right now I have my code deleting the files in the main index
directory after telling the search controller to switch to the temp
index. But by doing that, I need to manage existing searches and not
break them while they are running. I also still run into the open
files problem on Windows when trying to delete a file one of the
searchers has open before it's closed.

Thoughts?

Patrick
