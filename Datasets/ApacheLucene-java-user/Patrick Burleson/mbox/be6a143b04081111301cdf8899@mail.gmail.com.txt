SUBJECT: Searching without a specified field
DATE: 11 Aug 2004

I would like to build a search that takes a string and parses it, then
uses that string to search all fields available in the index. Is that
possible without building up a huge boolean query of all my fields? I
may not know the field names at runtime.

Thanks,
Patrick
