Ah, I see your problem. From the Lucene Javadocs on IndexSearcher.close():

"Note that the underlying IndexReader is not closed, if IndexSearcher
was constructed with IndexSearcher(IndexReader r). If the IndexReader
was supplied implicitly by specifying a directory, then the
IndexReader gets closed."

Since you are explicitly passing in an IndexReader, the IndexSearcher
is not closing it. But since you created the IndexReader without
retaining a reference to it, you can not close it, thus you will
always have an open index.

You have a couple of options:

Either retain a reference to IndexReader by doing the following:

IndexReader ir = IndexReader.open(indexName);
IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(ir);

or if indexName is just the path to the index, then just use:

IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexName);

since that will manage the IndexReader for you.

Hope that helps.
