Not sure how to specify which analyzer to use
when searching.  I could not find a search method
that would take an analyzer as an argument.  

Does Lucene remember which analyzer was used when it was indexed?

Thanks,
Randy

This is a lucene-user list question, so I'm moving it there.

You could lump them all in the same index and like you say switch to
appropriate analyzer when indexing and searching.

You could take a peek into Lucene Sandbox (link on Lucene site) and use
Snowball stemmers from there.  Figuring out which language is being
used for searching, or which subset of the index to search would be up
to you though.
