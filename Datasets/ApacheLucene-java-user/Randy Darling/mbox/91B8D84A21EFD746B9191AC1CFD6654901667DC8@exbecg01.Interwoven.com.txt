SUBJECT: Looking for someone to develop Thai Lucene Analyzer
DATE: 21 Jun 2005

Not sure if this is the appropriate forum to ask this.
 
We are currently looking for an implementation of a Lucene
Analyzer for the Thai language.
 
We are looking to pay a developer/consultant for a Thai Analyzer
implementation.
 
Thanks,
Randy
