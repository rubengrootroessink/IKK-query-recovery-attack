SUBJECT: Not able to search soufun.com site
DATE: 27 May 2003



We are not able to search the Chinese real estate site http://search.soufun.com

The search comes back with question marks in the "submit query" text field.
It does not seem to understand the query.

We are able to search other Chinese sites, such as www.sohu.com, but soufun.com
does not seem to understand our Chinese characters?

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Randy
