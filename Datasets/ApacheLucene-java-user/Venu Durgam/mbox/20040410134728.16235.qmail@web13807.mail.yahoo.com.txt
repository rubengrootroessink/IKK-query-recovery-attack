Erik,

Thanks for the poiner.
I am not sure how sort can filter out results.
sort will just sort the results right ?

lets say if i had below results 
http://www.b.com/1.html

http://www.a.com/1.html
http://www.b.com/2.html
http://www.a.com/2.html

if you sort by domain name, results might be
http://www.a.com/1.htmlhttp://www.a.com/2.html
http://www.b.com/1.html
http://www.b.com/2.html
 
If i want to have one result per domain. no sorting, just filtering out some results.
http://www.b.com/1.html

http://www.a.com/1.html

can this still be achieved using sort? If not any other ways of doing this ?

Thanks.

I have examples of this that I can post when I have more time, but a 
quick pointer... check out the overloaded IndexSearcher.search() 
methods which accept a Sort. You can do really really interesting 
slicing and dicing, I think, using it. Try this one on for size:

example.displayHits(allBooks,
new Sort(new SortField[]{
new SortField("category"),
SortField.FIELD_SCORE,
new SortField("pubmonth", SortField.INT, true)
}));

Be clever indexing the piece you want to group on - I think you may 
find this the solution you're looking for.

Erik
