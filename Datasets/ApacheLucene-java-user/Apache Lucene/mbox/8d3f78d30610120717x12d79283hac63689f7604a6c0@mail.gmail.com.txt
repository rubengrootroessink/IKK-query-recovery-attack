SUBJECT: IOException and index corruption
DATE: 12 Oct 2006

When I am adding a document to the lucene index if the method throws an
IOException and if I continue with adding other documents ignoring the
exception, will the index be corrupted? What happens to the fields which are
already written to the index?
