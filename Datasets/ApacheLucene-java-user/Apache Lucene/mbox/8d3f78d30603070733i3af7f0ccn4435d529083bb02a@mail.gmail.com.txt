SUBJECT: indexing problems
DATE: 7 Mar 2006

Hi,
       I am using Lucene 1.9.1 to index the files. The index writer created
the following files
(1) segment file "segments"
(2) deletable file "deletable"
(3) compound file "cfs"

None of the other files like term info, frequency..etc were created. Is
there something obvious, I am doing wrong?

thanks,
lucenator
