SUBJECT: Exact match with fuzzy query
DATE: 12 Jun 2010

Hi,

I am using lucene 3.0.1. I use a MultiFieldQueryParser with a 
GermanAnalyzer. In my index are some values among others one document 
with the title "bauer". I append to every word in my query a ~0.8 (here 
I am not sure if this is the way to do it). If I try to search now, I 
will not get the document with title "bauer" except I set the fuzzy 
value to very low values of about .3.
Do i have to perform two searches with and without the fuzzy parameter 
or can I do it somehow in one step like using "bauer~0.8 bauer" as query?
I saw that the parser cuts of the "er" if I am not using the fuzzy 
parameter. Can someone please tell my in a few words why? How can I do a 
fuzzy search which also finds exact matches?

Thanks,
Markus
