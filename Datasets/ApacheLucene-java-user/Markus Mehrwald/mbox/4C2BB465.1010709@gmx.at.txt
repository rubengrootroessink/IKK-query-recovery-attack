SUBJECT: Stopwords and Wildcards
DATE: 30 Jun 2010

Hi,

I use an AnalyzingQueryParser with the StandardAnalyzer and german 
stopwords in Lucene 3.0.1. If I have a query with a stopword followd by 
a wildcard (e. g. das*) I get a ParseException: Cannot build PrefixQuery 
with analyzer class org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer 
- token consumed.
Without the wildcard it works. I can remove the stopwords before 
building the query of course but then I and the analyzer have to search 
for the stop words what might be not the best solution in my eyes.
Is there any other way to get a proper result without writing code twice?

Thanks,
Markus
