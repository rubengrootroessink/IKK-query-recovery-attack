Incremental updates (additions and deletions) are possible, but I'm not 
sure if I understand your question. Lucene holds its own instances of 
documents structured in text fields (not going into details here). There 
lucene documents are created and updated programatically, not 
automatically because lucene does not keep tabs on external documents.

Very possible, before adding a document, you can check (with the judicious 
use of an id) if it has already been added. If it hasn't, do your 
notification, but this requires programming.

For concurrent write access, there is a lock, do you might want to use a 
singleton responsible for adding documents.
