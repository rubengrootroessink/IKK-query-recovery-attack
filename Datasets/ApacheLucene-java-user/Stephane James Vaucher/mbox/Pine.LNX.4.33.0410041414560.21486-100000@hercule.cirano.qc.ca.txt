SUBJECT: Re: BooleanQuery - Too Many Clases on date range.
DATE: 4 Oct 2004

I've used the simple message that the user's request was too vague and
that he should modify it. I haven't had too many complaints about this
especially when I explained why to a client:

If one user of many does a*, the whole system will grind to a halt as that
one request will use up all of the available memory (wildcards aren't very
scalable...).

Here is an example of a working system:
http://theserverside.com/search/search.tss

I don't know if many people complain that when they do a*, that no results
appear, but a request for javap* returns javapro, javaplus, javapolis...
