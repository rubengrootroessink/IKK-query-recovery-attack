I'm actually pretty lazy about index updates, and haven't had the need for 
efficiency, since my requirement is that new documents should be 
available on a next working day basis.

I reindex everything from scatch every night (400,000 docs) and store it 
in an timestamped index. When the reindexing is done, I alert a controller 
of the new active index. I keep a few versions of the index in case of 
a failure somewhere and I can always send a message to the controller to 
use an old index.

cheers,
sv
