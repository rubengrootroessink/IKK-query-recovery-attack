Hello lucene community,

I'll be presenting lucene at the GUJM (Java Users Group of Montreal), 
mid-April, could you send me references, articles, presentations not 
readily available on the lucene site (at 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/resources.html)?

Otis or Erik, I'll mention that you have written a book on lucene. When 
will it be out?

I'll also see if I can rearrange the wiki using the information you send 
me, and I'll contribute my presentation (in french).

cheers,
sv
