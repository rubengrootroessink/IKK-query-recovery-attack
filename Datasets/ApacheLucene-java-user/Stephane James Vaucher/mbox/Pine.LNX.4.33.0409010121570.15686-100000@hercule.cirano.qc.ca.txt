If all you need is to seach a field, you do not need to store it. If it is
not stored it can still be tokenised and analysed by lucene. It will then
be only stored as a set of token, but not as whole. You can thus use it
for fields that you never need to retrieve from the index.

For example:
the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

will be store in lucene only as tokens, not as a whole, so using a
whitespace analyser using a stopword list {the}:

You will have these tokens in lucene:
quick
brown
fox
jumped
over
dog

You will NOT be able to retrieve the original text, but you will be able
to search it.
