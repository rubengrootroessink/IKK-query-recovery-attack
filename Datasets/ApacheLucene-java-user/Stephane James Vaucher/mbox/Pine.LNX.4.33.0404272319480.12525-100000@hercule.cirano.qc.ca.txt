I suggest you look at:
http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/open-source-web-crawlers-java

>From what I know of nutch, it's meant as the basic for a competitor to the
big search engines (i.e. google). For a small web site, it might be
overkill especially if it requires you to build from CVS (unless there are
distributions).

Note:
I've got the book "Programming Spiders, Bots and Aggregators in Java", it
describes spiders using a project called: j-spider
http://sourceforge.net/projects/j-spider/
It could probably be adapted for your needs.
