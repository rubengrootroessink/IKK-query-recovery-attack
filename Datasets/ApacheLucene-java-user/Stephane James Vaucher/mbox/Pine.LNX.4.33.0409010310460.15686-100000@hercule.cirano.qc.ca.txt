Hi Niraj,

I'd rather respond to the list as others may be interested in your
questions, and since I don't consider myself a guru, I appreciate being
corrected.

For a title, I'd say yes, use the Field Text(String name, String value)
constructor. Not the others that use a reader as they do not store the
value.

You want for it to be:
1) tokenised (so to have its fragments saved for searching, not only the
totality of the text)
2) indexed so to make it searchable
3) store as to make the field retrievable from the index

hth,
sv
p.s. my name is Stephane, it's been a while since I've been in Oz
that I haven't been called James
