SUBJECT: Javadocs lucene 1.4
DATE: 29 Mar 2004

Are the javadocs available on the site?

I'd like to see the javadocs for lucene-1.4 (specifically SpanQuery)
somewhere on the lucene website. I've subscribed to the users mailing
list, but I've never got a feel for the new version. Is there any way
for this to happen, or should I await 1.4-rc1?

cheers,
sv
