IndexWriter.addIndexes()

What I mean is the following:

1) create tmp dir
2) redirect searchers to tmp dir
3) wait for everyone to use tmp dir (or other mecanism)
4) open indexwriter on master dir erasing it
5) merge tmp directory, using addIndexes() method
6) redirect searchers to new master dir

I used to reindex all my docs at 5h00AM, I probably could have waited 10 
minutes since I didn't have users, it's all about requirements ;)
