You can always submit requests for enhancements in bugzilla, so as to keep
track this issue.

Your usage seems pretty particular, why are you using the javacc
QueryParser?

It's configurable through sys properties or by
BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount(int maxClauseCount)

I can't help you here, and the doc seems rather thin (or nonexistent for
this class). I don't know the relation between the query and how the
scorer will process it.

Sorry I can't be of assistance,
