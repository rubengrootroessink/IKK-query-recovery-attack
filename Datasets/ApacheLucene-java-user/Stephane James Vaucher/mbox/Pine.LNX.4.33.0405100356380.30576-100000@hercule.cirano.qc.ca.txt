SUBJECT: Analysis of wildcard queries
DATE: 10 May 2004

I've seen this:
http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=538312

I've seen in the code that there is a method to set lowercasing, but I
need to remove accentuated chars as well. Any suggestions as to which is
preferable, preprocessing the input or subclassing a QueryParser and
redefining getWildcardQuery?

cheers,
sv
