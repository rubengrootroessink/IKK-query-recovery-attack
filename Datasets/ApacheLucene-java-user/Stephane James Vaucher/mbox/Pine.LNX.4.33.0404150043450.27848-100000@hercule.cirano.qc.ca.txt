SUBJECT: Presentation in Mtl
DATE: 15 Apr 2004

Hi everyone,

I did a presentation tonight in Montreal at a java users group metting.
I've got to say that they were maybe 4 companies present that use Lucene
and find it very useful and simple to use. It lead to the longuest
discussion (positive that is) I having at the users' group.

So I've got to tell the Lucene contributors GOOD JOB!

I'll probably upload my ppt presentation (heavily based on existing
tutorials) to the wiki, so you can comment it.

cheers,
sv
