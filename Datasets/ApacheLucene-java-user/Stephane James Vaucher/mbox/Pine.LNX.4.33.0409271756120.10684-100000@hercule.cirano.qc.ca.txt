Hi Tate,

I'd say you can use the german WordListLoader (renaming it or using a
nightly cvs version of the refactored class). I think there might be a
versionning issue here as from:

http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/Lucene2Whiteboard

It is mentionned that:
DONE: Move language-specific analyzers into separate downloads. Also move
analysis/de/WordlistLoader.java one level upwards, as it's not specific to
German at all.

That should be only applicable for lucene 1.9... Last version comment for
BrazilianAnalyzer:

"move the word list loader from analysis.de to analysis, as it is not
specific to German at all; update the references to it"

HTH,
