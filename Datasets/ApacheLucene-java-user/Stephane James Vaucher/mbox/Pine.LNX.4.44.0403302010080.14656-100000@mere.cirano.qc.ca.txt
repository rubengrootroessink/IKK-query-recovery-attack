SUBJECT: Re: Performance of hit highlighting and finding term positions for a specific document
DATE: 31 Mar 2004

I agree with you that a highlight package should be available directly 
from the lucene website. To offer this much-desired feature, having a 
dependency on a personal web site seems a little weird to me. It would 
also force the community to support this functionality, which would seem 
appropriate.
