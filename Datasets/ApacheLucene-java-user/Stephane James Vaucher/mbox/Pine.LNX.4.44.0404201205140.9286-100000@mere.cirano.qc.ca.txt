SUBJECT: Using Runtime.exec to extract text [Was: Bridge with OO]
DATE: 20 Apr 2004

In case you don't know. Using Runtime.exec() on windows, you need to 
consume the output streams of the application will block. This is not the 
case on linux.

In short:
Because some native platforms only provide limited buffer size for 
standard input and output streams, failure to promptly write the input 
stream or read the output stream of the subprocess may cause the 
subprocess to block, and even deadlock.
