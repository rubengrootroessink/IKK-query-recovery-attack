SUBJECT: Simple spider demo
DATE: 13 Apr 2004

I'm wondering if there is interest for a simple spider demo.

I've got an example of how to use HttpUnit to spider on a web site and 
have it index it on disk (only html page now). I can send it to the list 
if anyone is interested (it's one class, < 200 loc).

cheers,
sv
