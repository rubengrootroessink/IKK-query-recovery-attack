You should probably take a look at the javadoc:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/index.html

As for where to store the index, you'll want to put it somewhere where all
potential users can access it, as well as where there is enough space for
your index. In a nutshell, you need to think of:
- amount of storage required
- permissions (e.g. if you need to access it from a app server with
security restrictions)
- access, on a shared HD or not
- deployment, if for a product, then it should be included in your
installation strategy, so you might use c:/Program Files/.../MyApp/index,
or /usr/local/MyApp/index.

On win, I personnally use my D drive in a path corresponding
to d:/<app-name>/index.
