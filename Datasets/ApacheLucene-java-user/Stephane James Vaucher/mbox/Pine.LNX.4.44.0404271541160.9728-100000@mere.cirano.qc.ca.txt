When indexing, use UnIndexed fields to store this data in your document.

org.apache.lucene.document.Field#UnIndexed(String name, String value) 

Add the fields using:
org.apache.lucene.document.Document.add(Field)

After your search, you can get the field value from:
Document Hits.doc(int)

You can retrieve your store values using 
String Document.get(String name)
