SUBJECT: So many compiling errors in the 3.3 source release when added into Eclipse
DATE: 11 Jun 2011

Hi I added a Java project in Eclipse for the 3.3 src release, and find hundreds of compiling
errors. Most are the MockAnalyzer class are missing a few constructors.


Does anyone have the same experience? How has this incomplete version been released?


Thanks
