CL> Hi, Klaus, thanks.
 

 
CL> You can simply use DBSight to create the index. It's in Lucene's
 
CL> standard format.
 
CL> And you can control index field type, analyzers, how to select data
 
CL> from database, number of java threads, etc, just by web UI. No coding
 
CL> is needed. We have a user who didn't know Lucene at all, and have 3
 
CL> database searches up and running in one week.
 

 
CL> To index a huge index, say 1 million records, it may take 5 ~ 24 hours
 
CL> depends on the record size, computer size, etc. Actually most of the
 
CL> time is spent on JDBC pulling the data.
 

 
CL> Special warning: MySQL's JDBC driver has a bug leading to OutOfMemory
 
CL> if you do a select with lots of rows. You must download the latest
 
CL> JDBC(dev version) and use setFetchSize().
