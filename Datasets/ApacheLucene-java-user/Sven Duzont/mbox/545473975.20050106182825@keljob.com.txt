Hello,

Nice work, this mail is just to say that you already have a french concurrent ;)
www.keljob.com

For now, it's a sql server search engine, but we are planning to implement lucene in two or
three months.
Of course, we don't handle the same jobs volume (165,000 jobs vs
1,756,000) so it's reasonably  "fast",
Concerning the crawler, we use a proprietary robot made in C/C++, we
plan to move to a java & open src solution this year.
we already have a nice experience with lucene (with jakarta James)
implemented for a recruiter tool (emailed job applications management)
Also planning to implement it (maybe in association with Carrot²) in a
resume search engine.
Lot of work to be done this year so :)
