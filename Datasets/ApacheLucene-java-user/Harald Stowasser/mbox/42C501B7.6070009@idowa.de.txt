Hello lucene list readers.

We have decided to put my MySQL-Lucene-search-engine under the GPL.
Maybe you can use it:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mydbsearcher/

First implementation is running there:
http://www.idowa.de/ueberblick/suche/index_html (German Newspaper)

And it would be nice, if anyone want to aid me a little bit. Simply
because I don't have plenty of time. The next project is already in the
fledgling stages.

Thank you for reading,
  Harald.
