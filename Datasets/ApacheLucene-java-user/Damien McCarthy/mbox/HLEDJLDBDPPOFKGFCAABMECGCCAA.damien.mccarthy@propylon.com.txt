Hi Joe,

It would probably be cleaner to use a QueryFilter rather than doing the AND.
Take a look at
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_0_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/QueryFilter
.html

Also I'm not sure that using the sent to field will work - people may
receive email from a list, such as this, where their own email does not
appear in that field. They could also have email auto forwarded from another
address.

Anyway hope this helps ....

Damien

I hoped i havent to sanitize the user input cause the email address
query is ANDed by the
application, after the user finished his input.

(user_query) AND (email_query)

So is it possible to produce a user_query which will ignore the ANDed
(email_query)?
