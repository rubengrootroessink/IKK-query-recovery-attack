SUBJECT: how get ABC as hit for BC query ?
DATE: 21 Oct 2002

hi

my querystring is this: "BC" and i have an indexed itemstring like this:
"ABC"
but lucene doesen't return the ABC item as a hit for the "BC" search.

if i had an other indexed item like this "A BC DE", i would get it as hit
(because "BC" is space delimitered ?)

i've read about changing the queryparser grammar, but what i have to do
exactly with this file ?

thanks
