Hi Doug:
  I'll create a Jira account today and extract my code from the
lucene-2.0.0 tree.
  Then I'll upload to Jira to get more feedback.
  May be the first optimization for the TODO list will be replace the
insert/delete/update Data  Cartridge entry points for a new code which
put the modification in a queue to be processed with a new Sync method
regularly using an Oracle's DBMS_SCHEDULER or by the user's
application code.
  Best regards, Marcelo.
