Once again, LendingClub.com, a social lending network that today
announced nation-wide expansion (see Tech Crunch), is please to
contribute to the open source community a new release (2.2.0.2.0) of

and search using Lucene within the Oracle relational database. Many

Among the goodies you will find in the new release are:

.. where lcontains(..)>0 syntax.

* rounding and padding support for columns date, timestamp, mumber,
float, varchar2 and char
* ODCI API array DML support
* BLOB parameter support
* sort by column passed at
lcontains(col,query_parser_str,sort_str,corr_id) syntax
* Logging support using Java Util Logging package
* JUnit test suites emulating middle tier environment
* Support for rebuild and optimize online for SyncMode:OnLine index
* XMLDB Export which allows inspecting the Lucene index using Luke or
other tools
* AutoTuneMemory parameter for replacing MaxBufferedDocs parameter
* Functional column support
