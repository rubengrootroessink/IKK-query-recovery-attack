SUBJECT: Re: Full text searching on documents saved in database as BLOB
DATE: 1 Dec 2006

Hi Inderjeet:
  I am working in a full text searching implementation for Oracle
Databases running Lucene on the Oracle JVM.
  The text searching functionality is ready yet, you can get latest
code uploaded on Tuesday, see the attachment text for the detail of
the new functionality included:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-724?page=all
  Now, I am optimizing the Oracle Lucene Domain index, this new index
is implemented using Oracle Data Cartridge API and can be used as the
CTX_SYS.CONTEXT, including the SQL operators contains(column,'lucene
query string',correlation) and score(correlation) operators.
  The benefits of running Lucene inside the Oracle JVM is that all the
access to the data-sources which you index (now columns of type
VARCHAR2, CLOB, and XMLType) are locally, no network round trip, no
data marshalling and the cursors are in the same memory space.
  Also the Oracle JVM can be used as enterprise container for running
Lucene, because the Oracle JVM can be scaled up to thousand of
concurrent sessions.
   The Oracle OJVMDirectory classes replace the file system by BLOBs
as the storage for the  Lucene inverted index, so they inherits all
the benefits of the database storage such as full transactional
support, export and imports, recovery, auditing, and others.
   Best regards, Marcelo.
