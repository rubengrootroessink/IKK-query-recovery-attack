Hi:
   Could you try open the index using Luke but using the JDK bundled
with the Oracle DB?
   I mean, try to use Luke as an standalone application in the same
machine but outside the OJVM using the JDK at:
   $ORACLE_HOME/jdk
   which was used to compile most of the classes running inside the OJVM.
   Also you can drop me an email (not to the list because is quite off
topic) to help you how to debug an application inside the OJVM.
   I have experience writing the Lucene Domain Index for Oracle 11g
which is a Lucene 2.4.0 implementation running inside the OJVM but
replacing the file system store by BLOB store.

   Best regards, Marcelo.
