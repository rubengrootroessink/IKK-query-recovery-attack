  Yep, may be Mark can clarify the expected use cases for searching.
  But, the mixed mode can coexists.
  I am working on the Oracle/Lucene integration, so you can perfectly
store the content of the XML document in a relational table leaving
the DRECONTENT in a CLOB column and this column indexed with Lucene.
  Querying for /DOCUMENT/[DREREFERENCE=61926433] can be transformed by
the optimizer into a "select ... for ... where DREREFERENCE=61926433"
(using a btree implementation)
  and "find all documents where the DRECONTENT contains the words
"Action" " into
  select ... for where lcontains(DRECONTENT,'Action')>0
  The two world can coexists very well :)
