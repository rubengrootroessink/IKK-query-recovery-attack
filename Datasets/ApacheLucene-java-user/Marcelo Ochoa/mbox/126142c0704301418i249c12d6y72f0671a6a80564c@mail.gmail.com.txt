SUBJECT: Does someone have compared NFS versus OCFS2 in a Lucene grid installation?
DATE: 30 Apr 2007

Hi All:
  Does someone have compared NFS versus OCFS2 in a Lucene grid installation?
  The Oracle Cluster Filesystem 2 is shipped by default since linux
kernel 2.6.16-rc1+
   OCFS2 is a cluster optimized file system used by the Oracle RAC
configuration (http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2/).
   One of the possible installation is using dedicated hardware such
as NAS, but with a few RPMs file its possible to use a software for
the client and server iSCSI implementation
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iscsi).
   It means we can configure three machines as:
   m1: /dev/sda1 (local), /dev/sdb1 (local, exported via iscsi-target)
   m2: /dev/sda1 (local), /dev/sdb1 (remote, imported using iscsi)
   m3: /dev/sda1 (local), /dev/sdb1 (remote, imported using iscsi)
   The three server can mount /dev/sdb1 as /lucene-storage-area
directory and working on it as NFS.
   m1 can be used as Lucene for updating the index.
   m2 and m3 can be used as Lucene readers.
   We can configure three VMWare virtual machines with this scenario,
but we don't have a Lucene test suite configured as grid.
   Any help to configure the test suite will be useful!!!
   Best regards, Marcelo.
