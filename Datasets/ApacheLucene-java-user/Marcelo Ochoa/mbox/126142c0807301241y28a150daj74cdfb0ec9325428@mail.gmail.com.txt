SUBJECT: Re: Using lucene as a database... good idea or bad idea?
DATE: 30 Jul 2008

Hi John:
  Did you test/know Lucene Domain Index for Oracle database?
http://marceloochoa.blogspot.com/2007/09/running-lucene-inside-your-oracle-jvm.html
  If you are using Oracle 10g/11g is completed integrated in Oracle
memory space like Oracle Text but based in  Lucene.
  No network round trip is involved during indexing/querying time and
Lucene store is replaced by BLOB database storage.
  Also you can query your Oracle text store direct by SQL and two new
operators, lcontains and lscore based and Lucene and directly
integrated with the Oracle execution plan.
  Best regards, Marcelo.
