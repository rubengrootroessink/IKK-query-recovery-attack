Mike:
  If you work with Oracle databases you can take a look at Oracle
Lucene integration.
http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/10/lucene-oracle
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-724
  By using OJVMDirectory you have Lucene integrated at the Oracle
Engine as a new Domain Index, so you can use lcontains() and lscore()
operators inside your SQL queries.
  Best regards, Marcelo.
