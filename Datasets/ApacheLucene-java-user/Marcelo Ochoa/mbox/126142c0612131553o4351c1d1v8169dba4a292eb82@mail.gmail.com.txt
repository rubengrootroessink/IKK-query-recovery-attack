  I know that Lucene can manage more than 10 million documents
perfectly, but IMO the problem here is different, I think that the XML
showed on the example implied that searching a document by the xpath
/DOCUMENT/[DREREFERENCE=61926433] is like searching in a table by
primary key, not looking at the inverted index.

  Yes, you can build an inverted index for 10 million documents
perfectly, but the XML documents showed look like a simple relational
data.
