SUBJECT: Re: Performance of DbDirectory
DATE: 13 Jun 2007

Hi Simon:
   If you are using Oracle 10g you can get the advantage of using
Lucene inside the Oracle JVM.
   Look at this contribution:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-724
   The most important difference of this implementation in that all
the operation between Lucene to index table data and to store the
inverted index into a BLOB is that everything its made in the same
memory space!! no network roundtrip and data marshalling.
   You can check the difference in term of performance between
FSDirectory and OJVMDirectory simply by running all the Lucene test
suite inside the OJVM or outside.
   My test reports an slightly difference for using the BLOB Api
instead the FS API.
   The other import point in this implementation is the Domain Index
API, it means that all operations are synchronized by the Oracle
RDBMS, so update, insert and delete operations are automatically
handled and synchronized by the Domain Index.
   Best regards, Marcelo.
