SUBJECT: Re: JDBC access to a Lucene index
DATE: 19 Oct 2009

Hi Zukka:
   This is similar approach to Lucene Domain Index:
http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddgw7sjp_54fgj9kg
    But Lucene Domain Index is an specific implementation for Oracle
Databases 10g/11g which is integrated through the ODCI API and
replacing the Lucene file system storage by a BLOB storage.
    Basically you defines Index on table columns and then query Lucene
Index by using a new operator:
       lcontains(col,lucene-query,op)
    two new ancillary operators:
       lscore(op)
       lhighlight(op)
    and some pipeline functions which provides highlighting, facets, and so on.
    But isn't a new JDBC driver implementation, you query Lucene
Domain Index using default Oracle's JDBC drivers.
    Best regards, Marcelo.
