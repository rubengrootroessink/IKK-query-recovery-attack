Hi Mark:
  For 10 million records We recommend an strong database such as Oracle.
  You can annotate the Schema (.xsd) which describes your XML record
to store some field in traditional VARCHAR2 or NUMBER columns to query
it faster, and <DRECONTENT> in a CLOB column.
  You can find more information at:
http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/xml/xmldb/index.html
http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/oracle/05-mar/o25xmlex.html
  If you annotate the schema, you don't need to parse the XML records
with Digester to store into the Oracle database, you can simple insert
using an XMLType object, using Ftp or WebDAV.
  Best regards, Marcelo.
