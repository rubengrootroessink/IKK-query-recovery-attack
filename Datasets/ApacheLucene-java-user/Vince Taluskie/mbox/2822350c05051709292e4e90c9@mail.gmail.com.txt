SUBJECT: Re: Index Sizes
DATE: 17 May 2005

We're using a single dual-3Ghz Xeon box, Sun vx65 - indexes stored on Netapp 
nearstore R100. I think you can either try to investigate if there's a way 
your users will naturally group their searches and build indexes around that 
to minimize individual index size or prototype a distributed index search 
across enough processors to meet your service times. 

Hope that datapoint helps....
