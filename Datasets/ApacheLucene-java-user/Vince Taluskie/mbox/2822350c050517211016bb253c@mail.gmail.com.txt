Richard,

In an earlier note, I mentioned using an Netapp R100 for storage of our 
indexes and content - so I can say that Lucene definitely works accessing 
over NFS. I think this is more for updating/merging the same indexes across 
multiple systems simultaneously and once the indexes are there - I wouldn't 
think you'd have any issues with NFS per se. Just having them open for reads 
doesn't create any lockfiles...

I guess I would be curious if lucene itself creates filesystem lock files, 
where is the chance that other systems couldn't see them - the lockfile is 
after all a file in a network filesystem so I don't quite see the whole 
issue here.
