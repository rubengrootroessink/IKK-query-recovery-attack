  Hello LUCENE Gurus,

	I am very new user of lucene:)) I am building web portal, my all
date is in oracle tables, and web page is generated by servlets. In that
datebase I have one table(different articles) with 4 fields. I want in
search page, made with lucene, enter a date and to get all articles made on
that date. The problem is I dont know is it possible to make such kind of
indexing? If yes, could you give me guidelines how to make it? Thank you
very much.

with best regards
paulius
