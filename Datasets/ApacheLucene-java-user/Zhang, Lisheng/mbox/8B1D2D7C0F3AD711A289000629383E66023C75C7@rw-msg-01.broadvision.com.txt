You need to use Ant 1.6 to build lucene. The BUILD.txt does mention that.

Basic steps:
  0) Install JDK 1.2 (or greater), Ant 1.6 (or greater), and the Ant
     optional.jar
  1) Download Lucene from Apache and unpack it
  2) Connect to the top-level of your Lucene installation
  3) Install JavaCC (optional)
  4) Run ant

Hope this helps.
