SUBJECT: Possible bug in QueryParser when using CJKAnalyzer (lucene 2.4.1)
DATE: 2 Jun 2009

Hi,

When I use lucene 2.4.1 QueryParser with CJKAnalyzer, somehow
it always generates an extra space, for example, if the input is "ABC",
the query would be:

myfield"AB BC "  // should be myfield:"AB BC"

If I create PhraseQuery directly it does work. From Luke I know indexing
works OK. In lucene 1.4.3 we donot have this issue. I diffed CJKAnalyzer
code and it seems to be the same, so I guess it could be a QueryParser
bug?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
