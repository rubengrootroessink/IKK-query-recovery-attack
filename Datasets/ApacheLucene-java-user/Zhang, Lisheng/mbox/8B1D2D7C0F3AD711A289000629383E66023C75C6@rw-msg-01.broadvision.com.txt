SUBJECT: Build lucene1.4-rc3
DATE: 16 May 2004

Hi,

I tried to build lucene 1.4 -rc3 with ant 1.5.3 and java 1.4.1_02.

When I type "ant clean", I got an error message:

build.xml:11: Unexpected element "tstamp".

It seems like ant version problem, but BUILD.txt said ant 1.5
should be good enough ?

Also BUILD.txt mentioned on root directory we should have
default.properties, but I did not this file (possible OK, I did not
see this file is referenced inside build.xml).

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
