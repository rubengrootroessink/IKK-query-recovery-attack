SUBJECT: How to find most popular terms quickly?
DATE: 26 Feb 2008

Hi,

I have a very large amount of documents indexed, one field is Brand
(untokenized), now I need to find the most popular brand (which brand
is used by most Docs), one way is:

1) open IndexReader.
2) call terms() to get all terms, then filter out terms in field Brand.
3) call termDocs(Term) to get Docs having each special Brand.
4) count which term is used by most docs from above result.

Is this the most efficient way?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
