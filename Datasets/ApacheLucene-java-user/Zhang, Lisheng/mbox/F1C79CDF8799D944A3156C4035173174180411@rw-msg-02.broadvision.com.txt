SUBJECT: Sort in Lucene 1.4.3
DATE: 29 Apr 2007

Hi,

I encountered one problem in lucene 1.4.3: I called 

Searcher.search(<query>, new Sort("myfiled");

In "myfiled", most values looks like number "123456" or sth
similiar, but one field contains a value "Just a TRY", then
I got error:

java.lang.ClassCastException at
org.pache.lucene.search.FieldDocSortedHitQueue.lssThan
(FieldDocSortedHitQueue.java:129)

It seems that lucene judged this field as number so it 
cannot cast one particular value as String?

To me if client did not specify sorting field type, we should
treat it just as String?

Thanks very much for helps and best regards, Lisheng
