Hi,

In this case I guess we may need to find out what 
exactly BrazilianAnalyzer do on the input string:

BrazilianAnalyzer braAnalyser = new BrazilianAnalyzer();
TokenStream ts1 = braAnalyzer.tokenStream("text", new StringReader(queryStr));
... // what BrazilianAnalyzer do?

Also what exactly ISOLatin1AccentFilter can do:

WhiteSpaceAnalyzer wsAnalyzer = new wsAnalyzer();
TokenStream tmpts = wsAnalyzer.tokenStream("text", new StringReader(queryStr));
TokenStream ts2 = new ISOLatin1AccentFilter(tmpts);
.... // what ISOLatin1AccentFilter do?

to see what is wrong with ts1 and see if ts2 can 
do better job? I have never used ISOLatin1AccentFilter
before, I am not sure if the way to test it is really
OK, here I merely suggest a way to test.

Best regards, Lisheng

Yes...here's how I create my QueryParser:

QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("text", new BrazilianAnalyzer());
