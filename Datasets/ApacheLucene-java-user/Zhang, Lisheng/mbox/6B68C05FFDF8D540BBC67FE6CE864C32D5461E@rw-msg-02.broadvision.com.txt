SUBJECT: Lucene 1.4.3  QueryParser cannot parse "great!" ?
DATE: 9 Jun 2005

Hi,

We are using lucene 1.4.3, we indexed a string

Company picnic is great!

by IndexWriter created with StandardAnalyzer, into
a field called "all". I also confirmed StandardAnalyzer 
processed my input string as tokens:

company
picnic
great

as I expected.

But when I try to create Query by QueryParser 

Query q = QueryParser.parse("great!", "all", new StandardAnalyzer());

I got the ParseException:

##########################
Encountered "<EOF>" at line 1, column 7.
Was expecting one of:
    "(" ...
    <QUOTED> ...
    <TERM> ...
    <PREFIXTERM> ...
    <WILDTERM> ...
    "[" ...
    "{" ...
    <NUMBER> ...
#########################

Surely if I use "great" or some other special symbols
at the end like "great-" or "great+", QueryParser is OK.

I would expect QueryParser can process "great!" to take
away "!" so this query is the same as "great"? Is this behavior 
expected or is a bug?

Thanks very much for helps,
