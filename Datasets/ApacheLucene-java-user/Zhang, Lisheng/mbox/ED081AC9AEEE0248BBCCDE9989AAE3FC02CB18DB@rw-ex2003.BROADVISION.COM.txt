SUBJECT: outlook MSG file text extraction tool?
DATE: 4 Feb 2011


Hi,

Do you know any good open source tool to extract text from MS outlook MSG
files?

1) Apache Tika seems not to support *.msg yet.

2) Apache POI recently started to support *.msg (3.7 10/2010), but I run into
   several problems (cannot process Japanese well, null pointer exception ..)?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
