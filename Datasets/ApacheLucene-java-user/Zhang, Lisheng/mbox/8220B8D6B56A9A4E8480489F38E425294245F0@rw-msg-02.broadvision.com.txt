Hi Derek,

My guessing is that ":" is special, QueryParser
may regard ":" as for qualifying a field, we may
need to escape this special symbol as:

"GM\:Systems"

as query string.

You can use Luke to see what got indexed.  This will tell you what the
Analyzer did.
You can then use QueryParser from the command line (it's got a main
method), give it your input, and see what it returns.  This will tell
you what QueryParser+Analyzer did.  Oh, you use MFQP.  It may have a
main method, too, I'd have to check... To simplify, try getting it
working with the regular QueryParser first.
