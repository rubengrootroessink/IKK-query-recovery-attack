SUBJECT: Can PDFBox or POI handle multi-byte characters with different enc	odings?
DATE: 10 Feb 2006

Hi,

Currently we are using PDFBox to process PDF files and
POI to process DOC/XLS files, before send strings to lucene
for indexing,

Does any one know if PDFBox or POI can process multi-
byte characters like Japanese with various encodings (whatever
specified in PDF or DOC)?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
