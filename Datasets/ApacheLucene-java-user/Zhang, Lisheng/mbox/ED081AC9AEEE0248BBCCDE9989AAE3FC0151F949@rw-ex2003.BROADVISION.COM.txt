SUBJECT: Lucene 1.4.3: Error when creating Searcher
DATE: 8 Apr 2009

Hi,

We are using lucene 1.4.3, sometimes when two threads try to search,
one thread got error when creating MultiSearcher:

Lock obtain timed out: Lock@/tmp/lucene-ba94511756a2670adeac03a50532c63c-commit.lock

I read lucene FAQ and searched previous discussions, it seems that this
error should be related to indexing, but we are only creating Searcher? 

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
