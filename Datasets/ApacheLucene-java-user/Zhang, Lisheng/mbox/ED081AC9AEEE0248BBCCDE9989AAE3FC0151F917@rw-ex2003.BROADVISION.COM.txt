SUBJECT: Encoding detection free software?
DATE: 27 Mar 2009

Hi,

What's the best free tool for encoding detection? For example we have
a ASCII file README.txt, which needs to be indexed, but we need to
know its encoding before we can convert it to Java String.

I saw some free tools on the market, but have no experiences with any
of them yet? What is the best choice according to your suggestion?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
