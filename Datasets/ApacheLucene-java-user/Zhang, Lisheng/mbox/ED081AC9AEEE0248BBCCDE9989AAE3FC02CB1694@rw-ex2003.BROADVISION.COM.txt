SUBJECT: In lucene 2.3.2, needs to stop optimization?
DATE: 24 Sep 2010

Hi,

We are using lucene 2.3.2, now we need to index each document as
fast as possible, so user can almost immediately search it. 

So I am considering stop IndexWriter optimization during real time, 
then in relatively off-time like late night we may call IndexWriter optimize
method explicitly once.

What is the most efficient way to completely turn off IndexWriter merge
in lucene 2.3.2?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
