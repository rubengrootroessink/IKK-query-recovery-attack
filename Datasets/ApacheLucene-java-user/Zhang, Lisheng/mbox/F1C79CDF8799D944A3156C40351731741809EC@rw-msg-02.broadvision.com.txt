Hi,

In case you donot want to toss away any stop words and even
preserve case, WhiteSpaceAnalyzer can be used, also using
WhiteSpaceTokenizer would serve as a test (but need to reindex 
whole data set first), to make sure there is no other problems.

Best regards, Lisheng

You could write a custom analyzer that drops stopwords but adds an extra 1
to the "positionIncrement" property for the next valid Token after each
omiited stop word.

This would retain the benefit of removing stopwords from your index and yet
prevent your example phrases matching (because the remaining words are not
recorded as being directly next to each other)

Cheers
Mark

Yes... If my query phrase is "Health Safety", docs with "Health and
 Safety",
"Health or Safety" are being returned...

So... Is there any other way to handle this situation... Especially in
 the
above mentioned case, the user is expecting around 5 records and the
 query
is fetching more than 550 records.8-O

Thanks.
