SUBJECT: How to handle more than Integer.MAX_VALUE documents?
DATE: 1 Nov 2010


Hi,

Now lucene uses integer as document id, so it means we cannot have more
than 2^31-1 documents within one collection? Even if we use MultiSearcher
the document id is still integer so it seems this is still a problem?

We have been using lucene for some time and our document count is growing
rather rapidly, maybe this is a much-discussed issue already, but I did not
find the lead, any pointer would be really appreciated.

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
