Hi,

Simplest way is to add one condition (assuming field is f1):

f1:notebook f1:"note book"

which means (notebook OR "note book"), 2nd condition is phrase
search.

Best regards, Lisheng

Hi,
I'm new to Lucene and I'm trying to do some stuff with Lucene but I have
some problems.

I have some documents, in which some contain the word notebook written
separated,  e.g. "some dummy words note book other dummy words". And I'd
like that when I search notebook, these documents could be found and I'd
like to do it for a general case, like trying to search the words joining
the word before or after.

How could I do that? Is there an analyzer which tokenize like that?

Thank you


Alex
