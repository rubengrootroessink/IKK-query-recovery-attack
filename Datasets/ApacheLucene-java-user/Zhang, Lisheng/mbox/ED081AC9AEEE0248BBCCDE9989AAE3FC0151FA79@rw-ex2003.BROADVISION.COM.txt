Hi,

I did not see method setConstantScoreRewrite method
in RangeQuery class?

Best regards, Lisheng

Hmm... that's actually not true: RangeQuery will still throw that
exception, unless you call setConstantScoreRewrite to true (at which
point it does the same thing as ConstantScoreRangeQuery, ie that
exception will not be thrown).

The javadoc for RangeQuery is very misleading.  (This happened when we
absorbed ConstantScoreRangeQuery into RangeQuery, for 2.4).

I'll fix RangeQuery's javadoc.
