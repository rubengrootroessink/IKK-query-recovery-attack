Hi,

Very sorry I made a typo, what I meant to say is that lucene sort produced wrong
result in English names (String ASC):

liu yu
l yy

(previously I put other way round), and the problem is in java Collator which lucene
is using (I can produce bug by sample code below).

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng

Hi,

Today I have noticed that sometimes lucene sort produced strange result in plain
English names, like (String ASC)

l yy
liu yu

I traced to lucene source code, it seems to be a java English Collator problem (I 
set Locale.English to SortField), below I reproduced issue by a trivial code (pure
java):

/////
import java.util.Locale;
import java.text.Collator;

public class T1 {
  static public void main(String[] argv) {

    String s1 = "l yy";
    String s2 = "liu yu";

    //s1 = "l";
    //s2 = "liu";

    Collator col1 = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);
    System.out.println("COLL_RES  =" + col1.compare(s1, s2));
    System.out.println("STRI_RES  =" + s1.compareTo(s2));
  }
}
/////

The result is:

COLL_RES  =1
STRI_RES  =-73

I tested different java versions and get same result, maybe I missed sth trivial, but
above test is really simple?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
