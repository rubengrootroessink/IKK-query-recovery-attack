Hi,

Does anyone know a good tool to processing MS Power Point
file (*.ppt) into plain text so we can use lucene to index it?

I looked at jakarta/POI, and only see Word and Excel documents
can be processed, some JavaDoc pages mentioned ppt, but
status is not clear to me?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
