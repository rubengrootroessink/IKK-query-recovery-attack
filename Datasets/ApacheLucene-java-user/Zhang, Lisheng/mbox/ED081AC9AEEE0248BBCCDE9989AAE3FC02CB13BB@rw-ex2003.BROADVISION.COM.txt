Hi,

In that case, I would do:

1) if I can somehow know the input words (like foo, nacho, ...), I will create
   lucene BooleanQuery myself, that's the case in my application.

2) if I have to accept whole input string with all logic (AND, OR, ..) inside,
   I think it is easier to change TermQuery afterwards than parsing the string,
   since final result from query parser should be BooleanQuery (in your example), 
   then we iterate through each BooleanClause, if the clause is still BooleanQuery, 
   recursively go deep, if TermQuery, we may try to convert to WildCardQuery?

   I have not done that myself before, but feel it should work.

Best regards, Lisheng

What about a more complex query string like: (foo OR nacho) AND ("bar baz") OR cheese~1.2.
If I feed this to the MultiFieldQueryParser can I change the TermQueries afterward? Or am
I going to have write some code to modify the original string?

Thanks for your response,
