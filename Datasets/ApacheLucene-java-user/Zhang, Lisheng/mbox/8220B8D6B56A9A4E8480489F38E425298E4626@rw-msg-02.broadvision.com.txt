SUBJECT: Abnormal behavior in QueryParser
DATE: 8 Oct 2005

Hi,

We recently encountered a strange behavior in
lucene v1.4.3 QueryParser: we call

 QueryParser.parse("-1", "myidfield", new StandardAnalyzer());

and get retured query as:

 -myidfield:1  // apparently we want "myidfield:-1"

Currently we can use TermQuery to avoid QueryParser
to bypass this problem, but still we would like to know
if this is a known problem or already fixed in later version?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
