Hi,
 
I think using Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED means ignoring StandardAnalyzer, so we
index "sql. server" as one word. You may use luke to see how this field is indexed.
 
In this case we can only search whole term (without case change even), if using the
StandardAnalyzer to analyze "sql. server" we should not get result?
 
Best regards, Lisheng

Hi,

I am using SpanQuery and SpanNearQuery to get phrase query like "Sql Server".

In my text file in which I am searching, it is present like (sql. server) mean 'sql dot server'
 which is not a span like "Sql Server".

While searching for phrase query "Sql Server". It gives result for (sql. server) which is
not correct.

I am using StandardAnalyzer on both side while creating index or searching on files. While
creating index Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED  is used.

 

Please, give your suggestion !!!

 

 

Thanks & Regards,
