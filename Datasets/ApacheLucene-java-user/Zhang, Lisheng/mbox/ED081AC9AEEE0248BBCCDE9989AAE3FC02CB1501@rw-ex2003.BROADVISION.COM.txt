SUBJECT: Could multiple indexers change same collections at the same time?
DATE: 24 Jun 2010

Hi,

I remembered I tested earlier lucene 1.4 and 2.4, and found the following:

# it is OK for multiple searchers to search the same collection.

# it is OK for one IndexerWriter to edit and multiple searchers to search 
   at the same time.

# it is generally NOT OK for multiple IndexerWriter to change same collection
   at the same time.

Could you confirm briefly if above are true and give me Yes/No answer whether
in latest lucene 3x above conclusions are still OK?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
