Hi Pavel,

I have not done this build, I sent last message based on my
experiences using ant on other projects, maybe people who 
worked on maven artifacts could help?

Best regards, Lisheng

Hi,

I don't know. I tried to setup somethind like this:
 <property name="project.artifactId" value="lucene"/>

But error is the same. Maybe there are any other parameters?
