DATE: 8 Apr 2009

Hi,

Sorry that my initial message is not clear, I read lucene source code (both 1.4.3 
and 2.4.0), and understood more.

The problem is that when using lucene 1.4.3 sometimes when searching, we got
the error:

Lock obtain timed out: Lock@/tmp/lucene-ba94511756a2670adeac03a50532c63c-commit.lock

It seems that in 2.4.0 we will never have this issue because this error can only 
happen when concurrent writing.

Is this true?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
