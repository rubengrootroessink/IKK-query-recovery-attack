SUBJECT: How to avoid score calculation completely?
DATE: 23 May 2007

Hi,

We have been using lucene for years and it serves us well.

Sometimes when we issue a query, we only what to know
how many hits it leads, not want any docs back. Is it possible
to completely avoid score calculation to get total count back?

I understand score calculation needs a loop for all matched 
docs, can we avoid the loop, surely this is for performance. We
want to achieve getting total count at O(1), independent of the
number of Docs?

Thanks very much for helps, Lisheng
