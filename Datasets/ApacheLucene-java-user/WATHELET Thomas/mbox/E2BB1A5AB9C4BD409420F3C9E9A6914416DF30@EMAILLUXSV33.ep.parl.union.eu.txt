I'm using Lucene core 2.2.0
The field i'm trying to sort is not presente in each documents into the
index. I add the field only if I have a metadata for it
Maybee it's the problem?
My field is untokenized store and indexed.

Any other info or code snippets? I sort on multisearchers all the time 
and have never seen that behavior.
