It's not possible to change lockDir because it's a final static
varriables?
Is it possible to change the lockDir?

Yes, there is.

You can call the static FSDirectory.setDisabledLocks() to disable 
locking entirely.  But you need to be certain this is safe for your 
application.  Lucene uses this lock to ensure the index does not become 
corrupt when IndexReaders and IndexWriters are working on the same
index.

Or, if you want to change which directory the lock file is stored in you

can set this Java property:

    org.apache.lucene.lockDir
