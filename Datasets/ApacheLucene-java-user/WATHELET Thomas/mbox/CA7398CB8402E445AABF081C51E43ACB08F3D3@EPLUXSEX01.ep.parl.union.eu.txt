Ok it's faster (maybee 4 times less) with RAMDirectory  and with a
MaxBufferedDocs to 10000 and a MergeFactor to 1000 and JVM heap to 1024.
Thanks

increase the mergeFactor (how much depends on what the limit of open
file descriptors is on your machine)
increase maxBufferedDocs (how much depend son how much RAM you've got
and how big is your JVM heap)

I covered this in a Lucene article on onjava.com in 2003, I think.

How could I optimize my index creation?
        // setUseCompoundFile(?);
        // setMaxBufferedDocs(?);
        // setMergeFactor(?);
 
How could I reduce the disk access because I work with more than 1000000
documents?
Thanks
