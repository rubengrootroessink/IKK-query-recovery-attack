SUBJECT: RamDirectory vs IndexWriter
DATE: 28 Feb 2007

I don't really understand the difference between using the ramDirectory
and using IndexWriter.

What's the difference between using ramDirectory instead of using
IndexWriter with those properties set to:
setMergeFactor(1000);setMaxMergeDocs(10000);setMaxBufferedDocs(10000);
