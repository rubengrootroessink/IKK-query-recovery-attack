Are you using Lucene 1.4.3 ?

There's a bug report in JIRA (LUCENE-481) with a patch that solves this.

On Windows, files cannot be deleted while they are open and before the
patch, calling getCurrent or isCurrent in one process could block
another one from updating the segments file.

The patch in integrated in the current version(s) of Lucene for a few
months now...

Hi Thomas

I have been getting similar errors and am trying to investigate the
cause.
My current thinking is that it is caused by my virus checker opening
the files.  The error only occurs on Windows.  When I run the same
test on Linux I do not get the error.
Not much help I know... but at least you are not alone.

Patrick
