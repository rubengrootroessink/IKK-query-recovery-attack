I have an index with this field:
stored/uncompressed,indexed,tokenized<docnumber:SEC(2006) 0350>.
I'm using LukeAll to query myIndex and when I try to search in the
docnumber field with this query COM\(2005\) 0123 in the query detail
panel I retrive this: docnumber:sec ()
Do you know LukeAll?

Your question is not clear.  But I'm always happy to lend a hand...

Try the query:
	COM\(2005\) 0123

Parentheses are special characters with Lucene's QueryParser, so  
escaping them with a backslash is needed.

But also be aware of the analyzer setting and the parsed query Luke  
displays.  Your question brings up a whole slew of Lucene  
Troubleshooting 101 steps:

   * What exactly are you trying to find?
   * How was it indexed?
      - What analyzer(s), what field types
   * What are your users interacting with to search the index?   
(probably not Luke, right?)
   * How will the users interface build the queries issued?
