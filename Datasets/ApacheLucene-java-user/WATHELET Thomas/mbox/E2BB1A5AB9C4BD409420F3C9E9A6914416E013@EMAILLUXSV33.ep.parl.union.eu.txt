DATE: 30 Apr 2008

Hello,
How can I procced to to find an exact string match in lucene with somes
articles in my search query.
For exemple: if I search for "a ball" I just want results with a ball
and not "the ball" incled in the result?
Is it possible to have a blank stop word list?
I have to set something special to my search query?
I need help...
Thanks in advence.
