DATE: 11 Jul 2006

I have an index with this field:
stored/uncompressed,indexed,tokenized<docnumber:SEC(2006) 0350>.
I'm using RangeQuery to query the index:	TermQuery termQuery =
new TermQuery(new Term("docnumber", "SEC(2006) 0350"));
	
combinedQueries.add(termQuery, MUST);

The query that I send is:
SEC(2006) 0350

The resulting query that Lucene produces : 
+docnumber:SEC\(2006\) 0350

I'm using the class simpleanalyser for the search.

And I have no result but this data SEC(2006) 0350 is present in the
index "docnumber field"

Thank's in advence

Thomas

Could you provide a bit more information? What's important or not about
this
query? And how does that import relate to what you've indexed?

In other words, what do you *want* it to mean?

Best
Erick
