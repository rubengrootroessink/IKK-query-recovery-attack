	If by "the same time" you mean "in one session", or something like
	that, then yes, IndexModifier will help.
	
	But if you mean from multiple threads, you'll have to do a fair
	amount more work to keep them synchronized. IndexModifier won't work
	in multithreaded scenario, at least as far as I can tell.
