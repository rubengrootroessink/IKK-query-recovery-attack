SUBJECT: Sorting with MultiSearcher
DATE: 8 Nov 2007

Hi,
I have few Indexes with the same structure.
I'm using MultiSearcher to search into those indexes and when I try to
sort the result by field the result is sort by field and by index (we
have all results from index1 and then index2,...) but I would like to
have the result sorted on the all resultset
Is it possible?
Piece of code i'm using to do it:
Sort sort = new Sort(new SortField(field, SortField.STRING,
orderDirect));

MultiSearcher search=...

Hits hit = searcher.search(query, sort);

Thanks in advence.
