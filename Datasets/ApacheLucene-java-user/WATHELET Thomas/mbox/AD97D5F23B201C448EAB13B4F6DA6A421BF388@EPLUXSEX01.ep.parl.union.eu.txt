This just came up the other day as well, and was covered in the  
past.  Here's the thread with the answer:

	<http://www.nabble.com/Determine-the-index-of-a-hit-after-using-

MultiSearcher-t638218.html#a1706027>

And here are the relevant snippets:

        MultiSearcher searcher = (MultiSearcher) context.getAttribute 
("searcher");
        IndexReader[] readers = (IndexReader[]) context.getAttribute 
("readers");

        Hits hits = searcher.search(query);


// later while iterating through Hits...

       int indexIndex = searcher.subSearcher(hits.id(position));
