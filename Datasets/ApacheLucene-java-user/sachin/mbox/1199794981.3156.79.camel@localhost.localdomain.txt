SUBJECT: Self Join Query
DATE: 8 Jan 2008


I need to write lucene query something similar to SQL self joins. 

My current implementation is very primitive. I fire first query, get the
results, based on the result of first query I fire second query and then
merge the results from both the queries. The whole processing is very
expensive. Doing this is very easy with SQL query as we need to just
write self join query and database do the rest for you.

What is the best way of implementing the above functionality in lucene?

Regards
Sachin
