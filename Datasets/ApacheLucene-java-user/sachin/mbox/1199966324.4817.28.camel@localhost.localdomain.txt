Here are more details about my issue.

I have two tables in database. A row in table 1 can have multiple rows
associated with it in table 2. It is a one to many mapping. 
Let's say a row in table 1 is A and it has multiple rows B1, B2 and B3
associated with it in table 2. I need to search on both A and B types
and the result should have A and all the Bs associated with it. Also for
your information, A and Bs are long text in database. 

I could have two approaches for indexing/searching

First approach is to create the index in denormalized form. In this case
document would be like A, B1, B2, B3. The issue with this approach is
that any modification to any row would require me to re-index the
document again and fetch A and all Bs again from database. This is a
heavy process.

The other approach is to index A, B1, B2 and B3 in different documents
and after search merge the results. This makes my re-indexing lighter
but I need to put extra logic to merge the results. For this type of
index I would require self join kind of query from lucene. Query can be
written by using boolean query but merging of two type of documents is a
issue. If I go by this approach for indexing, what is the best way to
fetch the results?

I hope I have made myself clear. 

Thanks
Sachin
