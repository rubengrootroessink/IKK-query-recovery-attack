SUBJECT: Illegal seek error
DATE: 18 Nov 2003

Hi,

Occasionally I get an "Illegal seek" error while loading a document into lucene.
I am new to lucene so I am not sure what to look for. Does any one have an idea of 
what may cause this error. Can lucene handle multiple user inserting documents at
the same time or do I need to implement a locking mechanism?

I am using lucene-1.3-rc1 with java 1.4.2 on SunOS 5.8.

Thanks,
Dan
