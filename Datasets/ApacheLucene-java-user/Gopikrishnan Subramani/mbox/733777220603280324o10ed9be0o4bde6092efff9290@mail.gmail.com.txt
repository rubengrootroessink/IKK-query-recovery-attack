SUBJECT: API for setting lock directory
DATE: 28 Mar 2006

Hello,

With Lucene 1.4.3 I used to use a different lock directory from the default
by setting org.apache.lucene.lockdir system property. But as per
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/systemproperties.html this is not
supported in Lucene 1.9 and above. I don't see any equivalent API for
lockDir property though in Lucene 1.9.1. Does anyone know if using this
system property is still supported?

Thanks,
Gopi
