SUBJECT: Indexing Names in Lucene -- Thomas = Tom, etc
DATE: 3 Dec 2008

Hello,  I am indexing documents with a field that contains the first and
last name of people. It is working wonderfully with a slight issue: if
Thomas is indexed for a document, I would like searches for Tom to match
that document. I am sure this is a common problem that many of you must have
addressed, but I was unable to find anything in the archives or on Google.
Thanks in advance for the guidance.


Regards,
