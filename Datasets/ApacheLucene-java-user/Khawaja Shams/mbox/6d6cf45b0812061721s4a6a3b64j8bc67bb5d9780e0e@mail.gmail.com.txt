SUBJECT: Re: Sorting documents without a query
DATE: 7 Dec 2008

Hi Shivaraj,   I would recommend John's approach and let Lucene deal with
the sorting.


Nonetheless, you can traverse through the terms by using the following
method:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#terms(org.apache.lucene.index.Term)

Basically, you should pass in a term with your price field name and an empty
string for the value. You would traverse the enumeration until you hit a
Term with a different field name. You can get the documents with the term by
using:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#termDocs(org.apache.lucene.index.Term)



Hope that helps.

Khawaja
