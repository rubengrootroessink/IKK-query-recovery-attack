Yeah, I was worried because all the documentation I read didn't tell me
how to control when the servlet is loaded and when it's unloaded. So I
thought that, since I had no control, maybe the server would reload the
servlet more times than it should. But experimenting with tomcat5.5
revealed that it's not really common for the servlet to be reloaded.

I was a bit to worried about the costs of opening more than one
IndexSearcher at the same time and reopening it a few times (I only
reindex stuff once per semester). Now I realise that I was being too
worried about that, you just shouldn't reopen IndexSearcher too often,
but it's completely fine to reopen it every now and then. I was just
being paranoid :-P.
