SUBJECT: Benchmarking my indexer
DATE: 1 Nov 2008

Hello,

I did an indexer that parses some files and indexes them using lucene. I
want to benchmark the whole thing, so I'd like to count the tokens
being indexed so I can calculate the average number of indexed tokens
per second. Is there a way to count the number of tokens on a document?
While I'm at it, I will also need to calculate the amount of memory my
java program used (peak, avg, etc), what java tool would you suggest me
to figure that out?
