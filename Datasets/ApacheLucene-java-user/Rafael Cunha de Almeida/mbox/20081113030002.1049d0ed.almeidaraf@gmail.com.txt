SUBJECT: Using AND with MultiFieldQueryParser
DATE: 13 Nov 2008

Hello,

I used an Analyzer which removes stopwords when indexing, then I wanted
to do an AND search using MultiFieldQueryParser. So I did this:
	word1 AND stopword AND word2
I thought the stopword would be ignored by the searcher (I use the same
Analyzer to index and search). But instead, I get no results whenever I
have a stopword like that. If I remove the stopword, giving me:
	word1 AND word2
then the search is sucessful. Is that the expected behaviour? Am I
doing something wrong?
