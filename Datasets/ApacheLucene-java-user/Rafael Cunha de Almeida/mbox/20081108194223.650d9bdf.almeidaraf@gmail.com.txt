My case is more or less similar, but I don't have that many fields. I
have been using MultiQueryFieldParser and then Highlighter to figure
out which fields have a match and then I get the relevant fragment with
the right term highlighter.

I have a question for you, though. Are you parsing the XML for each
document after you get the results of a query or are you using stored
fields? What XML parser are you using?
