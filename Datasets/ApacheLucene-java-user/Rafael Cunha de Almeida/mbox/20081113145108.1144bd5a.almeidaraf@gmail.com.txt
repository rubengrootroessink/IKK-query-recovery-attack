I wanted MultiFieldQueryParser to ignore any stopword the user may type
in. In that particular case I'd like the result to be word1 AND word2. I
thought that was what would happen because I pass the Analyzer to
MultiFieldQueryParser, so I expected the parser to ignore stopwords for
fields which the analyzer drops stopwords (I use PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper
analyzer).
