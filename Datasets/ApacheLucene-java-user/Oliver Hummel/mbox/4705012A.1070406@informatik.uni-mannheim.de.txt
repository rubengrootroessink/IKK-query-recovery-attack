SUBJECT: RegexQuery on multiple fields?
DATE: 4 Oct 2007

Hi,

I've recently tried the RegexQuery with Lucene which works fine with the
following code snippet:

  Hits hits;
  String q = "someregex";
  Term t = new Term("content", q);
  Query query = new RegexQuery(t);
  hits = searcher.search(query);

However, I wonder whether it is possible to use a QueryParser together with the
RegexQuery to determine the field to be searched on dynamically?

I wasn't able to find a solution in the API. Anybody knows one? Or is this not
possible?

Thanks in advance!

  Oliver
