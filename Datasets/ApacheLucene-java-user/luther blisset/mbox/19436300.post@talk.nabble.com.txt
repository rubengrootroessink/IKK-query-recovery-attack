SUBJECT: Re: Searching substring starting at a fixed position
DATE: 11 Sep 2008


Really thanks Karsten and Ian Lea!!
You gave me a very useful solutions
I'm going to try the last one of Karsten:

Because you easly can use lucene with 1 field and 365 different tokens
(20080101, 20080102, ...20081231).

even if the solution of Ian Lea seems to be a very good one and I'll try it
too.
Thanks a lot!I really appreciate your help
