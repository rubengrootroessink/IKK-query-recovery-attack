SUBJECT: searching for c++, c#, etc...
DATE: 15 Jul 2009

Hello,
I'm trying to search for the terms like c++ but the parser is stripping off the ++.  I tried
escaping the ++ with slashes but it's still stripping it off.  I could replace + with "plus",
is that the best way to do it?  How come escaping isn't working?
thanks
Sincerely,
Chris Salem
