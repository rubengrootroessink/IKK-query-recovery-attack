I figured "c++." would be a problem.  Here's what I did to get around it:
value.toLowerCase().replaceAll("\\.( ?\t?\n?\r?)+", " ")
I'm not escaping +'s from the query so I should be good there.
thanks alot.

If you escape the character + or #, the sentence:
"I know java + c++" would not skip +, furthermore, it breaks query parsing,
where + is reserved.
