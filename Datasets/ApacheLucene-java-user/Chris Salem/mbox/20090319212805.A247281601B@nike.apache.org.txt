sure.  the method that does the reopening of the index is synchronized.  it would be possible
for in-flight searches to be using the reader, but that wasn't the problem since I was the
only one testing it.  here's the full exception that was thrown:
org.apache.lucene.store.AlreadyClosedException: this Directory is closed
