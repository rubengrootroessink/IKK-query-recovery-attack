SUBJECT: lucene 2.4 sorting slowness
DATE: 17 Dec 2008

Hello,
I have an index with ~4000000 documents and some 200 fields.  Searching without sorting takes
around 300 - 500 ms, when sorting on dates (formated as 'yyyy-mm-dd') searching time takes
on average 15 seconds. Here's the code that does the search:
hits = searcher.search(query, new Sort(new SortField("slast_modified", false)));
and here's how that field is being indexed:
doc.add(new Field("slast_modified", "2008-12-12", Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED));
Am I doing something wrong?  Is there a bug in lucene and if so is there a way to work around
it so that search speed is increased to something reasonable?
Thanks
Sincerely,
Chris Salem
