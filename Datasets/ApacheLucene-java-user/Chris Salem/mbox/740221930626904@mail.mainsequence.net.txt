SUBJECT: ComplexPhraseQueryParser with multiple fields
DATE: 29 Apr 2011

Hi,
I've just started using the ComplexPhraseQueryParser and it works great with one field but
is there a way for it to work with multiple fields?  For example, right now the query:
job_title: "sales man*" AND NOT contact_name: "Chris Salem"
throws this exception 
Caused by: org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException: Cannot have clause for field "job_title"
nested in phrase for field "contact_name"
What is the best way to work around this?
Sincerely,
Chris Salem
