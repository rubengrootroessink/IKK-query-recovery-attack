SUBJECT: Permissioning Documents
DATE: 10 Dec 2004

Hi;
 
I'm currently using Lucene (which I am extremely impressed with BTW) to
index a knowledge base of documents.  One issue I have is that only certain
documents are available to certain users (or groups).  The number of
documents is large, into the 100,000s, and the number of uses can be into
the 1000s.  Obviously, the users permissioned to see certain documents can
change regularly, so storing the user id's in the Lucene document is
undesirable, as a permission change could mean a delete and re-add to
potentially 100s of documents.
 
Does anyone have any guidance as to how I should approach this?
 
Would this be something the Lucene community would be interested in having
committed back if I embark on an optimised development at the index level?
 
Or, in the opinion of the group, should I just brute force the adds/deletes
and be done with it?
 
All advice greatly appreciated.
 
Steve
