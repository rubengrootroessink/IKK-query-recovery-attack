Hi everyone,

I have indexed a table in the database.
the table has a column named TagNr. It contains values like 25-XX8569,
41-VL451   ect....
By indexing the table I use the factory method Field.Keyword for this
column. So the values are not tokenised in this field.
Now, when I'm searching for a value containing '-' in the field TagNr I
don't get any results.
I have escaped '-' using '\' like 25\-XX8569, 25\\-XX8569 and  25\-\XX8569.
But I still don't get anything.

Has someone any suggestions?

Thaks for help
Arsineh
