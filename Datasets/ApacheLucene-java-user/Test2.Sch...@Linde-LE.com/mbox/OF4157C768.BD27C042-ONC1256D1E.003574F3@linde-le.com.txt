SUBJECT: date field in german notation
DATE: 6 May 2003

Hello,

I have indexed my table. The table has the column Date. It contains date
values in german fomat, like this 03.05.03 (day, month, year)
Indexing is ok. when I'm searching for dates (date:03.05.03) I recieve
nothing.
I've indexed this field as a keyword field.
When I print out the record, the date value looks like this 2003-03-18.
I've also searched for date:2003-03-18.

I still get no result.

What have I to do to solve this??

Any suggestions?

Arsineh
