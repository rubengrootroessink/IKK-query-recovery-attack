How about the new FilteredQuery (added in the latest Lucene 1.4 release 
- or earlier?).  I'm not sure it would suffice for that particular 
query though.  It would, however, work well for:

	foo OR (bar:yes AND xyz)

as you could use a QueryFilter on bar:yes nested in a FilteredQuery 
with a TermQuery for xyz, and then wrapped in a BooleanQuery as two 
non-required clauses.  As for QueryParser... FilteredQuery is not 
currently supported, although you could perhaps inject it by 
subclassing (?).

Maybe FilteredQuery would work for you?  But I'm not seeing how with 
the query you provided.
