SUBJECT: Lucene/Solr "OnTheRoad"
DATE: 7 Sep 2007

I just added brief mentions of some upcoming Lucene/Solr-related  
events to this page:

   http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/OnTheRoad

Below is some self-promotion of an upcoming class I have agreed to  
teach.  It's uncomfortable to send this sort of thing out, but if I  
don't then you might never stumble up on it since its being marketed  
in a low key way.

I'll be teaching a week long Lucene/Solr course October 28-November  
2.  More details here:
