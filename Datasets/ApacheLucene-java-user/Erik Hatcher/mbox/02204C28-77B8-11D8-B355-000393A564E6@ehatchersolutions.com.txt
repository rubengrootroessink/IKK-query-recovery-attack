Well, in this case it is QueryParser, not the analyzer, as the culprit. 
  QueryParser does not analyze wildcard expressions - that is just the 
nature of the beast.

You could override this behavior by subclassing and overriding 
getPrefixQuery (or getWildcardQuery too, perhaps - a single trailing 
asterisk is a prefix query though).
