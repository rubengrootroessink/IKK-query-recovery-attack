You can also try out analysis just using "ant AnalyzerDemo", like this:

$ ant AnalyzerDemo
Buildfile: build.xml

check-environment:

compile:

build-test-index:

build-perf-index:

prepare:

AnalyzerDemo:
      [echo]
      [echo]       Demonstrates analysis of sample text.
      [echo]
      [echo]       Refer to the "Analysis" chapter for much more on this
      [echo]       extremely crucial topic.
      [echo]
     [input] Press return to continue...

     [input] String to analyze: [This string will be analyzed.]
%772B
      [echo] Running lia.analysis.AnalyzerDemo...
      [java] Analyzing "%772B"
      [java]   WhitespaceAnalyzer:
      [java]     [%772B]

      [java]   SimpleAnalyzer:
      [java]     [b]

      [java]   StopAnalyzer:
      [java]     [b]

      [java]   StandardAnalyzer:
      [java]     [772b]
