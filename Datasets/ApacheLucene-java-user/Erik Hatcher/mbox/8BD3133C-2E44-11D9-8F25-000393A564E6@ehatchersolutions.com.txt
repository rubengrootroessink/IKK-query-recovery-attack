I get multiple sort fields to work, here's two examples:

         new Sort(new SortField[]{
           new SortField("category"),
           SortField.FIELD_SCORE,
           new SortField("pubmonth", SortField.INT, true)
         });

        new Sort(new SortField[] {SortField.FIELD_SCORE, new 
SortField("category")})

Both of these, on a tiny dataset of only 10 documents, works exactly as 
expected.

Are you using Lucene 1.4.2?  How did you index your integer field?  Are 
you simply using the .toString() of an Integer?  Or zero padding the 
field somehow?  You can use the .toString method, but you have to be 
sure that the sorting code does the right parsing of it - so you might 
need to specify SortField.INT as its type.  It will do automatic 
detection if the type is not specified, but that assumes that the first 
document it encounters parses properly, otherwise it will fall back to 
using a String sort.
