The RegexQuery won't work in this case, as it is only matching on  
terms, not original field values.  So it'd still pick up other titles  
with "the" in them (provided stop words were not removed).

If you need exact matching on original value, the easiest way is to  
index that value without tokenization (perhaps lowercasing though).   
Unless someone has some other tricks I'm not aware of, that is.
