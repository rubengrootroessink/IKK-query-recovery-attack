Mark,

This is great stuff!

One quick comment just at my look at the code (I haven't tried it yet). 
  Shouldn't the tpv variable be used in this method?

     public static TokenStream getAnyTokenStream(IndexReader reader,int 
docId, String field,Analyzer analyzer) throws IOException
     {
		TokenStream ts=null;

		TermFreqVector tfv=(TermFreqVector) 
reader.getTermFreqVector(docId,field);
		if(tfv!=null)
		{
		    if(tfv instanceof TermPositionVector)
		    {
		        //the most efficient choice..
 >>>		        TermPositionVector tpv=(TermPositionVector) 
reader.getTermFreqVector(docId,field);
		        ts=getTokenStream(reader,docId,field);
		    }
		}
		//No token info stored so fall back to analyzing raw content
		if(ts==null)
		{
		    ts=getTokenStream(reader,docId,field,analyzer);
		}
		return ts;
     }
