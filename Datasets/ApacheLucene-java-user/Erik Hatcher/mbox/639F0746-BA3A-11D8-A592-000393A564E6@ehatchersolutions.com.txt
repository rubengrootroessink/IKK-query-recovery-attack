Ah yes!  Don't worry, I hadn't forgotten about Nutch.  I'm tinkering 
with its query parsing and analysis as we speak in fact.  Very clever 
indeed.

I would be curious to see how an implementation of this played out.  
For example, could I add my own syntax such that

	"some phrase" <-3-> "another phrase"

could be parsed into a SpanNearQuery of two SpanNearQuery's?

I like the idea of a flexible run-time grammar, but it sounds too good 
to be true in a general purpose kinda way.
