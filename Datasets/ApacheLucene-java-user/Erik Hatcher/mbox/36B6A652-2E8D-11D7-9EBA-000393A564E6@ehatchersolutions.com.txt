I just realized how dense I've been on this thread.  All along Terry 
has been saying he's indexing date fields as "YYYYMMDD" String fields 
and I just wasn't getting it.  I had my brain locked into thinking the 
fields were being indexed as Date fields.

My apologies for the run around on this thread.  Back to your regular 
programming...
