But why even lowercase?  That is what an analyzer typically does anyway 
(look at the output from AnalysisDemo to see).

Note that there are switches on QueryParser (and MultiFieldQueryParser 
is lacking in this respect, another reason not to use it) that does 
lowercase wildcard terms automatically: 
setLowercaseWildcardTerms(true).  Wildcard terms are not analyzed by 
QueryParser, so this was added to account for it.
