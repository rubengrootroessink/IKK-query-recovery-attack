When you know you need to query on something you have available during indexing time, make
your life easy and index it!  In other words, index the number of (other) fields as a numeric
into a "num_fields" field or something like that.

This could be done automatically if you were to write a custom update processor and add it
to the update processing chain, but easy enough to do in most custom indexers I've ever come
across as well.

Good luck on this one... you'll have to contend with escaping (with a backslash) if you're
using the "lucene" query parser, and perhaps other related headaches with other query parsers
depending on how they do their thing underneath.
