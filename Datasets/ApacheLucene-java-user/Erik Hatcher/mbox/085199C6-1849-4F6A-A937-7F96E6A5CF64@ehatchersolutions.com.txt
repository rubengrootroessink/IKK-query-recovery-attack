I don't know about this one, but guessing that it just happens to be  
a normal state of the system when you killed the process.  *shrugs*

This is a typical occurrence when using Query's that expand such as  
WildcardQuery, RangeQuery, FuzzyQuery, etc.  If users are doing  
queries like a* and there are over 1024 terms that start with "a"  
then you will, by default, blow up WildcardQuery's expansion into a  
BooleanQuery.  You can up that limit on BooleanQuery, or disallow  
those types of queries perhaps.
