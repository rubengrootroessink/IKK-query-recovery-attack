SUBJECT: IndexSearcher on JAR resources?
DATE: 28 Aug 2002

I searched the archives, but may have missed it.  I suspect someone has 
done this before:

How can I read a Lucene index that is stored within a JAR file rather 
than directly on the file system?  I want to integrate a read-only index 
into a WAR and an EJB environment which has the easiest possible 
installation and also adheres to the "no filesystem access" rules of EJB.

Thanks,
	Erik
