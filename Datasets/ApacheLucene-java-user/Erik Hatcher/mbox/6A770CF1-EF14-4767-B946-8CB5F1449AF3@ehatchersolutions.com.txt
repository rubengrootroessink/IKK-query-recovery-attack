What do you mean by a fuzzy phrase query?   As in each term in the  
phrase is treated as a FuzzyQuery essentially such that "kool kat"  
matches "cool cat"?

This can be done with some work to implement a SpanFuzzyQuery  
(similar to the SpanRegexQuery in contrib/regex currently) and using  
SpanNearQuery instead of a PhraseQuery.   Performance is at risk  
doing such a query as all terms in the index need to be enumerated  
(or a subset if a prefix length is provided), but it can be done.
