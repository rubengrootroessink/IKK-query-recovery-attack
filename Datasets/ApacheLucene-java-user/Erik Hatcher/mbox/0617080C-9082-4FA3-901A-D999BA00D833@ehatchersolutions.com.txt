On already indexed documents?  No.  You likely used an analyzer that  
lowercased every term.

I support case-sensitive/insensitive searching by building two  
indexes, one with case as-is, another with everything lowercased.

Another option is to index the same text into two fields, one as-is,  
one lowercased, and toggle which field you search at query time.

Either way, you'll need to re-index in some way.
