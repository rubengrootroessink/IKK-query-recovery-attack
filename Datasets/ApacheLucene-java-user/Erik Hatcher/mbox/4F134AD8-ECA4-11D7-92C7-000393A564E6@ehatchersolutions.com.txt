My personal take is using the date support in Lucene is not all that 
fun or easy because of the contortions necessary to deal with it.  But, 
QueryParser supports date field ranges (but not a term query by date 
field).  So, you can do it this way:

	date:[1/1/04 TO 1/1/04] for inclusive date ranges (only 1/1/04 found)
	date:{1/1/04 TO 1/5/04} for exclusive ranges (dates 1/2, 1/3, and 
1/4/04 are found, but not 1/1 or 1/5/04)
