It matches both because you're tokenizing the name field.  In both 
documents, the name field has a "testing" term in it (it gets 
lowercased also).  A PrefixQuery matches terms that start with the 
prefix.  Use an untokenized field type (Field.Keyword) if you want to 
keep the entire original string as-is for searching purposes - however 
you'd have issues with case-sensitivity in your example.

Also keep in mind that QueryParser only allows a trailing asterisk, 
creating a PrefixQuery.  However, if you use a WildcardQuery directly, 
you can use an asterisk as the starting character (at the risk of 
performance).
