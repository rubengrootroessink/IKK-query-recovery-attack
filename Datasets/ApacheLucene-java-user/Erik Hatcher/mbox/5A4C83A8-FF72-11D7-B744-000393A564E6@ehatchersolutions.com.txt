Yes, it was implemented to limit the number of clauses in a 
BooleanQuery, which is what a WildcardQuery is rewritten to after 
enumerating all the terms matching the wildcard expression:

BooleanQuery:
	  private static int maxClauseCount = 1024;

WildcardQuerys, as you've experienced, have a potential for a major 
performance hit or worse.  Exposing QueryParser to users opens the door 
to this potential easily - although you can subclass QueryParser and 
disable WildcardQuerys if you like.
