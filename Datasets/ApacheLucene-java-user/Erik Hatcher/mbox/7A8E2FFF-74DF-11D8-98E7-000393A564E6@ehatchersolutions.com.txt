Look in the archives for KeywordAnalyzer (custom).... and 
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper (built-in).... using a combination of these you 
can use keyword fields.  Or, first try just using WhitespaceAnalyzer.

It is almost always the analyzer that is the cause of confusion - folks 
just get lulled into forgetting about its role because Lucene is so 
easy to use... until this type of issue bites you.

It is a wacky combination though - and notorious for causing confusion.

Perhaps someone could create a wiki page for this scenario where we can 
flesh out examples/solutions?
