There really isn't much wheel to reinvent... you can "page" through  
Hits by simply starting at any point and going forward however many  
documents you want per page.  You could also use TopDocs  
returning .search() methods, which is what I think Solr does.  Again,  
not much to it - pick a starting point, and go from there.
