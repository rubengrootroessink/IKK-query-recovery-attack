Not true.  The Analyzer base class has a method tokenStream that 
accepts the field name.  None of the built-in analyzers use the field 
name to do anything different based on the field name, but a custom 
analyzer easily could.

This change (I think) was made relatively recently, so maybe its not 
part of a release build of Lucene?
