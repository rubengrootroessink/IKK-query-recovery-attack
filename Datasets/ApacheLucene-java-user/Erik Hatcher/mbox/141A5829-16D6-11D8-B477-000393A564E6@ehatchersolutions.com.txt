With Lucene's analysis process, you can assign a position increment to 
tokens.  The default value is 1, meaning its the next position.  Phrase 
queries default to a slop of 0, meaning they must be in successive 
positions.  When analyzing and you encounter a sentence boundary, you 
could set the position increment of the next word (the first word of 
the next sentence) to a high number (to account for users searching 
with potential slop, or just something greater than one if you never 
use sloppy phrase searches).

Does this get you closer to what you're after?

As for how to weight queries by the distance from terms.... I'll have 
to think on that some, but I suspect something reasonable could be done 
with a custom Similarity or a custom type of Query.
