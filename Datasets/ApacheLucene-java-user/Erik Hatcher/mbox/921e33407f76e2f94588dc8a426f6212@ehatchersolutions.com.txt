Lucene's index works with any String.  But, when dealing with numbers 
and dates such that range queries work, they need to be formatted in a 
way that makes them orderable.

If you index the numbers 1 - 10, you have to pad them, otherwise you'll 
end up with 1, 10, 2, 3, ... and that will throw off sensible range 
queries.

There is prefix compression used on term values.  So you could pad 
numbers with lots of leading zeros and not incur much additional 
size... 000000000001, for example.
