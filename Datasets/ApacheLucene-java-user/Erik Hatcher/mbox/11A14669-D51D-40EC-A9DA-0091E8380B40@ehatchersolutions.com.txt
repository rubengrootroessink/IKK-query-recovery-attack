Nutch does do this sort of thing, but I'm not quite sure how.  It  
isn't doing any operations to the Lucene index beyond what plain ol'  
Lucene does.

Collex is quite open source, its just ugly source :)  We're the  
'patacriticism' project at SourceForge, under the "collex" directory  
in Subversion.

Collex implements tagging by implementing JOIN cross-references  
between user/tag documents and regular object documents.  It's  
scalability is not going to be good at bigger numbers in its current  
architecture, but it works quite well for our 60k or so objects at  
the moment.
