SUBJECT: general versus java-user@lucene e-mail lists
DATE: 26 Apr 2005

Because we now have the e-mail lists general@lucene and 
java-user@lucene, I want to clarify their purpose.  java-user@lucene is 
where we discuss the Java implementation of Lucene.  The general@lucene 
list is for discussions that are about the Lucene top-level Apache 
project that do not pertain to a specific implementation or sub-project 
- such as organization of the sub-projects, cross-implementation 
testing, etc.

Several have posted to general@lucene recently but those mails are 
really best sent to java-user@lucene.  I am subscribed to both and 
filter them both into my "Lucene" folder, and may or may not notice 
which of the lists I'm replying to.  Please use the appropriate list 
for your messages.

If there is anything we can do to avoid confusion with the e-mail 
lists, let us know.

	Erik
