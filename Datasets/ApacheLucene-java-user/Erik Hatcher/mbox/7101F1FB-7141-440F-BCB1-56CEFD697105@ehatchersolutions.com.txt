For a domain-centric identifier, use a custom field to store (and  
index perhaps?) it.  Lucene's Document id's are internal and not  
controllable.

The id is created on addition to the index - the id is merely the  
position of the document in the index and changes when documents are  
deleted before it and the index optimized.  Document id's are not to  
be relied in the long-term.
