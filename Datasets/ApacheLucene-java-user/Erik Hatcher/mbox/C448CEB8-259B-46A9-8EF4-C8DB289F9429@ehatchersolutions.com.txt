But of course.  Have a look at the source code to  
QueryParser.getFieldQuery() - it does this very thing.  I'm glad to  
see more folks creating queries programatically using a blend of  
QueryParser, analysis, or just plain ol' StringTokenizer.  The  
expressiveness of queries is of the utmost importance, and  
QueryParser is pretty BASIC.  Most of the applications I've worked on  
have used custom techniques for creating the Query.
