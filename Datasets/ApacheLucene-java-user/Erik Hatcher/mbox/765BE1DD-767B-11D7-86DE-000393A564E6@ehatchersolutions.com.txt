SUBJECT: Re: Type information on Tokens?
DATE: 24 Apr 2003

Here's another vote for keeping the type information in the index.  I 
suspect where this would break down is if a field has two tokens that 
are textually the same, but are considered different types - so maybe 
its not a good idea technically.  I'd love to hear more about the 
pros/cons to keeping this information, as it seems like something quite 
useful during searching.
