Are you using Lucene 1.4.3?  Or the latest Subversion version?

The Lucene index does not keep all of the information in the Token's  
emitted by the analyzer (unless specified to do so, but 1.4.3 didn't  
support the fancier features).

So, the fail-safe way is to re-tokenize the original text (perhaps  
stored in the Lucene index) and hand that TokenStream to the  
Highlighter.

Or you can experiment with the additional Field constructors to  
enable the storage of token offsets and the Highlighter can use those  
for a little better performance, but it's likely to be unnoticeable  
for your application to simply re-tokenize on the fly for only the  
fields you're displaying.  Storing the token offsets increases the  
index size, of course.
