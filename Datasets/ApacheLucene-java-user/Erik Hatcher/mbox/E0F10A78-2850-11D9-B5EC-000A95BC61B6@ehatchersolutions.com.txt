But you want stop words removed for general term queries?

Have a look at how Nutch does its thing - it has a very similar type of 
situation where it deals with common terms differently if they are in a 
phrase.

There are other choices - use a different analyzer, and if you want 
that used only for phrase queries you can override QueryParser and its 
getFieldQuery method.
