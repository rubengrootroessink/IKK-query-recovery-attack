It's not a straightforward use of Lucene to emulate that type of query. 
  The trickiest one is the "sounds like".  The FuzzyQuery in Lucene is 
close, but not quite a "soudns like".  You could use WildcardQuerys for 
the "like" clauses, but they might be better served with more 
sophisticated analysis that puts all combinations ("a", "ab", "aba", 
"abab"....") as terms.

There are certainly tricks that could be played at either indexing 
analysis or query analysis times that could do what you want.  Would it 
be faster than a fast database with that large of a dataset?  I'm not 
sure.
