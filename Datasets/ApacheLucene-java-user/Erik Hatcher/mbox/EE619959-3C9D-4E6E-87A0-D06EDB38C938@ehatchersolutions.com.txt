It's a fair bit trickier than using any of the stock core classes  
like that.  But it can be done, using SpanNearQuery nested with  
SpanRegexQuery's for the wildcarded parts in the contrib code (note,  
this uses regex syntax, not WildcardQuery syntax), along with  
SpanTermQuery's for the non-wildcarded parts.
