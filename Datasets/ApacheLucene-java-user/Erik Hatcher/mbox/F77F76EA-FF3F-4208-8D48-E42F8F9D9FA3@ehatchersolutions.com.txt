Are there any other issues or concerns with making this change to  
StopFilter?  Should we make this change in 1.9?  Or wait until after  
2.0 is released?

Mike - if you could create some test cases for this scenario and  
contribute your patch and tests to Bugzilla, barring no objections,  
I'll apply it.
