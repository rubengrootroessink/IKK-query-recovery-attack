This could be thwarted with tokens using zero position offsets  
though, no?

For my purpose it is actually a global need - all successive  
instances of fields will have this offset specified, but setting this  
on a per-Field instance is no problem.

It is either expand Field slightly, or expand Analyzer.  The Analyzer  
extensions seem fine, but much more general purpose than my need.  So  
being practical, if there is no current use case then we should stick  
with the concrete.

As for Doug's comments, I'll add javadocs for sure, and increase the  
warnings on getBoost() while I'm at it.  In fact, getPositionOffset()  
isn't technically needed (nor getBoost() for that matter), but I'll  
add it just to be complete, but add thorough warnings.
