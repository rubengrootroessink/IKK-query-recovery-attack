Because I'm really interested in the guts of Lucene, I dug even

PhraseQuery uses a SloppyPhraseScorer, and its phaseFreq method is what 
makes the order not matter.  I'm pretty sure a new OrderedPhraseQuery 
that subclassed PhraseQuery and overrode createWeight and did something 
similar to the SloppyPhraseScorer would do the trick.
