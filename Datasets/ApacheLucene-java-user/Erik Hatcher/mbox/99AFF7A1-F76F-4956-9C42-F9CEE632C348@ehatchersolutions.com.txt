Well, the more RAM you have the better when it comes to Solr  
responsiveness, I'm sure.  But, Solr leverages some caching  
cleverness so the queries and filters used most frequently are in RAM  
and lesser used items get dropped from the cache and loaded  
dynamically.  Quite cool stuff!  I'm just beginning to leverage it  
myself and its working nicely.
