I suggest you aggregate all the text you want searchable into a single 
field during indexing.  Then search that field at query time instead.

The alternative is to build up a (potentially huge) BooleanQuery using 
that string for each field.  The MultiFieldQueryParser can do this, but 
its not pretty and I'm not fond of it.
