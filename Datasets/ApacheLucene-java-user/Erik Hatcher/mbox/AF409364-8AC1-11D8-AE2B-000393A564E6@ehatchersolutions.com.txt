I have examples of this that I can post when I have more time, but a 
quick pointer... check out the overloaded IndexSearcher.search() 
methods which accept a Sort.  You can do really really interesting 
slicing and dicing, I think, using it.  Try this one on for size:

     example.displayHits(allBooks,
         new Sort(new SortField[]{
           new SortField("category"),
           SortField.FIELD_SCORE,
           new SortField("pubmonth", SortField.INT, true)
         }));

Be clever indexing the piece you want to group on - I think you may 
find this the solution you're looking for.
