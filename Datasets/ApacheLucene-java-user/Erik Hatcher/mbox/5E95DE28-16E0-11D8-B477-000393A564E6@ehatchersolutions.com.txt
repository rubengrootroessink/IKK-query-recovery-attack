You should write your own code that creates the Document objects with 
the fields you wish, with a Field.Keyword for the URL probably.  Take 
what is useful from IndexHTML.java, but don't use it as-is.  If you're 
speaking of pulling the document from a URL now you're talking of doing 
some HTTP communication, and HttpClient is one clean option for this.
