You can pretty safely rely on the current state of Subversion not  
changing the API between now and a release.  No promises, but I don't  
know of any open issues that propose API changes.  So I don't think  
you have any worries  using Subversion.  However, I do realize that  
many organizations demand a release version for use (understandable  
in one sense, but also missing the point of open source IMO).

All we need is a release manager volunteer to step forward (one of  
the committers) and push through the logistics of making an official  
release.  If it goes long enough, maybe my plate will be clear  
enough, but currently I'm not in a position to tackle it myself.
