SUBJECT: Re: How to obtain unique field values
DATE: 30 Dec 2002

Terry,

Thanks for that quick reply and code.  I love open source!

But it seems there should be a way to do this without walking every 
document, since these fields are indexed after all :)

I realize that Lucene is very sophisticated under the covers, and there 
may be some technical reason why this isn't feasible though.  But 
certainly when I do a query "category:SomeCategory" Lucene is not 
crawling all documents.  Hopefully if its possible to obtain this 
information without walking every
document in the index someone will share how - but if not, its not the 
end of the world for my project.

Thanks,
	Erik
