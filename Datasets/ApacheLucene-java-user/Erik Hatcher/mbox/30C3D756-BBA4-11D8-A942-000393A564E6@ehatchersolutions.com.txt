Sorry for the short reply, but I'm leaving momentarily to go present 
Lucene (and Ant and Tapestry) at the Research Triangle Software 
Symposium.

Two things:

  - Don't build a QueryParser string in code - simply construct a 
RangeQuery directly.  This eliminates a lot of variables to the 
equation that may be getting in the way.

  - Know what terms are being emitted during analysis.  Try the utility 
pointed to here 
(http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/AnalysisParalysis) with your 
data.
