Sure.... do you realize what WildcardQuery does under the covers?  It 
literally expands to a BooleanQuery for all terms that match the 
pattern.  There is an adjustable limit built-in of 1,024 clauses to 
BooleanQuery.  You obviously have not hit that limit ... yet!

You're better off using the advice offered on this thread 
previously.... create a single dummy field with a fixed value for all 
documents.  Combine a TermQuery for that dummy value with a prohibited 
clause like y our negativeMatch above.
