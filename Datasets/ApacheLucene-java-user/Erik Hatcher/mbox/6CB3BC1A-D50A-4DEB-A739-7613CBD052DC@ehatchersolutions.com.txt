There are test cases in the Highlighter codebase that exercise it and  
show its use, as well as a few examples of it in the "Lucene in  
Action" codebase.

These examples output plain text with some prefix and suffix  
surrounding the highlighted terms.  Highlighting text in a PDF is  
possible, I'm pretty sure, but I don't think the same would be easily  
possible with Microsoft document formats.  I'm not sure if you are  
asking for these document types to be highlighted or just a plain  
text representation of them, though.
