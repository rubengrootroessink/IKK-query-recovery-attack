SUBJECT: ApacheCon and Lucene
DATE: 11 Oct 2004

Pardon the mild advertising interruption - I'm giving a 3 hour tutorial 
on Lucene at ApacheCon next month.  Time is running out for meeting the 
pre-registration numbers, so I'm encouraging folks that are already 
going to ApacheCon but have not registered yet to please do so.  And if 
you are undecided, maybe a Lucene tutorial would be enough to persuade 
you to come.

One nice thing for attendees of ApacheCon tutorials, they take away 
handouts that I'm preparing.  I'm copy/pasting sections of the Lucene 
in Action manuscript so that attendees will get plenty of details on 
tricky issues with analysis, parsing query expressions, sorting, 
filtering, and more.

I hope to see you there!

	Erik
