Actually what William should use is the new Sort facility to order  
results by a field.  Doing this with a Similarity would be much  
trickier.  Look at the IndexSearcher.sort() methods which take a Sort  
and follow the Javadocs from there.  Let us know if you have any  
questions on sorting.

It would be best if you represent your 'popularity' field as an integer  
(or at least numeric) since sorting by String uses more memory.
