There used to be a such a beast, and to get at it you'll need to  
resurrect it from the jakarta-lucene-sandbox CVS repository attic.   
We (well, I, but no one objected) chose not to bring it over as it  
was not a best-practice recommended way to work with Lucene search  
results.  It had its own sorting mechanism that was vastly inferior  
to the current built-in sorting that came along in Lucene 1.4.

If you're running into an issue in using Lucene, ask here and I'm  
sure we can work it out without you needing to locate SearchBean.
