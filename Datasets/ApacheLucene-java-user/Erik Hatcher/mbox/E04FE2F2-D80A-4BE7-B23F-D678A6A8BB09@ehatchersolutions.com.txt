SUBJECT: Re: Help with custom sorting - ignoring case on string fields.
DATE: 6 Jul 2005

Ian - I'll look into this issue in more detail as soon as I can, but  
one reasonable approach is to add a special field designed for  
sorting that has all case normalized to either all upper or all lower  
such that sorting is case insensitive.  Note that Field.Text is not a  
good choice for sorting, as it is highly likely there would be  
multiple terms for that field which does not work with sorting.   See  
the javadocs for Sort:

     http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/ 
Sort.html

So given this, a think a special field for sorting that has been  
lowercased but uses a non-tokenized but indexed field type is the  
best choice.
