I'd keep around the software used to read those indexes also, as Karl  
suggested.

But even then, will Java 7.0 be able to run Java 1.5 JARs?!  ;)   So  
maybe you should also keep around an entire machine (or virtual  
image) that can read those indexes?  But then what if the 1.0 power  
cord is not compatible with your future 5.0 wirelessly electric  
office building?   I'm being silly, of course, but at the very least  
I recommend you keep around at least the basics of the software  
system used to read the indexes now.  In the past, we've kept the  
entire build system of our software in version control (i.e. Ant  
itself, and all its dependencies).
