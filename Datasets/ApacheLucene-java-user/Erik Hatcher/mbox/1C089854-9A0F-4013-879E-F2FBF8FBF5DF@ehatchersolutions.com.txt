Are indexes A and B completely different sets of logical documents?    
Or are the indices parallel such that first document in A represents  
a piece of the first document in B?

If they are distinct indexes, then title:XXX AND label:XXX won't work  
because no document would have both title "AND" label.  Perhaps  
logically you'd achieve what you want by using "OR" instead?   To  
search multiple distinct indexes you could use a MultiSearcher.

If they are parallel indexes, using a ParallelReader within an  
IndexSearcher may be what you're after in which case the "AND" would  
work as you mentioned.
