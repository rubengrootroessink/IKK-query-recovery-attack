I don't think that Lucene is causing the issue.  I'd like to wait and 
see if others have opinions/suggestions on this issue.  Again, what 
your example program is doing is unrealistic - you're hammering the 
filesystem and CPU by having infinite loops that do not sleep.  If a 
minimal sleep works then I don't think you'll have to concern the 
operations folks with a bigger box.
