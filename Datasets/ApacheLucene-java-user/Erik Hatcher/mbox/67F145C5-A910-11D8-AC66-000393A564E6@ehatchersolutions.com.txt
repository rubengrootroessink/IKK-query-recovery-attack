Could you elaborate on what you mean by MVC here?  A value list handler 
piece has been developed and links posted to it on this list - if this 
is the type of thing you're referring to.

Personally I'm skeptical of using such wrappers.  Lucene itself 
provides the needed wrapping for efficiency to allow you to page 
through search results with the least possible resource use.  Trying to 
pull all results into a collection and iterate them will not scale 
unless you leverage some lazy handling like Lucene already provides.  I 
don't see the need to add an additional intermediate layer.  Purists 
will claim it "abstracts" the implementation.  But, I'm _agile_ and 
being so means I have faith in my skills to shift my codebase to a 
different search implementation when/if needed, and I definitely do not 
foresee that as even being a possibility since Lucene is superb.

I'd love to hear how folks are using SearchBean though, and why they 
feel it is beneficial.

Maybe "deprecates" was too strong - but sorting is completely covered 
with built-in capabilities now, and you can see above regarding my MVC 
opinions.

It offers sorting by relevance, document id, and any field you've 
indexed appropriately (see javadocs for details) as well as custom 
sorting implementations.  I have, as a prototype, leveraged the custom 
sorting implementation to efficiently sort documents (businesses with a 
"location" field) by geographic distance from the user doing the query.
