In general, all answers would be too general to be useful :)

JavaCC is great - I'm using it for a custom query parser myself.  But  
it's not for the feint of heart.  It may be more than you need, it  
all depends.  The main thing StandardTokenizer does is keep e-mail  
addresses intact, and a few other fiddly things.

If you provide us with some sample text and how you want that  
tokenized, I'm sure we could offer suggestions.

There are many pitfalls with JavaCC grammars.  It takes practice and  
unit tests to get this stuff right.  The same could be said of any  
style of tokenization.  Make lots of tests to ensure you don't break  
expected behavior as you tweak.
