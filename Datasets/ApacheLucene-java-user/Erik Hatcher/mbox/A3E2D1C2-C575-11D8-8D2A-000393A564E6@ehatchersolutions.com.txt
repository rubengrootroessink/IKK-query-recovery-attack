You get term vectors by "field", not document.  As for best practice, 
there is really only one way to go about getting the term vectors:

         TermFreqVector termFreqVector =
             reader.getTermFreqVector(i, "subject");

where reader is an IndexReader and i is the document number.

Document frequency of a term is in the term info file (.tis) and 
available through TermEnum (see IndexReader.terms()).
