DATE: 3 Feb 2005

We can work the 1.x and 2.0 lines of code however we need to.  We can 
branch (a branch or tag in Subversion is inexpensive and a constant 
time operation).  How we want to manage both versions of Lucene is open 
for discussion.  Nothing about Subversion changes how we manage this 
from how we'd do it with CVS.

Currently the 1.x and 2.x lines of code are one and the same.  Once 
they diverge in 2.0, it will depend on who steps up to maintain 1.x but 
I suspect there will be a strong interest in keeping it alive by some, 
but we would of course encourage everyone using 1.x upgrade to 1.9 and 
remove deprecation warnings.
