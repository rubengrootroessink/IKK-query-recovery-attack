The only catch that I know if is that an Analyzer is invoked on a 
per-field basis.  I can't tell exactly what you have in mind, but a 
Lucene Analyzer cannot split data into separate fields itself - it has 
to have been split prior.

I'm indexing a lot of XML myself, with JDOM in the middle, and using 
XPath to extract data per field before building the Document.
