Well, I actually already had a comment in the book about why you'd 
override getRangeQuery, and it said this:

   * handle number ranges by padding to match how numbers were indexed

You did give me the incentive to flesh this out into an example.

I also created a variant of this to parse range queries like this 
field:[1/1/04 TO 12/31/04] into YYYYMMDD syntax so it becomes 
field:[20040101 TO 20041231].  This is very handy when dealing with 
dates in a typically more sensible YYYYMMDD format and allowing users 
to deal with them naturally also.

What about them?  It all depends on how you want users to be able to 
query based on that flag.  Do you want them to say field:true?  
field:on?  field:yes?  How you translate things in QueryParser is up to 
you - and this may of course have some impact on how you index.  You 
could use "0" and "1" instead, and do the translation in a QueryParser 
subclass if you like.

Ummm, yeah.... Lucene is real slow!  :)

You tell us.... is it slow with your data and environment?  If so, give 
us some more details on the scenario.
