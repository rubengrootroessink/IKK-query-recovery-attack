There is a Metaphone filter and some sample analyzers that use it in  
the Lucene in Action codebase.  I toyed with various ones from  
Jakarta Commons Codec and thought Metaphone did a better job than  
Soundex.  The implementation is pretty trivial, so it'd be easy to  
switch to Soundex.  Just grab the code download from http:// 
www.lucenebook.com
