SUBJECT: Re: HTML Analyzer?
DATE: 15 Nov 2002

If you have a look at the HtmlDocument class in the ant contributions 
directory of jakarta-lucene-sandbox in Jakarta's CVS.

<http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contributions/ant/src/main/org/apache/lucene/ant/HtmlDocument.java?annotate=1.1>

I wrote this and it uses JTidy to parse HTML and does a nice job of it.

Maybe this would be good for your solution as well?
