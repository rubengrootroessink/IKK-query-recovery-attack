The "words" (or "terms") are already in the index ready to be read very 
rapidly and accurately.  IndexReader is what you want to investigate if 
your fields are indexed.

Look into IndexReader and pull the terms directly rather than 
re-"analyzing" the text.  Provided "contents" was an indexed field, you 
could do something like this (taken from a mini-project I'm tinkering 
with right now):

   public String[] wordsThatStartWith(char c) throws IOException {
     String letter = new String("" + c).toLowerCase();

     ArrayList words = new ArrayList();
     if (reader == null) {
       reader = IndexReader.open(indexPath);
     }

     TermEnum terms = reader.terms(new Term("word", letter));
     while ("word".equals(terms.term().field())) {

       String word = terms.term().text();
       if (word.startsWith(letter)) {
         words.add(word);
       } else {
         break;
       }

       if (!terms.next()) {
         break;
       }
     }

     Collections.sort(words);

     String[] sortedWords = (String[]) words.toArray(new String[0]);

     return sortedWords;
   }

You'll need to do some adapting of this code to your environment and 
field(s), as what is here is designed to pull all the "word"'s that 
start with a specified letter.
