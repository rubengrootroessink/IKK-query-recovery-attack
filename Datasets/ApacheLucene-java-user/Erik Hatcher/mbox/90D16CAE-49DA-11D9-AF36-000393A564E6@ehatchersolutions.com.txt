I have the e-book PDF in my possession.  I have been prodding Manning 
on a daily basis to update the LIA website and get the e-book 
available.  It is ready, and I'm sure that its just a matter of them 
pushing it out.  There may be some administrative loose ends they are 
tying up before releasing it to the world.  It should be available any 
minute now, really.  :)
