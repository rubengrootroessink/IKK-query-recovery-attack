Give me an example of a string and how you'd like it to be tokenized.  
But first, give the AnalyzerUtils (from my java.net article) a try and 
get a feel for what different analyzers do.

Keep in mind that it can be tricky (see the AnalysisParalysis page on 
the wiki and my java.net article on QueryParser) to make sense out of a 
combination of QueryParser and an Analyzer - so its best to work with 
them independently to get what you want and then put things together.
