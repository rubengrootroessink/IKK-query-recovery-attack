You *can* use wildcards with keywords (in fact, a keyword really has no 
meaning once indexed - everything is a "term" at that point).

99% of the issues people have with things like this end up being 
Analyzer/QueryParser related.

A few quick pieces of advice:

  - use Luke to see what is inside your index and understand what it 
looks like from the inside.
  - create a utility (I've posted one on the list in the past) that 
shows what your analyzer is doing graphically.
  - use Query.toString to output what QueryParser did to your query 
expression.

Armed with the above bits of trivia, you have the information to 
troubleshoot the situation first-hand.
