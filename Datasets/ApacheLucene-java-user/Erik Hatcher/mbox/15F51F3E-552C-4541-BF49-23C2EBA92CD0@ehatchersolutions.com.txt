Highlighting and QueryParser aren't related.  How you build or  
generate the Query object is irrelevant to the Highlighter.

It is true that in my applications, use of QueryParser is only a  
small piece of how the Query gets built and in one project I've  
created an entirely different and custom expression parser (for  
legacy syntax compatibility reasons, as well as to support  
sophisticated SpanQuery constructions).

I believe the first example in Lucene in Action does use QueryParser,  
the Searcher.java code in Chapter 1.
