SUBJECT: Re: How to index a Word document
DATE: 31 Jan 2003

My current day job project uses SQL Server (yes, Slammer hit several  
folks, sheesh!) and it has built-in full-text indexing of IMAGE fields  
that correspond to Office documents (or anything Index Server can  
index, I suppose).  It works very well and made our Word document  
indexing issue a non-issue - we just call a stored procedure with the  
query - even natural language queries I believe.

The Jakarta POI project is aiming towards being able to do this with  
Word docs, but I don't believe its very usable yet, or so last I heard.

I'm still keen on hearing how others are doing it, especially with  
Lucene.
