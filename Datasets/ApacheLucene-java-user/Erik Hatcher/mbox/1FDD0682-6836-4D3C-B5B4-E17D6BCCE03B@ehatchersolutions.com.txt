I'm increasingly getting more and more requests for Lucene consulting  
myself, and simply don't have the bandwidth to tackle most of them.   
I have said "yes" a few times recently though, so don't count me out  
though ;)

If you are skilled with Lucene, and interested in making yourself  
available for consulting work, please register yourself here:

I have referred several folks to this page recently when I've not  
been able to help them.
