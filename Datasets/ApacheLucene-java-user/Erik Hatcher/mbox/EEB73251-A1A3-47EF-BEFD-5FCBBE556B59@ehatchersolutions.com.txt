The analyzer is responsible for some additional data about terms,  
specifically in this case a position increment.  All built-in  
analyzers use a position increment of 1 for each term, meaning that  
each term is in a successive position than the previous one.   
PhraseQuery looks for all terms in the phrase in successive positions  
(or within a certain slop factor distance from one another).
