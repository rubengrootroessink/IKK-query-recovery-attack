SUBJECT: Re: reuse of TokenStream
DATE: 18 Feb 2005

I'm confused on how you're reusing a TokenStream object.  General  
Lucene usage would not involve a developer dealing with it directly.   
Could you share an example of what you're up to?

I'm not sure if this is related, but a technique I'm using is to index  
the same Document instance into two different IndexWriter instances  
(each uses a different Analyzer) - and this is working fine.
