Lucene itself indexes java.lang.String or java.io.Reader data.  It is 
completely up to your application to parse the data out of whatever 
source it is in and hand it to Lucene.  There are a number of 
open-source libraries that make parsing XML, MS Word, Excel, HTML, and 
other formats trivial.  If you search the e-mail list archives you'll 
find pointers to tons of options.
