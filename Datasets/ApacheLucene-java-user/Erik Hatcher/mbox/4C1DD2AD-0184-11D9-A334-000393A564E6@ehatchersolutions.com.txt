First of all, this is untrue.  WildcardQuery itself most definitely 
supports wildcards at the beginning.

The dilemma you've encountered is that QueryParser prevents queries 
that begin with a wildcard.

It will require more than that in this case.  You will need to create a 
custom parser that allows the grammar you'd like.  Feel free to use the 
JavaCC source code to QueryParser as a basis of your customizations.
