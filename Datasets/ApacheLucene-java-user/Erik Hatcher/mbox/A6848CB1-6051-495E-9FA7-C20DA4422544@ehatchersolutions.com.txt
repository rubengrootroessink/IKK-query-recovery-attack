To clarify something that no one else has mentioned, its only  
QueryParser itself that prevents terms from beginning with a wildcard  
character.  WildcardQuery itself supports this.  The reason  
QueryParser prevents it is to avoid runaway queries, as the  
underlying mechanism iterates through all terms in the index,  
optimizing it for the terms that begin with the static prefix.  With  
a leading wildcard character, there is no static prefix so literally  
all terms in the index are checked.

So, you could try:

	Query query = new WildcardQuery(new Term("fieldname", "*-123"));

and see if the performance is acceptable.
