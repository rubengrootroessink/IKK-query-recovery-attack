Making it optional is ok by me, though I'm curious about a use case  
that would prefer it the way it is now.  Searching for "lucene in  
action" and having it match documents with "lucene action" in them  
seems awkward to me in a precision context.  Google allows  
wildcarding of words with an asterisk:

     <http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=%22lucene+* 
+action%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8>
