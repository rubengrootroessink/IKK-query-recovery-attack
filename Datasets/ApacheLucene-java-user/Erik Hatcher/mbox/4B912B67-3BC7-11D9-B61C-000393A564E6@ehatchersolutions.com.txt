It'd be interesting for you to compare the speed and see.  In your 
approach you are still doing two searches, with the first one used to 
get the documents available for the second search.

QueryFilter also caches.  Filters are really designed for long standing 
use, not a one time query refinement.  For query refinement (search 
within search), simply combine the two queries in a BooleanQuery as 
required clauses.
