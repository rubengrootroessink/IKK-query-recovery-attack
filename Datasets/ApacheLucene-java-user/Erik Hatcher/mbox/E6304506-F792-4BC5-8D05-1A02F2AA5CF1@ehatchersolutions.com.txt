Millions of records is fine.  The main breaking point of the BitSet- 
in-Map scheme is can you cache all the BitSets for the unique facet  
terms (album/artist).  And don't despair yet... if you want to dabble  
with Solr's DocSet infrastructure instead of BitSets you can reduce  
your memory consumption dramatically I'm sure - without having to  
convert to using Solr as a web service.
