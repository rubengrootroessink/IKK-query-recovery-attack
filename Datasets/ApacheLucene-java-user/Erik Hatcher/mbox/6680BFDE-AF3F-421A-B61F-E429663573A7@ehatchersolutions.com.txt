Shyam - I moderated your message through, so please subscribe to the  
list to send to it in the future.

Please provide us with some details - a standalone RAMDirectory-using  
JUnit TestCase is the most ideal way to share an issue like this and  
have someone else take a look at it.  And frequently the act of  
distilling an issue down to a test case points out the error being  
made :)
