You should consider using the Ant <index> task in the Sandbox
(contributions/ant directory).  You'll need to write a custom document
handler implementation to handle PDF's and any other types you like.
The built-in handler does text and HTML files, but is pluggable.

The <index> task uses Ant's filesets to determine what should be
indexed, so you could simply have an excludes="include/" to exclude
that directory.
