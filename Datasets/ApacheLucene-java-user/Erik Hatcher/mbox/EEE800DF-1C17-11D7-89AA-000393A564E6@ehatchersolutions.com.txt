SUBJECT: Querying for documents that have a field
DATE: 30 Dec 2002

Is it possible to get a collection of documents based on whether they 
have a particular field (regardless of value)?  I'm indexing HTML 
documents, and want to pull out some information that may or may not be 
present in the documents (and adding a field if that information exists 
but not otherwise), but later I want to retrieve a list of all 
documents that have that field.

If its possible would you mind sharing how?   If not, are folks 
employing some kind of other tricks to accomplish something like this?

Thanks,
	Erik
