If you need to transfer an index from one machine to another all you  
need to do is move the index directory (by zipping it if you want).   
There isn't a need to put an index in a JAR just for transfer purposes.

There has been some work on a ZipDirectory (or JARDirectory?, not  
sure what it was called exactly) that you might find in the  
archives.  I don't think it was ever fully polished though.
