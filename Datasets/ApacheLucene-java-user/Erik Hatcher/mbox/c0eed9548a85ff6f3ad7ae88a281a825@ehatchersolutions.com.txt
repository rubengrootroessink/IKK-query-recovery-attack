Get a copy of Lucene in Action.  Otis wrote a great chapter on how to 
handle various document formats with Lucene:

It sounds like you're using the Lucene demo application.  That is a 
reasonable starting point, but you will very quickly want to diverge 
from it and integrate in a PDF reader (PDFBox being the best open 
source library) and something to read Office documents (TextMining for 
Word docs, perhaps POI for the other formats).

Also, have a look at Nutch - it may actually be the indexing/searching 
solution you want for your intranet rather than a custom Lucene 
application.
