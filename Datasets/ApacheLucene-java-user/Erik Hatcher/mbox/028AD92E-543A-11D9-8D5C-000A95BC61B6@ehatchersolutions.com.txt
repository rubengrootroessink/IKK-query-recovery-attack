Correction: Field.Text(String, String) is a stored field.  If you want 
unstored, use Field.UnStored(String, String).
This is a bit confusing because Field.Text(String, Reader) is not 
stored.  This confusion has been cleared up in the CVS version of 
Lucene and will be deprecated in the 1.9 release, and removed in the 
2.0 release.
