First, the phrase query with wildcards is not currently a built-in 
capability of Lucene.

You'll need some kind of lookup to know how to split a token like 
"cybercafe" into two words - once you've done that it will be easy to 
set the position increment of them to zero so that they overlay the 
original term.

Again the caveat about wildcard phrase queries applies.  You'll need to 
use that same lookup mechanism to combine multiple tokens coming 
through a token filter into a single combined one.

The approach I've described above is a crude dictionary-based one, but 
I'm sure other tricks could be employed but they would be quite 
sophisticated (N-gram sequencing ala LingPipe comes to mind).
