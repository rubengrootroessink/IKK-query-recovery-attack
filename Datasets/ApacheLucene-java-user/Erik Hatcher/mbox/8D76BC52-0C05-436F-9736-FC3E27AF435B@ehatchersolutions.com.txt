The problem I encountered when indexing "Lucene in Action" was that I  
couldn't just blindly concatenate two tokens because the first ends  
with a hyphen.  Some lines ended with a hyphen because it was a dash,  
not a hyphenated word.

I'm sure other more clever implementations could do this better, by  
looking up the concatenated word in a dictionary for instance.
