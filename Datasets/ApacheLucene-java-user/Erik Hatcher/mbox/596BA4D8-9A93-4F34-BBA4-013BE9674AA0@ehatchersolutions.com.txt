All stored field data in a Lucene index are Strings.  The performance  
difference you may be referring to is with sorting results, not in  
retrieval.

You will want to simply convert your int "days" into a String  
(Integer.toString(days) will do the trick.  Careful with your  
analyzer if you really do want days to be searchable/sortable.  Using  
Field.Keyword() is probably more appropriate.
