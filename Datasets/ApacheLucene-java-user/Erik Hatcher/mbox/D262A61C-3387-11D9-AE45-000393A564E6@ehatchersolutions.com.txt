I just ran the code you provided.  On my puny PowerBook (Mac OS X 
10.3.5) it dies in much less than 5 minutes.

I do not know what the issue is, but certainly the actions the program 
is taking are atypical.  Opening and closing an IndexWriter repeatedly 
is certainly expensive on large indexes.  Indexing documents in batches 
is more typical, I presume.

Also, maybe you need to put some sleep into the code to give the JVM a 
chance to catch its breath?  Does that alleviate the issue?
