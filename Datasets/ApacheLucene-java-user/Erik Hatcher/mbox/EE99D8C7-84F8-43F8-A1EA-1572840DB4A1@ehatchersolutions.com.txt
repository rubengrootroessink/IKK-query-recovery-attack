Lucene's build.xml uses some advanced techniques that it seems  
Eclipse isn't dealing with.  build.xml <import>s common-build.xml  
which <macrodef>s a compile task which is a wrapper around <javac>.

Are you wanting to have an Eclipse project that works with the Lucene  
source code itself?  Or are you using the Lucene JAR in another  
project of your own source code?  It's easy enough to create a  
project in Eclipse to work with Lucene's source, ignoring build.xml.   
Lucene's core has no external dependencies so simply configure a new  
project with src/java for the source code.
