QueryParser is a Query "factory".   It takes a String and parses it  
into a Query, and depending on the expression in that String it could  
be one of many different types of Query subclasses.

There is no difference in searching at all.... you search with a  
Query, and how that query got built is immaterial.

QueryParser has its limitations, and one of them is to prevent the  
possibility of a prefixed wildcard query such as "*foo" which would  
have to enumerate all terms in the index and quite possibly blow up  
BooleanQuery as it rewrites the query or perhaps cause performance  
issues.

QueryParser is a one-size-sorta-fits-all kinda thing.  It's a decent  
general purpose tool to get going, but most of my projects use  
QueryParser sparingly only within small pieces of the ultimate query.

Neither QueryParser or Query factor into the size of the index or how  
to manage a frequently changing index, totally unrelated topics.
