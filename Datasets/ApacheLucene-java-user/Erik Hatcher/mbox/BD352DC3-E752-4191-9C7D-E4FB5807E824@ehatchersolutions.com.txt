I'd be in big trouble if Lucene couldn't handle dates in the  
1850's :)  My life revolves around 19th century literature at http:// 
www.nines.org where I'm building the "Google of 19th century  
literature".  I hope to have a working system deployed in the next  
few weeks.  I've got development prototypes with faceted browsing  
(much like the CNET interface, as well as like the cool Flamenco  
interface) along with full-text search.

To echo what others have said... index years as a String YYYY if only  
years are relevant, or YYYYMM if you need months, or YYYYMMDD if you  
need full dates.

     Erik
