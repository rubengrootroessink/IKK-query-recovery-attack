SUBJECT: Re: building lucene-1.4.3 from source yields lucene-1.5-rc1-dev.jar?
DATE: 16 Dec 2004

The rationale, or at least the one I'm making up right now, is that if 
you pull down the source distribution, modify some files, and build it, 
you are now most definitely *not* using Lucene 1.4.3.  It would be 
confusing to those of us supporting Lucene to get a bug report for 
1.4.3 when it is really a custom forked version.
