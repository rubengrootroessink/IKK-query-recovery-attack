No, that never has been a design goal of Query.toString(), and there  
many cases that it fails.  QueryParser only supports a fraction of  
the Query subclasses out there, so any Query subclass it does not  
support, of course, will fail to parse as you're expecting.

I understand the benefit such a feature would have, though.
