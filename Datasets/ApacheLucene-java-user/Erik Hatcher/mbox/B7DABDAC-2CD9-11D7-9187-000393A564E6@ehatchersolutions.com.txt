The current CVS of HitsIterator is hard-coded to a single field to sort 
upon.  Your code is more general, as well as the changes I made locally 
and independently.  So at least that part seems generally applicable.

All I'm asking is that you diff your code, if you like, and submit it 
as a patch, and note anything you feel isn't general enough and I could 
tweak it appropriately.

couldn't resist the King of the Hill paraphrase)
