Greetings,

I'll be presenting along with some of our customers from Motley Fool  
at a free webinar, sponsored by Lucid Imagination, entitled "Take  
Control of Your Search Destiny: Migrating to Apache Solr/Lucene Open  
Source Search" .

I'll be joined by Motley Fool Director of Search Danny Hsia and Motley  
Fool Search VP Tech Operation Chad Wolfsheimer, to discuss how The  
Motley Fool took control of their search technology and migrated to  
Lucene/Solr Open Source Search â€“ and how they dramatically improved  
search relevancy, speed, versatility and costs.

You're welcome to join or to forward this to someone who might like to.

Thanks,
	Erik
