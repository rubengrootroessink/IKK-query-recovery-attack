Well, a roundabout way is to simply create a FuzzyQuery, rewrite it,  
cast it to a BooleanQuery and use the BooleanQuery API to extract the  
TermQuery objects and the Term within the TermQuery has what you're  
looking for.  That's actually not a bad way to go, but you could also  
go more low-level and borrow the technique used under FuzzyQuery itself:
