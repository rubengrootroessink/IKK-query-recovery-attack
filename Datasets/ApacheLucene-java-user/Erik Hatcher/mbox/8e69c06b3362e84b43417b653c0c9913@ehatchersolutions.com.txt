Do I think its right?  That's just the way it is.  Whether that is 
right or not I don't know for sure.  I don't think analyzing a wildcard 
expression is going to do the right thing in most cases - consider 
analyzers that split on special characters like ? and * - in fact I'd 
bet your analyzer currently does that!

Your free to subclass QueryParser and override getWildcardQuery and 
analyze the term text.  I suspect you won't have much success though.  
Please let us know what you find.
