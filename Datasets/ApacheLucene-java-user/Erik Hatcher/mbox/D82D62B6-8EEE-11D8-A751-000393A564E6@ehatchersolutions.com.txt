This is great to see!  I've been presenting Lucene at the No Fluff, 
Just Stuff symposiums for a while and really enjoy doing so.  I also 
presented it last year at the O'Reilly Open Source Conference with the 
toughest attendee possible, Doug Cutting himself.

I'm continuing my Lucene presentations this year still on the NFJS 
tour, and also I will be presenting it at JavaOne.  The JavaOne 
presentation is only one hour though, so it will be a very quick (yet 
techie) pass through what Lucene offers.

Let's create a wiki page that lists all the venues for Lucene 
presentations and training.  If you are in the US and near a city 
listed here <http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com> come on out!
