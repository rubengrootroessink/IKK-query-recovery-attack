QueryFilter caches the results (bit set of documents) of a query by 
IndexReader.

CachingWrapperFilter does not actually do any filtering of its own, but 
merely wraps the results of another non-caching filter, such as 
DateFilter.  CachingWrapperFilter was added to disconnect caching from 
filtering.  QueryFilter is the exception as it came first and already 
does caching.  If you're using QueryFilter, there is no need to concern 
yourself with CachingWrapperFilter.

How you keep a reference to the IndexSearcher instance is up to the 
design of your system.  But, yes, you do need to keep a reference to it 
for the cache to work properly.  If you use a new IndexSearcher 
instance (I'm simplifying here, you could have an IndexReader instance 
yourself too, but I'm ignoring that possibility) then the filtering 
process occurs for each search rather than using the cache.
