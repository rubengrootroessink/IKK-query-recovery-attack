So does Simpy - it's the social bookmarking / folksonomy system  
developed by our very own Otis Gospodnetic.

I'm also building a collaborative and social "bookmarking" system  
(hopefully deployed live in the next few weeks in pre-alpha status  
for scholars to tinker with).  My current architecture does not use  
Lucene for tags, but rather RDF and Kowari.  I have full-text search  
for content, but tags are currently treated precisely and full-text  
search is not needed on them.
