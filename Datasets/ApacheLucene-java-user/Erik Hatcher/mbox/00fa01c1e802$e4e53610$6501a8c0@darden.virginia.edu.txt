HttpUnit (which uses JTidy under the covers) makes childs play out of
pulling out links and navigating to them.

The only caveat (and this would be true for practically all tools, I
suspect) is that the HTML has to be relatively well-formed for it to work
well.  JTidy can be somewhat forgiving though.
