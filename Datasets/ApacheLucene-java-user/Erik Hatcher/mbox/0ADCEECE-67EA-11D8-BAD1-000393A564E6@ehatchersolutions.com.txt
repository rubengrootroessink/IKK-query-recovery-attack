I'd recommend a pool of filters for each category.  Regenerate them 
when the index changes, otherwise leave the instances alive and reuse 
them for queries - this will speed things up pretty dramatically I'd 
guess.  There is a QueryFilter you could use, or write a custom one 
that could be faster.
