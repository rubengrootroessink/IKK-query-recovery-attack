Filters in general were meant for one-time creation and caching.  If  
the date ranges are fixed and the index not being updated, then  
DateFilters will work fine as you only create each filter once.  If  
the index updates, thats ok, as you can simply reinstantiate the  
filters when that occurs.

My recommendation is for you to consider using YYYYMMDD format for  
your dates to begin with, but I'd like to see more about the range of  
dates that you're indexing and what kind of ranges you need to  
accommodate for searching.
