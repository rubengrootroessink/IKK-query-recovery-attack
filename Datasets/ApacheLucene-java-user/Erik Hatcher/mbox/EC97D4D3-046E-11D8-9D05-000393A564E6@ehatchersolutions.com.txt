That is correct.... currently a match would be found.  Here's a little 
test case I'm working with:

     Directory directory = new RAMDirectory();
     IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(directory, new 
StandardAnalyzer(), true);
     Document doc = new Document();
     doc.add(Field.Text("contents", "The quick brown fox jumped over the 
lazy dogs"));
     writer.addDocument(doc);
     writer.close();

     IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(directory);
     QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("contents", new 
StandardAnalyzer());
     Query query = parser.parse("\"over lazy\"");

     Hits hits = searcher.search(query);
     assertEquals(1, hits.length());

which currently passes.... although should not I don't think.

I concur.  StopFilter just removes terms, but does not adjust the 
following acceptable term with the offset to account for the missing 
stop words.
