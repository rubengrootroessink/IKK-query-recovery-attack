SUBJECT: Re: Lucene app to index Java code
DATE: 4 Sep 2003

A couple of thoughts on this:

- Eclipse uses Lucene for its code indexing/searching (I learned this 
at the OSCON Keynote by Eclipse folks).  Perhaps looking at how Eclipse 
does its thing would be useful even if not the solution.

- XDoclet could be used to sweep through Java code and build a text/XML 
file as richly as you'd like from the information there (complete with 
JavaDoc tags, which Zapata will miss :)), and then run Lucene on the 
generated files.  On a related note, the XDoclet2 architecture would 
streamline this even further by eliminating the middle textual 
representation (QDox/XJavadoc reads Java as a "meta data provider" and 
then a Lucene "plugin" indexes things).  It could be done without the 
intermediate text representation even in XDoclet 1.2, but it would 
require coding a custom subtask and be slightly out of the norm for 
XDoclet subtasks (but would work just fine).

- My <index> task could be used, but it would be better to use 
something that built a complete object-graph of all the source code you 
want indexed, so that it can deal with base classes, inherited javadoc 
tags, and other such interactions between classes you might want to 
capture.
