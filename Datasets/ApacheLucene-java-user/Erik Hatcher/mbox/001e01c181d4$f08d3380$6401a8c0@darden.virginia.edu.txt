SUBJECT: Re: Include ANT in CVS?
DATE: 10 Dec 2001

The ant-dev team work very hard to maintain backwards compatibility and
anything that breaks a Lucene build will be caught by Gump long before a
release version of Ant or Lucene is made.

All of us doing Java development should have Ant already installed anyway,
no?!  :)

Is there something specifically breaking the Lucene build that is Ant
related?  If so, what?
