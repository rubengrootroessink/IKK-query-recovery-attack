So the issue is how to update the Lucene index more rapidly when data 
in the DB changes?

If there is a single point of code that DB code goes through and all DB 
changes are under your control then hooking that point for updating 
Lucene makes sense.  Perhaps aspect-oriented programming could come 
into play to separate the Lucene indexing concern from the DB updating 
code?

Database triggers would be a good place to hook Lucene indexing if 
different processes not under your control are updating data that needs 
to be indexed.
