Yes, I do.  It just takes a bit of time to do as I've not automated 
that step.  It requires digitally signing several files and several 
other currently manual steps while I'm looking at the instructions.

I apologize for not doing this  yet myself.  Other committers can also 
do this too if they are so inclined.
