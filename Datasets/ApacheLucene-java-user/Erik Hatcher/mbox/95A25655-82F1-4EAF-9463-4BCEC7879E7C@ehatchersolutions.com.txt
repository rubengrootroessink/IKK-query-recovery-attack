Well, there are lots of techniques for all sorts of tricks with  
Lucene.  What you're basically asking for is an untokenized, indexed  
field and a TermQuery to find a document with an exact match for a  
field.  Will that work for your situation?  If not, give us some more  
details of why that doesn't work and we'll work from there.
