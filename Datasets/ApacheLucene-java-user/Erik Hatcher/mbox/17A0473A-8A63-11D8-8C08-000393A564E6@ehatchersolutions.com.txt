Patterns are work-arounds for language deficiences :)

Don't use patterns because some book said so - use them if they are the 
pragmatic choice.  Flattening data for reports or search results and 
perhaps being a little more coupled to Lucene between tiers in order to 
avoid performance problems seems a wise way to approach it.  Or go 
straight to Lucene from the presentation tier - no one said you had to 
proxy it through some other layer.

I would highly recommend *against* loading all documents from a search 
into a collection and passing it across tiers - you're only asking for 
trouble.
