Your question is not clear.  But I'm always happy to lend a hand...

Try the query:
	COM\(2005\) 0123

Parentheses are special characters with Lucene's QueryParser, so  
escaping them with a backslash is needed.

But also be aware of the analyzer setting and the parsed query Luke  
displays.  Your question brings up a whole slew of Lucene  
Troubleshooting 101 steps:

   * What exactly are you trying to find?
   * How was it indexed?
      - What analyzer(s), what field types
   * What are your users interacting with to search the index?   
(probably not Luke, right?)
   * How will the users interface build the queries issued?
