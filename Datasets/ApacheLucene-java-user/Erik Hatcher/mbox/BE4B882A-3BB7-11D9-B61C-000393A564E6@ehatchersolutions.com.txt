The caching is there to avoid disk access of the Lucene index for the 
documents most likely to be accessed next.

That's quite a lot of data.  You'll have to do more than just use plain 
Lucene to handle this much data, of course.

My advice would be to not worry about caching unless and until you need 
it.  You're searching terrabytes, you say, but that does not mean you 
are accessing every single document that comes back from searches.  One 
big issue is how you access the documents you get back from hits - 
accessing a document is when Lucene goes to the index and retrieves 
(currently) the entire document including all the stored fields.  
Minimizing the documents you access in this way (say displaying 10 or 
20 at a time, which is typical) is wise.

I really don't see a need for any custom caching on top of Lucene.  
Remember the rule of optimization: don't.  And for experts only: don't 
do it yet.  :)

Hits is not tunable.  It caches up to 200 documents.  Though you can 
use Lucene's lower-level search() API methods to do some of your own 
magic if you like - look to see how Hits does its thing with the basic 
search(Query) method.
