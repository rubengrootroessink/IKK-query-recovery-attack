Could you share the details of your SynonymFilter?  Is it adding  
tokens into the same position as the original tokens (position  
increment of 0)?   Are you using QueryParser for searching?  If so,  
try TermQuery to eliminate the parser's analysis from the picture for  
the time being while trouble shooting.

If you are using QueryParser, are you using the same analyzer?  If  
this is the case, what is the .toString of the generated Query?
