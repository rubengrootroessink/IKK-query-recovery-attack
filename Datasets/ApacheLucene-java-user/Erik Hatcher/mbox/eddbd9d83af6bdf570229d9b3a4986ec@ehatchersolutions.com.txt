SUBJECT: JavaLobby Lucene presentation
DATE: 20 Feb 2005

I recorded a "Meet Lucene" presentation at JavaLobby.  It is a  
multimedia Flash video that shows slides with my voice recorded over  
them which spans just over 20 minutes (you can jump to specific  
slides).    Check it out here:

It's tailored as a high-level overview, and a quick one at that.  It'll  
certainly be too basic for most everyone on this list, but maybe your  
manager would enjoy it :)

It's awkward to record this type of thing and it sounds dry to me as I  
ended up having to script what I was going to say and read it rather  
than ad-lib like I would do in a face-to-face presentation.  ah's and  
um's don't work well in an audio-only track.

I'd love to hear (perhaps best through the JavaLobby forum associated  
with the presentation) feedback on it.

	Erik
