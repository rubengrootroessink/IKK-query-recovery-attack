Lucene 1.4.x contains a term vector feature (see the javadocs for 
Field) that you can enable.  This does not give you position 
information though.  In the latest codebase (obtained via Subversion) 
the term vector feature has been enhanced to allow (optionally) the 
capturing of term positions and then also term offsets.

I recommend you try out the latest codebase for these features.
