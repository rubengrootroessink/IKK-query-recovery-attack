QueryFilter would do the trick if you instead used the query you handed 
to it to be the one to single out a "sub-category".  It would limit the 
documents searched to just the sub-category, and the fuzzy search would 
be done using IndexSearcher.search, only handing it the filter then as 
well.

Will this scheme work for you?
