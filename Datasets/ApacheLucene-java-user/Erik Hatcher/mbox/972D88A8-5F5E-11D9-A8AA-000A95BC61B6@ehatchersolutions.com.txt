Yes, absolutely.  The flaw you have stumbled on was completely an 
oversight and a mistake that should not have occurred.  I, for one, 
apologize for not catching it.  Only because I have custom QueryParser 
subclasses and lots of unit tests did I catch the signature changes 
that I did, and I'm not sure how I missed this one.  I have not gone 
back, yet, to review the change history and whether my code is broken 
in one of those versions of Lucene, or whether I've not overridden that 
method.

In short - we screwed up, and we should fix it since its obviously 
important to you.

	Erik
