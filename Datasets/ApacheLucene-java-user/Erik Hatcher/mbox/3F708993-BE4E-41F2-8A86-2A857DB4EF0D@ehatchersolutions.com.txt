SUBJECT: Re: Problems with sandbox - can't find org.apache.lucene.store.IndexInput
DATE: 2 Jan 2006

I haven't checked the specifics, but many of the contrib (the  
"sandbox" is the old name for it) projects have upgraded their latest  
code to be against the trunk of Lucene, which is destined to be  
Lucene 1.9.  You'll need to either grab a previous JAR built before  
the codebase changed, or upgrade yourself to the trunk of Lucene's  
subversion repository all the way around.
