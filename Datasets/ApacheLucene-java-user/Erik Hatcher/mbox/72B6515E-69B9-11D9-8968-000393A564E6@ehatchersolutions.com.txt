I don't have experience with NFS, but the issue has cropped up numerous 
times on this e-mail list, and the general advice is "don't use Lucene 
on NFS drives, period", and that is why we provided that same advice in 
LIA.  However, I'm admittedly unknowledgeable in the reason the problem 
exists.

Right - concurrent writes to the index could cause trouble.
