Lucene in Action has a SecurityFilterTest example (grab the source code 
distribution).  You can see a glimpse of this here:

	http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=security

So yes, its possible to index a username or roles alongside each 
document and apply that criteria to any search a user makes such that a 
user only gets documents allowed.  How complex this gets depends on how 
you need the permissions to work - the LIA example is rudimentary and 
simply associates an "owner" with each document and users are only 
allowed to see the documents they own.
