To echo what Otis said - I don't know of any myself.

I'd be very interested to hear yours, and others, thoughts on what  
Lucene in Action 2nd edition should add/remove to its coverage.   
There are lots of topics that I've researched and worked on since  
that book that I think make sense to add, but community feedback will  
decide ultimately how LIA 2.0 unfolds.
