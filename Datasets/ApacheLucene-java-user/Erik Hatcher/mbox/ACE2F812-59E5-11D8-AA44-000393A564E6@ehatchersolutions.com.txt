I'm not quite following your Filter questions, but QueryFilter seems to 
fit the bill for what you are trying to do.  Just keep around the 
previous query, and filter on it for successive searches.

Document numbers change when a hole has been made by a delete and the 
index is optimized.  So, I think your assumption is fine, but 
personally I'm weary of relying on something potentially transient.  
Perhaps there is another way to accomplish what you are after?  A 
TermQuery is very fast, so maybe that could get you directly to a 
document of interest instead?
