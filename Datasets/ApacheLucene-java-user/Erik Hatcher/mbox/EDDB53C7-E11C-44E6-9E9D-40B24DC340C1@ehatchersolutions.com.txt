I built a suggest interface into Collex here:

	<http://www.nines.org/collex/browse>

You can type either into the "phrase" box, or in the "name" box.    
The "name" box gives back role information as well (try "ros" for  
rossetti).  In both, counts are provided for how many documents  
_within the current constraints_ match the prefix typed.  Under the  
covers its using Solr.
