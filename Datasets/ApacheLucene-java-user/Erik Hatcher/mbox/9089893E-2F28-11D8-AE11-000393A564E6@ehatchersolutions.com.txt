Not currently.

Treating them as two separate words when quoted is indicative of your 
analyzer not being sufficient for your domain.  What Analyzer are you 
using?  Do you have knowledge of what it is tokenizing text into?

This is an open issue in Lucene.  You and the community would be better 
served if you were able to fix the existing QueryParser and submit the 
fix back to us.  Is it possible someone has already done this and it is 
pending in Bugzilla?  (I haven't checked, searching Bugzilla with 
Safari doesn't work *sigh* - so it is a pain for me to do).
