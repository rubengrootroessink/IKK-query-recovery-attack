It's long been on my TODO list.  I just adapted (changed the package  
names) the Lucene in Action KeywordAnalyzer and added it to the new  
contrib area:

	http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/analyzers/ 
src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KeywordAnalyzer.java

In the next official release of Lucene, the contrib (formerly known as  
the Sandbox) components will be packaged along with the Lucene core.   
I'm still working on this packaging build process as I migrate the  
Sandbox over to contrib.

	Erik
