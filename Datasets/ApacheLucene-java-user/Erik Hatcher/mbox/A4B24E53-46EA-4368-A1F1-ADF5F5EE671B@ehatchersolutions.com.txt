If you have a copy of "Lucene in Action", check out the TheServerSide  
case study that Dion Almaer contributed.  TSS boosts more recent  
content.

If you're re-indexing (for example nightly, like TSS does) you can  
dynamically adjust boosts on the document based on last modified date.

If you need to boost without reindexing, I'm not quite sure what the  
best solution is - perhaps a custom Query subclass that can do this  
based on the current date?
