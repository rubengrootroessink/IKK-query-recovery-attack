A Document only carries along its *stored* fields.  Fields that are 
indexed, but not stored, are not retrievable from Document.

Have a look at the tool Luke (Google for "luke lucene" :) and see how 
it does its "Reconstruct and Edit" facility.  It is possible, though 
potentially lossy, to reconstruct a document and add it again.
