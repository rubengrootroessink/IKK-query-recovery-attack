SUBJECT: Re: DocumentWriter, StopFilter should use HashMap... (patch)
DATE: 9 Mar 2004

Well, one issue you didn't consider is changing a public method 
signature.  I will make this change, but leave the Hashtable signature 
method there.  I suppose we could change the signature to use a Map 
instead, but I believe there are some issues with doing something like 
this if you do not recompile your own source code against a new Lucene 
JAR.... so I will simply provide another signature too.
