If you know ahead of time that queries of this type would be made, then 
it could be "optimized" by doing the query that has the fewest hits 
first, then using a QueryFilter for successive queries to narrow it to 
the precise criteria.  Granted this doesn't help when the queries can 
be entered free-form via QueryParser.
