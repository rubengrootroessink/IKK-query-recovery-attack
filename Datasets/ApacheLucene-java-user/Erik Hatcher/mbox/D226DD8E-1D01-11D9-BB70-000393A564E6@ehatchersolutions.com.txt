They are different internally.  Externally they should return identical 
results and not appear different at all.

Internally, ParallelMultiSearcher searches each index in a separate 
thread (searches wait until all threads finish before returning).   In 
MultiSearcher, each index is searched serially.

You will not likely see a benefit to using ParallelMultiSearcher unless 
your environment is specialized to accommodate multi-threading 
(multiple CPU's, indexes on separate drives that can operate 
independently, etc).

There is no external difference to using either implementation.  
Benchmark searches using both and see what is best, but generally 
MultiSeacher will be better in most environments as it avoids the 
overhead of starting up and managing multiple threads.
