I'm not sure what you plan on doing with the fileName field, but you 
probably want to use a Keyword field for it.

And you may want to glue the file name and contents together into a 
single field to facilitate searches to span both.  (be sure to put a 
space in between if you do this)

By using true on the finalQuery.add calls, you have said that both 
fields must have the word "temp" in them.  Is that what you meant?  Or 
did you mean an OR type of query?
