What would be the best way?  Use Lucene outside of EJB.  It's quite 
silly to make such a decision "purely due to a policy decision" when 
the technicalities of it show that it is an unwise decision.

You're going to navigate Hits through a session bean?  And as you said, 
the EJB spec says not to use file I/O from EJB's.  That is a good 
recommendation if you are distributing your system across servers and 
replication is occurring - if another call to a session bean occurs and 
ends up on a different server, then the file handle is lost.

I violate the spec in my JavaDevWithAnt project and have one mode where 
I have a stateless session bean returning search results: 
http://www.ehatchersolutions.com/JavaDevWithAnt - but I definitely do 
not recommend it.  It works when you are in a single-server 
environment.

In summary - EJB and Lucene are not a good mix - don't force it just to 
be buzzword compliant.
