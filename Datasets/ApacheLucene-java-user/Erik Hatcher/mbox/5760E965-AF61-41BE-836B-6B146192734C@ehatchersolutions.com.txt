The new MemoryIndex might be perfect for this sort of thing.  I  
suspect Microsoft's search doesn't allow anything but a term/exact- 
phrase kinda query, so even MemoryIndex might be doing more work (and  
thus slower) for a fair comparison.  However, you'd be able to do  
rich queries using MemoryIndex and it has been heavily tuned for  
performance.  The slow part will be simply reading the files and  
converting them.
