Try the tips here: 
http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/AnalysisParalysis - you need to 
analyze your analyzer and ensure what you think was indexed actually 
was.  Also, look into using Luke - http://www.getopt.org/luke/ - to see 
what makes your index tick.

Yes.  That's just the nature of how it works.  Getting the analysis 
right is important stuff, and if you didn't index it, you can't search 
for it!

Feel free to share more details of your analyzer, and we'd be happy to 
"analyze" it.
