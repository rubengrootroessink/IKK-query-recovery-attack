Don't forget to get your copy of "Lucene in Action" too :)

Some suggestions:  index degree as a Keyword field.  Pad GPA, so that 
all of them are the form #.# (or #.## maybe).  Numerics need to be 
lexicographically ordered, and thus padded.

With the right analyzer (see the AnalysisParalysis page on the wiki) 
you could use this type of query with QueryParser:'

	degree:cs AND gpa:[3.0 TO 9.9]

There is a LuceneRAR project that is still in its infancy here: 
https://lucenerar.dev.java.net/

You can also store a Lucene index in Berkeley DB (look at the 
/contrib/db area of the source code repository)

However, most projects do fine with "cruder" techniques such as sharing 
the Lucene index on a common drive and ensuring that locking is 
configured to use the common drive also.
