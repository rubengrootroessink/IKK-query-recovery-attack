In my code that I pulled that example from, I store data in another 
field ("body") but do not search on that field (since it is HTML 
content).  I modified the example slightly to paste in the e-mail, and 
I actually glue bodyText into the "contents" field.  bodyText is the 
text-only part of "body".  There is some duplication, agreed, but so 
far performance has not at all been an issue.
