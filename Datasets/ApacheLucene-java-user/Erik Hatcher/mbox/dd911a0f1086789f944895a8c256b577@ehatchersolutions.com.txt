Submit patches in unified diff format to Lucene's issue tracking system 
- see the links on the Lucene site.

The goal is to have 1.9 backwards compatible with 1.4.3 API, but many 
things will be deprecated.  2.0 will remove all those deprecated 
methods.  If you can your app with 1.9 without deprecation warnings, 
then you can upgrade cleanly to 2.0.  Functionally 1.9 and 2.0 will be 
the same though.

I don't think at this point anything structural has been proposed as 
different between 1.9 and 2.0.

Improvements always welcome!
