No question that it'd be unwise to do.  We could say the same argument 
for making everything public access as well and say it'd be stupid to 
override this method, but we made it public anyway.  I'd rather opt on 
the side of safety.

Besides, you haven't provided a use case for why you need to get the 
searchers back from a MultiSearcher :)
