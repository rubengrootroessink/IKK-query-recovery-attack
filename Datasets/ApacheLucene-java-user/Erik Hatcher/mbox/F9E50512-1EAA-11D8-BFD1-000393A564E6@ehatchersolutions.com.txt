Well, nothing is "hidden" when you have a nice IDE :))

In IntelliJ, I did this:

- Ctrl-n, typed "simi" followed by return, which took me to 
Similarity.java
- Ctrl-h

Two subclasses appeared: DefaultSimilarity, and 
TestSimilarity.SimpleSimilarity.

So there are two subclasses within Lucene's codebase, one used for 
testing.  To see it's usage, have a look at TestSimilarity.  The test 
cases are a great place to look for "documentation".

As for weighting - the scoring process uses weighting based on the type 
of query - look at the Query class and its subclasses to see those 
details.
