As John said - you'll have to come up with some way of knowing whether 
you should index or not.  For example, when dealing with filesystem 
files, the Ant <index> task (in the sandbox) checks last modified date 
and only indexes new files.

Using a unique id on your data (primary key from a DB, URL from web 
pages, etc) is generally what people use for this.
