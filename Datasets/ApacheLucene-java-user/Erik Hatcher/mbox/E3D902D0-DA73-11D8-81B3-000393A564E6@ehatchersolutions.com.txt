I have already provided my opinion on this one - I think it would be 
fine to allow Token to be public.  I'll let others respond to the 
additional requests you've made.

Wow - I didn't realize that they've made local changes.  Did they post 
with requests for opening things up as you have?  Did they submit 
patches with their local changes?

Then they should speak up :)

Making things extensible for no good reason is asking for maintenance 
troubles later when you need more control internally.  Lucene has been 
well designed from the start with extensibility only where it was 
needed in mind.  It has evolved to be more open in very specific areas 
after careful consideration of the performance impact has been weighed. 
  "Breaking" is not really the concern with extensibility, I don't 
think.  Real-world use cases are needed to show that changes need to be 
made.
