The only caveat to your VerbatimAnalyzer is that it will still split 
strings that are over 255 characters.  CharTokenizer does that.  
Granted, though, that keyword fields probably don't make much sense to 
be that long.

As mentioned yesterday - I added the LIA KeywordAnalyzer into the 
contrib area of Subversion.  I had built one like you had also, but the 
one I contributed reads the entire input stream into a StringBuffer 
ensuring it does not get split like CharTokenizer would.
