SUBJECT: Lucene 1.3 FINALly mirrored
DATE: 3 Feb 2004

Doug asked me to take care of the logistics of pushing the Lucene 1.3 
FINAL release to the Apache site properly so that it is mirrored 
worldwide.  Last weekend I said the right magic incantations and it 
looks like it has been successful.  So, without further ado, Lucene 1.3 
is now completely official.  To grab it, start at the binary download 
site:
