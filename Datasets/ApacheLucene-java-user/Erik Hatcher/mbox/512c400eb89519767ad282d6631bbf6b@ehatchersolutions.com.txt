You can use an IndexReader and IndexWriter at the same time (the caveat 
is that you cannot delete with the IndexReader at the same time you're 
writing with an IndexWriter).  Is there no other identifying 
information, though, on the incoming documents with a date stamp?  
Identifier?  Or something unique you can go on?
