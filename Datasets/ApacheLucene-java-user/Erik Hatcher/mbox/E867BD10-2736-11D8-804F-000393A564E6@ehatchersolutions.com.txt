So use Field.UnStored(String, String) then.  It is the same as 
Field.Text(String, Reader).

The static "factory" methods on Field are merely for convenience.  You 
can control all the flags yourself using the constructor:

	public Field(String name, String string,
	       boolean store, boolean index, boolean token)

You could always use a StringReader wrapper :))
