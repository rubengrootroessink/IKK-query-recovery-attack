What you are doing looks fine to me.  I'm sure these are obvious 
questions, kinda like "is your computer plugged in?", but here goes:

- How are you determining that the document is still there?  With an 
IndexReader?  IndexSearcher?
- A freshly created (i.e. after the delete) Index[Searcher|Reader]?
- And finally, did you remember to recompile?!  :))  (just kidding)
