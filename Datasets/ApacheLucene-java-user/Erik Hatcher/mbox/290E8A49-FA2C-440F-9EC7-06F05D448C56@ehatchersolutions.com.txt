Paul - if stemming is what you're looking for, then grab the  
SnowballAnalyzer code from Subversion under contrib/snowball.  Or you  
could get a binary copy of the JAR from the source code distribution  
of Lucene in Action at http://www.lucenebook.com (and see examples of  
its use in the sample code there).  Lucene's JAR does have a built-in  
PorterStemFilter, but none of the built-in analyzers use it, and the  
SnowballAnalyzer is more commonly used anyway.
