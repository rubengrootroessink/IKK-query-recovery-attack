The "Document" is the granularity of search results, so if you want 
results by page, then a page should correspond to a Document instance.  
I'm not sure you'd need the parent concept except as a field to 
represent the actual document the page comes from if you are indexing 
several multi-page documents.  Unfortunately "document" is far too 
overloaded in the previous sentences.  I think you are onto the right 
approach though.
