Please keep discussion on the e-mail list.  I'm not familiar with the 
fields and types that Nutch uses first-hand, but you should take this 
up on the Nutch list rather than the Lucene list.

I do know that Nutch uses a custom query parser, so perhaps it does not 
allow range and proximity queries?
