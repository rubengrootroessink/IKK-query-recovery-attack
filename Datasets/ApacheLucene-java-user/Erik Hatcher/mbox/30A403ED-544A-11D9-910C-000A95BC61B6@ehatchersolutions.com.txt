Consider that you're only highlighting 20 or so entries at one time.  
Getting the text from a Lucene index you're already navigating will be 
quite quick.  But it shouldn't be too bad to pull 20 records from a 
database either.

There is one other consideration, and that is to use the new (CVS only) 
feature of capturing term vectors with position information.  The 
author of the Highlighter, Mark Harwood, has posted in the not too 
distant past, an update to the Highlighter that can use this position 
information for highlighting rather than re-analyzing the original 
text.  The re-analysis of the text may be the bottleneck, not the 
database access.
