Vladimir,

I have just taken a look at your submitted patches.  I have no  
objections to making Cp1251 the default charset used in the no-arg  
constructor to RussianAnalyzer, but all of your other changes are  
formatting along with the addition of some other constructors.

Could you please provide a functionality-only diff for your patches,  
preferably in a single file attached to a Bugzilla issue?

Thanks,
	Erik
