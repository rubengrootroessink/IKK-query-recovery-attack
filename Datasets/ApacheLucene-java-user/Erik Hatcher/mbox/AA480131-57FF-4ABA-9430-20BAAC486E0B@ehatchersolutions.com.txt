There's a bunch of stuff listed here: <http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/Resources

Lucene has been changing so rapidly lately that I'm not aware of any  
articles that are entirely up-to-date API-wise, but again in general  
most of those API changes are pretty minor and actually well  
documented in Lucene's CHANGES.txt and deprecation warnings (upgrading  
from 1.4 to 1.9, for example, primed users with nice deprecation  
warnings with what was going to be removed).
