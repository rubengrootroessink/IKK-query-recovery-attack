Indexing and searching Chinese basically is no different than using 
English with Lucene.  We covered a bit about it in Lucene in Action:

And a screenshot here:

The main issues of dealing with Chinese, and of course other languages, 
are encoding concerns in both indexing and querying of reading in the 
text and analysis (as you can see from the screenshot).

Lucene itself works with Unicode fine and you're free to index anything.
