There really is no difference in these approaches for identifiers.   
Different field instances have a positional gap feature, but that  
wouldn't be a consideration for TermQuery's on these identifiers.  I  
recommend the multiple keyword field approach, to avoid having to  
deal with analysis (in case identifiers have special characters, etc).
