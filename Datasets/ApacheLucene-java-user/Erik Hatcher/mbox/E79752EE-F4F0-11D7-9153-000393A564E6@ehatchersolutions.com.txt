Have you ever had an unstable version of Lucene?!  :)

I would not at all be concerned with grabbing a nightly build of 
Lucene, but certainly I'd test my system (you do have tests, right?) 
with whatever version you use.

This is usually a pretty silly question for open-source projects as it 
relies on someone to volunteer their time and agreement with the 
community.  I'm perfectly fine with releasing what is there now as 1.3 
(as an RC first, then quickly followed by a final).  Check the -dev 
list for any remainder to-do items and lobby there for a release - that 
is where such discussions occur.
