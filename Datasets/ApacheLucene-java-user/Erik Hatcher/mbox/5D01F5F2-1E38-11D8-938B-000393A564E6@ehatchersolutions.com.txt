I'm guessing you're using Field.Keyword(String, Date) for modifieddate? 
  The date field stuff in Lucene is really a timestamp, and doing a 
range query enumerates all the terms for that field in that ranging 
making a big ol' boolean OR query of all the individual ones.  Since 
you want this to be just a date, use Field.Keyword(String, "YYYYMMDD") 
instead.  But.... you'll want to subclass QueryParser and override 
getRangeQuery to do the right date format parsing from "MM/DD/YYYY" 
into "YYYYMMDD" rather than the internal Date representation Lucene 
uses for "date" fields.
