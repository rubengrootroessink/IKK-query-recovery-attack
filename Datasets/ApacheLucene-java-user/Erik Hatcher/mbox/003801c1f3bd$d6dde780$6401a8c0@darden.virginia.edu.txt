Also, while it has no details whatsoever of Lucene's API, the sample
application I built for my soon to be released Java Development with Ant
book uses Lucene heavily.  http://www.manning.com/hatcher/

I do mention Lucene in many places throughout the book, and even cover the
JavaCC task with a sample from Lucene's own build file!

I'll be committing my Ant task for Lucene indexing, on which the sample
application relies, to the Lucene sandbox as soon as I get an opportunity
(it has already been posted to the lucene-dev list, so its available in the
archives).
