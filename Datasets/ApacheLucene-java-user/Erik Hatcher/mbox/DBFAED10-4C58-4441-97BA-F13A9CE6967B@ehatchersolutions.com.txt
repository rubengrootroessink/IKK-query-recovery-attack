PrecedenceQueryParser was my tinkering attempt to make it more  
logically handle precedence.  I don't recall the exact issues that  
occur, though a JIRA issue was just filed with one:

    <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-792>
    "NOT foo AND baz" is parsed as "-(+foo +baz)" instead of "-foo  
+bar".
    (I'm setting parser.setDefaultOperator 
(PrecedenceQueryParser.AND_OPERATOR) but the issue applies otherwise  
too.)

I believe the test case points out some potential issues.  In other  
words, PrecedenceQueryParser is a work-in-progress that I no longer  
am working on myself.  Improvements to it welcome.  Query parsing is  
tricky business!
