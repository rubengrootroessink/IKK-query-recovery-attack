It's no secret that Otis' wonderful Simpy is powered by Lucene.

I'm in the process of building a folksonomy-based application that  
allows collecting scholarly objects, annotating and tagging them, and  
it is leveraging Lucene.  It is currently in development, so nothing  
worth showing at this point, but hopefully in a few months it'll be  
presentable.
