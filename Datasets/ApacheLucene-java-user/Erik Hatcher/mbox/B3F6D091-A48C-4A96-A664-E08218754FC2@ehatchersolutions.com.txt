The latest Highlighter source code is now specific to the TRUNK of  
the core Lucene API (which will be Lucene 1.9/2.0).  You will need to  
pull a previous version somehow (I'm not sure if the Subversion  
repository for contrib goes back that far or you'll need to get at  
the CVS attic for jakarta-lucene-sandbox).

You can get a binary of a 1.4 compatible Highlighter JAR from the  
source code that comes with Lucene in Action at http:// 
www.lucenebook.com
