Query parsing/expansion is the holy grail.  There are so many ways to 
do this sort of thing that I'm mostly of the opinion it is a 
per-project customization to get it tuned for the needs of that 
project.

Nutch has done some nice things with query parsing/expansion and 
extensibility.

I'm all for a more extensible base to work from, no question.

I'm personally not fond of MultiFieldQueryParser - I much prefer 
aggregate fields that are indexed (not stored) to be used for queries.  
Blindly expanding queries across fields doesn't seem that useful to me.
