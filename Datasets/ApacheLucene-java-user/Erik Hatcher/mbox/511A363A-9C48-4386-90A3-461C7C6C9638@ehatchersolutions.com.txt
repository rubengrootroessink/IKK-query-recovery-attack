It would solve a lot of folks questions!  I find the analysis part of  
Lucene fascinating.  The really interesting thing is that its  
actually quite simple, yet packs a lot of power.  What makes a word a  
"word" (or term, in the Lucene sense) - that is quite a fun  
rhetorical question to ask.  This is why I strongly advocate the use  
of the AnalyzerDemo from the Lucene in Action source code, or some  
variant thereof (like Luke's capability to do the same sort of  
thing).  Visually seeing what comes out of the analysis process for  
sample strings is really eye opening.

Wow, they're slow... 'cause I know you ordered it back in December  
when it was released :))

Don't forget that you can get the book from Manning (www.manning.com)  
in e-book form and have the hard-copy of it as well.
