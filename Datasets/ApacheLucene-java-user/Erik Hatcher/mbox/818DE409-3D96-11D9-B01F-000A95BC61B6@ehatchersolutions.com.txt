I'm feeling particularly commit-y today.  I dug up Matt Quail's 
original LongField contribution in e-mail and adapted it to a new 
NumberTools class.  I committed it along with the tests he contributed 
also.

I think there needs to be some discussion on what other utility methods 
should be added.  For example, most of the numerics I index are 
positive integers and using a zero-padded is sufficient.  I'd rather 
have clearly recognizable numbers in my fields than some strange 
contortion that requires a conversion process to see.
