Yes.

Lucene has *nothing* to do with web applications.  It is completely 
orthogonal.

Look at the many Lucene articles (mine at java.net are the most 
recent).  You have to write some Java code, but you can easily write a 
few lines of code that search an index and output the results.  In 
fact, look at Luke if you want a pre-built desktop application to 
browse/search an index.  Also, look at the lucli project in the sandbox 
for a command-line tool.

The Lucene website has pointers to all that I've mentioned here.
