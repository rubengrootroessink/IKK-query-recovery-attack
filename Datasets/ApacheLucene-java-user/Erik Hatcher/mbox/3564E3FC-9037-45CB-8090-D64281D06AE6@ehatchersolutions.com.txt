Also heed the other recommendations in LIA and don't necessarily use  
Filters when BooleanQuery clauses will suffice.  There is overhead  
involved in the Filter mechanism in terms of executing multiple  
queries to build all the filters you're proposing.

There is a ChainedFilter available in the contrib/miscellaneous area  
(previously called the "sandbox", as in LIA) that can be used to  
combine multiple Filters in sophisticated ways.  Maybe this is what  
you're after?  It is covered in LIA.
