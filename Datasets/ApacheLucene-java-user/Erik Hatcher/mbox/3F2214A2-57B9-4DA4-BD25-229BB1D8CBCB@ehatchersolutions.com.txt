Chances are that you've got a stop word remover in the mix, and "by"  
and "of" are being removed, thus making the words close enough for a  
match.  The built in stop filter does not leave gaps for removed  
words.  So you could either use a custom stop filter or remove it  
altogether to keep those words there.
