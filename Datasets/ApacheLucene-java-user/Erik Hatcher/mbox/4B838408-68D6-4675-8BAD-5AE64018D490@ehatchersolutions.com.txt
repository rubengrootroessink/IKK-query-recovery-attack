It seems you have conflicting goals here.  You want (md5, url, alt)  
to be unique in one sense, yet you want md5 itself to be unique in  
another sense.

Thank you!  :)

Filters reduce the search space to a subset of the documents in the  
index.  Which document would you want returned when there are  
multiple documents in the index with the same MD5?  Or do you want to  
cluster them by MD5?

Do you want to cluster them by MD5 perhaps, but still return multiple  
documents back from a search?

I'm not sure if a Filter is the appropriate technique for this  
scenario or not.
