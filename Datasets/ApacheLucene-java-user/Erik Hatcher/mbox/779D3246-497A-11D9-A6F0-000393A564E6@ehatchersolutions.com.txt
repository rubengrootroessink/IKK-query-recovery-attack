No - logically it doesn't make sense.  How would Lucene determine which 
of those field values to sort by?

You need a single field value to sort by.  I think you should get an 
error when sorting by a field with duplicate values though.

Again, it would be most helpful if you could provide code that 
demonstrates what you're doing during indexing and searching 
specifically related to the sorting issue.
