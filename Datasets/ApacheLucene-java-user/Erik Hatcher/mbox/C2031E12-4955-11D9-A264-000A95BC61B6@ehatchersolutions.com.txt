XOR is not a built-in operation.  However in a few lines of code (a 
custom subclass of BooleanQuery) I was able to implement it.  I built 
this functionality under contract and I'm still working out the details 
of how much of my work can be contributed back, most of which is custom 
and isn't generalizable, but some like an XOR query is general purpose 
enough.

However, I will give some hints - all the details of providing a custom 
Similarity has been been mentioned in this list - thats the trick.
