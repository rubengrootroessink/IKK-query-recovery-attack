Xin,

You're correct.  This was noted as an errata here:  <http:// 
www.lucenebook.com/blog/errata/2005/01/24/scoring_formula_omission.html>

All other known errata is here: <http://www.lucenebook.com/blog/ 
errata/> (and searchable via Lucene, as in <http://lucenebook.com/ 
search?query=scoring+formula+incomplete> :)
