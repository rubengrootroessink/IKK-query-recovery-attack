There really is no need to close an IndexSearcher until you need to  
instantiate another one, and even then you can let the old instance  
go without closing and all will still be well.  If you construct  
IndexSearcher with a String directory name, there is no need to close  
anything other than (optionally) the IndexSearcher.
