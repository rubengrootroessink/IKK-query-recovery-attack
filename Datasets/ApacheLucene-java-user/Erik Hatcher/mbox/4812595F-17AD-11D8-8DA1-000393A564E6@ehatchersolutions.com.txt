Creating the filter object is not expensive... it's when it's used in 
the IndexSearcher.search method (i.e. when the bitset method is called) 
that the expense of term enumeration occurs.  DateFilter does not cache 
it's bitset though, so if you are reusing the same DateFilter over and 
over you will incur that expense every time.  CachingWrappingFilter, 
though, will cache the enumerated bitset and using the same instance 
again will not incur that expense of enumerating terms.

Make sense?  So maybe the timing tests you were doing were timing the 
DateFilter as well.
