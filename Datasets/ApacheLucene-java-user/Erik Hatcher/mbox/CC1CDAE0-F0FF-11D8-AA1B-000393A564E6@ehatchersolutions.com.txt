That's why it's call stop word *removal*.  The purpose of removing 
words is to save space and eliminate words that are ultra common.  
Tuning the analysis process to your domain/environment is by far the 
trickiest part of using Lucene, and often is not even much of a 
consideration as the built-in Analyzers suffice.  It sounds to me that 
your stop word list is far too aggressive and you should consider 
trimming down the list of words that are removed.

Or, even consider not removing words at all.  From the What Would 
Google Do (WWGD)? category.... does Google remove stop words?  I'll 
leave that as a rhetorical question for now :)
