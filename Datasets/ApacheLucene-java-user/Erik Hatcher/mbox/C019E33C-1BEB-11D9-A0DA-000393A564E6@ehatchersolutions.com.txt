Chris - I suspect something else in your application is getting in the 
way.  Try to simplify and eliminate the servlet, or use a tool like 
Luke to see what is truly in the index and what truly is being 
returned.  Lucene indexes what you tell it (perhaps your analyzer is 
manipulating things?), and returns what is stored exactly, so I doubt 
Lucene is the culprit.
