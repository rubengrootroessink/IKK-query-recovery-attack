For the record, Subversion trunk (no longer CVS) is stable and being  
used in many production projects already.

The only difference between Subversion trunk and a released version  
is the time and effort someone has taken to build it, package it,  
sign it, and upload it (and of course a consensus vote authorizing  
it).  While I know that many environments demand that such blessing  
has occurred, I cannot say that I altogether understand it.  I much  
prefer, personally, to be on the trunk and know that any issues I do  
happen to encounter can be easily reported, likely fixed if  
identified specifically enough, fixed, and integrated back into my  
projects right away.

I certainly do feel a bit bad that I'm not personally being  
aggressive about pushing a new release, but please don't let my  
insane schedule hold you back from using the latest and best version  
of Lucene.

     Erik
