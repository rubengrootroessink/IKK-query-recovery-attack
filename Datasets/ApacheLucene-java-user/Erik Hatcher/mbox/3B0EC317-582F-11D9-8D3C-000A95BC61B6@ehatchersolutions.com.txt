SUBJECT: LIA shipping from Manning
DATE: 27 Dec 2004

I received my allotment of physical Lucene in Action copies late last 
week directly from the printers.  I just checked Manning's site - 
http://www.manning.com/hatcher2 - and they now have the link to add the 
physical copy to your "bookbag" enabled which means they must be 
shipping copies.  Buying directly from Manning has the bonus that you 
get the e-book for free when you buy the physical book.

I personally prefer books I can hold in my hand, but searching the PDF 
is handy too (though lucenebook.com will have a "search inside" feature 
:).
