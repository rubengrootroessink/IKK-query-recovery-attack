If you're building up a Query from a UI, I strongly recommend you do  
so using the API rather than QueryParser.  Pieces of the expression  
may make sense to be parsed, or just analyzed of course, but  
QueryParser adds complexity to the equation.  Using BooleanQuery with  
nested PhraseQuery's and such directly will provide a much cleaner  
Query and much less trouble.
