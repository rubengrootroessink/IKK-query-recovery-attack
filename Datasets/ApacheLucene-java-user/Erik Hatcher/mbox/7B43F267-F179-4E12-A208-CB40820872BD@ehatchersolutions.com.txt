"wrong" is subjective in this case.  I personally prefer exact  
highlighting based on what matched, not just individual term  
extraction.  I have, in one project, converted all queries to a  
SpanQuery and used getSpans() to do highlighting in an accurate way.   
This particular code is not generalizable easily and was written  
under contract, so I cannot share it, but it actually was not very  
complex to do.
