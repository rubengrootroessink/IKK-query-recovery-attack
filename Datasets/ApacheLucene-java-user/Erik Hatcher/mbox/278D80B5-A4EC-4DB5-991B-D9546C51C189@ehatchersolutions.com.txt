(sorry for the delay)

I'm doing something sorta relational in my Collex project - http:// 
www.nines.org/collex - where I have different "types" of documents in  
the index, and filters are created and cached that cross-reference  
from one type to another.  It's not very sophisticated and this is an  
area that will likely change but it is possible with clever  
techniques to make Lucene "relational" in a sense.
