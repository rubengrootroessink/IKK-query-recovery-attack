SUBJECT: Re: Configurable indexing of an RDBMS, has it been done before?
DATE: 8 Feb 2005

I agree that it is a worthwhile contribution.

Some suggestions... allow the configuration to specify field boost 
values, and analyzer(s).  If analyzers are specified per-field, then 
wrap then automatically with a PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper.  Also, having a 
facility to aggregate fields into a "contents"-like field would be nice 
- though maybe this would be covered implicitly as part of the SQL 
mapping with one of the columns being an aggregate column.

Perhaps the configuration aspect of it (XML mapping of expressions to 
field details) could be generalized to work with an object graph as 
well as SQL result sets.  OGNL (www.ognl.org) makes expression language 
glue and I can see it being used for mappings - for example the "name" 
field could be mapped to "company.president.name", where "company" is 
an object (or Map) with a "president" property, and so on.
