A Document, when reconstituted from Hits, is essentially a glorified  
HashMap-like structure.  I recommend you simply iterate your HashMap  
during indexing and add each entry to the Document as a Field.Keyword  
or as an unindexed field.  It may be slightly more code than doing  
some type of serialization/de-serialization, but not by much.
