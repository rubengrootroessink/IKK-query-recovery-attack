Bingo... this is the same thinking I've had on this subject.  Why even 
bother with Field.Keyword and the confusion that occurs with 
QueryParser and such?  Just use a KeywordAnalyzer and 
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper setup instead for both indexing and 
querying.... at least that seems a more confusion-free route to go in a 
lot of ways.
