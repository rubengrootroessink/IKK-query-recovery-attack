You've asked to different questions - you can use IndexReader.numDocs 
() to find the total number of documents.

Within a date range - how did you index the dates?  If the dates are  
in lexicographical order, you can walk all the terms in that range  
using TermEnum from IndexReader.terms(Term t) where t is the first  
term in the date range.  You will then need to get the termDocs(t)  
for each of the matching terms.  So it is possible without a search.
