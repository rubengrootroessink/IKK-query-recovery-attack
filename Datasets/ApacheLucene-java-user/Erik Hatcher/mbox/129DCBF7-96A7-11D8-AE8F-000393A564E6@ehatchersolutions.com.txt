Equivalent scoring documents are then subsorted by document insertion 
order by default.

With the 1.4 version of Lucene, there is a very sophisticated way to 
sort, and you could choose to sort by "relevance" (rank/score), and 
then sub-sort by some other field value (ascending or descending) and 
now within even the latest unreleased version a comparator feature was 
added so you could develop your own mechanism for sorting given two 
documents.
