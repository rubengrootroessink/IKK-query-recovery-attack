There is a build system for the entire sandbox area.  The procedure is 
like this:

 > cvs co jakarta-lucene-sandbox  # tweaking to however you like, maybe 
just jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contributions/highlighter

 > cd jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contributions/highlighter

 > ant javadoc

voila!

You can run ant from any of the contributions sub-directories, or run 
it for the entire contributions tree at that level.  The artifacts from 
the sandbox are not, however, packaged into Lucene distributions or are 
they published anywhere in binary or javadoc form online anywhere that 
I know of.  CVS and Ant are your friends!

For details on checking out a Jakarta repository 
(jakarta-lucene-sandbox, in this case), read here:
