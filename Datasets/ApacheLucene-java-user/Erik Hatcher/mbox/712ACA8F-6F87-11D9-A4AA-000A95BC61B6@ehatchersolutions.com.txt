Our master plan is working!  :)   Just kidding.... I have on my TODO 
list to aggregate more Lucene related content (like the javadocs, 
Lucene's own documentation, perhaps a crawl of the wiki and the Lucene 
resources) into our search engine so that it becomes a richer resource 
and seems less than a marketing ploy.  Though the highlighted snippets 
do have enough information to be useful in some cases, which is nice.  
I will start dedicating a few minutes a day to blog some useful 
content.

By all means, if you have other suggestions for our site, let us know 
at authors@lucenebook.com.

	Erik
