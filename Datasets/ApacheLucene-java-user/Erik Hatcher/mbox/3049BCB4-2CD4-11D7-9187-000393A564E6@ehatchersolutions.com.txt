Terry,

Thanks for sharing your changes.

I have commit access to the sandbox, so if I get into using the 
HitsIterator more I'll be happy to commit these types of changes as 
long as no other dev folks complain.

If you can find the time, please post your patches to Bugzilla for safe 
keeping, and bug me from time to time to review and possibly commit.

I'll probably at least commit the patch to fix the compilation error.

	Erik
