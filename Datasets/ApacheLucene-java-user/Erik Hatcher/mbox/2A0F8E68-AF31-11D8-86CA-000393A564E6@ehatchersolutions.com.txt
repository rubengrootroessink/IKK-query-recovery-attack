I think I can safely say that you are not running the latest version of 
Lucene.  This has been corrected in the 1.4 versions.

I've tested this with "Wal-Mart" (without the quote) and QueryParser, 
and it works as expected.

Now that is odd.

QueryParser is an awkward beast at times, and combining it with 
MultiFieldQueryParser (which I'd recommend against, as you can see with 
the odd queries it built for you) gets even more confusing.

Hopefully the latest Lucene 1.4 RC release will fix up your situation.
