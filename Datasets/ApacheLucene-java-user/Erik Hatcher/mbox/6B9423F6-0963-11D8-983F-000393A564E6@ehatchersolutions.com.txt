Lucene is such a generically useful little gem that I think its quite 
difficult to pin down a set of best practices that are generally 
applicable.  It really all depends on what are you doing with it.

A collection of case studies really seems to be the most useful to 
study, and pull out what is useful as it relates to your environment.  
I am *keenly* interested in collecting such case studies.  If you've 
built something useful around Lucene and care to share, let's hear it.  
If you want to have your case studies published in a more formal manner 
than within lucene-user archives, contact me off the list and let me 
know what you're up to with Lucene and you may just .....
