I strongly disagree.  It would not be good at all for  
StandardTokenizer to do this.  It would be easy to write a  
CamelCaseSplitFilter that could be used in conjunction with any  
tokenizer.

It is important to design filters and tokenizers in the most single- 
purpose way to allow them to be combined for various scenarios.

If such a filter is contributed, I'd happily add it to contrib/ 
analyzers - seems useful to have around.
