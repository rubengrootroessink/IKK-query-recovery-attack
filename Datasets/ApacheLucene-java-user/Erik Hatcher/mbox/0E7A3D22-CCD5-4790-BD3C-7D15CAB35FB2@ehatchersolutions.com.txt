What are your searching needs?  That is the first question to ask  
yourself when deciding on an analyzer.  You will probably want to  
extract the cells separately and index them into separate fields, and  
you could start by trying the StandardAnalyzer to see if it meets  
your needs.  It is impossible to say for sure without seeing some  
details of what text you're dealing with and knowing how you want to  
search it.
