A couple of sanity checks... you changes the main lines, not the  
comments I hope :)  And also, you need to rebuild the parser code by  
running JavaCC on it.  If you're tinkering with a copy of Lucene's  
source code you can run the Ant target "javacc" and you must have  
JavaCC installed per the build instructions.
