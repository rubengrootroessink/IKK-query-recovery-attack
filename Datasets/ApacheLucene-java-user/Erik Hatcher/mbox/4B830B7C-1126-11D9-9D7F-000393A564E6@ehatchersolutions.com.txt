 From IndexSearcher, use search(Query,Sort) method (or other variants  
that take a Sort):

	<http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/ 
Searcher.html#search(org.apache.lucene.search.Query,%20org.apache.lucene 
.search.Sort)>

Following the Javadocs for Sort should be (hopefully) self-explanatory.

Sorting is a pretty new feature, and is only described in Javadocs and  
this e-mail list as far as I know.  I wrote a pretty extensive section  
on sorting in Lucene in Action - http://www.manning.com/hatcher2 -  
which is primarily in Otis' hands right now (*nudge nudge*) and has  
been technical and copy edited.  In other words, LIA should be  
available in print 6-8 weeks (e-book in PDF format available much  
sooner) after Otis is done.
