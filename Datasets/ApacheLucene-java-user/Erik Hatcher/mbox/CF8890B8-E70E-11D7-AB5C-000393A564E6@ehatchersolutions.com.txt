You can only use one Analyzer per document and all tokenized fields 
will use that analyzer (an aside, you can change analyzers on a per 
document basis also).

But, you can create a custom Analyzer that does the right logic on a 
per-field basis easily by just copying the code from the Analyzers you 
want to use in there.  The tokenStream method you override provides the 
field name as a parameter.
