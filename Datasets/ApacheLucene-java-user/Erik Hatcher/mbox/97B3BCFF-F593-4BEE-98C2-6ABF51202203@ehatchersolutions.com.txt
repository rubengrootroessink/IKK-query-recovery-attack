The code to Lucene in Action, available for free at http:// 
www.lucenebook.com, has Filter examples.  One such example is a  
SecurityFilter that prohibits a user from seeing documents that he/ 
she does not "own" (a contrived example).  Wouldn't hurt our feelings  
if you purchased the book too :))
