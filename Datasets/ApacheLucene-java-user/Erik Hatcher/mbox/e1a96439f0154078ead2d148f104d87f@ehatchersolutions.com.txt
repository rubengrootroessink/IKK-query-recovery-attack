For comparison, check the older site's search is here:

	http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu:2020/search.html

(don't bother trying it - it's SLOOOW)

And also for comparison, here is an older look:

	<http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu:8090/styler/servlet/

Dig that URL!  The new look and URL is here:
