I recommend against code generated String's to be QueryParse'd.  There 
are far too many fiddly issues with QueryParser (my java.net article on 
this very subject should be coming today or very very soon).  Use 
Lucene's Query API to construct queries in code - and doing so 
dynamically from a sophisticated search UI would not be that much more 
work yet would avoid several awkward issues in the parsing process.
