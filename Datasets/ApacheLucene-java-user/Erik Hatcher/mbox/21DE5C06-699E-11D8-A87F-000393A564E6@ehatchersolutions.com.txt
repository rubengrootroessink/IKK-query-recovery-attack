Ah, ok.... DocumentFieldList/DocumentFieldEnumeration are the culprits.

This is certainly a bug.  With things going in reverse order as they 
are now, a PhraseQuery for "brown quick" matches this document:

     doc.add(Field.Keyword("contents", "quick"));
     doc.add(Field.Keyword("contents", "brown"));

There is merit to what Boris said about phrase queries not matching 
across, but if that effect is desired the position increments can be 
adjusted somehow (but how could someone do this?  a stateful analyzer?)

I don't personally see why you would index text in chunks like this 
rather than aggregating it all into a Reader or String, so certainly 
this is an uncommon usage pattern.
