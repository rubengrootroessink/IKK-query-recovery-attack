That's not quite accurate about why wild card search isn't working.  
My hunch is that it is the lowercasing effect of QueryParser.  There  
is an _instance_ setter to control it.  You'll need to construct an  
instance of QueryParser, call setLowercaseWildcardTerms(false), and  
then call the parse(String) method.
