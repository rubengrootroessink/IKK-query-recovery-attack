If you're using the binary distribution of Lucene 2.0, you'll already  
have the JAR file with those analyzers handy.  It's prefixed lucene- 
analyzers.  Simply add that to your compile and runtime classpath and  
you'll have what you need.

You could certainly just copy the source code into your project if  
you like as well, but I'd recommend you just use the JAR file that  
come with Lucene so you can benefit from any enhancements if you  
eventually upgrade to a future version.
