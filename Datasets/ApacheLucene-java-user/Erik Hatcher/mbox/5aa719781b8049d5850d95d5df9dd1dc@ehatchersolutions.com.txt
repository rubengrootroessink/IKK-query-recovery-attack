The problem is your KeywordSynonymAnalyzer is not truly a "keyword" 
analyzer in that it is tokenizing the field into parts.  So Document 1 
has [test] and [mario] as tokens that come from the LowerCaseTokenizer.

Look at Lucene's svn repository under contrib/analyzers and you'll see 
a KeywordTokenizer and corresponding KeywordAnalyzer you can use.
