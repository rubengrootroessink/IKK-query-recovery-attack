Eventually I'll have a look at implementing this (and of course 
contributing it back to Lucene's codebase) - its on my to-do list.  But 
if you want to beat me to it, even better!  It could be a few months 
before I actually get to it, since the filesystem works fine for my 
demonstration environment.

Save yourself a bit of leg-work - and reuse what I've already done.  Its 
in the Lucene sandbox CVS area already.  It could use a little work, but 
it does work nicely for what I've pushed through it to index text and 
HTML files.  It also has quite speedy dependency checking, so if you 
index the same files a second time, its much much faster as it just 
compares dates and ignores them.  If you aren't indexing filesystem 
files then this won't work out of the box for you, but might serve as a 
starting point.

I suspect that leveraging the read-only FSDirectory would work, although 
I have not looked at the code to see how tough or easy that might be.
