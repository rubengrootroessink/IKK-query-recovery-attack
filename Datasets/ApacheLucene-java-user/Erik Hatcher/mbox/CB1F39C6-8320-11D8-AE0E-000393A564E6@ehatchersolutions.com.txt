If this is the entire query, boosting the entire group really doesn't 
do anything useful.  Every score will be boosted equally by 5.0, so you 
may as well not even use a boost on the group.

Yes, its multiplied like you have shown.  From BooleanQuery:

         if (getBoost() != 1.0f) {                 // incorporate boost
           if (query == c.query)                   // if rewrite was 
no-op
             query = (Query)query.clone();         // then clone before 
boost
           query.setBoost(getBoost() * query.getBoost());
         }

That is part of the rewrite method.
