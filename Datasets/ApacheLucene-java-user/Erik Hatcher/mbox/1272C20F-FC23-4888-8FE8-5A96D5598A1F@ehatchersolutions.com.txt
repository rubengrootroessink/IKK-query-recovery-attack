SUBJECT: SIPs and CAPs
DATE: 14 Jul 2005

Has anyone developed code to extract SIPs (statistically improbable  
phrases) and CAPs (capitalized phrases) from a Lucene index, such as  
Amazon does with it's books as shown here?

ref=sip_top_dp/102-8573693-0514548?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance>

I'm curious as it is something I'd like to do with some of my work.   
Of course CAPs would be impossible to extract from an index that used  
a lowercasing analyzer, so that is a special case that would require  
work during indexing.  But SIPs could be extracted from an existing  
index.

Thanks,
     Erik
