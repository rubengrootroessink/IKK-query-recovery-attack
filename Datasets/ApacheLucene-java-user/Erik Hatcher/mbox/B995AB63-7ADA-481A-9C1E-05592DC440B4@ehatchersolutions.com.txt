Actually its a single index, with a "type" field that separates the  
two different types of documents (archive objects, or collectable  
objects).

A pointer to this code is here: <http:// 
patacriticism.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/patacriticism/collex/trunk/ 
src/solr/org/nines/CollectableCache.java?view=markup>  It's a hack  
that leverages some of Solr's facilities (but not near enough!).
