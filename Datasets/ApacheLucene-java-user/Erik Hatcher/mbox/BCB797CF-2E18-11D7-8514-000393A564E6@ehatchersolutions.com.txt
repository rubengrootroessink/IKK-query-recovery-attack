SUBJECT: Re: Range queries
DATE: 22 Jan 2003

Unfortunately I don't believe date field range queries work with 
QueryParser, or at least not human-readable dates.

Is that correct?

I think it supports date ranges if they are turned into a numeric 
format, but no human would type that kind of query in.  I'm sure 
supporting true date range queries gets tricky with locale issues and 
such too.
