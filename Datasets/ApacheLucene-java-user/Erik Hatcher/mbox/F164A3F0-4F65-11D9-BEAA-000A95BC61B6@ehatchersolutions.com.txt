No, in fact, you have not.  If you want to continue to receive my help 
here, you need to provide *details*.  You pose often ambiguous and hard 
to decipher questions.  Please help us help you by answering the 
questions we ask precisely.  What are the values (exact string values) 
in that field?  Please also read the wiki page on indexing numeric 
values.

Look at using the new RangeFilter rather than a RangeQuery due to the 
noted issues with doing a RangeQuery.
