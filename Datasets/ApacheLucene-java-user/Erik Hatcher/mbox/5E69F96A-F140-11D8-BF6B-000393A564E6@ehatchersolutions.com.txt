Thanks for doing the legwork.  My favorite example is "to be or not to 
be" with and without quotes.  The top hit without quotes is quite 
funny.

So, Google doesn't throw away stop words, but they do special query 
processing to keep you from doing silly things like "show me all 
documents with 'the' in them".  Look at Nutch for how it does something 
very similar.
