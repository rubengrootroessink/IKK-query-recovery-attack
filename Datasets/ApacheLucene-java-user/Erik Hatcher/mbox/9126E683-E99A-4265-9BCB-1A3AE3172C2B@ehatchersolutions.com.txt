Have a look at your analyzer (check out my java.net article for  
starters), and the "Analysis Paralysis" section of the Lucene wiki.   
You will need to adjust your analyzer (and query parser perhaps) to  
tokenize things as you'd like.  For a quick fix, try using the  
WhitespaceAnalyzer, though you'll soon want to upgrade that most likely.
