What I do is simply index all the fields individually that need to be  
searchable or just stored, but also index a general-purpose  
"contents" field with all of that same text.

You can add multiple fields of the same name to a document, making it  
easy to just keep appending to a "contents" field for a document.   
You can see how this is done in the Lucene in Action code in the  
TestDataDocumentHandler.java - however I took a cruder approach and  
appended the fields together with a space in between them rather than  
using the multiple valued field approach.  Either technique will work  
just fine.
