I don't have a solution, but rather some questions to check.... are all 
dateTime's the same width, zero padded on the right?  Does every 
document have a dateTime field?

I recommend you sort with type INT instead of STRING if it fits, or 
maybe LONG.  STRING will use the most resources for sorting.
