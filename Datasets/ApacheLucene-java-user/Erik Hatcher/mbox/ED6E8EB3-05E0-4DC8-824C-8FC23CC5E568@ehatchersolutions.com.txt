It really depends on your needs.  If you never need proximity across  
sentence boundaries, then what's the issue?   Putting a large gap at  
sentence boundaries makes good sense for some needs.  Maybe not so  
for your situation?

I'm definitely interested in what others have done with this sort of  
thing.

At the extreme, if all you wanted was to find sentences and did not  
need to query for terms in multiple sentences at one time then you  
could index each sentence as a separate Document.
