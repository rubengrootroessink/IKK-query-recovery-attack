A bit off topic, but I'll indulge myself for at least one more message  
on this.  Here is a fun link I've been saving for a while:

True, but I don't use an existing framework for a CMS, which my blog is  
a "lite" version of.  I've done a lot with Struts, and I use it for  
heavy form-based sites and it does the job acceptably well.  Now I'm  
embarking on a relatively large-scale Tapestry project, and its URL's  
are even more ridiculous.  At least with Struts you can control how  
URI's are mapped to ActionServlet, so typically either *.do or /do/*,  
and you have full control over the rest of the URI with the action  
mappings.  There is even wildcard support to map a range of URI's to  
the same Action, which may have already been added to the latest  
codebase.

There is something slightly satisfying about the ease that mod_rewrite  
does its thing though.  I use it, in fact, to map my old blog URL to my  
new one - it is a straightforward domain and path prefix change,  
nothing dramatic though.
