No such recommendation would ever officially come from the Lucene  
community.  Lucene is entirely independent of how search results get  
rendered.  The demo application is nothing more than a demonstration,  
not a recommendation of technologies to use around Lucene.

Whatever technologies best fit your environment is what I'd  
recommend :)   I've used all types of technologies on top of Lucene,  
from a servlet, to JSP pages, Struts, Tapestry (what lucenebook.com  
uses) to now using Ruby on Rails  backed by Solr (which fronts Lucene  
with servlets).
