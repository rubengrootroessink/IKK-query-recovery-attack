Lucene in Action 2nd edition (code named LIA2) will be the successor,  
not quite a complement but rather a newly revised version with  
updated API usage for Lucene 2.x, coverage of new features, but also  
containing all the still relevant content from LIA1.

Certainly updated coverage of Nutch will be part of LIA2 as well as  
solid coverage of Solr.  We'll release more details of what we plan  
to cover as we actually pin down what that is.  Right now we're in  
the planning stage, and work should begin on it real soon now.  As  
for an expected release date, I cannot even speculate.  A wild guess  
would be no later than next summer, but certainly we hope much sooner.

	Erik
