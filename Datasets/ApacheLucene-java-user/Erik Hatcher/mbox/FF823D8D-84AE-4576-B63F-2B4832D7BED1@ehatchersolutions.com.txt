Simply storing a parentId doesn't help query the hierarchy though -  
for example, search for all "lucene" containing documents in a  
specific forum thread, children and all.

One technique I've used to index hierarchy is to come up with a path  
string such as "/parent/child/grandchild" and index that as a non- 
tokenized field.  Querying for all documents under "/parent" is as  
simple as a PrefixQuery.
