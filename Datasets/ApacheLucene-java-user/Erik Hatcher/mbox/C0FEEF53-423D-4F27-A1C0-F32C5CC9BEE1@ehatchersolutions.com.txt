I'll second Otis' request about the special segmentation api.  If it  
is open source, I'd love to tinker with it.  中文是不太难。  :)

If you can share an example that demonstrates an issue, we'd love to  
have it and incorporate it into our test suite and fix the  
implementation if a bug exists.   A working example of a bug can get  
fixed much easier than looking for needles in a haystack.
