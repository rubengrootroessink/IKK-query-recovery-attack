This is, in fact, one of the documents I referenced to get a grasp on  
how to do it.

My code has some built-in assumptions on parts of the equation that get  
short-circuited (there is only 1 of each term in my case, for example)  
so it would not be a general-purpose algorithm.  It's basically just  
using the TermFreqVector information and plugging it into an equation  
like found in that PDF - nothing more than that actually.
