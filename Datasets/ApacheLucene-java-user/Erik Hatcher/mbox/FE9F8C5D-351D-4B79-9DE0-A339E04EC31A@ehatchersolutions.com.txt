If you're using NullFragmenter (which I just committed to contrib/ 
highlighter) then you're not getting snippets, you're getting the  
full text.  But this is unrelated to your main question.

Well, as I said, from here on out is really in the domain of your  
application and not Lucene and the Highlighter.  Perhaps your index  
should have a unique identifying key field (Field.Keyword works well  
for this).  And then your links to the full text should be augmented  
to have that key in them, and that link needs to be to something  
dynamic, like a servlet, rather than a static link, that passes in  
the id of the document to be highlighted and the query to use with  
Highlighter.

Perhaps.  I cannot decide this for you as it is, again, your  
application business logic that determines where the text of a  
document is.  You already mentioned the text is in the Lucene index  
in your case, so you could pass the document id (or the path, or some  
unique key) to the highlighting servlet, retrieve that document from  
Lucene, highlight the text using the NullFragmenter, and serve up  
that highlighted text.

You're adding a field to the document in doHighlight - this is not  
something I'd recommend.  It is not persistent, just so you know.  I  
recommend simply returning the highlighted String from that method  
rather than adding a field.
