The Highlighter class is not in the core of Lucene.  When 1.4.3 was  
released, the add-ons such as the Highlighter were in a separate CVS  
repository called "sandbox".  When we moved to Subversion we put it  
all together and it is now under a directory called contrib/highlighter.

To have a Highlighter compatible with Lucene 1.4.3 you will not be  
able to use the Subversion code though.  The easiest thing to do is  
get the JAR file that comes with the Lucene in Action free code
