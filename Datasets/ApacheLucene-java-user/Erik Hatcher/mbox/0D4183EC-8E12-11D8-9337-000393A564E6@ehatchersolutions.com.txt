SUBJECT: Re: How to retrieve the terms that matched
DATE: 14 Apr 2004

Have a look at the Highlighter code that lives in the Lucene sandbox.  
It is a new addition there, but has been available for some time from 
the creators website.  I'm not sure if this will give you the 
information you need directly, but it would be a start.
