Beyond the advice already given on this thread, since you said you were 
using Tapestry, I keep an IndexSearcher as a transient lazy-init'd 
property of my Global object.  It needs to be transient in case you are 
scaling with distributed servers in a farm and lazy init'd so to 
instantiate the first time.

Global, in Tapestry, makes a good place to put index operations.  As 
for searching - a good first try is to re-query for each page of search 
results (if you're implementing paging of results, that is).  It is 
often fast enough.
