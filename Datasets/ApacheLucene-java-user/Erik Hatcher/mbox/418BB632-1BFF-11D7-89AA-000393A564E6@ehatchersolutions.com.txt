SUBJECT: Re: Heuristics on searching HTML Documents ?
DATE: 30 Dec 2002

If you have control over the HTML, how about marking the navbar pieces 
with a certain CSS class and then filtering that out from what you 
index?  It seems like that would be a reasonable way to filter it - but 
this is of course provided its your HTML and not someone elses.
