DATE: 10 Sep 2005

Riccardo,

I'm not quite understanding the issue with using Document.fields().   
It returns an Enumeration of Field objects, which contain the name  
and the value.  If you only want the name, then only use the name and  
ignore the value.  That seems simple enough, so I must be missing  
what you're asking for.  Please clarify a bit more.

Thanks,
     Erik
