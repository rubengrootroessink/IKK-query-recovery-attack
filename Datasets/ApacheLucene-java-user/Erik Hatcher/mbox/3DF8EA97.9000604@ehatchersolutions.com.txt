SUBJECT: Re: HTML saga continues...
DATE: 12 Dec 2002

On a related note, I've also released a project that I developed for my 
book and for presentations that I have been giving on Ant, XDoclet, and 
JUnit.  This project is a documentation search engine with a web 
(Struts) interface.  It uses Lucene and the Ant task I mentioned already 
to index a directory full of HTML and text files.  The sample data 
provided is Ant's documentation.

Its available as version 0.3 (currently, but always grab the latest 
thats there) at http://www.ehatchersolutions.com/downloads/

I have not documented it well yet, but that is my plan over the next 
couple of weeks.

To get it running you need:

- Ant 1.5.1 (1.5 is not sufficient)
- JUnit 3.8 or up (3.8.1 is the latest)
- j2ee.jar - I don't provide this in the download for size (and legal?) 
reasons.

Build it this way:

	ant -Dj2ee.jar=/path/to/my/j2ee.jar

Or if you run it without the -D switch it will tell you where to place 
j2ee.jar by default.  If you have J2EE_HOME set it will pick that up 
automatically and use it appropriately.

Deploy the WAR in a web container, or the EAR in JBoss.  Navigate to:

	http://localhost:8080/ant-sample/

and search for your favorite Ant tasks or Ant related information.

Let me know if you experience any issues with it, or have comments.
