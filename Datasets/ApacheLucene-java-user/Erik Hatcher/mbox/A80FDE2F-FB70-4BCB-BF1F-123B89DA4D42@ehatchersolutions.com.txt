What analyzer did you use for your text?   Again, that is not a valid  
regular expression.   But also, you're using a single long string of  
several words within your SpanRegexQuery term.  What you probably  
want is a SpanNearQuery of those fixed terms along with a ".*"  
SpanRegexQuery in the wildcarded spots, and then you could nest that  
inside a SpaneFirstQuery.

It's likely a bug that you get this particular error, but I think  
you'll get around it by solving the above mentioned issues with your  
query.
