There is no such switch in QueryParser to disable fielded queries.  A  
custom QueryParser would be needed to make this happen.

If you only need TermQuery and PhraseQuery you could do without  
QueryParser altogether in this situation and process (not quite  
"parse") the text fields by building up the appropriate query.
