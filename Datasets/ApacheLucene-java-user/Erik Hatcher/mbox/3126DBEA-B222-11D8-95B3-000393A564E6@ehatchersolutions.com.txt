Michael - zilverline is nicely done!  I downloaded it and dropped it 
into Tomcat and it came right up.  I did not actually configure a 
collection yet, but from the docs on the website it looks like you have 
built something quite nice.  Maybe you could embed a built-in 
collection of the zilverline docs so something comes up right away and 
is searchable :)

Nice work.  I'll definitely stay tuned into your project.

	Erik
