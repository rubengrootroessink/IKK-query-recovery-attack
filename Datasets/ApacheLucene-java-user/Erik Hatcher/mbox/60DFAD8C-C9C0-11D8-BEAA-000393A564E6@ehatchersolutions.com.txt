Here is a short example from our Lucene in Action book's code:

   public void testSpanish() throws Exception {
     Analyzer analyzer = new SnowballAnalyzer("Spanish");

     assertAnalyzesTo(analyzer,
         "algoritmos", new String[] {"algoritm"});
   }

Substitute "French" for "Spanish" and you should be in business, 
provided you've grabbed 'snowball' source code from the 
jakarta-lucene-sandbox CVS repository in the contributions/snowball 
area.
