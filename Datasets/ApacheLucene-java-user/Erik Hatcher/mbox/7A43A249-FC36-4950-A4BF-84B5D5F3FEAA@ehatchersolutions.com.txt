Harini,

I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.  IDF doesn't factor  
into highlighting.

IDF calculations are useful in scoring documents during a search,  
such that the most relevant documents are returned, but again this is  
unrelated to highlighting.

Could you elaborate on what you're after?
