Eric,

I've not done something like this myself, but I did a quick perusal  
of the source code and tracked it into how it is used.  There are a  
few subclasses of FilterIndexReader out there.  To do anything useful  
with FilterIndexReader you must subclass it and provide your own  
"filtering".

TestFilterIndexReader has some clues that might help you:

	<http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/src/test/org/ 
apache/lucene/index/TestFilterIndexReader.java?view=markup>

I'm definitely interested in seeing how to go about implementing what  
you're after, so keep us posted.

	Erik
