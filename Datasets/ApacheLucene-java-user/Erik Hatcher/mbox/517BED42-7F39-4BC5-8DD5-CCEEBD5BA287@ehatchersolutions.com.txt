Hugh,

Both approaches are certainly in use in various projects.  I  
typically opt for option #1, but that is because it is feasible  
giving the data I work with, and how it is managed.

However, the decision is really based on the size of the text to be  
highlighted and whether it makes sense to store it or just access it  
on the fly.
