I wouldn't call it misleading as much as confusing.  QueryParser itself 
presents quite a few quirks, and combine that with escape characters 
and an analyzer and it is tricky to see what is really going on without 
understanding all the players involved.

The best advice I can offer is to always simplify things when trouble 
shooting.... eliminate the analyzer or use the WhitespaceAnalyzer, 
eliminate QueryParser from the equation, etc.  Taking these steps will 
give you insight into where oddities occur.  In your case, if you use 
WhitespaceAnalyzer, you would get the query you desire.
