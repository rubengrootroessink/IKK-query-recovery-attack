Yes, you're right.  Getting the scores of a second query based on the 
scores of the first query is probably not trivial, but probably 
possible with Lucene.  And that combined with a QueryFilter would do 
the trick I suspect.  Somehow the scores of the first query could be 
remembered and used as a boost (or other type of factor) the scores of 
the second query.

Am I off base here?

Right... but you'd still need the filtering capability as well, I would 
think - at least for performance reasons.
