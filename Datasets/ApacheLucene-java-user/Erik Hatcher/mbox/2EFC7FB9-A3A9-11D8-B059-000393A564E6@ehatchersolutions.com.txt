Terms in the index are *always* text.  The DateField class in Lucene 
helps do conversions, but see the wiki for more info on date fields.  I 
wouldn't recommend using it, personally, unless millisecond granularity 
is really desired.

For other types, if you need range queries, you need to make the 
textual representation be ordered lexicographically (i.e. pad the 
numbers with leading zeros so that all numbers have the same width) - 
again, some of this is on the wiki.

There really isn't anything in the "manual" about field types, that I 
know of, only brief mentions on the wiki and e-mail archives.
