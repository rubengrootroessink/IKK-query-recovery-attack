If you’ve got a lot of data to tame in a variety of formats, there’s  
no better, deeper, faster platform to build your search application  
with than Solr. Apache Solr 1.4 expands the power and versatility of  
the leading open source search server, with its convenient web- 
services interfaces and well-packaged server implementation. Erik will  
present and discuss key features and innovations of Solr 1.4,  
covering, among others:

   * Faster, more streamlined document and query processing
   * New powerful search methods including multi-select faceting,  
deduplication and numeric range handling
   * Simplified, powerful, highly-scalable deployment improvements  
with new Java server infrastructure
