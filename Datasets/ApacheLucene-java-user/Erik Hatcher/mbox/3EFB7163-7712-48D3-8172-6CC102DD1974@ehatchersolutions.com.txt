SUBJECT: Re: Boosting a token in the query
DATE: 29 Mar 2006

Unfortunately I'm not sure what boosting capabilities were available  
in 1.2, but that syntax is correct for the 1.4+ at least.

And I'm sure the Explanation feature is not available in 1.2, but  
with more recent versions of Lucene you'd be able to see the effect  
of the boosts on the score.

Does Query have a setBoost() in 1.2?   If so, maybe the parser didn't  
support boosts at that time?   Sorry I'm not of more help.
