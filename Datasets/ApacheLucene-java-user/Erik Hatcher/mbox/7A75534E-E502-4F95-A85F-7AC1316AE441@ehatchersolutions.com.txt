Good idea... it'd be a shame for the index to sit unsearched!  :)

Yes, no problem with searches occurring during add/delete  
operations.  The searches will not see new documents and still return  
deleted documents until a new IndexSearcher instance is used, though.

For best performance, use a single IndexSearcher instance across your  
entire application.

When you want index changes to be visible to searches, drop the old  
IndexSearcher instance and instantiate a new one.
