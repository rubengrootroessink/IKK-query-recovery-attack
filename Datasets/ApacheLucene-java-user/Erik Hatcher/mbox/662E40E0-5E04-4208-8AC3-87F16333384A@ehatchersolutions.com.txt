SUBJECT: DC/NOVA Lucene&Solr meetup
DATE: 4 May 2009

My company is co-sponsoring a Lucene/Solr meetup later this month in  
the Northern VA / DC area (Reston).  Details will be coming out soon.   
We've got one night of talks planned and considering adding another  
consecutive night.  If you're in the area and have a Lucene (any of  
the Lucene family of projects, including Mahout, Solr, Tika, etc)  
project you're eager to discuss for 20-30 minutes, write me offline  
and tell me about it.

Thanks,
	Erik
