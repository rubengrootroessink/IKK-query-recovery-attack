See what you're missing?!  :)

I really admire and respect the folks that do Java without an IDE.   
Doug wrote Lucene with emacs, and that is a skill in and of itself to  
be revered.  But I view Java source code as a rich interconnected  
web.  Surfing it with an IDE(A!) is definitely my preference.
