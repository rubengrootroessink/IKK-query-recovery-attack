That's a loaded question.  Lucene "supports" it by being able to index 
text, sure.  But Lucene does not include an XML parser and the facility 
to automatically turn an XML file into a Lucene document, nor would you 
want that.  For example - in my current project, I'm parsing XML 
documents, and indexing pieces of them individually as Lucene Documents 
- in fact I'm doing that in all kinds of various ways too.

The demo applications that you've tried are not designed for anything 
but a very very basic demonstration of how to use Lucene - these 
example applications were never intended to be used as-is for anything 
other than some code you could borrow and learn from to build your own 
custom solutions.

If you want a quick jump on processing XML with Lucene, try out the 
code that comes with Lucene in Action (grab it from 
www.lucenebook.com).  When you get the code, run this:

$ ant ExtensionFileHandler
Buildfile: build.xml

...

ExtensionFileHandler:
      [echo]
      [echo]       This example demonstrates the file extension document 
handler.
      [echo]       Documents with extensions .xml, .rtf, .doc, .pdf, 
.html, and .txt are
      [echo]       all handled by the framework.  The contents of the 
Lucene Document
      [echo]       built for the specified file is displayed.
      [echo]
     [input] Press return to continue...

     [input] File: [src/lia/handlingtypes/data/HTML.html]
src/lia/handlingtypes/data/addressbook.xml
      [echo] Running lia.handlingtypes.framework.ExtensionFileHandler...
      [java] log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger 
(org.apache.commons.digester.Digester.sax).

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 18 seconds

Note that I typed in the path to an XML file where it asks for [input]. 
  Now dig into the source tree and borrow what you need from 
src/lia/handlingtypes
