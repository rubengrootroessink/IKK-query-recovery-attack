As long as you keep it around.  Lucene isn't responsible for keeping  
a reference to it, your application is.

See above.  You're entirely in charge of the Hits object being kept  
around, or not.

Since you're obviously in a servlet environment, you probably will  
want to implement some sort of paging through Hits.  One option is to  
simply throw Hits away after every request and re-search for every  
page.  That works well enough in every case I've encountered that I  
haven't used the alternative of keeping Hits around across requests.
