To reiterate what Otis said, there wouldn't be much need to cover  
servlets in detail.  Searching with Lucene is general-purpose, and  
servlets is just one way to expose its functionality.  Covering  
servlets would take the focus off of the core technology, and would  
overlap with the other resources available on servlet technologies.   
That being said though, if there is something specific you or anyone  
else would like to have covered, or covered in more detail, or  
removed from the 2nd edition of Lucene in Action, please submit these  
to me personally (not to the list).  All suggestions will be given  
consideration.  Also when Otis and I really dig into the planning,  
we'll post our plans here to solicit feedback.

	Erik
