ezlm is the mail software used to power the Apache e-mail lists, and 
has absolutely nothing to do with Lucene.

There is no thesaurus integrated into Lucene, however it is quite easy 
to custom code the integration.

Since you don't want to be on the e-mail list, but want to know about 
Lucene, I suggest picking up a copy of Lucene in Action (Manning 
Publications).  Sorry for the self-advertising ;)
