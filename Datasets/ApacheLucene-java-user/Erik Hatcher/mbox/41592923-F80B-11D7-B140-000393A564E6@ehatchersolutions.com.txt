Hits is not a java.util.Collection, so you cannot directly iterate 
through it using <logic:iterate>.  There are some Lucene-specific tag 
libraries that may do what you're after within the 
jakarta-lucene-sandbox CVS repository (you'll have to check out that 
module and build them yourself, currently).
