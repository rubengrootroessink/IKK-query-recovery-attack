Since you ported GPL code, aren't you required to GPL your version as 
well?  I'm not a lawyer and not clear on how this works.  You can use 
reflection to "link" to GPL code from Apache code, but I don't think 
you can directly import GPL'd packages (again, I'm not clear on this 
though).

The safest bet is to just host what you've done on your own or at 
Sourceforge or java.net.  It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have 
some type of repository of Lucene extensions hosted elsewhere anyway to 
solve the GPL issue.
