Just let me point out that it's a *wiki*, so the community is free to  
take advantage of the malleability of it.  The reason we encourage  
the wiki is such that FAQ's, which often is about support, can be  
answered but allowing those answers to be driven by the collective  
best practices of the community and not as rigid and funneled as the  
main Lucene website or, *gasp*, documentation such as books and  
articles which begin stagnating before the ink dries.

One of the contributions I'm most personally proud of was the idea to  
do a section for the Ant book called "The Elements of Ant Style":

	<http://wiki.apache.org/ant/TheElementsOfAntStyle>

After the book was published I, with permission from the publisher,  
converted the list of best practices to the Ant wiki to let it evolve  
there given newer and better ways to do things.  Having a communal  
whiteboard at our disposal is a mighty powerful way for us to  
collaborate beyond the e-mail list.  I do have to admit an aversion  
to wiki formatting and the granular and unsemantic way it works, but  
for those motivated to build up the wiki you have my full backing,  
and I do generally agree its a great resource we should cultivate.

So maybe we need a wiki page for the "Tao of Lucene"?!  ;)
