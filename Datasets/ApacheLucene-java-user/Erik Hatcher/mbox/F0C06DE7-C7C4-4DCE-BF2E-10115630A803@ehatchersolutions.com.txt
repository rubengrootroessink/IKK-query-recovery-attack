Consider the index in the back of a book.  You could tear that out  
and still use it to tell what page something is on, but you have no  
actual content in hand.  When a field is tokenized (and therefore  
implicitly indexed), it is run through the specified Analyzer and the  
terms emitted are indexed, but the original text may or may not also  
be stored in the index.

Make sense?
