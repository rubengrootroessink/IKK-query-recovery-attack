Also let me also emphasize the test cases that are built into the  
Lucene codebase itself.  These are premium *always working* examples  
of how to use specific parts of Lucene in an isolated fashion.    
Check out Lucene's trunk (or 2.0 branch) via Subversion and enjoy.

p.s. I had updated all of the "Lucene in Action" code to be 2.0  
compliant a while back but have never published it.  I'll make a  
point of doing that as soon as possible and posting its location here.
