SUBJECT: Re: Caching and paging search results
DATE: 8 Mar 2004

In the RealWorld... many applications actually just re-run a search and 
jump to the appropriate page within the hits.... searching is generally 
plenty fast enough to alleviate concerns of caching.

However, if you need to cache Hits, you need to be sure to keep around 
the originating IndexSearcher as well.

A stateful session bean could be used, but I'd opt for a much simpler 
solution as a first pass, such as the first point of just re-running a 
search from scratch.
