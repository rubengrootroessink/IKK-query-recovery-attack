There is an art to providing just enough detail :)

This looks fine.

How about using:

	ms.search(query,
            new Sort(new SortField("modified", SortField.STRING, true)));

Does that fix it?

If "modified" is only there for sorting and not for querying, perhaps 
index it as a Integer.toString or Float.toString instead - this will 
give you better resource usage and performance most likely - and change 
the type to SortField.INT or SortField.FLOAT appropriately.  The 
sorting infrastructure can detect a type, but it may have issues doing 
so if the strings look like a number in the first document but later 
appear like a String.  DateField.timeToString makes them String, so 
forcing it to sort on String type should work.
