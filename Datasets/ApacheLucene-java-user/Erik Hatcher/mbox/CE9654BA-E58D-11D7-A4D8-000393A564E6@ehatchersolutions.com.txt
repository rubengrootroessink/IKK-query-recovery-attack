Hits is really a collection of pointers back to the documents, not a 
standalone collection.

Have a look at ejindex: http://ejindex.sourceforge.net/

Also, have a look at the built-in RemoteSearchable class.  You could 
use it to search over RMI.

But the quickest/easiest way that I've used before is to extract all 
the documents from the hits and wrap it up as a Map and send it back.
