SUBJECT: Re: Which Analyzer to use when searching on Keyword fields
DATE: 5 Apr 2006

Venu,

I presume you're asking about what Analyzer to use with QueryParser.   
QueryParser analyzes all term text, but you can fake it for Keyword  
(non-tokenized) fields by using PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper, specifying  
the KeywordAnalyzer for the fields you indexed as such.

The KeywordAnalyzer code will work with 1.4.3, so just grab that  
class and put it into your project.  A couple of variations of it are  
also included with the Lucene in Action code.
