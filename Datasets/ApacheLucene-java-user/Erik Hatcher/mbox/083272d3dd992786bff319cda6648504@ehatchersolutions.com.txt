On further thought, my approach would be to handle this on the analysis 
side and not deal with position increments.  The lookup would take 
"cyber cafe" and emit the token "cybercafe".  In your #3 example, the 
tokens would be [cafe] [cyber] and would not match.  If someone issued 
a phrase query for "cyber cafe" the same analysis would turn that into 
a query for "cybercafe".

What drawbacks are there from replacing multiple words with its 
corresponding acryonym/alias during analysis?
