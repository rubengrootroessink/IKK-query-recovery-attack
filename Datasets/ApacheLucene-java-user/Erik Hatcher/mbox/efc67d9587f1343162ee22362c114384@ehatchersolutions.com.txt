I have been adding .equals/.hashCode to the query types as I find a 
need.  I'm comparing queries generated by a custom query parser and 
queries created by the API using .equals in unit tests and have 
encountered the same issue.  I have not hit RangeQuery yet, so your 
patch would be a welcome addition.
