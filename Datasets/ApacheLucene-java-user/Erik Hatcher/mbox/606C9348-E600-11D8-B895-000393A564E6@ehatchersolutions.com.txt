My deepest apologies - I totally misspoke with my post yesterday.  
Chris, and the others, are correct - I wasn't thinking clearly and was 
confusing IndexReader.document() with Hits.doc().

So, as far as the exception goes - perhaps your servlet does not have 
access to the index because of permissions.  Maybe you're using a 
different version of Lucene between the command-line and your web 
application?
