Echoing a previous suggestion, use Luke to examine the index to make 
sure it is in good shape.  You can do ad-hoc queries with it also.

One recommendation below....

I highly recommend you use a BooleanQuery and AND in a TermQuery for 
resellerId rather than textually concatenating it to the expression you 
parse.  There are numerous issues that could come up with parsing it 
this way and potentially brittle.  If you ever switch analyzers such 
that numbers are filtered out, you could be in trouble.
