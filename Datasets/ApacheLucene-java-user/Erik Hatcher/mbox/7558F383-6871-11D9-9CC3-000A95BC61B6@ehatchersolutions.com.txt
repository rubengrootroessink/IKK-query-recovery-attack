SUBJECT: Re: StandardAnalyzer unit tests?
DATE: 17 Jan 2005

I personally don't have a problem with that change, however I don't 
like changing such things as they can lead to unexpected and confusing 
issues later.  Suppose someone upgrades their version of Lucene without 
re-indexing and now queries that used to work no longer work?  (sure, I 
agree it is wise to re-index if you upgrade Lucene).

Perhaps others could chime in on whether this change would adversely 
affect them or if this a desirable change?
