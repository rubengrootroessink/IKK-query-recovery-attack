All Lucene searches are case-sensitive, actually.

But most often a lowercasing analyzer is used.  So the trick is to  
change the analysis process to not lowercase.  It gets more fun when  
you need case sensitive or insensitive searching both in the same  
situation, where the trick is to either build two different indexes  
or to use different fields that use different analysis on the same  
text (though this gets tricky with QueryParser generated queries and  
the potential for user field selection).
