It isn't that much more effort to have something like NumberUtils 
listed here: 
http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/SearchNumericalFields

I'm not sure of the pros/cons to making Field extensible or not, but it 
really is of marginal benefit since it ultimately it needs a String and 
a conversion of numeric to String in your own code isn't involved.  I 
suppose we could put something like NumberUtils (maybe called 
NumberField to be like DateField) in the core to have a built-in 
solution.  We probably ought to also go another step and provide Date 
-> YYYYMMDD conversion as additional parts to DateField.
