No objections that error messages and such could be made clearer.  
Patches welcome!  Care to submit better error message handling in this 
case?  Or perhaps allow lower-case "to"?

But, also, folks need to really step back and practice basic 
troubleshooting skills.  I asked you if that string was what you passed 
to the QueryParser and you said yes, when in fact it was not.  And you 
slowly fed more details of your scenario (MFQP, some German 
SnowballAnalyzer variant).  Reduce the variables in the equation and 
narrow things down until it works and then incrementally add 
complexity.  I cannot encourage folks enough to try some JUnit 
test-driven *learning* by exploring various scenarios.
