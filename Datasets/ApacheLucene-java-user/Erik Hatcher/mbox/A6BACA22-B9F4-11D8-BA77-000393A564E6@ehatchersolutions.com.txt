The total number of "hops" to put the words in order is calculated and 
if it is less than or equal to 10 there is a match.

For example, a field was indexed with "the quick brown fox jumps...".

"quick brown" matches
"quick fox"~1 matches (# of hops = 1)
"quick jumps"~1 does not match (# hops = 2)
"the brown jumps"~1 does not match (# hops = 2)
"fox brown"~1 does NOT match (# hops is actually 2)

I suspect many people do.  You can also set a default slop factor on 
QueryParser so users don't have to use the ~10 syntax.

Also have a look at the new (in Lucene 1.4) SpanQuery family.  It has a 
less confusing "slop factor" and you can control whether the terms must 
be in order or not (with SpanNearQuery).  QueryParser does not support 
it currently, but subclassing and overriding getFieldQuery makes it 
possible.
