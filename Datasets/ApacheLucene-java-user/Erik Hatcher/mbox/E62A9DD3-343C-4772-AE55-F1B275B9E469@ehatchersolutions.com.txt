As I read it offered a number of solutions:

   * Twiddle the *.fnm files (carefully)

   * Use string substitution on the users query, so "foo:whatever" ->  
"bar:whatever" under the covers

   * Wrap IndexReader

Effectively that process would only be changing the *.fnm files as  
mentioned in that thread.
