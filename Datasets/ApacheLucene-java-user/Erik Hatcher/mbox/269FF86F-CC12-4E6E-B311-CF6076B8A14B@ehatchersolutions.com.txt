Thank you for the latter!  For the former, thanks go to Doug and many  
others.

The case studies chapter has some examples of metadata driven  
configuration as in TheServerSide section.  There aren't any "best  
practices" in this regard.  Every environment has a different way to  
configure it some via JNDI, some via deployment descriptors, most  
probably hard-coded, some via .properties files, some via Ant build  
files (see contrib/ant), and so on.  Solr and Nutch are projects that  
leverage Lucene underneath and add a layer of configurability on top  
- you can check out how they've done this.

Yup, as mentioned earlier, PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper is handy in this  
scenario.
