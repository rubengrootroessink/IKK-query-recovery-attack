Rather than changing StandardAnalyzer, you could create a custom  
Analyzer that is something along the lines of StandardTokenizer  ->  
custom apostrophe splitting filter -> ISOLatinFilter.  You get a  
special type for words with interior apostrophes from  
StandardTokenizer (look at StandardFilter to see how that works).   
You could create a simple TokenFilter that splits apostrophe'd tokens  
into two.  Maybe it's simple enough also to expand "j" and "l" into  
"je" and "le" in the same step too?
