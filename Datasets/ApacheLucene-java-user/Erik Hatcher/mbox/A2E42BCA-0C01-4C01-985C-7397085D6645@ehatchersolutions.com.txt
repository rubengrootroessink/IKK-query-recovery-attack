I completely concur.  It is for the gurus of the inner workings to  
discuss the feasibility of this sort of thing.  I believe Doug did  
add some kind of additional information, though I don't recall the  
specifics.  Could someone elaborate on the pros/cons to this sort of  
thing?

Subject, predicate, object.... right within my current work context  
of learning and building a system that leverages RDF heavily.
