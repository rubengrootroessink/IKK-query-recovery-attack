I suppose you mean "search within search", so that the second search is 
constrained by the results of the first query.  If so....

There are two primary options:

   - Use QueryFilter with the previous query as the filter (search the 
archives for QueryFilter and Doug's recommendations against using it 
for this purpose)

   - Combine the previous query with the current query using 
BooleanQuery, using the previous query as required.

The BooleanQuery is the most recommended way.
