The short answer is yes.  http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=xml

The longer response is more involved - what are your needs?

I built a search engine for the Rossetti Archive.  All of the data  
originated in XML files that I read with JDOM and indexed in some  
sophisticated ways.  The main search page is here (showing a bit of  
the structural information that was indexed):

     http://www.rossettiarchive.org/rose

Here is an example search result: http://www.rossettiarchive.org/ 
rose/?query=%2Bblessed+%2Bdamozel
