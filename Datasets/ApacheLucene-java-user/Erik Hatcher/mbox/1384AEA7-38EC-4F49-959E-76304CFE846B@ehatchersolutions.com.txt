GermanStemFilter (not GermanFilter) is specific to German.   
PorterStemFilter is for English.  SnowballAnalyzer is an engine that  
runs any of the available stemmers (there is German, a few different  
English ones, and several other language-specific stemmers).

Your best bet would be to give each of them a try on some sample text  
and see which one fits best for your needs.
