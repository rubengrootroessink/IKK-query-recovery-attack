Hits from all non-HitCollector searches are "normalized".  Normalized  
in this sense means that if the top-scoring document scores higher  
than 1.0 it is normalized to 1.0 and that ratio is used to normalize  
all scores.  However, if the top-scoring document is under 1.0, the  
scores are left as-is.

Searches using a HitCollector are always left as-is.

Have a look at IndexSearcher.explain() results for document/query  
combinations to see what is causing the lower than expected scores.
