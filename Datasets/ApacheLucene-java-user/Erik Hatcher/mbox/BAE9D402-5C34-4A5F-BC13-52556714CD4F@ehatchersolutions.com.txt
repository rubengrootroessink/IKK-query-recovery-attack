How you design your index requires consideration of all you're trying  
to do with it.  It's an art form, in fact.  So while we can offer  
some ideas, ultimately you have to find what fits.   The granularity  
of what you index as a Document is the granularity of what you get  
back from searches as Hits.

There are blended approaches - an index does not have to be  
homogeneous in Document design.  You could have documents that  
represent the entire e-book, and documents that represent each  
paragraph.  You can use a field on each document "type" to  
distinguish them and filter in a search.
