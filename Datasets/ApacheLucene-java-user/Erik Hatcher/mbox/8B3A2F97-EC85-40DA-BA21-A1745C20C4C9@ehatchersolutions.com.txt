This is quite debatable.  I personally don't think the ends of the  
ranges should be swapped when the left one is greater than the right  
one.  The word "TO" indicates the user is supplying the ends already  
in order.

But if the consensus was to adjust it, I wouldn't object.

You could leave the "+" off for positive numbers.  That'd do the  
trick, right?  "-" < "0" lexicographically.
