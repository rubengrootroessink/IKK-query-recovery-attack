Whether you use the *same* analyzer or not is a great question.  In  
most cases, yes, you should.  But the more correct answer is that you  
need to use compatible analyzers.

For example:
If you're injecting synonyms during indexing, there is no need to  
inject them during query parsing.  In that case, the analyzers would  
do the same processing steps except the indexing one would also  
inject synonyms.
