No, not with Lucene 1.4.3.  But the Subversion trunk has a feature  
that can facilitate this sort of thing by building two indexes, one  
with the data and one with the security information.  Look at  
ParallelReader and it's javadocs.

However, for data like permissions, ACL's, groups, etc, it may be  
better to keep the information where it originally resides and have a  
Filter that accesses the external data.  It would likely be easier  
and quicker to re-instantiate Filter's than to rebuild a security  
index and less duplication.
