SUBJECT: sanity check - index size
DATE: 20 May 2002

I'm indexing 900+ files (less than 1,000) that total about 15MB in size.
These are text files and HTML files.  I only index them into a few fields
(title, content, filename).  My index (specifically _sd.fdt) is 20MB.  The
bulk of the HTML files are Javadoc files (Ant's own documentation,
actually).

Does that seem at all close to being reasonable/normal?  I am calling
optimize() before closing the index.

Thanks for the sanity check.

    Erik
