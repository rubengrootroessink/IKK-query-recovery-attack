We're not exactly waiting.  I'm working night and day on Solr + Ruby  
(solrb and Flare) for various projects.

A book project, especially a 2nd edition, is an incredible  
undertaking and commitment.  It is an undertaking Otis and I plan on  
carving out time for in the near future, but predicting exactly when  
that will be is not worth speculating.  Rest assured that this list  
will be kept well informed of LIA2's progress.  java-user is the  
audience to which we most cater.
