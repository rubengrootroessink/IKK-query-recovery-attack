There are several ways to adjust scoring, but I really think your  
best bet is to create a custom Query subclass (and therefore the  
Weight stuff underneath) to accommodate your needs.  I'm going to  
become an audience member for the rest of this discussion as I  
personally don't have experience creating that sort of thing, but  
look forward to learning more about how it can be done.
