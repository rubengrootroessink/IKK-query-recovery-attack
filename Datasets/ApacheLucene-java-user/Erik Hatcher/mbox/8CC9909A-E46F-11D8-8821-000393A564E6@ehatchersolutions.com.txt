Have a look at the term vector support new in v1.4.  For a document 
number and field name, you get terms and frequencies:

     TermFreqVector vector =
         reader.getTermFreqVector(id, "contents");

Note: you do need to set the storeTermVectors flag on the field during 
indexing to enable it.
