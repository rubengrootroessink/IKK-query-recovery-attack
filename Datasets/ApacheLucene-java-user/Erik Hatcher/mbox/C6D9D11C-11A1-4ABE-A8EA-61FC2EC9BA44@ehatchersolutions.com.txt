DATE: 27 Sep 2006

Lots of possible issues, but we need more information to troubleshoot  
this properly.   How big is your index, number of documents?  total  
file system size of the index?  is your index optimized?  how often  
do you update the index?  how are you managing indexsearcher  
instances after the index is updated?
