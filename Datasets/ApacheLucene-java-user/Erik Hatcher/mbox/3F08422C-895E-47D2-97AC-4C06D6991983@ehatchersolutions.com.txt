Harini - you won't find a custom analyzer that does exactly what  
you've described, but building custom analyzers is pretty  
straightforward.  You can learn a lot about it by looking at the  
pieces within Lucene's source code or the examples (and text) from  
Lucene in Action.

Reading from an external file and aggregating tokens shouldn't be too  
difficult.
