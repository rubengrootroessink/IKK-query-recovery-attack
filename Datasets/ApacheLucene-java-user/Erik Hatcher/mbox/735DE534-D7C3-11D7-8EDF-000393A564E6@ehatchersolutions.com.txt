The common thing I've done and seen others do is glue all the fields 
together into a master searchable field named something like "contents" 
or "keywords" (be sure to put a space in between text so it can be 
tokenized properly).

Your description of searches for "cancer" finding "cancerous" isn't 
really what the fuzzy query is about.  What you're after, I think, is 
more the stemming algorithms used during the analysis phase.  Have a 
look at the SnowballAnalyzer in the Lucene sandbox.  There is a little 
bit about it in the article I wrote for java.net: 
http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/07/30/LuceneIntro.html - it 
definitely sounds like more work in the analysis phase is what you're 
after.
