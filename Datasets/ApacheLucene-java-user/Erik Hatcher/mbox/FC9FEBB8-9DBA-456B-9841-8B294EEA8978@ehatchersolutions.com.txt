Nothing automatic with the built-in analyzers that remove stop  
words... but you could tokenize without removing stop words, and  
remove them before forming the query and taking note of the ones  
removed.  Or create a custom StandardAnalyzer variant that used a  
custom StopFilter that took note of the words removed.

Surely some other ways I haven't thought of too.
