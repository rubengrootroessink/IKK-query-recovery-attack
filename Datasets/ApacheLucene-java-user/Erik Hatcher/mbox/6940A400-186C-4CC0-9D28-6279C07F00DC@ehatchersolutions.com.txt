If you use filter queries (fq) in this manner, you will be caching the  
results, and this could have a negative impact on faceting performance  
if you bump facet field/query entries out of the cache.

Having uncached filter queries would be a good idea: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-407

But for now, you could simply append your "filter" to the original  
query string (unless you're using dismax and need a sophisticated  
clause).
