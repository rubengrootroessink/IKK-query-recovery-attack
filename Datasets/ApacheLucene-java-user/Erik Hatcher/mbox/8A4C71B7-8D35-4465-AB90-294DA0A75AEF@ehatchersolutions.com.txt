Could you be more specific about what you want that Lucene does not  
already provide?

FSDirectory is essentially a serialized RAMDirectory.  What do you  
mean by "unpack the file"?  There is nothing special needed to move  
an index from one machine to another, simply copy the entire  
directory and use your searching code to refer to its location.
