Deciding how to slice a domain into Documents is one of the most  
important decisions to make with Lucene usage, and not one that  
Lucene itself gives an answer to.  There are precedents that have  
been set and advice that users here can give, but ultimately how to  
represent your domain in Lucene is up to you.

Do users of your search system need to know about the PDF/Word/HTML  
documents?  Or should they simply know about "products"?  If all you  
need back is the product, then the simplest approach would be to  
create one Lucene Document per product, parse all the files and data  
associated with it and add it as text to fields.  If the search  
system is simple in that fielded search is not needed, simply create  
two fields per Document: id and text.  Field "id" is the product id,  
and "text" is an aggregation of all the text associated with the  
product regardless of where it came from (careful if you're doing  
string concatenation to put whitespace between so you don't blur  
words together).

There are many other ways to approach this and my recommendation is  
just the simplest one based on the description of your needs.
