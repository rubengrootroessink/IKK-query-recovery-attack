Lucene's WildcardQuery *does* support "postfix" queries - however  
QueryParser does not allow such an expression to pass through.  You  
can create a WildcardQuery with a Term("field", "*whatever") and  
search with that.  All caveats about WildcardQuery, performance, and  
maximum number of boolean clauses apply.
