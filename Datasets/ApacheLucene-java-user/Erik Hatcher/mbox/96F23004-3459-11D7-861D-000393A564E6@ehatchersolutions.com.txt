If you look at the contributions/ant area of the Lucene sandbox in CVS  
you'll see my HtmlDocument class which uses JTidy.

Rather than making up some invalid HTML tag, I'd recommend you separate  
your navigation section with a <div> or <span> with a special  
class="navigation" or something like that.  Then use JTidy to ignore  
such tags that have that class.  Then you get valid, clean HTML and the  
ability to filter it for indexing.
