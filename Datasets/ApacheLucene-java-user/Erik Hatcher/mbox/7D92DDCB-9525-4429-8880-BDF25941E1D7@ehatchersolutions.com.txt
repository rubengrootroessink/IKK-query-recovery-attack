I'm guessing QueryParser actually throws an exception, not  
IndexSearcher, correct?  Wildcards at the beginning of a term are not  
allowed by QueryParser.

Using \**11 works because the first character is literally an  
asterisk, and thus is a legal expression.

I see the issue though - by making it \** at the beginning, you've  
effectively bypassed the QueryParser protection of not allowing  
prefixed wildcard terms but achieved the same thing.  Interesting hack!
