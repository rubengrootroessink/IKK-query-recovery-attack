Be forewarned - you are asking for trouble doing this if you have 
enormous number of hits.  I highly recommend you reconsider your 
approach.

Sure, separation of concerns/tiers is a nice ideal, but pragmatically 
don't let blind adherence to "principles" get in the way of 
performance/scalability.

I'm not following what you mean.  Not continuous?  Batches?  Now is the 
time for you to show some code of what you're doing.  Succinct, clear, 
examples are best.
