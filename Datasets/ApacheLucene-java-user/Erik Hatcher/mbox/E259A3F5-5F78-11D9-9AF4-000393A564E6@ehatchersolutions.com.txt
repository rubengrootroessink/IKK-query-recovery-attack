Try out the Indexer code from Lucene in Action.  You can download it 
from the link here: 
http://www.lucenebook.com/blog/announcements/sourcecode.html

It'll be cleaner to follow and borrow from.  The code that ships with 
Lucene is for demonstration purposes.  It surprises me how often folks 
use that code to build real indexes.  It's quite straightforward to 
create your own Java code to do the indexing in whatever manner you 
like, borrowing from examples.

When you get the download unpacked, simply run "ant Indexer" to see it 
in action.  And then "ant Searcher" to search the index just built.
