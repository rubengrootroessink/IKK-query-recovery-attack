Keep us posted if/when you return to this.  I would love to see XPath 
query capability on "hierarchical" content indexed in Lucene.  Jakarta 
Slide, for example, is starting to build in Lucene indexing capability 
- although I don't think they are doing anything with XPath query 
expressions yet.

Anyone doing anything similar?  Implementation ideas?
