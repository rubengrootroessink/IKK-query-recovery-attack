Nutch uses NekoHTML, so you can browse around that codebase and borrow 
its implementation.  The sandbox has a contribution/ant directory which 
contains an HTMLDocument that uses JTidy to parse HTML which does a 
pretty good job at handling bad HTML.

Why isn't it in the distribution?  Parsing HTML and turning it into a 
Lucene document is not always done the same way and doing so is really 
on top of the core, not integral to it.
