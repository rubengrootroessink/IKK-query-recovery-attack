Lucene has historically taken the exact opposite approach... open up  
the API as needed.  Unless there is very good reason for it, classes  
and data should be kept private.

You bring up some points that need to be made to justify opening up  
specific classes.  Sounds like a good discussion for the java-dev  
list on a case by case basis.
