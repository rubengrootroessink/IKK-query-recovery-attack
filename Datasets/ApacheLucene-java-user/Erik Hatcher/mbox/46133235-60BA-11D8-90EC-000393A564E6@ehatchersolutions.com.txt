You are now venturing under the covers of Lucene's API.  This is where 
I give the sage advice to get the Lucene source code and surf around it 
a bit.  (It helps to have a nice IDE where you can click around classes 
and see the object hierarchy easily)

TokenStream is used by the Analyzer to split text into terms.

The field is the field name.  No built-in analyzers use it, but custom 
analyzers could key off of it to do field-specific analysis.  Look at 
the PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper to make per-field analysis easier than 
writing a custom one that keys off the field name.
