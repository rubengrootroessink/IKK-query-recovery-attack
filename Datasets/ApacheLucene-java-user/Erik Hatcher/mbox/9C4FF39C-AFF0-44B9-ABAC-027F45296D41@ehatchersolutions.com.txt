My apologies here.  The trunk of Subversion has parts that are not  
backwards compatible.  You probably can get back to the old CVS  
repository and pull the jakarta-lucene-sandbox codebase, but an  
easier download would be to use the Highlighter JAR found in the  
Lucene in Action codebase at http://www.lucenebook.com

In future releases of Lucene, all the contrib pieces will ship in the  
binary downloads in binary form and the source code will be packaged  
up in the source downloads.  In the past, the sandbox was a built-it- 
yourself batteries-not-included area.

     Erik
