I recommend against using DateField, because it's granularity is down  
to the millisecond and has some nuances to it, but there are a few  
options to doing what you want.  Use a date field as YYYYMMDD format  
instead (unless you need a time also).

1) Documents in Lucene are in order of insertion, so if you're  
inserting them in chronological order, you could simply direct access  
the last five documents without a search.  2) There is no (well,  
minimal) storage overhead in doing a full search and only getting the  
most recent 5 documents, provided you sort the search by the date  
field.  3) There are expert-level search() methods that do allow  
limiting to N number of results, but that isn't really necessary (see  
javadocs for details - they literally are marked as "expert").
