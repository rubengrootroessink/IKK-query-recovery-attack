Yes, in Lucene terminology these two are the same.

That is correct.  A Keyword field is taken exact case as-is as a  
single term.  A token is one piece of the analysis process.  A term  
what tokens are called when indexed.

Saying that it has to be an exact match is being a bit too  
simplistic... it is possible to find terms inexactly by fuzzy,  
prefix, and wildcard queries for example.
