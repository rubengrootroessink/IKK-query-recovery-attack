RangeQuery expands under the covers to a BooleanQuery with all  
matching terms OR'd together.

In your case, if you've indexed a term for every day in that range  
using YYYYMMDD then you've got 2,524 terms roughly = 7 * 365 - 31  
(minus 31 because you'd omit December '05 since you are only going to  
200512).  If all you need is YYYYMM range searching, then index it as  
that (that'd be 7 years * 12 months/year = 84 terms).
