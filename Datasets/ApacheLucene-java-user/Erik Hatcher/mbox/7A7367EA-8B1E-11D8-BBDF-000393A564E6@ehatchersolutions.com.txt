Thats the beauty.... it is up to you to load the doc iff you want it.  
In many situations, loading the doc would slow things down 
dramatically.  For example, QueryFilter uses a HitCollector internally, 
but could care less about the actual document object, just its id 
(which you get from the int doc).  To get the doc:

	 Document document = searcher.doc(doc);

(I'd use 'id' for the int, personally).
