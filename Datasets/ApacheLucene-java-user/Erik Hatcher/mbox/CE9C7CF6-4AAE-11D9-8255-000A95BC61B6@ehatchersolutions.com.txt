Unfortunately there isn't a clean way to stop a HitCollector - it will 
simply collect all hits.

Also, scores are _not_ normalized when passed to a HitCollector, so you 
may get scores > 1.0.  Hits, however, does normalize and you're 
guaranteed that scores will be <= 1.0.  Hits are in descending score 
order, so you may just want to use Hits and filter based on the score 
provided by hits.score(i).
