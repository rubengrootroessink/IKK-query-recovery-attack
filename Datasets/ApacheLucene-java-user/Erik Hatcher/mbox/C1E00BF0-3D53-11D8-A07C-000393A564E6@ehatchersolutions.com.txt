Quite sadly, the demo application that ships with Lucene is inadequate 
for a nice sales pitch or starter demo to lure folks in.  It is my plan 
(eventually - more later than sooner at this point, but you can 
definitely count on it from me) to enhance the demo application to be 
quite nice and easy to use.

The source code to HTMLDocument shows what fields are indexed.  To 
search on a specific field, use the syntax you see here: 
<http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html>

There are articles available on the resources page: 
<http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/resources.html>, and a new one 
of mine that isn't listed there (yet) at 
<http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/11/07/QueryParserRules.html>

My recommendation is for you to do your own experimenting and not try 
to tinker with the demo application.  What you need to know to use 
Lucene effectively is actually quite simple and you can glean all of 
that from the articles in a cleaner way than the demo app.
