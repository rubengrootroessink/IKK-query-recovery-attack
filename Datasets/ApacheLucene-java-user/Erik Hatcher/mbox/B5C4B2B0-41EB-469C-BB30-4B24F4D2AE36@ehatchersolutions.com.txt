No, that article has not been updated for the 2.0 API.

The main things that changed from the version of Lucene used in that  
article are:

	* QueryParser must now be instantiated and the instance .parse()  
must be used instead of the previous QueryParser.parse() static method.

	* BooleanQuery.add() now uses the Occur enumeration rather than the  
boolean flags.

You can reference the javadocs for the 2.0 QueryParser and  
BooleanQuery APIs here: <http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/ 
index.html> and that will help you resolve any compilation issues you  
get when using code examples for previous versions.

Given the nature of your questions I recommend you download Lucene  
1.9 and use it for the time being (at least for the javadocs to see  
the deprecation messages with upgrade details), while you become  
familiar with Lucene.  All the examples you'll find online and in  
Lucene in Action are 1.9 compatible, and the main change between 1.9  
and 2.0 is that all the deprecated methods have been removed.  Once  
you have a working system and understand Lucene's API in more detail,  
you can tidy up any deprecation warnings you get and upgrade to 2.0.
