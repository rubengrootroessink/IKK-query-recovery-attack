What documentation shows that syntax when using Field.Keyword(String,  
Date)?

QueryParser attempts to parse the from and to strings as simple date  
formats with the default locale.  You would use something like  
"created:[01/01/04 TO 07/05/05]".

Please read up on the issues that the default date handling poses  
though.  Simply indexing with YYYYMMDD format is generally a better  
way to go, though you will need to adjust for this to handle range  
queries with QueryParser.  Lots of details of the date issues are in  
Lucene in Action and some details on the wiki too I believe.
