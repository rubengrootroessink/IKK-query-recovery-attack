What do you mean it is not returning all of the documents?  If you  
iterate through the documents provided by Hits it will return _all_  
documents that match that Query.  I recommend you have a look at your  
index with Luke and ensure things are indexed as you expect.  There  
are other IndexSearcher.search() methods you can use that use  
HitCollector or return TopDocs instead of Hits - you could use those  
but the issue is likely nothing those methods would fix.
