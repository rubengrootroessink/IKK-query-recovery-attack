Manning will have the electronic book version available *TODAY* 
(hopefully).  It has been sent to the printers and this process takes a 
few weeks.  I don't expect Amazon.com to be shipping them until January 
though - the book industry really is slow moving.

Otis and I thank everyone for their patience and you can be sure that 
no one wants the book in their hands more then he and I :)
