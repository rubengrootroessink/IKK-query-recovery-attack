Your best bet is to dig around in the codebase.  The Indexer.java code 
is hard-coded to only do .txt file extensions - this was on purpose as 
the first example in the book, figuring someone using this code on the 
their C:\ drive would be relatively safe and fast to run.

Their is also an example easily run from the Ant launcher to show how 
various document types can be handled using an extensible framework.  
Run "ant ExtensionFileHandler".  It doesn't actually index the document 
it creates, but displays it to the console.  It would be pretty trivial 
to pair the Indexer.java code up with the file handler framework to 
crawl a directory tree and index any content it recognizes.

You got all the code already.  It should be fairly straightforward to 
navigate the src tree, especially with the Table of Contents handy:

(incidentally, this dynamic TOC page is blending the blog content with 
the TOC using an IndexReader to find all blog entries that refer to 
each section - and you'll see the two, minor and cosmetic, errata 
listed there already).
