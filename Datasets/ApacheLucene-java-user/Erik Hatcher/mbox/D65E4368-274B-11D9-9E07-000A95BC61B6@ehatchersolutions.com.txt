The harm is in performance and resource utilization.  Rather than do 
this, though, read on...

Do you really need to do ranges down to that time level?  Or are you 
really just concerned with date?  If you indexed using YYYYMMDD 
instead, there would only be a maximum of 365 terms in that range, 
whereas you've got zillions (ok, I was too lazy to do the math!  But 
far more than 1,024).

I recommend changing how you index dates, or at least use a different 
field for queries that do not need to concern themselves with the 
timestamp aspect.
