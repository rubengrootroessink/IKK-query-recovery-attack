Look in Lucene's sandbox for analyzers for all sorts of languages.

I suspect this is a highly subjective situation.  Indexing and 
searching of documents of any language is "supported" by the core 
Lucene API.  Analysis is where the differences come out.  Stemming, 
stop word removal, and dealing with normalizing diacritical characters 
seem to be the common issues needed for various languages.

The short answer is: if you can get text into Lucene, you can search on 
it.  How that text gets in is up to you.  The Analyzers in the sandbox 
may just help you on your way, but they are far from the only way to do 
it.
