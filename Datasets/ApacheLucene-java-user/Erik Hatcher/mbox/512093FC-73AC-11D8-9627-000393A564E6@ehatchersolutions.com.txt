SUBJECT: Re: DocumentWriter, StopFilter should use HashMap... (patch)

Part of the dilemma of which implementation to actually be used will be 
solved implicit since our function to construct the Set will return a 
HashSet - and this will surely be the method most folks would use.  But 
I will be sure to note in the Javadoc that the implementation of the 
Set is important.
