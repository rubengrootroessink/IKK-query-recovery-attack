I would go so far as to even recommend that javacc.home be defined in
build.xml with a default location that is the recommend "home" for it and if
it needs adjusting it would happen via build.properties or -D command-line
switch.

Again, I'm here to help and volunteer my Ant expertise to lucene-dev.  Just
e-mail me and ask!
