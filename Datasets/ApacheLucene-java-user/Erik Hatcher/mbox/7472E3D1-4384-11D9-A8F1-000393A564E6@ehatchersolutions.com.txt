Are you really showing *all* results at one time?  Or just the first 
several?  Iterating over all hits and retrieving each Document is often 
unwise and generally unnecessary if only the first 20 or so are shown 
at first.

I don't know of a simpler way to get all the "path" values in your 
example.  Perhaps a HitCollector is more to your liking?  Though it 
probably would not speed anything up for you.
