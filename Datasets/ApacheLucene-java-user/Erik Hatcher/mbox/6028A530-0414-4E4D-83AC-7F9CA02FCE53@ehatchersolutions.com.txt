The old Jakarta Lucene Sandbox is still available via CVS:

     cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic co jakarta- 
lucene-sandbox

I think you want false, not true.  The boolean flag refers to term  
vector data.

No.  It's the same as add(tq, false, false)

At this point we're probably too far removed from it to accomplish  
that cleanly.  MoreLikeThis may not have ever been 1.4.3 compatible -  
I don't recall - it certainly wasn't added until well after 1.4.3 was  
released.  The CVS repository should be sufficient for folks to build  
it themselves if necessary.

For most of the old Sandbox contributions, you can find binary  
releases of those in the Lucene in Action code distribution at  
www.lucenebook.com
