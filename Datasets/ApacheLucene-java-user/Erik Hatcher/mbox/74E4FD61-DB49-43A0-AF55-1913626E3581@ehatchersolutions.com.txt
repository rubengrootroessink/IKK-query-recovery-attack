David,

I was moments away from sending out a status on LIA2.  I posted the  
short and sweet version here:

	<http://www.manning-sandbox.com/thread.jspa?messageID=56559&#56559>

Excerpted: "Yes, we are planning a 2nd edition. The road from LIA1 to  
LIA2 has been a combination of busyness, lazyness, and now its just  
plain pragmatic. Lucene has been undergoing massive changes (for the  
better, if you can imagine that Lucene could actually get better!!!)  
which are still works in progress. Otis and I have decided that it is  
best to wait for at least the next 6 months or so and let Lucene  
stabilize in functionality and we'll shake it out in the 2nd edition.  
Don't hold your breath, except only briefly at times. I can't say  
when for sure, but I'd put money on seeing a new edition before  
2010  :)"

I've posted some other bits about converting the LIA1 codebase to be  
Lucene 2.0 compatible on this list, with a pointer to the thread here:

	<http://www.manning-sandbox.com/thread.jspa?threadID=17404&tstart=0>

All the concepts from LIA1 and the bulk of the API still apply.  Some  
API was changed, and it is a relatively minor adjustment to convert  
to 2.0 style following the instructions indirectly linked to above.

LIA2 will be a fairly massive undertaking, requiring that Otis and I  
both put our lives, wives, and children on hold for a bit.  When  
Lucene is ready for the second edition to begin, we'll do our best to  
jump right in and get to work.

	Erik
