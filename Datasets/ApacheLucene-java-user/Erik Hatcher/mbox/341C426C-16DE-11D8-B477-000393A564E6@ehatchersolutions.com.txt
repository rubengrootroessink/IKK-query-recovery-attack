BooleanQuery _could_ take the order of terms into account for weighting 
and scale the weights accordingly, I believe.

I get the feeling you're looking for reasons that Lucene is inadequate. 
  This may be the case for the uses you're speaking of, but there is 
quite a bit of flexibility with Lucene in terms of Analysis, scoring, 
and custom Query implementations that all relate to what you've been 
speaking of.  And, of course, Lucene is a low-level component of which 
a higher level piece could be built around.
