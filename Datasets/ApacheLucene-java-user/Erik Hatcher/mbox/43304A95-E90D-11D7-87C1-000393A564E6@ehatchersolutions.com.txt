DATE: 17 Sep 2003

please keep the discussions on the lucene-user e-mail list.

of course the source code will be available... what is there is already 
in lucene's CVS and i will just revamp what is there and commit it.  
and when we make lucene releases it will be bundled and made available 
as a single download too.

as for indexing XML files.... that is a possibility, but that is a 
broad request.  how would they be indexed?  every element made a field? 
  every attribute too?  what are the field names?  is this really 
appropriate for a "demo"?
