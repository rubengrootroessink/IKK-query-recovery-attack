It definitely cannot be done with custom token types.  You're probably 
aiming for field-specific boosting, so you will need to parse the HTML 
into separate fields and use a multi-field search approach.

I'm sure there are other tricks that could be used for boosting, like 
inserting the words inside <b> multiple times into the same field for 
example.
