SUBJECT: Re: proximity search not working when extending the QueryParser
DATE: 27 Jun 2005

Ross - could you please show us a bit of your code so we can see  
explicitly what you're doing and how it's not working as expected?   
set/getPhraseSlop are quite straightforward, so unless you're mixing  
up the static versus instance parse methods with QueryParser then I  
don't know what could be wrong at this point.
