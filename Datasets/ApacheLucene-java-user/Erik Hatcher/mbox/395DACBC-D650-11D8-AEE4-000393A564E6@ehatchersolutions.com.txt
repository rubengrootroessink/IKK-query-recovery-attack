Kathik,

I have a really hard time following your questions, otherwise I'd chime 
in on them more often.  Your meaning is not often clear.

In the case of normalizing the score to 1.0 or less - this is precisely 
what Hits does for you.  I'm not sure what you mean by "BEFORE" doing 
QueryParser - a score is computed based on a query, so it necessarily 
must come after.
