Try it and see :)

It should work fine by replacing the JAR, with no recompilation 
necessary.  The more important question is do you need to reindex.  
Most likely not, but there have been some versions of Lucene that have 
changed how some factors were computed and a reindex is needed in those 
cases to keep things in sync.
