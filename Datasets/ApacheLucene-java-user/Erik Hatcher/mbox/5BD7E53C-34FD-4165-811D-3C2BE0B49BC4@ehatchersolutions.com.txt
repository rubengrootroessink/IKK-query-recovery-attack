*arg* :)  As I said in my original message... ParallelReader is in  
Subversion trunk.  It does not exist in a released version of Lucene  
yet.  It will be part of 1.9.  The trunk of Subversion is quite  
stable - feel free to build Lucene from there and use it.

This is basically what ParallelReader does - joins two parallel  
indexes that line up _exactly_ in document insertion order.

One strong recommendation I make regarding Lucene (and coding in  
general): don't pre-suppose things about performance.  Implement the  
solution in the cleanest most logical way, try it, and if there are  
issues, then tune.

Thank you!
