This is by-design "issue" with QueryParser (to avoid WildcardQuery's  
from being created that run through every term in the index).  It is  
the way the grammar has been defined.  You would need to build your  
own QueryParser to change this behavior.   The relevant QueryParser  
grammar piece is this (from QueryParser.jj):

| <WILDTERM:  <_TERM_START_CHAR>
               (<_TERM_CHAR> | ( [ "*", "?" ] ))* >
