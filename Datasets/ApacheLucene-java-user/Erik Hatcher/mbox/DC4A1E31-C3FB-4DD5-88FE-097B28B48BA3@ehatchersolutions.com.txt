last.fm using Lucene, sweet!   It has caught on with quite a number  
of friends, so I tried it just yesterday and my first query for music  
like "Michael Hedges" turned up nothing, so I was bummed.   - but it  
is a very cool service.

Rather than building a string to index in this manner, perhaps adding  
each integer as an individual Field with the same name, with the term  
vector enabled, and using something like the WhitespaceAnalyzer.  To  
be honest, though, I'm not sure without digging deeper whether adding  
same-named fields in this manner messes with the term vector  
capabilities.
