It doesn't seem like you need a "parser" at all for your field- 
specific search fields.  Simply tokenize, using a Lucene Analyzer,  
the text field and build up a BooleanQuery of all the tokens.

QueryParser is over prescribed - and is often not the best fit for  
the job.  It's only a few lines of code to tokenize (look at the  
QueryParser code in how it creates a PhraseQuery, for example) and  
build a Query from the tokens.

If you need to support +/-/AND/OR syntax in your field-specific  
inputs that's a different story - though your example does not show  
this need.  If so, copying the QueryParser.jj file and removing the  
"field:" syntax and fixing all created Query objects to a specified  
single field might be the trick.
