You're doing the right thing.  Although codebase details are most 
appropriate for the lucene-dev list.  And filing issues in Bugzilla 
ensures your requests do not get lost e-mail inboxes.

At this point, Lucene 1.4 has been released and Doug has put forth a 
proposal for Lucene 2.0 (with a migration path of a version 1.9 
intermediate release).  I'm not sure when the best time is to make this 
change.  We should put API changes to a VOTE on the lucene-dev list 
though.  In fact, I'll post a VOTE for Token now! :)

You are not being ignored - not at all.  Look at the replies you've 
gotten already.

Did they post their changes back?  Did they discuss them here?  I do 
not recall such discussions (although see above about being lost in 
e-mail inboxes - mine is swamped beyond belief).  Are there Bugzilla 
issues with their patches?

I was not referring to your requests in my comment, but rather a 
general comment regarding requests to make things "public" when quite 
sufficient alternatives exist.
