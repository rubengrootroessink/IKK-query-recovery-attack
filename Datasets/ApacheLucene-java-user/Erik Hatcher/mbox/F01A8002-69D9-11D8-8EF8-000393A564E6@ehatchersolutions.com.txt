SUBJECT: Lucene Wiki
DATE: 28 Feb 2004

Lucene's wiki has been migrated to:

	http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene

The old content was migrated to 
<http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/LuceneProjectPages>

Doug has gotten on the wiki bandwagon with Nutch also: 
<http://www.nutch.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Main/Nutch>

I've started PoweredBy and SandBox pages.  I would like to see us 
migrate the committer maintained "powered by" to the wiki and let the 
community self-organize this, taking us committers out of the loop.

Content changes are e-mailed automatically to 
jakarta-lucene-cvs@apache.org.

Have at it folks!

	Erik
