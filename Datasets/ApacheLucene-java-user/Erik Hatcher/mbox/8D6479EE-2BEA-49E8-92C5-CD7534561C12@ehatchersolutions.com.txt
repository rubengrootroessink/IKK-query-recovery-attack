The Snowball stemmer came from Porter, yes.  There was a looser  
stemming algorithm prior to Snowball though, which the  
PorterStemFilter uses.

Multi-lingual stemming is one of the most complex topics I've  
personally come across.  It is not a generalizable thing - each  
language is unique and you'd need to have the language known for each  
word being stemmed.  As far as I know, this is still practically an  
impossible task with existing technology.  If you come across  
something good in this area, please share :)

There are other stemming algorithms, K-Stem is one I've heard of but  
don't know anything about currently.
