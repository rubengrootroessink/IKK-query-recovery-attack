That's not accurate API, but add you used pq.add(t), it still would  
presume that text is all a single term.

Chances are, though, that even getting the query to have the quotes is  
not going to work as you've probably lost the quotes during indexing.   
Check out the AnalysisParalysis page on the wiki and "analyze" your  
Analyzer and make sure you are indexing the text with the quotes (no  
built-in analyzer besides WhitespaceAnalyzer would do that for you).
