The integration won't be too painful... the main thing is that Solr  
requires* some configuration files, literally on the filesystem, in  
order to fire up and be happy.  And you'll need to craft Solr's  
schema.xml to jive with how you indexed with pure Lucene.

That'll do the job, without a servlet engine.  But a servlet engine  
can be mighty handy when you need to go to distributed search,  
replication, etc.  But one can use Solr very much like using Lucene,  
API-only (but with config files).

Yup, see above.
