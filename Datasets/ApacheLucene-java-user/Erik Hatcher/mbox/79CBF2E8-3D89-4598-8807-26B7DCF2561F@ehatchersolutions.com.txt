Sami,

You're on to the right approach seeking something other than  
FuzzyQuery.  FuzzyQuery is rarely generally useful and there are  
other ways to achieve the same sort of thing (soundex, metaphone) in  
an efficient manner.

If you could share some details about these properties and how you  
need to query them I'm sure the community could offer suggestions on  
an efficient and clean implementation.  Without details, its not  
possible to (easily) know how recommend a specific technique.

	Erik
