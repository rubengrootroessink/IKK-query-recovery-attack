Teresa,

What bugs are you getting, specifically?   (always a helpful addition  
to a bug report :)

One thing you can try is simply unzipping the source code package and  
running "ant" to ensure all is well.

One thing to note is the code from the book, the original code that  
is, is for Lucene 1.4.3, and because of the changed API the code in  
the book requires some slight changes to work with Lucene 2.0.   
Months ago I updated the code to work with the (then upcoming) 2.0  
API.  I have not uploaded that code though, but will do so soon.

	Erik
