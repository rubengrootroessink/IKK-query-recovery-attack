FROM: Erik Hatcher <e...@ehatchersolutions.com>
SUBJECT: Lucene in Action source code
DATE: 7 Dec 2004

Pasha already broke the news, but here's my official announcement.

The source code distribution to the long-awaited Lucene in Action book 
is now available for download.  You'll find it at:

	http://www.manning.com/hatcher2

Navigate to the "Source Code" link on the left to get to the download 
page.

The source code, of course, does not stand alone, though there is 
benefit to the code by itself.  We'd love to have your feedback on the 
source code - please consult the README file for details on how to 
submit feedback.  Otis and I are right here on these e-mail lists, so 
please post any general Lucene questions here rather than e-mailing us 
directly.  Send only book related feedback to us directly.

The book is forthcoming and should be available in electronic (PDF) 
format very soon (as in today or tomorrow, I'm told).  The print copies 
will ship from the bindery in a few weeks, perhaps even before Xmas.  
Manning sells them directly from the web site noted above, and if you 
purchase the e-book you can get the print copy and e-book all for the 
same price as the print copy (I believe, at least that used to be the 
case - check the website for details when the e-book is available 
there).

	Erik
