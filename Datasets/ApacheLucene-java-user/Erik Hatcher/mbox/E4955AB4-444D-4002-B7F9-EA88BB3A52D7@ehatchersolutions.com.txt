Perhaps that "news" term is coming from a different field?  Are you  
sure that you're seeing the filename field tokenized?  Your usage of  
the field constructor looks fine to me and should not tokenize.

Lucene is case-sensitive.  I suggest lowercasing the field before  
indexing, and search using lowercase.  This is the simplest  
suggestion, but you may need to use some other technique such as  
having different fields (or different indexes) to deal with case- 
sensitivity issues.
