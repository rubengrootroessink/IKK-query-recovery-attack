I suspect we're all here!

QueryParser is Lucene's red-headed step-child.  It works "well enough", 
but it has more than its share of issues.  It is almost a shame it is 
part of Lucene's core because of its loose coupling, but it does make 
Lucene quite approachable for simple applications at least.

A complete rewrite of QueryParser would certainly be welcomed by most, 
I think.
