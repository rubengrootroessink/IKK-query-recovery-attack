I did not mean to imply for you to call the bits method in this manner. 
  In fact, you should not call it - the IndexSearcher calls it under the 
covers.  I was implying that you could write your own Filter subclass 
that lit up a single-bit corresponding to the document you're 
interested in.

No, not related with respect to a filter - two different concepts.

Look at the Lucene index format (from Lucene's main web page).  Term 
frequencies are part of the statistics gathered, of course.  You can 
get at the values there using IndexReader.  This may be a lot 
lower-level than you desire, but what Lucene stores is there for you.
