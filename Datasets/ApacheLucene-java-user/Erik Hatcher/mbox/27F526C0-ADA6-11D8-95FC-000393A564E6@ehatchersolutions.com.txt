You will need to write a custom analyzer to handle this situation.  
Indexing a Keyword as "en-us" does not do anything special for 
QueryParser.  QueryParser analyzes everything, so a special analyzer 
needs to be in place to basically do no analysis (pass through as-is a 
single token) for this particular field.
