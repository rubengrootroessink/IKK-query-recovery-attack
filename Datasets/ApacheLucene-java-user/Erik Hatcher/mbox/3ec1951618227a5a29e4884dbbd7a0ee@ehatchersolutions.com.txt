Lucene is now in Subversion as mentioned on this very list :)

The Sandbox repository was folded into our single Subversion repository 
at:

	http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk

The sandbox code is in a bit of transition right now, as I've moved 
some of it to /contrib, the rest is under /sandbox.
