Where in the FAQ does it indicate this?  This is incorrect.  And I 
don't think this has ever been the case for Lucene.  Indexing and 
searching can most definitely occur at the same time.

It is not too much data for Lucene.  Your architecture around Lucene is 
the more important aspect.

MultiSearcher is pretty trivial to use.  There is an example in Lucene 
in Action's source code ("ant SearchServer") and I'm using a 
MultiSearcher for the upcoming lucenebook.com site like this:

     Searchable[] searchables = new Searchable[indexes.length];

     for (int i = 0; i < indexes.length; i++) {
       searchables[i] = new IndexSearcher(indexes[i]);
     }

     searcher = new MultiSearcher(searchables);

Use MultiSearcher in the same manner as you would IndexSearcher.  You 
can also find out which index a particular hit was from using the 
subSearcher method.

As for your comment about the javadocs, allow me to refer you to 
Lucene's test suite.  TestMultiSearcher.java in this case.  This is the 
best "documentation" there is!  (besides Lucene in Action, of course :)
