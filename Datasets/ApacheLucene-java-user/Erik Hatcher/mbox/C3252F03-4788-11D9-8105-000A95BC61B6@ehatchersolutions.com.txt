See the CHANGES.txt file for details on what changes took place, but 
yes some issues were fixed.

Yes, there should be no problems moving to 1.4.3.

Just replace the JAR.

Yes, announcements should happen on the lucene-user list.  Discussions 
related to the releases occur on lucene-dev.  We have dropped the ball 
on the 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 releases by not following the official release 
rules.  We committers are responsible for taking care of all of these 
loose ends but failed to do so in these cases.  The 1.4.3 release has 
stumbled a bit becoming official too, but it at least is mirrored and 
available at the official download site - we still have some loose ends 
to tidy up with that.

I, for one, certainly apologize for not taking care of these 
administrative details.  There really are no excuses - though I've 
certainly not had a shortage of Lucene related efforts consuming my 
time in the past few months.
