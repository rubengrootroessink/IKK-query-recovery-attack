> exchange of ideas amongst ASF Members, innovators, developers,  
> vendors, and users interested in the future of Open Source  
> technology. The conference program includes competitively selected  
> presentations, trainings/workshops, and a small number of invited

> APACHECON 2009 - LEADING THE WAVE OF OPEN SOURCE
>
> Building on the success of the last two years, we are excited to  
> return to Amsterdam in 2009. We'll be continuing to offer our very  
> popular two-day trainings, including certifications of completion  
> for those who fulfill all the requirements of these trainings.
>
> The ASF comprises some of the most active and recognized developers  
> in the Open Source community. By bringing together the pioneers,  
> developers, and users of flagship Open Source technologies,  
> ApacheCon provides an influential platform for dialogue, between the  
> speaker and the audience, between project contributors and the  
> community at large, traversing a wide range of ideas, expertise, and  
> personalities.
>
> ApacheCon welcomes submissions from like-minded delegates across  
> many fields, geographic locations, and areas of development. The  
> breadth and loosely-structured nature of the Apache community lends  
> itself to conference content that is also somewhat loosely- 
> structured. Common themes of interest address groundbreaking  
> technologies and emerging trends, successful practices (from  
> development to deployment), and lessons learned (tips, tools, and  
> tricks). In addition to technical content, ApacheCon invites  
> Business Track submissions that address Open Source business,  
> marketing, and legal/licensing issues.
>
> Topics appropriate for submission to this conference are manifold,  
> and may include but are not restricted to:
>
> - Apache HTTP server topics such as installation, configuration, and  
> migration

> Maven
