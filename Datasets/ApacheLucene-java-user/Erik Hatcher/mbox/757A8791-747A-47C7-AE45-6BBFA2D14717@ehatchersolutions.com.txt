SUBJECT: Re: Searching/sorting strategy for many properties for semantic web app
DATE: 22 Feb 2006

One very nice implementation to take a look at is the Simile project  
at MIT.   The Piggy Bank and Longwell projects use Lucene to index  
RDF and integrate full-text and structural queries nicely together.
