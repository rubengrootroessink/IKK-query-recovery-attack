I don't really understand your question, and your example is using,  
apparently, your own custom classes that I'm not familiar with.  How  
you access the "whole" document found by searches is entirely up to  
your application design.  You can store information in a fields  
within the Document, or you could have the original document  
elsewhere and access it however appropriate, in which case you'll  
want to have some key to the original document stored as a field.
