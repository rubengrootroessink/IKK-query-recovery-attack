Analyzers are at a per-field granularity, and more than likely your  
XML data contains what you would want treated as multiple fields.  So  
while an analyzer _could_ directly deal with XML, it really is  
unlikely to be the appropriate layer to do so.   The majority of  
scenarios would have XML parsed separately and then the individual  
separated text fed to Lucene fields for analysis.
