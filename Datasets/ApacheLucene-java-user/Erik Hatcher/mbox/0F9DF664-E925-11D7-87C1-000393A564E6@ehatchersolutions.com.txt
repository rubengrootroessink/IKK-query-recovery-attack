Bryan, no offense... but I won't be using the taglib in the demo.  I 
just don't feel accessing a Lucene index via a taglib is the right way 
to do things.  Coupling an index to JSP in that manner is too tight for 
my tastes.  What happens if you want to use Velocity for presentation?  
Or a Swing app?  See what I mean?
