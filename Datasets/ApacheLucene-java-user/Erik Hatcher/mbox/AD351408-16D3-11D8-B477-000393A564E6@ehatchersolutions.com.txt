You mean if you have text like this: "Hello Herb.  Have a nice day!", 
you want to prevent phrase queries for "herb have"?  You could prevent 
sentence boundary crossing with clever use of the token position I 
suspect.  Would that accomplish what you're after?

Could you give a really dumbed down simple example of what you mean by 
inter-term correlation?
