Brian - it is beyond the scope of this e-mail list to go into  
building a web application, though with some trial and error you  
should be able to get something running within a day or less.  Here  
are some general pointers:

Download the latest Tomcat binary release, install it, and get its  
built-in samples working.  Since you've already toyed with Lucene's  
web demo, you're probably already at this point.  Create a new  
directory under Tomcat's webapps directory, place a WEB-INF directory  
under that, then copy the Lucene web app's web.xml over to your new  
WEB-INF directory.  Place a simple "hello world" JSP file in your new  
web app directory (above WEB-INF).  Restart Tomcat, and make sure you  
can navigate to http://localhost:8080/<dirname>/some.jsp and see what  
you put there.  Now copy Lucene's JAR file over to WEB-INF/lib.   
You're now ready to start integrating the search piece into the JSP,  
and here is where you start borrowing pieces of code from LIA's  
Searcher.java and the Lucene demo web app.

I hope some of that helps.  Java is a big big scary world, so I can  
sympathize with the learning curve ahead of you.

     Erik
