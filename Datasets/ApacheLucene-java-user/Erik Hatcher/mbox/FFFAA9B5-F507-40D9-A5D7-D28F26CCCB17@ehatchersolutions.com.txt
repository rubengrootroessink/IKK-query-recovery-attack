Simply use the SnowballAnalyzer that is part of the JAR file that got  
built.  It sounds like you're after more basic instructions than  
that, such as how to put that JAR on your classpath and how to use  
Lucene at a basic level.  Have a look at the articles that have been  
written about Lucene, the (free) codebase to "Lucene in Action" or  
the book itself, or any number of the test cases that exist within  
the Lucene's codebase.

I hope that helps.  Come back with more specific questions and we'd  
be glad to help further.

	Erik
