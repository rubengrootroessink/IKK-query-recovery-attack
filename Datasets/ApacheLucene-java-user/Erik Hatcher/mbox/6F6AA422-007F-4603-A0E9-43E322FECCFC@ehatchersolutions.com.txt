My hunch is that sorting will be fine, but you'll want to warm up the  
caches before putting a new IndexSearcher into production use.  Solr  
does this by running a configurable set of queries against an index  
before swapping out the old IndexSearcher with a new warmed up one.

Solr's FunctionQuery (isn't it time we move this to the core of  
Lucene?! :) might be able to help you out in this situation, but it  
sounds like sorting is what you want to use, not scoring tweaks.
