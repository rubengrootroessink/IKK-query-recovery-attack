Yes, id is the same as document number.

By "renumbered", it means it squeezes out holes left by deletes.  The 
actual order does not change and thus does not affect a Sort.INDEXORDER 
sort.

Documents are stored in the index in the order that they were indexed - 
nothing changes this order.  Document id's are not permanent if deletes 
occur followed by an optimize.
