You want phrase searches not to match across lines?   If you're  
indexing each line as a separate Field instance, you can set the  
position increment gap to something greater than the maximum phrase  
query slop that would be used.

I'm not currently understanding how stop word removal is getting in  
the way though.  An example would be useful to see.
