What you are doing is really the job of an Analyzer.  You are doing 
pre-analysis, when instead you could do all of this within the context 
of a custom analyzer and avoid many of these issues altogether.

Do you use the XML only during indexing?  If so, you could bypass the 
whole conversion to XML and then back through Digester all within an 
analyzer.

Or am I missing something that prevents you from doing it this way?
