QueryParser and Field.Keyword fields are a strange mix.  For some 
background, check the archives as this has been covered pretty 
extensively.

A quick answer is yes you can use MFQP and QP with keyword fields, 
however you need to be careful which analyzer you use.  
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper is a good solution - you'll just need to use an 
analyzer for your keyword field which simply tokenizes the whole string 
as one chunk.  Perhaps such an analyzer should be made part of the 
core?
