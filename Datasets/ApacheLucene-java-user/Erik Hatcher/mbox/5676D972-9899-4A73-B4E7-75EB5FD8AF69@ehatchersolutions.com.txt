Well, that's not quite correct API, but your point is accurate :)

Fields are made up of terms.  A Field.Keyword makes a single term for  
a field.  Adding multiple fields with the same name works even if its  
not Field.Keyword - it simply adds the term(s) to the field.

Good point about documentation - it would be worth noting this  
explicitly.
