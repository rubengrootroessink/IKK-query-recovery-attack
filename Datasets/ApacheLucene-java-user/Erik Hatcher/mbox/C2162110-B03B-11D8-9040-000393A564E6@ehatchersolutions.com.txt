SUBJECT: Re: Tool for analyzing analyzers
DATE: 28 May 2004

Mark,

Nice idea!  (I've had this type of thing on my to-do list for the 
Lucene demo refactoring that I *promise* I'll eventually get around 
to).

I tried to get it to work, though, and was unsuccessful.  It did not 
show me any Analyzers in the drop down (I have the latest CVS version 
of Lucene in my classpath).  Maybe this could be added into Luke as a 
new tab?  You can sort of fake this with Luke now, by entering your 
text as a query and seeing what it parses to, and select an Analyzer.

	Erik
