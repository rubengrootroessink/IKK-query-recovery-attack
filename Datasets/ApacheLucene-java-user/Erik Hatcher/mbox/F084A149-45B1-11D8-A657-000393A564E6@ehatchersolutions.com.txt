The new PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper (in v. 1.3) allows you to specify 
different analyzers, as its name says, per field.  You simply specify 
which analyzer to use as a default and then any special ones for 
individual fields.

As for using the same analyzer for querying as for indexing - that is a 
deeper question that I've yet to agree with.  There are some 
interesting reasons why you may want a different one - although they 
must "cooperate" in some fashion.
