Another important facet to Terry's question here is what syntax to use 
to express all various types of queries?  I suspect that Google stats 
show us that most folks query with 1 - 3 words and do not use the any 
of the advanced features.

The elegance of the query syntax is quite important, and QueryParser 
has gotten a bit hairy.  I would enjoy discussions on creating new 
query parsers (one size doesn't fit all, I don't think) and what syntax 
should be used.

Paul Elschot created a "surround" query parser that he posted about to 
the list in April.
