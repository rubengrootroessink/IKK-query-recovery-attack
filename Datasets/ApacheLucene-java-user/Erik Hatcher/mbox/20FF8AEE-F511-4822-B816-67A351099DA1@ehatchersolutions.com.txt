If the tokens you're searching for are returned from your analyzer,  
then they will be searchable.  If you're using QueryParser for  
searching, then you need to be sure your Query is being constructed  
as you'd like.

To get Luke to use a custom Analyzer, it should have a no-arg  
constructor, and be put in the classpath that you launch Luke from  
and it should appear in the list.

Hope this helps.
