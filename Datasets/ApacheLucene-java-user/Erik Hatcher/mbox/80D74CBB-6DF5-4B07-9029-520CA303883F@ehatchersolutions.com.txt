Chris,

Once upon a time there was a taglib area in the Lucene Sandbox, but  
that has since been removed since the contributor of it disappeared.

What do you need a Lucene taglib to do?  I personally thing such a  
taglib is overkill and harder to use than it would be to just code up  
the functionality you need directly.
