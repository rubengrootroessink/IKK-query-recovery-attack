Analyzing a query expression outside of QueryParser is _not_ doing the  
same thing that QueryParser does.  QueryParser picks out the pieces it  
knows about (parenthesis, boost symbol, AND, OR, etc, etc) and only  
analyzes term text.  In your example it would analyze "jakarta" and  
"apache" separately.

That all depends on what you indexed and what analyzer you used at  
index time :)
