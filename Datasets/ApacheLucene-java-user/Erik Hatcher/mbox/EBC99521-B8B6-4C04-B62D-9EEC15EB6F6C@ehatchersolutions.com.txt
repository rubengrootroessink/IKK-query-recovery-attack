It looks like you've got all the troubleshooting bases covered, so  
I'm not sure what to suggest other than for you to post a simple test  
case that demonstrates the issue.  If you see the term in Luke, and  
it is indexed, then it most definitely can be used to find the  
document using a TermQuery (I hope that is what you meant as  
"manually").  If you're using QueryParser "manually", then perhaps  
your analyzer is causing an issue?   What is the .toString of your  
Query?

Setting maxFieldLength isn't the issue, otherwise you wouldn't have  
seen the term in Luke.
