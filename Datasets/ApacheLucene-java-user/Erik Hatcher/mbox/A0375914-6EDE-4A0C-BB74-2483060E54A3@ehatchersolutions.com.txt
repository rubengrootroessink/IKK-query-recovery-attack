This is a case where you are probably better off starting with Solr,  
which supports faceting natively.

The main trick to making this fast is coming up with cached sets of  
each of the categories and intersecting each of those sets with the  
main result set and using the cardinality of the intersected sets for  
the counts.  Again, Solr is what I'd recommend as a starting point for  
you.
