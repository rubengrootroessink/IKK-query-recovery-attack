That is correct.

I've upgraded the "Lucene in Action" codebase (locally, will release  
it when Lucene 2.0 ships) for the Lucene 2.0 API and here's what I  
did in the IndexBuilder class that used to use Field(String,Date):

       String now = DateTools.dateToString(timestamp.getTime(),  
DateTools.Resolution.MILLISECOND);
       document.add(new Field("last-modified", now, Field.Store.YES,  
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
