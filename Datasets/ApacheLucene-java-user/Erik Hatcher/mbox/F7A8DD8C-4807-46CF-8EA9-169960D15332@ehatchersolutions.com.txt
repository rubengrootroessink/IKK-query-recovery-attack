Yes, it can easily be done by using an analyzer that stems, such as  
the SnowballAnalyzer.  The SnowballAnalyzer is found currently in  
Lucene's subversion repository under contrib/snowball.  Build this  
yourself if you are using Lucene from trunk.  If you're using Lucene  
1.4.3, your best option is to grab the snowball-1.1-dev.jar from the  
"Lucene in Action" codebase - http://www.lucenebook.com - and feel  
free to look at the examples in the src directory there.
