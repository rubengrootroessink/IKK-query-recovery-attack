Here are some pointers:

     - Lucene's javadocs give a brief description, such as <http:// 
lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/ 
StopAnalyzer.html>

     - The source code is the ultimate documentation: <http:// 
svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/ 
lucene/analysis/StopAnalyzer.java?rev=168970&view=markup> - look at  
the tokenStream method

     - Several Lucene articles: <http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta- 
lucene/Resources> with the most relevant being my java.net article  
here: <http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/07/30/LuceneIntro.html>  
where the AnalysisDemo code is provided.

     - And last but certainly not least, "Lucene in Action" :)  You  
can search for details of analyzers at the lucenebook.com site, like  
this: <http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=StopAnalyzer> The  
Analysis chapter in LIA provides in-depth details of each of the  
built-in analyzers.
