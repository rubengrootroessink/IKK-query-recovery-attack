In other words, you need to invent your own "pattern" here?!  :)

The benefit of agility is to know that any decision you make now is not 
something that prohibits you from change later.  Do you really think 
you're going to plug-and-play with search engines?  Or will you be 
sticking with Lucene for the foreseeable future?  Are you trying to 
plan for a future without Lucene when there is no use-case for doing 
so?  If you code with coupling to Lucene, do you see that as making 
life harder in the future, or are you smart enough and flexible enough 
to change your "soft"ware as times change?

Throw your patterns away when they don't solve the problem.  Be 
pragmatic _and_ agile.

	Erik
