But, here's the beauty of Solr... if you're not afraid of a JVM  
running Jetty, Tomcat, Resin, or many others then fire up (Java) Solr  
and use .NET HTTP API to talk to Solr.  It's the best solution  
available and leverage the performance gurus tweaks that make it in  
each new release of Java Lucene and Solr.
