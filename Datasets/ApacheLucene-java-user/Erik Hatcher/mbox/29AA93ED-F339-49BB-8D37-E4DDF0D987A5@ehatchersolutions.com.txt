The demo code does not tap into highlighting.  To integrate the  
highlighter, you'll use its API and add it to the Java code that  
outputs the results.  It's API is here:

	<http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/ 
highlight/package-summary.html>

You'll learn more about the usage of the API by perusing the test  
cases available along with the source code (either in the source  
distribution or Subversion directly).
