I'm really confused on the dilemma here.

You can create a startup hook using one of the Servlet specification  
listeners, create an IndexSearcher there, stuff it into application  
scope (context.setAttribute()).

There is no digging into Jetty's guts needed, just plain and simple  
servlet API will suffice.

Of course you'll also want a facility to re-instantiate the  
IndexSearcher if the index is changing, but that is just building  
upon the pieces I just described.
