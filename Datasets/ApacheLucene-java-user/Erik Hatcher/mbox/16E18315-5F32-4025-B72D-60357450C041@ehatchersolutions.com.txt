What is the tokenizer you're using deeper below the "Stop" you  
mentioned?  The StopAnalyzer itself uses a LetterTokenizer, so  
numbers get removed and only letters remain.

Check out the "analysis paralysis" article I did at java.net and the  
AnalyzerDemo (or is it AnalysisDemo?) in the Lucene in Action  
codebase - it'll shed a lot of light on analyzers.
