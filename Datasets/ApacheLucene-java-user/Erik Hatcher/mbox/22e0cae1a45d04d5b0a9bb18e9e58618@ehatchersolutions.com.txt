No, Lucene doesn't have that feature, at least not explicitly....  it 
could be hacked, sort of, by injecting multiple of the same term in the 
same position (to get a higher term frequency) for the earlier terms.  
Back to the original question - the position information will not 
adversely affect scoring.
