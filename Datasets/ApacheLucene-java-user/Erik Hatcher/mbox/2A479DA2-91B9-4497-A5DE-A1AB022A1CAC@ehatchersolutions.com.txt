Improvements were made to the Highlighter in December to add field- 
specific highlighting capability.  Here's the svn log:

-----
r351504 | mharwood | 2005-12-01 17:18:33 -0500 (Thu, 01 Dec 2005) | 1  
line

Added support for field-specific highlighting which respects the  
fieldnames found in queries. Pass a field name to the QueryScorer in  
order to only select those field's query terms for highlighting.  
Updated JUnit tests too.

You will need to rebuild the Highlighter (contrib/highlighter in  
Subversion) to get this change, and the Highlighter code depends on  
the trunk version of Lucene.  You'll either need to upgrade to the  
latest trunk code of Lucene and the Highlighter, or figure out how to  
backport the Highlighter changes to a 1.4.3 compatible version.  My  
recommendation is to upgrade to the trunk of Lucene and Highlighter.
