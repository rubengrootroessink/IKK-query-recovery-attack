The problem with that solution is the same as what the other thread 
about OutOfMemory is discussing with wildcard queries.

Just prefixing something with a fixed query to 'hack' a wildcard query 
could lead to performance/memory issues.

I recommend indexing the file extension (or mime type) as a separate 
field.
