What other types of queries are you referring to?   No built-in Query  
subclass uses an analyzer.  All terms handed to these Querys must  
"pre analyzed", such that they match how terms were indexed.  You can  
always run through an analyzer to build up queries, just like  
QueryParser does.  Look at AnalyzerDemo (or is it AnalysisDemo?) in  
the Lucene in Action codebase which does this, as well as the  
internals to QueryParser.
