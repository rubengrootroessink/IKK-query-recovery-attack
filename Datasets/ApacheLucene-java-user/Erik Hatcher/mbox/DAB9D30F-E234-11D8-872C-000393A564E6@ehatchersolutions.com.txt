You can do this with the new SpanQuery family in v1.4.  The example you 
gave would consist of a SpanTermQuery for "very", "good", and 
"sometimes", with the first two combined with a SpanNearQuery (with no 
slop, in order), and finally the "very good" SpanNearQuery combined 
with another SpanNearQuery with the "sometimes" SpanTermQuery.  *whew* 
:)

There is no QueryParser support (yet) for such constructs, so doing 
this with the API directly is necessary.  There has been a contribution 
of a new parser that can work with SpanQuery which probably should be 
put in the sandbox soon.
