What analyzer did you use?  SimpleAnalyzer lowercases....

And so your "How" term should be "how" in order to match what you 
indexed.

Be sure to read and understand issues you can encounter with analysis 
in the picture, or in your case in the picture during indexing, but not 
during querying:

In other words, knowing *exactly* what you indexed is extremely vital 
in understanding issues with querying.
