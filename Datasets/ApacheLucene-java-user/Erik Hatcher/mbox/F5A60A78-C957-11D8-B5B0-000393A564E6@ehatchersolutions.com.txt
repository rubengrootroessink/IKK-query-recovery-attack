It all depends on what granularity you care about.  If your application 
only cares about year, month, and day, then I recommend indexing dates 
literally as text YYYYMMDD format, which allows you to query by year 
(or year and month, or year, month, and day) quite efficiently.

If you care about milliseconds, you will need to determine how best to 
handle this when it comes to querying.  A RangeQuery on tons of 
documments that all within the date range is an issue that deserves 
consideration and you may need to do some cached filters in order to 
facilitate such things.
