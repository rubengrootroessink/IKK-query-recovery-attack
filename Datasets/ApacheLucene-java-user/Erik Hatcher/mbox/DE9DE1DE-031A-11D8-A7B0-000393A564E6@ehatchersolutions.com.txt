There is not a more "lucene" way to do this - its really up to you to 
be creative with this.  I'm sure there are folks that have implemented 
something along these lines on top of Lucene.  In fact, I have a 
particular interest in doing so at some point myself.  This is very 
similar to the object-relational issues surrounding relational 
databases - turning a pretty flat structure into an object graph.  
There are several ideas that could be explored by playing tricks with 
fields, such as giving them a hierarchical naming structure and 
querying at the level you like (think Field.Keyword and PrefixQuery, 
for example), and using a field to indicate type and narrowing queries 
to documents of the desired type.

I'm interested to see what others have done in this area, or what ideas 
emerge about how to accomplish this.
