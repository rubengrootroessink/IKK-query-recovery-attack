SUBJECT: LARM - still viable?
DATE: 5 Jan 2004

I'm embarking on a sandbox overhaul in order to unify the build process 
across all codebases there (Ant 1.6 with <import> and <subant> are the 
key!).  In my effort, I'm going to be questioning the codebases and 
seeing if we need to do any cleansing.  The end result is going to be a 
clean sandbox package that we can include alongside the core Lucene 
distribution.

The first project I'm curious about is LARM.  Given that Nutch is 
filling the same niche (it seems to me) and that LARM has not been 
touched in a while, where do we stand with LARM?  Are folks using it?  
Is Nutch a replacement for LARM?  How do they compare/contrast?

	Erik
