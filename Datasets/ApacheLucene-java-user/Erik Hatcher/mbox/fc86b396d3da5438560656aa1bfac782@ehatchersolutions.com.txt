There has been no binary release of it.  The codebase available from 
Subversion checkout and easily built with Ant is available using:

	svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk

The current trunk will be (except for any changes that occur in the 
next few days or weeks) Lucene 1.9 and Lucene 2.0 will be the same as 
1.9 except with the deprecated methods removed.
