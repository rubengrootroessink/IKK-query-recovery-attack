It's not quite true that Kowari only deals with RDF.  It can load and  
parse HTML, for example, and load it directly into a LuceneModel for  
full-text indexing.  You can then query structured information in  
conjunction with full-text Lucene queries.  To get other type of  
content in, you would need to extend Kowari or hand in literal text,  
but it could be done.
