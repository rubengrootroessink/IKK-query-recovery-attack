What about preprocessing the query string and replace colons with a  
space?   Or perhaps escape colons with a backslash (I believe that  
works, but haven't confirmed it lately).

Would users ever need to use fielded selectors?  Or QueryParser  
syntax in general?  If not, then bypass QueryParser altogether and  
analyze the string yourself and build up a query clauses into a  
BooleanQuery.
