SUBJECT: Re: Whitespace Analyzer not producing expected search results

Try using a TermQuery instead of QueryParser to see if you get the  
results you expect.  Exact case matters.

Also, when troubleshooting issues with QueryParser, it is helpful to  
see what the actual Query returned is - try displaying its toString  
output.
