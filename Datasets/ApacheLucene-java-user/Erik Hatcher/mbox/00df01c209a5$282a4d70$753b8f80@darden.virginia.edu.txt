Well, I would certainly encourage you to get the book if you're doing
anything at all with Ant.  But the book itself won't really go into Lucene
details.  I've attached two screen shots from the book to this message (will
they be stripped by the mail server?) - the "canoo" extension is because we
did automated functional testing of our web app with Canoo WebTest. You can
see the Lucene logo and a sophisticated Lucene expression being used in one
screenshot, and the results of that search in the other.

The code will be available for download from Manning's site when the book is
published, but its really nothing elaborate.  I've contributed the Ant task
to do indexing to the lucene-dev crew, and when I finally get some breathing
room I'll commit it to the Lucene sandbox CVS repository (but its in the
mail archives at least).

As for the code wrapping it into a web service and EJB - not much to it
really (laughably simple, actually)- as we wrote a very simple wrapper that
did the querying and returned results so that Lucene's API was not even seen
from tools that searched.  That same wrapper was easily reused no matter
what front-end we wanted to put on it.  I can contribute that code to the
sandbox as well, probably.
