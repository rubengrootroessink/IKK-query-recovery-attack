In your case, you'll need to get the "path" field (since that is  
being stored) and then load the file into a String to pass to the  
highlighter.  The text to highlight must be stored somewhere, and in  
your case it is on the filesystem only.

Be carefuly - you're highlighting all hits there, which will have  
issues if you get a lot of hits.
