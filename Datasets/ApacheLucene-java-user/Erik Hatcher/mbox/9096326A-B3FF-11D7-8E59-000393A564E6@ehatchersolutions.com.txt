SUBJECT: Re: Adding to the same Keyword field
DATE: 12 Jul 2003

It will make multiple "tokens" within the same field.... just as if you 
had used a tokenized field with all the values (and your analyzer split 
them in the manner you're adding them).  Does that make sense?

In other words, adding keywords "foo" and "bar" is the same as using a 
text field as "foo bar" and using the WhitespaceAnalyzer.

If you want to use a query like a TermQuery on 
"http://jakarta.apache.org" then indexing multiple Keyword's with the 
same field name is what you're after.
