The "Lucene in Action" source code - http://www.lucenebook.com - 
contains JAR files, including the Highlighter, for lots of Lucene 
add-on goodies.

Also, Lucene just converted to using Subversion, which is much more 
firewall friendly.  Try this after you have installed the svn client:

	svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk
