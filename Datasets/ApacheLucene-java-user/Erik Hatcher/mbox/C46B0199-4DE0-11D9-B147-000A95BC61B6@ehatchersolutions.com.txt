I use Lucene as the complete data storage for my blog at 
http://www.blogscene.org/erik - all HTTP requests map to a Lucene query 
(based on the path and optional query parameter).   I've been lame and 
have never put any caching in there.

I'm about to start a new project that really needs a relational 
database under the covers, but I'm cringing at the headaches involved 
compared to the joys of using Lucene.
