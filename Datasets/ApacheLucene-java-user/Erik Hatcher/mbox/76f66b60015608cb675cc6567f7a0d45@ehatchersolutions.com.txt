It's not just hard, its impossible in the generalizable sense.  An 
analyzer is involved in parsing a query and could easily 
remove/change/add to the query.  I suspect there are probably issues 
with escaped characters as well.  For many cases with a straightforward 
analyzer and queries that use alphabetic terms then it'll probably work 
fine as you've seen, but relying on Query.toString is risky.
