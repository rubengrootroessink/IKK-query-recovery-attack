Yup, no problem!

It'll be as if you did concatenate them yourself into a single field,  
with a slight caveat.  Multiple same-named fields can have a virtual  
positional gap added to them (see the setPositionGap feature).  This  
can prevent phrases searching across instances of the field.  For  
example, if you indexed "Samual Clemens" and "Mark Twain" as two  
separate "author" fields, but left the default position gap setting,  
someone could query for "clemons twain" and get a hit as an exact  
phrase match.

You'd do it just the way you're doing.
