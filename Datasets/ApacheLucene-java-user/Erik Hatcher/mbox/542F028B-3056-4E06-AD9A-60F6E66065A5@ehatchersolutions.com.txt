If you're ripping out non-alphanumerics, you may as well simply  
create the Query through the API instead of using QueryParser.  I do  
this for all the structured search options on the Rossetti Archive  
search page: http://www.rossettiarchive.org/rose/

I analyze (or string tokenize) the text for a field, and then build a  
Query from it rather than allowing QueryParser expression syntax.   
QueryParser is probably overkill for most applications needs anyway,  
and can end up getting in the way in the cases described in this thread.
