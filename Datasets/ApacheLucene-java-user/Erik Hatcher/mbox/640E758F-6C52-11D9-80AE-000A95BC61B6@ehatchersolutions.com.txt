First off, let me thank you for your work with log4j!  I've been using 
it at lucenebook.com with the SMTPAppender (once I learned that I 
needed a custom trigger to release e-mails when I wanted, not just on 
errors) and it's been working great.

You wouldn't even need the sequence number.  You'll certainly be adding 
the documents to the index in the proper sequence already (right?).  It 
is easy to random access documents if you know Lucene's document ids.  
Here's the pseudo-code....

	- construct an IndexReader
	- open an IndexSearcher using the IndexReader
	- search, getting Hits back
	- for a hit you want to see the context, get hits.id(hit#)
	- subtract context size from the id, grab documents using 
reader.document(id)

You don't "search" for a document by id, but rather jump right to it 
with IndexReader.
