Actually I believe the Xalan and/or Xerces group bundle Ant because they
want to allow easy modifications of the codebase by savvy developers
avoiding the configuration issues needed to install Ant and get it all set
up properly to build their systems.

But in general, I am not for bundling Ant with projects either since its
something we all should have installed separately anyway.
