The problem is you're using the SearchFiles demo code, which uses 
different field names than Indexer.java.  You need to be sure the 
searching and indexing code agree on the field names.  Since you 
borrowed from Indexer.java from LIA, keep borrowing from Searcher.java. 
  You can run "ant Searcher" from the LIA source code.

Be sure to really learn what's going on in that code rather than just 
accepting what its doing - this will pay off as you continue to evolve 
your application.  Indexer.java has only 6 (effective) lines of code 
tied to Lucene's API, and similarly very few lines of Lucene-dependent 
code in Searcher.java.  All of this is demo code, and is designed to be 
adapted to your needs.
