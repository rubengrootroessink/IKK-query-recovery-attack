SUBJECT: Free Webinar: Findability: Designing the Search Experience
DATE: 12 Aug 2010

Here's perhaps the coolest webinar we've done to date, IMO :)

I attended Tyler's presentation at Lucene EuroCon* and thoroughly  
enjoyed it.  Search UI/UX is a fascinating topic to me, and really  
important to do well for the applications most of us are building.

I'm pleased to pass along the blurb below.  See you there!

You don't need billions of dollars or users to build a user-friendly  
search application. In fact, studies of how and why people search have  
revealed a set of principles that can  result in happy users who find  
what they're seeking with as little friction as possible -- and help  
you build a better, more successful search application.

Join special guest Tyler Tate, user experience designer at UK-based  
TwigKit Search, for a high-level discussion of key user interface  
strategies for search that can be leveraged with Lucene and Solr. The  
presentation covers:
* Ten things to know about designing the search experience
* When to assume users know what they’re looking for – and when not to
* Navigation/discovery techniques, such as faceted navigation, tag  
clouds, histograms and more
* Practical considerations in leveraging suggestions into search  
interactions
