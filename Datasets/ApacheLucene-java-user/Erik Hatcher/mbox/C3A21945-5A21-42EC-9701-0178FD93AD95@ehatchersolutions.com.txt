I presume you're asking how QueryParser syntax allows for this?    
Simply add ^2.0 (or whatever boost you'd like) after the expression:

     (erik OR otis)^2.0 lucene

     <http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=%28erik+OR+otis%29%5E2.0 
+lucene>

You'll see the Query from the parse displayed (we use stemming, so  
"otis" get stemmed in this case, poor guy, as does "lucene").
