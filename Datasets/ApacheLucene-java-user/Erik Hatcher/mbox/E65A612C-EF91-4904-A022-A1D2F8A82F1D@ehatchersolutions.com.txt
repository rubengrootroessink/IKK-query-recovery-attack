Could you elaborate on the havoc you've experienced?

Yes, and yes.  You still have to watch out for the TooManyClauses  
exception when doing a plain RangeQuery, but there is now a  
RangeFilter available to help with this situation (which may require  
changing how you construct Query objects in some way).

You need to ensure that the string representation of any terms used  
for range queries be in lexicographical order.  Every term in Lucene  
is essentially a string.

Hope this helps some.
