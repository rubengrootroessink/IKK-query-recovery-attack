SUBJECT: Deeply nested boolean query performance
DATE: 1 Apr 2005

I will soon create some tests for this scenario, but wanted to run this 
by the list as well....

What performance differences would be seen between a query like this:

	a AND b AND c AND d

and this one:

	((a AND b) AND c) AND d

In other words, will building a query with nested boolean queries be 
substantially slower than a single boolean query with many clauses?  Or 
might it be the other way around?

Thanks,
	Erik
