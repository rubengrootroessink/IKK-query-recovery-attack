I think your application deserves a good look at XTF:

Here's an example of its results:

I've been looking into XTF lately.  I've seen that they do some  
patches to Lucene, or at least now extend it somehow, and I'm curious  
if anyone on this list is part of the XTF team and could describe the  
changes they've made to Lucene and possibly submit them for  
consideration into the core.
