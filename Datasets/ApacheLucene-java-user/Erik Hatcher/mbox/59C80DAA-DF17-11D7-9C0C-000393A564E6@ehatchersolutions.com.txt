Do you mean the Ant build file parsing?  That would be the only XML 
parsing in the equation I'm proposing, unless you did it the clunkiest 
XDoclet 1.2 way of having an intermediate XML file.

As for speed.... QDox, I've heard, is the fastest option.  javadoc is 
the slowest parsing of the three I know of (javadoc, xjavadoc, qdox).
