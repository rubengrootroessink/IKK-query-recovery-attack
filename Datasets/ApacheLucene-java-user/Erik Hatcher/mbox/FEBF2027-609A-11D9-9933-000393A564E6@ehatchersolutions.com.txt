CVS commit messages are sent to the lucene-dev e-mail list.  This is 
the best way to see what is happening with the codebase.  As for what 
is planned, see here:

Lucene is community-driven, though, so if you have a compelling 
rationale for why something should be committed by all means lobby for 
it.
