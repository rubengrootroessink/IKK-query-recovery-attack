SUBJECT: Date fields (was: Re: Range queries)
DATE: 23 Jan 2003

Again my apologies to Terry who was patient and confident despite my 
misunderstanding.

I saw a change earlier today (on lucene-dev) with the QueryParser 
syntax updated with more details on the range query format.  I think 
the ambiguity of saying a "date field" is still there though, since the 
Field.Keyword construct supports Date natively now as well as homegrown 
YYYYMMDD String fields.

My question now is: what benefit is the Field.Keyword(String,Date) if 
its easier to deal with dates in YYYYMMDD format?

Its nice that QueryParser can deal with that type of field using the 
SHORT DateFormat - so I can see a slight advantage when QueryParser is 
involved to representing dates as Date's rather than String's, but the 
range query constraints of the open-ended begin or end dates negate 
that benefit it seems.

I'm just trying to understand in more detail the finer points of Lucene 
so that I can make more effective use of its features as well as help 
educate others on it.

	Erik
