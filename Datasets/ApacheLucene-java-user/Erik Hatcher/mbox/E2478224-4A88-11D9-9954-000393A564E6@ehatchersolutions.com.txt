SUBJECT: Lucene in Action e-book now available!
DATE: 10 Dec 2004

The Lucene in Action e-book is now available at Manning's site:

	http://www.manning.com/hatcher2

Manning also put lots of other goodies there, the table of contents, 
"about this book", preface, the foreward from Doug Cutting himself 
(thanks Doug!!!), and a couple of sample chapters.  The complete source 
code is there as well.

Now comes the exciting part to find out what others think of the work 
Otis and I spent 14+ months of our lives on.

	Erik
