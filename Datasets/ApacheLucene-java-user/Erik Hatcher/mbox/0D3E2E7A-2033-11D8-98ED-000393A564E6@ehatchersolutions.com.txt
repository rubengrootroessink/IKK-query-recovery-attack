Actually there is a little bit more to it than understanding the 
analysis phase, and you were right in saying you need to understand '*' 
and '~' as well.

this is searching for all terms that start with "return_res", and 
during analysis you split this into "return" and "res", so no terms 
match.  Same goes for the fuzzy query with ~.

in all of these cases, you're searching for terms that got split by the 
analyzer on indexing (and during QueryParser analysis for 
"return_results", "results.pl").

Tricky stuff, eh?
