No, they don't.  Adding abbreviations, aliases, synonyms, etc is not 
stemming.

Nothing built into Lucene does this, but the infrastructure allows it 
to be added in the form of a custom analysis step.  There are two basic 
approaches, adding aliases at indexing time, or adding them at query 
time by expanding the query.  I created some example analyzers in 
Lucene in Action (grab the source code from the site linked below) that 
demonstrate how this can be done using WordNet (and mock) synonym 
lookup.  You could extrapolate this into looking up abbreviations and 
adding them into the token stream.
