Karthik - I'm concerned that folks will get the wrong idea about  
Lucene based on your advice about indexing once per day.  Lucene does  
very well with incremental indexing, and it really depends on the  
nature of the application on the granularity of indexing.  There  
would be no problem for most normal use applications to index when a  
document is uploaded - especially given that they will be 3-5 page  
Word documents and not massive PDF files or something that needs to  
be done in a background process.
