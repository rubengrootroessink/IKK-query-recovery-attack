The webapp is built from the source code, not included directly as a  
WAR.  If you download the 1.4 binary distribution, luceneweb.war is  
pre-built at the top-level.  If you grab the source release for 1.4,  
use Ant with the war-demo target:

% ant war-demo
Buildfile: build.xml
.
.
.

compile-demo:
     [mkdir] Created dir:  
/Users/erik/Desktop/Downloads/lucene-1.4-final/build/classes/demo
     [javac] Compiling 17 source files to  
/Users/erik/Desktop/Downloads/lucene-1.4-final/build/classes/demo

jar-demo:
       [jar] Building jar:  
/Users/erik/Desktop/Downloads/lucene-1.4-final/build/lucene-demos-1.5- 
rc1-dev.jar

war-demo:
       [war] Building war:  
/Users/erik/Desktop/Downloads/lucene-1.4-final/build/luceneweb.war

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
