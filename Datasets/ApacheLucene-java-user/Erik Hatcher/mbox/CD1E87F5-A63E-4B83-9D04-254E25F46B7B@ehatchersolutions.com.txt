This is one of those areas where it really depends.  It's fine to  
store information in Lucene, but whether that is best for your  
scenario really depends on the rest of your architecture.

Stop iterating Hits after 1000 :)   Or use one of the other .search  
methods that allows you to specify (though this is entering expert- 
level API area) or use a HitCollector.

The first hit here gives you some best practices:

The main idea is simply to re-search for each page, just picking up  
the Hits iteration at the proper offset.  If that is not performant  
enough, then it'd be time to seek another solution, but I've never  
had to go there myself.
