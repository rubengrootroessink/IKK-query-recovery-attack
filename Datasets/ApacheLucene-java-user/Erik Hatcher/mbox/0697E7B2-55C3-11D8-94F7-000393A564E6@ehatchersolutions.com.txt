contribution/ant is not part of Nutch, it is in the Jakarta CVS 
repository jakarta-lucene-sandbox.  Details here:

	<http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/lucene-sandbox/>

you will have to pull it from CVS to use it, and build it yourself.  
There are plans to release binary versions eventually, but for now it 
is "batteries not included"
