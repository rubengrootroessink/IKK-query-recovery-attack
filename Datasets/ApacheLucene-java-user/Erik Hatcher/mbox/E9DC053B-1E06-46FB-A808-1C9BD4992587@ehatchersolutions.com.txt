I will emphasize the other comments made on this regarding the  
Analyzer.  I recommend against programatically adding to the string  
passed to QueryParser because of these types of issues.  You can  
aggregate a parsed expression Query into a BooleanQuery with other  
programmatically created Query objects (such as TermQuery in this case).
