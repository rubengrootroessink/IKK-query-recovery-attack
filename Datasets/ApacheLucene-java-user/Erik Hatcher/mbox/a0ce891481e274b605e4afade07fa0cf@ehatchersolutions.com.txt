No, this particular item is not covered in the book.  My initial 
response was a succinct way of making a point.  A lot of times it is 
worth investing in giving something a try with a little bit of code, 
and doing this with Lucene is trivial.  I don't want to discourage 
anyone from asking questions, but rather encourage us all to do a 
little tinkering to find out things for ourselves and then ask if our 
assumptions don't come out as expected.

In fact, I'd have to mock up an example to find out myself for sure, 
but my hunch is that Lucene would maintain the order as it probably 
doesn't make sense algorithmically to do anything but keep the order.
