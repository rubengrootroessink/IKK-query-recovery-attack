You could, instead, do a string substitution on the string the user  
enters and replace "kw:" with something else.  That'd be quick and  
dirty and probably pretty robust too.

However, it is a good point about allowing QueryParser a way to  
translate field names.  A patch along these lines would be well  
received, I think.
