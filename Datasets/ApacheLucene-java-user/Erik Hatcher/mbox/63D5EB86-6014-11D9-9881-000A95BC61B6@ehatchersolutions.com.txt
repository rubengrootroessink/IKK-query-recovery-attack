It's news to me that Amazon is shipping it in the U.S. even.... but I 
just checked and you're right!  They *just* got it in stock though, so 
I'm sure it takes a bit more time for the U.K. to get it.

It's been shipping from Manning's site for a couple of weeks now 
though, and as noted, it includes the e-book along with it.
