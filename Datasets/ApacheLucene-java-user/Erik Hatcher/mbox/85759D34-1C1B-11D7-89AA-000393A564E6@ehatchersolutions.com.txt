SUBJECT: How to obtain unique field values
DATE: 30 Dec 2002

One final Lucene question for the day...

Is it possible for me to retrieve all the values of a particular field 
that exists within an index, across all documents?  I don't really need 
(or want) to retrieve all documents and then collate them myself into 
unique values, and it seems this information should be readily 
accessible somehow.  If so, could you share how?

For example, I'm indexing documents that have a "category" associated 
with them.  Several documents will share the same category.  I'd like 
to be able to retrieve all categories.

And if you are curious what my project actually is - its my custom 
blogger, BlogScene: http://www.ehatchersolutions.com/servlets/blogscene 
- its a Lucene-based blogger (hence part of the reason for its name).  
All documents are indexed and stored in a Lucene index, and retrieved 
dynamically for every request.  Thanks to Lucene its working very very 
nicely!  I just need to add some polish to it, such as a category list 
and such.

	Erik
