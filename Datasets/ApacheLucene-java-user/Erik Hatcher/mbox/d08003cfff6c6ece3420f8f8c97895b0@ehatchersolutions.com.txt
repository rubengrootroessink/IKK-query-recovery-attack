Only certain (.txt?) attachments are allowed to come through on the 
mailing list.

Using IndexSearcher(query, sort)?

I assume you are only accessing the documents you wish to display 
rather than all of them up to where you need.   Also keep in mind that 
accessing a Document is when the document is pulled from the index.  If 
you have a large amount of data in a document it will take a 
corresponding amount of time to load it.  You may need to restructure 
what you store in a document to reduce the load times.  Or perhaps you 
need to investigate the (is it in the codebase already?) patch to load 
fields lazily upon demand instead.
