I have not tried the sandbox with any versions past WordNet 1.6.  
Karthik shows a Java API to it, which I have not used - only your code 
that parses the prolog files.  So the book code explains exactly what 
is in the sandbox and describes WordNet 1.6 integration.  Though 
WordNet has evolved.

It'd be awesome to have current WordNet support - I haven't looked at 
what is involved in making it so.
