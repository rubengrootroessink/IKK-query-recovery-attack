SUBJECT: Fwd: SearchBean?
DATE: 7 Feb 2005

I want to double-check with the user community now that I've run this 
past the lucene-dev list.

Anyone using SearchBean from the Sandbox?  If so, please speak up and 
let me know what it offers that the sort feature does not.  If this is 
now essentially deprecated, I'd like to remove it.

Thanks,
	Erik
