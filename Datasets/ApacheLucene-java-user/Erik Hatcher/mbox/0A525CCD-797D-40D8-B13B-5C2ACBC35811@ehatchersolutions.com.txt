The names of a field in a document are unique, but you can add  
multiple instances of the same field name.  You can retrieve the  
array of them, if they are stored, as well.  You do have to be  
careful though - a phrase query can match across these field  
instances unless you specify a positional gap between them large  
enough to prevent it.
