The dilemma is that in a general sense there are multiple fields in 
HTML.  At least "title" and "body", and perhaps others from metadata.  
An Analyzer operates only on a single field at a time so cannot split 
its input into multiple fields.

But, yes, it would be possible to strip bracketed text out.  My 
recommendation for such would be to implement a Tokenizer to do this 
that could be used to feed an analysis process.
