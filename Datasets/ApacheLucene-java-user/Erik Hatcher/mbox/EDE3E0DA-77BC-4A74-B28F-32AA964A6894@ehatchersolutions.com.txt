There is a language identifier plugin in the Nutch codebase that  
could surely be distilled (and there are plans to do so) into a  
standalone library:

	<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/nutch/trunk/src/plugin/ 
languageidentifier/>

Stemming shouldn't be considered for reducing index size, but rather  
to improve a users experience in findability.  It is quite useful in  
the right situations, but it is not something that all projects  
desire, so you'd have to see if it fits your needs specifically.
