I'm confused on what you are planning doing.  Are you going to replace 
all spaces with an underscore before handing it to the analyzer?  
StandardAnalyzer will still split at the underscores though.

If you have special tokenization needs, why try to hack it somehow 
rather than address it cleanly in the way Lucene was designed to work?
