It's only advantageous when the Filters are long-lived over multiple  
searches.  It's not really recommended for search-within-search when  
the initial search is transient.  Combining queries within a  
BooleanQuery is more recommended in that case.

Walking all Hits and extracting a field is an expensive operation, so  
be forewarned on that.

I'm not sure if you can get at each indexes results in that way, but  
you can tell which index an individual hit came from (see API docs  
for details on that).

Your guess is as good as any at this point.  I'm not sure what is  
still left to be done for a 1.9 release.  I haven't heard any prods  
to release it any time soon, but you're welcome to push us to  
consider it if need be.
