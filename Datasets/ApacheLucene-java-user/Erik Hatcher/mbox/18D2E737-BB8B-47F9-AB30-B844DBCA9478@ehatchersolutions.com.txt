If you put it in the right package directory under WEB-INF/classes  
then it should work (provided all the dependencies it has are in WEB- 
INF/lib, which may just be the Lucene JAR file).  The package is  
org.apache.lucene.search.similar, so it should go in WEB-INF/classes/ 
org/apache/lucene/search/similar.  I recommend you put this under  
your webapps WEB-INF/classes directory, not in a common directory to  
your container.

You should use org.apache.lucene.search.similar.MoreLikeThis
