The best thing you can do is set up a test environment to try out  
sample text with various analyzers.  Lucene in Action's source code  
(http://www.lucenebook.com) comes with such a demo that you can  
easily tweak.  Here's a sample of running "ant AnalyzerDemo":

      [echo] Running lia.analysis.AnalyzerDemo...
      [java] Analyzing "some_word"
      [java]   WhitespaceAnalyzer:
      [java]     [some_word]

      [java]   SimpleAnalyzer:
      [java]     [some] [word]

      [java]   StopAnalyzer:
      [java]     [some] [word]

      [java]   StandardAnalyzer:
      [java]     [some] [word]

      [java]   SnowballAnalyzer:
      [java]     [some] [word]

      [java]   SnowballAnalyzer:
      [java]     [some] [word]

      [java]   SnowballAnalyzer:
      [java]     [some] [word]
