Field.Text(String, Reader) is not a stored field.  This is why doc.get 
("contents") is empty.

You have some options... change to using a stored field by reading  
the file contents into a String and using Field.Text(String, String)  
instead.  Or, when rendering the results, go directly to the file  
pointed to by doc.get("filename") and read its contents then.  There  
are pros/cons to both of these approaches.
