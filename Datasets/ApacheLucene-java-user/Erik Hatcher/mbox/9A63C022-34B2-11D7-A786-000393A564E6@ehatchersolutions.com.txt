You did it the way I envisioned.  I did not expect JTidy to have a way 
to ignore tags either, but rather having to do it the laborious way and 
check the attribute values yourself as you did.

Yeah, I really should glue all fields into "contents" like that, thanks 
for the enhancement.  I'll roll that into my update.  My original needs 
were not to mirror the demo/HTMLDocument class so I didn't think of 
making them compatible at the fields level.  I just changed it so there 
are now title, body, and contents fields.

picky picky!  :)  But thanks - I'll correct those too.

I'm not ready to commit my changes - I'll do so in a few weeks when I 
get some refactoring done on IndexTask.
