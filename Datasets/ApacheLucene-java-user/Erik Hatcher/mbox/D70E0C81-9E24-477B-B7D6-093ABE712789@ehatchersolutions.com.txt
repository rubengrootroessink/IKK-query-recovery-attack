SUBJECT: Re: TermFrequencies vector limits?
DATE: 21 Nov 2005

By default, documents get truncated at 10,000 terms (maybe there is  
an off-by-one where it is going to 10,001 though?).

To increase this, and I always do, set the max field length on your  
IndexWriter, and re-index.  In 1.4.3, you set the maxFieldLength  
variable of IndexWriter directly.  We've changed this to be  
setMaxFieldLength in the TRUNK codebase.
