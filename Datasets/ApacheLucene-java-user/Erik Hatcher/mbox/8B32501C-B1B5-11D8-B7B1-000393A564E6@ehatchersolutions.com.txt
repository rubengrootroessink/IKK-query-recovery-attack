I'm not sure I understand your question.

At this point there is no plan to "release" the sandbox components -  
they are really there in a batteries-not-included fashion at this point  
but its all there to freely use if you like.

I did centralize the build system in contributions area, so each piece  
should easily build into JAR files.

Is there more that you desire?
