Are we talking about that query being entered by the user and you 
handing it just like that to QueryParser?  If so, then QueryFilter 
won't help.

Well, that is not quite the right API, but something like this:

     Query maleQuery = new TermQuery(new Term("Gender", "Male"));
     Filter filter = new QueryFilter(maleQuery);
     Hits hits = searcher.search(new TermQuery("ZipCode","CA10927"), 
filter);

Keep in mind all that Doug has said on this topic as well.  In this 
case, it probably won't be any faster than a single query, maybe even 
slower.  But if you use the same instance of the filter for future 
searches there will certainly be a benefit.
