I had to look up Zipfs law to understand this.  Lucene does include 
frequency information about terms indexed, yes.  And Analyzers can 
remove common words if you like, or you can play other bigram tricks 
like Nutch does to not take a performance yet keep stop words too.

Does that answer what you're looking for?
