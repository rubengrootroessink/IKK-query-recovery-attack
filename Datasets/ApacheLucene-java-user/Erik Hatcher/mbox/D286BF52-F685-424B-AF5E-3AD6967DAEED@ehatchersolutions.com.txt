Please provide a simple example of how you're indexing and querying.

If you index "A Phrase" as untokenized, you would find it with a  
TermQuery for "A Phrase".  You must use exact case.  If you're using  
QueryParser, the text get analyzed and most analyzers lowercase.  If  
this expression is quoted it would become a PhraseQuery with two  
terms, or if it is unquoted it would become a BooleanQuery with two  
TermQuery clauses - either way it would not match if you indexed the  
phrase as untokenized.
