With Lucene's trunk, there is a MatchAllDocsQuery.   You could use  
this in a BooleanQuery with your negative-only query.

Another option, if you're at Lucene 1.4.3 is to index the same value  
for a dummy field for every document (say like "dummy:all") and use a  
TermQuery in a BooleanQuery with the negative-only query.

As for BitSet's, if you need to go that route a QueryFilter would  
give you the BitSet back that you could easily complement, but that  
might be a bit overkill for what you need given the option above.
