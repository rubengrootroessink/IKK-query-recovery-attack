I may not be fully understanding your question, but I'll go with my  
assumptions... wrap the users query into a BooleanQuery as a required  
clause and then add another clause with a TermQuery for the specific  
host_id.  Then simply constrain the number of Hits shown to the first  
3.  Does that do what you're after?
