SpanNearQuery is your friend!  Like Paul said, this is not currently 
supported by QueryParser, however it is easy to do with the API.

Here's an example with a SpanOrQuery (a SpanNearQuery works 
identically) from the Lucene in Action code SpanQueryTest.java.  Two 
documents are indexed:

         "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

         "the quick red fox jumps over the sleepy cat"

This SpanOrQuery is formed (omitting some code details):

     SpanOrQuery or = new SpanOrQuery(new SpanQuery[]{quick, fox});

And the spans are displayed:

spanOr([f:quick, f:fox]):
    the <quick> brown fox jumps over the lazy dog (0.37158427)
    the quick brown <fox> jumps over the lazy dog (0.37158427)
    the <quick> red fox jumps over the sleepy cat (0.37158427)
    the quick red <fox> jumps over the sleepy cat (0.37158427)
