I'm using the trunk of Subversion (pretty much what 1.9 will be) on  
all my projects and it is quite stable.  I defer to the others on  
when we release it as 1.9 officially, though.

I recommend to you, and others that can, to use the trunk codebase in  
your projects.  It will ensure that it gets hammered more and any  
issues ironed out (though it is unlikely you'll encounter any, no  
more so than you would with 1.4.3).
