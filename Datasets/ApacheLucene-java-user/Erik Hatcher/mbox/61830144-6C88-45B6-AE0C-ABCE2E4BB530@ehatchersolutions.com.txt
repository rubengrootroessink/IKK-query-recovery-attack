WildcardQuery does support leading wildcard characters, but  
QueryParser is what prohibits it.  A custom QueryParser could be  
created that removes this restriction.  However, the potential of a  
"too many clauses" exception is great with WildcardQuery so you'll  
want to be careful.  Check the list archives for this topic in gory  
and never ending detail :)
