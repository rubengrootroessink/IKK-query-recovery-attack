The .zip seems to be broken (though I haven't checked on why that is 
yet).  The .tar.gz, though, worked fine for me.

It depends on what your purpose is ... but I'd recommend you use the 
1.4.3 release version.

But if you want the latest build, "cvs co" and "ant" is the way to get 
it.  We currently do not publish nightly builds (though there may be 
some systems that do build Lucene regularly and publish the results), 
that I know of.
