Yes, the demo app is not compelling and definitely needs work.  It is 
my hope to get a chance to write a much slicker demo suite as part of 
our book project and of course contribute it back into Lucene's own 
codebase and distributions.  A couple of months ago I solicited input 
from this list on what everyone wanted to have in a demo application 
and I saved those replies.  If there were only more hours in a day..... 
  :)
