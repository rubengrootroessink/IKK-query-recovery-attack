I don't know displaytag internals, but be cautious with such things.  
What you do not want to happen is all the results to be grabbed and 
cached somehow.  You only want to retrieve the actual documents being 
shown on that specific page.  It looks like displaytag can support 
this, as long as you provide your own custom pruned document set.

Personally, I use Tapestry :)
