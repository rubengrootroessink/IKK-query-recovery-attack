The first, and currently only, edition is based on Lucene 1.4.3, and  
all code works with Lucene 1.9 as well.  Lucene 2.0+ changed some  
API, but it is easy to convert the code to be compatible.

A second edition is in progress at the moment.  Expected completion  
date:  ??  (your guess is as good as mine! :) - but let's say early  
2009 just to be a bit safer than promising this year.  The second  
edition will be current with whatever release of Lucene is available  
at the time it is published - probably 3.0.
