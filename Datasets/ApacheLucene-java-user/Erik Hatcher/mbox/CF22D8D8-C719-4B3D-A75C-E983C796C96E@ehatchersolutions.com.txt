No, we don't cover this sort of thing in LIA.

One option is to create your own fork of ParallelMultiSearcher and  
boost the scores for the desired index in the relevant .search  
methods (excluding the HitCollector one).  It should be a minor tweak  
to accomplish this.  Maybe something general along these lines is  
worth adding to both MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher to allow  
a hook point for this?
