Look at my article at java.net and try out the AnalyzerDemo code using 
some sample text and your custom analyzer:

	http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/07/30/LuceneIntro.html

One of the things I plan to do with an enhanced Lucene demo to ship 
with Lucene's binary distributions is integrate in this type of 
"analyzing the analyzer" feature.  It is the root of a lot of questions 
about Lucene.  You can really only search for what you index, and you 
only index what the Analyzer creates, so understanding it is key to a 
lot.

And yes, if you are using StandardTokenizer, you are probably not 
tokenizing COBOL quite like you expect.  Is there a COBOL parser you 
could tap into that could give you the tokens you want?
