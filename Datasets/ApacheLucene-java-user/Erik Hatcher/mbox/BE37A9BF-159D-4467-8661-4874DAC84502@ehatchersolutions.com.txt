Whether you parse or not in this case depends on whether the tokens  
in the Vector are exactly the tokens you indexed or not.  If they  
are, then you could create a BooleanQuery, construct a TermQuery for  
each token and add it to the BooleanQuery.  Eliminating the use of  
QueryParser when not needed may not be a performance booster, but it  
certainly eliminates a source of confusion or unexpected queries  
because of QP morphing them via parsing and analysis.
