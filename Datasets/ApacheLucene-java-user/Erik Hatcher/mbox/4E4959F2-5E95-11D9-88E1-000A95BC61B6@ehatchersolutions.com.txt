SUBJECT: Re: 1.4.3 breaks 1.4.1 QueryParser functionality
DATE: 4 Jan 2005

Bill,

If we broken API compatibility then we screwed up.  What getFieldQuery 
signature are you overriding?

As for version numbers - there are no strict conventions.  The API 
should not have broken in 1.4.2, nor in 1.4.3 - this is very 
unfortunate.  I caught what I thought were all of the incompatibilities 
introduced in 1.4.2, but apparently I missed something that perhaps my 
test cases didn't account for?
