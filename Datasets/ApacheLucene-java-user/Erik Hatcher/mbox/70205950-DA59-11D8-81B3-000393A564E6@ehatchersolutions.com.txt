How you get the data from  your database is really up to you.  Some 
folks here may be able to offer some advice, but ultimately it is 
specific to your application and business process.

Once you have the data, via some query (again, this is up to you how 
you do it) you use Lucene's IndexWriter, create new Document's, add 
Field's to them, add the document to the writer, then close the writer. 
  That's all there is to indexing a document with Lucene.

As for automation - again this is up to your application but certainly 
you can interact with a Lucene index from your application so that it 
is not a manual separate indexing step.

You need to ensure that when data changes, the index is updated to 
reflect those changes.
