Is that the only change you made to the .jj file?   Where did you put  
that exactly?

Don't you need a * after the second <LETTER>?

I think the missing * above explains what you're seeing.

I'm surprised this one worked - maybe some other token in JavaCC is  
catching that?

JavaCC is perhaps overkill for what you want.  If you don't need any  
of the other fancy analysis tricks that StandardTokenizer has, you  
could just use WhiteSpaceAnalyzer, LowerCaseFilter, voila, your  
hyphenated tokens would come right out.

Unless you need the other features of StandardTokenizer, you may be  
best staying away from JavaCC altogether.  It is it's own complex  
world that might be more than what you need.
