First let me re-phrase what I think you want.  You want to be able to 
search on a folder name and retrieve back JPG filenames that are in 
that folder.  Correct?

You're using the text file as simply a way to get text into Lucene?  
Does this text file have any other relevance here?

If you have a folder of JPG images and all you're after is their 
filenames and the results granularity to be a JPG image file name, 
write a simple file system crawler that recurses your directory tree, 
and indexes a single document for each JPG, with a field for 
"filename".  What type of field should the "filename" field be?  That 
depends on how you want to search.  You could make it a 
Field.Keyword(), which would require exact (TermQuery) or PrefixQuery's 
to work.

The Indexer example from Lucene in Action makes a great starting place 
for this crawler - you'd have to adapt it to recognize .jpg extensions 
and adjust it to only index the filename, not the contents (though the 
contents may contain text and be worth indexing also).
