You must be using the demo program that comes with Lucene.  That is  
merely an example, and a barely decent one at that.  Have a look  
under the covers of that code or the code that ships with Lucene in  
Action at http://www.lucenebook.com

You can slice and dice "documents" in whatever granularity you like -  
but you have to write code to parse the TREC files into those pieces,  
making appropriate fields and so on.
