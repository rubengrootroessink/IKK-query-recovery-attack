Correct.

Have a look at PhraseQuery and how it does its ranking.

Term offset (aka position increments) is stored in the index.  However, 
for highlighting you need byte offsets.  The CVS version of Lucene 
includes an option to capture the byte offsets in the index also.  
Prior to this CVS version, it required re-analyzing the text to be 
highlighted.  Token objects contain the byte offsets that the 
Highlighter package uses.

Have a look at the Highlighter code in the Lucene Sandbox.
