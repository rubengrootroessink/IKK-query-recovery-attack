It looks like this is a CVS dialog as none of those connection types  
apply.  Subversion is over HTTP(S).

There are lots of details about accessing the Subversion repository  
at Apache here:

     <http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html>

Nothing Eclipse-specific that I've found, but this is the command- 
line used in a shell:

     svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/ lucene
