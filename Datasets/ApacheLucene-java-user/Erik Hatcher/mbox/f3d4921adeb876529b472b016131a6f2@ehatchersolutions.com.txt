The problem is that QueryParser analyzes all pieces of a query 
expression regardless of whether you indexed them as a Field.Keyword or 
not.  If you need to use QueryParser and still support keyword fields, 
you'll want to plug in an analyzer specific to that field using 
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper.  You'll see this demonstrated in the "Lucene 
in Action" source code.  Here's a quick pointer to where we cover it in 
the book:
