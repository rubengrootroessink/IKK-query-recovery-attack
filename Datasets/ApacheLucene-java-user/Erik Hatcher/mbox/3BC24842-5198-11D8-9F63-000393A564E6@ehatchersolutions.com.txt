SUBJECT: Re: use Lucene LOCAL (looking for a frontend)
DATE: 28 Jan 2004

Lucene is a Java API, and can be used within any type of Java program 
(command-line, web, etc).

It is up to you as the developer embedding Lucene to put whatever kind 
of interface you want on it.  To index local files leverage some of the 
code I have put in my java.net articles, or use the Ant <index> task 
that resides in the sandbox repository, or write your own.  How you 
present the search results will be up to you and the needs of your 
project.
