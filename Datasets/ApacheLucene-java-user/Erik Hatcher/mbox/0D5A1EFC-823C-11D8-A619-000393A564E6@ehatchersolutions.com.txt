I don't have that e-mail you refer to.  Please use the standard Jakarta 
Bugzilla issue tracking system, though.  You can place an attachment to 
an issue after you create it - e-mail ends up mangling in-line patches.

What I'm after is a clean patch that *only* changes the functionality 
you desire, not code formatting also.  We can clean up code formatting 
in another pass if needed - or I can just do that on my end after 
reviewing the functionality-only patch.

	Erik
