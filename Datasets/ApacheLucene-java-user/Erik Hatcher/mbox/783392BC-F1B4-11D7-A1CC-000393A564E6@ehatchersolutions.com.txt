SUBJECT: Re: Announce : arabic Stemmer/Analyzer for Lucene
DATE: 28 Sep 2003

We could put this in the Lucene sandbox CVS perhaps.  Could you package  
it similarly to the other contributions there with a build file and  
convert your command-line tests to JUnit tests that run from the build  
file?

I took a quick look and looks like you did a fair bit of work and have  
the ASL in the source files.  The question, though, is whether your  
basing it on GPL code is acceptable.  Did you copy code from it?  We  
can have no GPL code in Apache's CVS.
