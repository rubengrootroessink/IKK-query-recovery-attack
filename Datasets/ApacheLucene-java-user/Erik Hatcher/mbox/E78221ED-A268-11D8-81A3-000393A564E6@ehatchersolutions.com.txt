The issue, however, is that wildcard queries are not analyzed by 
QueryParser.

I think if your analyzer is working fine for regular term and phrase 
queries, that subclassing QueryParser and overriding getWildcardQuery 
to handle special processing (perhaps even analyzing if you are careful 
not to remove the wildcard characters themselves!) is the way to go.

Although pre-processing is a fine solution too if the accented 
characters should be removed in all query types.
