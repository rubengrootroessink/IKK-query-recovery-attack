Look in the src/test directory of where you checked out Lucene.  All  
JUnit tests live there and below.

Maybe you'd care to share some *technical* details to elaborate on "no  
worky"?!

What Index.class are you talking about?  The demo application?

Use CVS :)

People have been using Lucene for years and managing the file handle  
issue by setting ulimit and other tricks like optimizing to reduce the  
number of segments.  So it is not as much a problem as it is a known  
issue that can be managed.

I'm not up to speed on what the issues with 1.3 final are - I've just  
started hearing about it.  Is there a reproducible example that  
demonstrates a problem?
