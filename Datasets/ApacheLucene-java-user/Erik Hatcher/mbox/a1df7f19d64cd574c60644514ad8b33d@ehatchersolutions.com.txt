SUBJECT: wildcarded phrase queries
DATE: 6 Apr 2005

I have a need to implement wildcarded phrase queries, such as this:

	"apach? luc*"

which would match "apache lucene", for example.  This needs to also 
support ordered and unordered proximity like SpanNearQuery does:

	"apach? luc*"~10

I presume I'm going to have to key off of SpanQuery with a some 
specialized subclasses.

What approach do you recommend for implementing something like this?

Thanks,
	Erik
