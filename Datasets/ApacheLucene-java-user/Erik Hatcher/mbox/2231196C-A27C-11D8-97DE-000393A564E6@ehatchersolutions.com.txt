Instead of running multiple queries against the uber-index, try making 
a single "uber" query that builds up boolean query clauses that select 
each of the small "index" fields you're interested in.

Also, perhaps using a Filter to narrow down the search space on the 
uber-index is more along the lines of what you're after?
