SUBJECT: Re: DateFilter on UnStored field
DATE: 13 Feb 2005

Following up on PA's reply.  Yes, DateFilter works on *indexed* values, 
so whether a field is stored or not is irrelevant.

However, DateFilter will not work on fields indexed as "2004-11-05".  
DateFilter only works on fields that were indexed using the DateField.  
One option is to use a QueryFilter instead, filtering with a 
RangeQuery.
