That is an invalid assumption with QueryParser and how it forms  
queries.  And it actually is a tricky sort of query to do even  
programatically.

The query john j* (with default operator AND) searches for john AND  
j* regardless of position.

Programatically you can use PhrasePrefixQuery - see Lucene's test  
case code for examples of how it's used, but it is a bit of work to  
set up.

In short, not easily, but it is possible with PhrasePrefixQuery  
programatically.  QueryParser does not support this at all currently.
