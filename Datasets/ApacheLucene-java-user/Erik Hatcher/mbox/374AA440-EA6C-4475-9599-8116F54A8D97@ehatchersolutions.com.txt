SUBJECT: Re: wildcards with SpanQuery
DATE: 18 Apr 2006

There isn't a SpanWildcardQuery, per se, but there is a SpanRegexQuery:

	<http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/regex/src/ 
java/org/apache/lucene/search/regex/>

It can be used to achieve the same sort of thing, only using standard  
regex syntax like fast.* (instead of fast*)

But, stemming should be considered as well.  It'd certainly be more  
performant using a regular PhraseQuery with terms analyzed and  
stemmed, matching terms analyzed the same way during indexing.
