Careful with terminology here.  It works for only one "term".  What is 
a term?  That all depends on what happened during analysis.  Generally 
speaking, though, "word" is the right generalization for a "term" - but 
we have to be careful technically speaking.

Wrong.  When constructing a query through the API, if you want an OR 
you'd need to add two TermQuery's to a BooleanQuery, one for each 
"word" and make them not required.

Yes.

If you have a text string of multiple terms you want added to a boolean 
query you could do so programatically by analyzing the string as I do 
in my article in AnalyzerDemo or by parsing it through some other 
mechanism than QueryParser and add each as a TermQuery.  You're on 
track!
