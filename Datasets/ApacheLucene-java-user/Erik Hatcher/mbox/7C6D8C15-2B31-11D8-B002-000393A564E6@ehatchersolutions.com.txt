You've got quite a tough task ahead of you I think.  You originally 
said you wanted to limit documents, which is what a Filter does.  But a 
FuzzyQuery still needs to go over all the terms, otherwise how would it 
know if there was a match or not before even considering the documents.

It'll be interesting to see what solution you come up with.
