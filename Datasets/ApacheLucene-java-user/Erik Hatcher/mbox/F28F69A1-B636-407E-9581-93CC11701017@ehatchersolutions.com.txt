The SpanQuery family of queries will do exactly this.  Each term  
becomes a SpanTermQuery (rather than using a PhraseQuery) and then  
each phrase is a SpanNearQuery, and then nest those in another  
ordered SpanNearQuery with whatever distance you want to allow and  
whether it should be ordered or not ordered.
