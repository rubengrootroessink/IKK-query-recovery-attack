You cannot chain Analyzers per se, but you can easily write a custom 
analyzer that does chaining of all of the various operations like stop 
word removal, lower-casing, stemming, filtering, etc.  Have a peek at 
the source code of your favorite analyzers to get an idea of how these 
are built - and you will see how simply they are put together.
