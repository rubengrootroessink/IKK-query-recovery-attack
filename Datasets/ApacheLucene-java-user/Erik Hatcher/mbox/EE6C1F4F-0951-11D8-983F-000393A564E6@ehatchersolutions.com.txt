Is there anything in particular you're interested in knowing about?  
This list and its archives contain in conjunction with the jGuru FAQ 
are the best sources for such info currently.... as well as the 
articles that can be found on the Lucene website.  In fact, I'll 
pre-hype another java.net article that I'm writing as we speak- it is 
on QueryParser, detailing what it does and the caveats to its use.

I have a pretty good feeling that we'll be treated to more writings on 
Lucene in the near future ;)
