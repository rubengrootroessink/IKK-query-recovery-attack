Have a 10 minute dedicated look at http://lucene.apache.org/solr -  
download the latest binary distribution, follow along with the  
tutorial.  After that, you'll know almost everything you need to know  
on the Solr side of things, but then you'll have to write a bit  
of .NET code to parse some XML responses.  No problemo.
