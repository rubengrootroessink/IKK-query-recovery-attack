Well, the original design is to have hits sorted by score.... you want 
the most relevant first.  Sorting defeats the purpose of a score in 
many respects.

But in the latest CVS (unreleased, must build it yourself) version of 
Lucene, a very slick contribution has been added to sort by an integer 
field.  Other datatypes are in the works.
