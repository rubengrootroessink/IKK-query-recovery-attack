You probably do not want to use Field.Text for a filename.  Use 
Field.Keyword instead.

Now use Luke (Google for _luke lucene_) to browse your index, and check 
that you are getting what you think.  You can do ad-hoc queries there 
also.

If you want the first 200 - 400, start your Hits walking at index 200, 
and proceed through 400.

Is there some field you want to key off to do the range?  Or do you 
just want the 200th - 400th hits from the search, which is an entirely 
different question than about ranges.

Please send (succinct) code examples in the future to really keep this 
discussion concrete and clear.
