Now you've just said the same conflicting thing a different way.  You  
want to cluster but only return one.  :)

If you only want one image returned, then it seems that only indexing  
the same image once is the way to go.  When you find a duplicate MD5,  
don't index that as a second document.  You will, instead, update the  
document by adding additional ALT text and perhaps the additional URL.

Is there a reason why indexing each unique image (by MD5) is not a  
good way to go in your case?

This would give you multiple records for the same MD5.  You said  
above you only want one per MD5.
