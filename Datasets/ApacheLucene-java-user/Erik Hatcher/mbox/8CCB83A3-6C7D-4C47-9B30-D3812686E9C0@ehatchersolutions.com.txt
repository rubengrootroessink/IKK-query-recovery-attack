Marc,

SpanNearQuery isn't capable of performing the proximity to within  
only a single position in the manner you've described.  A slop of 0  
means the terms must be contiguous with no gaps, which also allows  
for matches in the same position as in your first example.

I think MultiPhraseQuery (from svn trunk) will do what you want  
though.  Please try that and report back on how it works for you.
