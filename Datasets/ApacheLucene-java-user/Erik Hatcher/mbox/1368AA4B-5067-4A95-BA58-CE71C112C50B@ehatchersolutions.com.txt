lucenebook.com uses MultiSearcher and hits from different indexes are  
handled differently.  Blog hits are shown fully.  Book section hits  
are shown as snippets.  Here's how it's done:

       MultiSearcher searcher = (MultiSearcher) context.getAttribute 
("searcher");
       IndexReader[] readers = (IndexReader[]) context.getAttribute 
("readers");

       for (int i = startHit; i <= endHit; i++) {
         int position = i - 1;
         Document doc = hits.doc(position);
         int indexIndex = searcher.subSearcher(hits.id(position));
         IndexReader reader = readers[indexIndex];

         // ...
       }

MulitSearcher handles the offsetting based on the specific IndexReader.

Look at the MultiSearcher API.  There is also a subDoc() method to  
get the document number for it's specific index.
