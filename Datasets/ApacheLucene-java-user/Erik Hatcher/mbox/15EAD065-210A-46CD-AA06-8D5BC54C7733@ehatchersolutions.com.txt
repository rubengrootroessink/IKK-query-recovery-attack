Look at the AnalyzerDemo code.  There isn't anything built in, as  
doing it only involves a few lines of code.  Run a String (via  
StringReader) through an Analyzer, pluck out the tokens from the  
resultant TokenStream, create the queries you want from those  
tokens.   I use this technique frequently to bypass the  
idiosyncrasies of QueryParser or in places where using the QP syntax  
is undesirable but analysis still needs to occur.
