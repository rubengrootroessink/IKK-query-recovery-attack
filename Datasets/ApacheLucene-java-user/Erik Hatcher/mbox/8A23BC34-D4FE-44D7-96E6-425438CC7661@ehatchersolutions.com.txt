What Analyzer are you using?   Have a look at the Analyzer demo with  
Lucene in Action's code, or from my java.net article so you can  
analyze your analyzer.  Also try out Luke, it really is handy for  
seeing inside your index.

And is your text really long (> 10,000 terms)?   If so, you'll need  
to set the max. field length higher on IndexWriter (I always use  
Integer.MAX_VALUE).
