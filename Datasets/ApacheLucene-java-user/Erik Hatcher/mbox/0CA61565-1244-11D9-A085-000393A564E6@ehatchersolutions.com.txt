How are you indexing the name field?  (code please :)

Normally random order?!  The natural (not using a Sort) order is by 
score (also called relevance).  Nothing random about it at all.  In 
fact, this ordering is very special!  See the Javadocs on the 
Similarity class for details of the formula.

No limitations that I know if.  Some bugs have been fixed, so be sure 
you're using Lucene 1.4.1, and not just 1.4, but please report back 
with more details if this issue still occurs in 1.4.1.
