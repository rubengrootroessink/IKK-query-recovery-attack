PhraseQuery originally did not account for gaps left in the terms of  
the phrase.

PhraseQuery was modified last year to allow for this though:

r150509 | goller | 2004-09-15 05:38:50 -0400 (Wed, 15 Sep 2004) | 5  
lines

PhraseQuery and PhrasePrefixQuery are extended. It's now
possible to specify the relative position of a term within
a phrase. This allows gaps and multiple terms at the same
position.

So we could change StopFilter to put the gaps back in safely now, I  
think.

Thoughts?
