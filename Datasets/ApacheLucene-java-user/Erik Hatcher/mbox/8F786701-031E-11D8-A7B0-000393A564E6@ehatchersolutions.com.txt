I looked at the patch here:

	http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23838

I'm not entirely satisfied with it.  I'm of the opinion that we should 
only change QueryParser to fix the behavior of operators nestled within 
text with no surrounding whitespace.  The provided patch only works 
with the "-" character, but what about "Wal+Mart"?  Shouldn't we keep 
that together also and hand it to the analyzer?

I'm not convinced at all that we should change the StandardTokenizer to 
not split on dash.  If only QueryParser was fixed and handed "Wal-Mart" 
to the StandardAnalyzer, it would be split the same way as during 
indexing and searches would return the expected hits.

Thoughts?  I'd like to see this fixed, but in a way that makes the most 
general sense.

Thanks,
	Erik
