But consider the same type of thing like a phrase query.  If two 
documents are indexed with a field containing "a b c" and "x b y"

If searching for "b" is done, both documents are returned.  If 
searching for "a b" is done, then only the first document is returned.  
So I think with a domain aware analyzer, you might be able to split 
things up into separate terms and then on the querying side of things 
the same type of analysis would be done  Certainly not a trivial thing, 
and maybe not even the right approach, but it seems that intelligent 
analysis can make things a lot easier on users and performance for 
searching.  Maybe?  Just food for thought.

Definitely interested!
