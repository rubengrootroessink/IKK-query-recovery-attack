What would define the documents in the sub-index?   What about  
building client-specific indexes and transfer the actual index to the  
client rather than pulling out individual documents?

There really isn't anything special about a Document object - pulling  
its fields into Map would do the trick for transferring it.  But,  
again, what about unstored fields?  What about analysis?  You'd have  
to re-index the a document on the client, which may be an issue to  
keep Java and .NET analyzers in sync exactly with one another.
