IDE builds aren't official with Lucene.  All releases are built with  
the command-line using Ant.  The way the contrib build works is that  
each builds it's own JAR.  The core of Lucene is its own separate JAR  
also.  I would not recommend merging everything into one JAR, but  
certainly there is no problem with doing so.
