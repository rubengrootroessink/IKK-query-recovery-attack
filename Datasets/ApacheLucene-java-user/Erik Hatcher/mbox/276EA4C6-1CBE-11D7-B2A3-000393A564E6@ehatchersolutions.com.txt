SUBJECT: Re: QueryParser question
DATE: 31 Dec 2002

I'd like to revisit this issue.  First, I add the path field to the 
Document in this way:

	doc.add(Field.Keyword("path", path));

This field is, of course, not tokenized by the Analyzer, right?  So 
shouldn't QueryParser take this fact into account on a field-by-field 
basis such that a query of "path:/whatever/blah" not be tokenized?

The analyzer used for the IndexWriter is not used for Keyword fields, 
right?

Is it possible to have this type of smarts in the QueryParser such that 
it takes the field type into consideration before using an Analyzer?  
Should this issue be taken to lucene-dev or Bugzilla as an enhancement 
request?  I want a sanity check on my thinking before doing so though.

Thanks,
	Erik
