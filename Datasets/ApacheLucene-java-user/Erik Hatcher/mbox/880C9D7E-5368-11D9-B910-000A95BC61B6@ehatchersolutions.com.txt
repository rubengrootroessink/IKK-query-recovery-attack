Where have you read that?  This is incorrect.

To index data in a database into a Lucene index, you must write code 
that pulls the records from the database and adds them to a Lucene 
index, slicing into fields in whatever manner you need.  You will want 
to be sure to update the index when your database changes by either 
removing, or "updating" (remove and re-add) documents.  There is 
nothing built-in that will do these steps for you.
