The simplest thing would be something like this in a servlet:

try {
   Query query = parser.parse(...);
}
catch (ParseException pe) {
   throw new IOException(pe.getMessage());
}

But you may not want the user to see that harsh of an error from your  
servlet when an unparsable expression is used.  Typically that  
exception is caught and a friendlier message is provided to the user.
