There is no need to create a new Lucene Document just to highlight  
text.  The text you highlight does not have to be the text you  
indexed even.  The Highlighter takes a String to highlight and a  
Query to extract the terms to highlight from.

Well, the question really comes back to you.... where is the text you  
want to highlight?  You can store it in a Lucene index, in a  
database, on the filesystem, wherever.  Neither Lucene nor the  
Highlighter are related to that decision whatsoever.  So using a  
NullFragmenter, which I will commit to contrib/highlighter soon, use  
the Highlighter on the full text.

If you're still having issues, send us a (brief, please!) piece of  
code you're using to highlight.

     Erik
