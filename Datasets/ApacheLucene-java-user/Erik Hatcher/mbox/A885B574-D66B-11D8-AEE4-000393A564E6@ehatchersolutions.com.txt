Right... when you use double-quotes, a PhraseQuery is implied, and it 
has no support for wildcards (currently).

Check the AnalysisParalysis page on the wiki for some insight into how 
to go about trouble-shooting things like this.  First is to eliminate 
QueryParser and see if you can make a query through the API that 
matches what you're after.
