I would be against such a move.  I think Lucene's core has too many 
analyzers in it already, such as the German and Russian ones.  The core 
could do without any of the concrete analyzers altogether, in my 
opinion - but it is handy to have a few general purpose convenience 
ones.

What benefit, besides convenience, would there be in CJKAnalyzer into 
the core?  What about the all the others in the sandbox?  If we bring 
one in, why not all of them?

It has been brought up to bring in the SnowballAnalyzer - as it 
actually is general purpose and spans many languages.  I'm not really 
for bringing that one in either.

I'm but one voice and would not veto bringing in other analyzers, I 
just don't think there is much benefit, especially if we improve the 
release process to incorporate the sandbox goodies into a single 
distribution but as separate JARs.
