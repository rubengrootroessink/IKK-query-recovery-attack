It doesn't.  A TermQuery is exactly as-is.  If you need the analysis 
part, you can use QueryParser or talk to an Analyzer directly and use 
the TokenStream it feeds you back to build TermQuery's by hand.  I 
would not recommend using QueryParser for code-generated queries - 
there are just too many variables in that equation for comfort (to me).
