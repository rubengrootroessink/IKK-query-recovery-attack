You may want to consider using an Analyzer to expand queries rather 
than manipulating the query object itself.

No.  For example, look at the SpanQuery family.  These do no explicit 
rewriting and thus are left as themselves.

I think we'll see QueryParser, or at least more sophisticated versions 
of it, emerge that support SpanQuery's.  In fact, in our book, I 
created a subclas of QueryParser that overrides getFieldQuery and 
returns a SpanNearQuery in order to achieve ordered phrase searching.
