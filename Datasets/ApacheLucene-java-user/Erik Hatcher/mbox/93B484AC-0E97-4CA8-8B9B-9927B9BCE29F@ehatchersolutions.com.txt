Cross-posting...

In gearing up for a 1.9 release, I've been perusing our issue tracker  
(http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE) to see what low-hanging  
fruit there is that I can help address.  This message is a prod for  
others to do the same.  We have >100 open issues, some of which may  
no longer be valid, or they require more information, or need their  
patch updated relative to the current trunk, and so on.  If you have  
opinions or patches on an issue, please add them.

There are many issues that have quality patches submitted, but I  
don't feel qualified myself to assess their viability and fit.  I'll  
refrain from applying those patches unless someone, such as Doug,  
gives approval.

For Lucene users, it would be particularly helpful if you'd use the  
JIRA voting feature to vote on issues you feel strongly about having  
in Lucene 1.9/2.0.  When viewing an issue, there is a "Vote for it"  
link in the lower left.

Thanks,
     Erik
