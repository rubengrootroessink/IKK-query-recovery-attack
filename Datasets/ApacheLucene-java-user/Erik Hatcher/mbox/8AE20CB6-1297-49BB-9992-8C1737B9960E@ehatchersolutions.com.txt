Well, you're free to spell it anyway you like for your subclasses :)

Well, the smiley is because my own frankenstein blog is a servlet,  
some very simple abstraction layers, velocity templates, and  
Lucene... http://www.blogscene.org/erik - though I'm a very  
infrequent blogger.  The categories are picked up using TermEnum on  
the category field.  The blog entries are stored in the index, and of  
course indexed as well.  You can subscribe to a feed for a search.   
Once upon a time I had a lot of fun building it and exploring what  
Lucene could do in the blogging world.
