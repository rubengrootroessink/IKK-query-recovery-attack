The details of the segments file (and all the others) is freely 
available here:

	http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/fileformats.html

Also, there is Java code in Lucene, of course, that manipulates the 
segments file which could be leveraged (although probably package 
scoped and not easily usable in a standalone repair tool).
