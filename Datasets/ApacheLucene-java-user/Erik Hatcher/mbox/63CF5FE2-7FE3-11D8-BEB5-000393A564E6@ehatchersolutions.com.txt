What's in a name?!  :)

This is standard operating procedure.  That "-dev" simply means you're 
building it locally and all bets are off as to what you built if you 
modified your local codebase.  We remove the "-dev" when building 
releases, and adjust the "rc1" to "final" or "rc2" as appropriate.
