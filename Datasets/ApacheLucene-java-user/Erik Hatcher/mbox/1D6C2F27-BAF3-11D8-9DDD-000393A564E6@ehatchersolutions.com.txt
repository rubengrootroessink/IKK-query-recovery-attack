To add to what Otis said - I've been working feverishly to come to 
"terms" with SpanQuery*, the new sorting feature, Highlighter, Nutch 
analysis and much more.  Lucene in Action will be accurate with Lucene 
1.4, so it has been a tough job to learn and keep up.  We are nearing 
the end though, and I can pretty confidently say that Otis and I will 
be completely done with the manuscript sometime in July.  We are behind 
where we wanted to be, but thankfully that has worked out well with the 
timing of a Lucene 1.4 final release.

	Erik
