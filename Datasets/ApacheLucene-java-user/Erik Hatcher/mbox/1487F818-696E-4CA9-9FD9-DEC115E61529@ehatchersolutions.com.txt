SUBJECT: Re: How can you simulate inOrder in boolean queries
DATE: 8 Feb 2006

The source code to Lucene in Action (www.lucenebook.com) has an  
example of extending the built-in QueryParser to use SpanNearQuery  
for in-order phrase searching instead of the default unordered  
PhraseQuery behavior.  That example will show how to use  
SpanNearQuery made up of SpanTermQuery's.  The source code to  
QueryParser <http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/src/ 
java/org/apache/lucene/queryParser/QueryParser.jj> shows how to use  
PhraseQuery directly, if all you want is an example.

Also as Paul mentioned, the test cases in Lucene's source code make  
great ways to learn how Lucene's API works.

If what you're trying to do is put an in-order wrapper around all of  
the query types you mentioned, you will have a fair bit more work to  
do in order to create a parser that can create a SpanNearQuery with  
SpanRegexQuery's (new in contrib's trunk), and there currently is not  
a SpanQuery version of FuzzyQuery that I'm aware of.
