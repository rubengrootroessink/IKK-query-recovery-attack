I've seen both of these types of procedures followed on Apache 
projects.  It really just depends.  Lucene's codebase is not being 
modified frequently, so it is not necessary to branch and merge back.  
Rather we simply develop off of the trunk (HEAD) and when we're ready 
for a release we'll just do it from the trunk.  Actually  we'd most 
likely tag and build from that tag just to be clean about it.
