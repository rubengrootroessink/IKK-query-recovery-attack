Terry,

I'm still quite curious how you plan to take advantage of a 
subclassable Hits.  Are you going to create your own IndexSearcher with 
returns your subclass somehow?

You could use a HitCollector (which is what is used under the covers of 
the Hits returning methods anyway) to emulate whatever it is you're 
trying to do, I suspect.

As for 'final'.... Doug did a great thing by designing Lucene tight and 
controlled with private/package scoped access and final modifiers in 
lots of places.  There is no technical issue with removing the final, 
but we would need to see a pretty compelling detailed reason to do so.
