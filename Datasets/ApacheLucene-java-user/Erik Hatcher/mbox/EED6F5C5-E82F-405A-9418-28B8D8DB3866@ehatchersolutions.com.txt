You will need to override this behavior by subclassing QueryParser  
and overriding getFieldQuery to create the BooleanQuery yourself.

If the tokens are emitted in the same position (increment of 0) and  
you're using Lucene 1.9.x it will work differently in this case than  
1.4.3 did - positions were not taken into account in 1.4.3, but are  
in the latest version.
