The web applications I've built around Lucene mostly all support "web  
services" (lower cased).  Atom, RSS, OpenSearch, and Solr's custom  
XML all qualify.  I'm currently leveraging Solr in a Ruby on Rails  
front-end and it is working very well.  SOAP works too, but I prefer  
a lighter-weight mechanism.  With all of these, care must be taken to  
only send back a paged subset of matching documents, of course.

There are many factors involved in determining how any kind of web  
service wrapper around Lucene will perform, so its hard to say.  The  
real question is: does it perform well enough in your environment?
