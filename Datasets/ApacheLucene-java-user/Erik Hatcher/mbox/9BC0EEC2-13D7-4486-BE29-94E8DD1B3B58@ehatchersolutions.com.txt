Two ways....

	1) Simply create a BooleanQuery with one clause a TermQuery for  
"type" and the constraint

	2) Use a QueryFilter with that same TermQuery, and apply that Filter  
to your search method.

#1 is the simplest and most recommended to begin with unless you have  
other reasons to go to #2.
