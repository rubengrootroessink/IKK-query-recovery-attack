SUBJECT: QueryParser question
DATE: 30 Dec 2002

I have a keyword field that has a value like: "/path/to/something". Is 
there a way I can use QueryParser to get documents that have that field 
value?  It seems the Analyzer is kicking in and tokenizing it if I 
query for "path:/path/to/something".  I tried several ways of escaping 
the slashes and quotes, but nothing seemed to work.  Help!

Yes, I know I can do it by constructing a query through the API and 
that works fine - but it'd be nicer, of course, if QueryParser did the 
trick.

Thanks,
	Erik
