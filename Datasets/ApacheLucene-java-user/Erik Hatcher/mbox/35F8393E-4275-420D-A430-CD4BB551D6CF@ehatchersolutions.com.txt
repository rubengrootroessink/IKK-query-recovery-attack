"t" is a stop word because words like "don't" get analyzed into [don]  
[t].

In the short term, its not really a bug but just the nature of how it  
was meant to be.  Changing the default stop words in the 1.9/2.0  
releases isn't going to happen... but certainly lobbying for this to  
be more sensible in the future is worth it.
