First steps are to familiarize yourself with just what exactly Lucene  
is.  You don't "deploy" Lucene, per se.  It simply(!) a library, a  
JAR in Java terms.  Lucene itself becomes integrated into your  
application just like any other 3rd party library.

I recommend you begin by reading any of the freely available articles  
online - http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/Resources - and  the  
wonderful (hey, even I think so ;) "Lucene in Action" book.
