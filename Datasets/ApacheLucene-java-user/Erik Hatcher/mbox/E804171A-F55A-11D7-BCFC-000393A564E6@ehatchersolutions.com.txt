SUBJECT: Re: which lock belong to which index?
DATE: 3 Oct 2003

The CHANGES.txt file says this about the issue:

  2. Changed file locking to place lock files in
     System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), where all users are
     permitted to write files.  This way folks can open and correctly
     lock indexes which are read-only to them.

I haven't thought through the implications of all this yet, just 
thought this might shed slightly more light on it.
