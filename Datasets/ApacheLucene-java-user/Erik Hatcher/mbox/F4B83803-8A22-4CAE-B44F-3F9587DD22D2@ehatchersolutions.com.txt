I have used a technique of encoding a hierarchical path (like "/ 
category/subcategory/sub-subcategory") into an indexed untokenized  
field.  This allows for flat or hierarchical queries.  A hierarchical  
PrefixQuery of "/category" returns all documents from "/category"  
downward, for example.

I suspect others have done more interesting techniques for this sort  
of thing - I'd love to hear about them.
