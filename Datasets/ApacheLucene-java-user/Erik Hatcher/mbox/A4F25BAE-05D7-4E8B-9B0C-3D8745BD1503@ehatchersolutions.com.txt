Keep in mind that even if you tokenize "/usr/include" as "usr" and  
"include" that a query for "/usr/include" will still match if it is  
analyzed in a compatible manner.   It is important to realize that  
just because bits and pieces get eaten during analysis that it  
doesn't make things unfindable.  Sure, if someone literally wants to  
search for "/" only then it is important to keep upfront, but  
generally this is not the case.

WhitespaceTokenizer followed by a LowerCaseFilter also catches the  
cases you mention.

Again, lots of tests to assert what the users expect is a strong  
recommendation I have with tokenization.

It all really depends.  JavaCC is complex, that is my only  
reservation for recommending it.  If you can get by with simpler  
analysis techniques, then I say go for those instead.

But, JavaCC is powerful.  It simply isn't necessary for the bulk of  
analysis cases I've come across.  Works great for parsing query  
expressions though.
