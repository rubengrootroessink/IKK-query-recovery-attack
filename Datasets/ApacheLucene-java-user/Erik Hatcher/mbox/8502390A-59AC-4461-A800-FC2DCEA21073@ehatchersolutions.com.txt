It's not a "bug" per se.... but rather just how StandardAnalyzer  
works.  StandardAnalyzer is a general-purpose text analyzer, and  
cannot reasonably deal with this issue and also deal with the much  
more common scenario of "hyphenated-text" that should be split into  
separate tokens.

As Otis said, this is really the job for a custom analyzer.
