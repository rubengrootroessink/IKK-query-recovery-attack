Your use of QueryParser is unnecessary.  Simply construct TermQuery's 
instead.   Otherwise, what you are doing looks fine.

Right.   A OR B means that either A or B have to be present, but if 
neither are present then there is no match.

You're asking a pretty general question - are you really just using two 
terms for each field?  What you've shown based on the example (with the 
exception of using QueryParser) is fine.
