It is expected.  You're thinking that wildcards work on range queries.  
They do not.  You are literally starting the range at "0*", which is 
greater than "0" lexicograhically.  If you are doing number ranges, 
though, you probably want to do some padding with leading zeros so all 
numbers have the same string size.
