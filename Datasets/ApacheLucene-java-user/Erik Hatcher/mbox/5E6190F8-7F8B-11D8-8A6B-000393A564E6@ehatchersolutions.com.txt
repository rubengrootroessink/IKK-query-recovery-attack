So far so good, Stephane, on the wiki changes - looks good!

As for our book - at this point, early summer seems like when it'll 
actually be on the shelves.  By the end of April we should have mostly 
everything complete, reviewed, and entirely in the publishers hands.  
*ugh* - this process takes much longer than even exaggerated estimates.
