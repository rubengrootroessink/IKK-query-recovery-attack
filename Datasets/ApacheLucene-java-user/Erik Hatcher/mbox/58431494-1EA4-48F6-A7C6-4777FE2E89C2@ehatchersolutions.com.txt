Using ParallelReader - yes.  Read the javadocs to learn more.

Filters may be expensive to create, but once created and cached they  
are rapid.  Each user, for example, may have their own associated  
filter.  Or each group, or something like that.  You'd only need to  
rebuild the filters when permissions changed, but that may be better  
than rebuilding an index.

Results?!  As in Hits?  No.   Filters, yes, perhaps.  Architecturally  
that is your decision though.

I recommend trying it out and seeing if it works for you.

I'm a little too biased for that :)
