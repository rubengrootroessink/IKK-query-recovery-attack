SUBJECT: [webinar] Rapid Prototyping Search Applications with Solr
DATE: 7 Jun 2010

Marketing blurb below.  My personal hype here... I'm going to be  
showcasing a straightforward document search engine, from files  
through indexing through usable user interface in no time.  Come check  
it out.  There'll be similarities to my EuroCon presentation[1],  
though this will be an entirely custom built (building it as we  
speak!) application for the webinar.
