More robust, as in does not require re-indexing?

This is one of the tricky things about making a search engine.  Having 
fast searches, yet reserving the right to change how you query at a 
later time without re-indexing.  Unfortunately it doesn't work that 
way.  You have to consider the types of queries that will be made in 
order to index appropriately.  Changes in types of queries may 
necessitate a re-index to accommodate.

You may want to go ahead and index one field as YYYYMMDD, and another 
as YYYY.  and possibly another as YYYYMM.

You could also utilize a Filter for constraining searches based on a 
date range.  QueryFilter is one option, or writing a custom one that 
selects the appropriate documents.
