This list is primarily for the Java version of Lucene, but I suspect 
the behavior of the analyzers is fair game to ask here.  Perhaps you 
could mock up examples of what you're asking about in Java (should be 
pretty trivial to convert from C# to Java, eh? :).

This is something you'd have to ask in forums of each of the ports.  
PyLucene is exactly the Java version (at whatever point in time they 
built it).  CLucene and LuPy are surely playing catch-up with features 
and new index file formats.
