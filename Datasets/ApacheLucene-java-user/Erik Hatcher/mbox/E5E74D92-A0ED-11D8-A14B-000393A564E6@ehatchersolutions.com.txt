ParallelMultiSearcher simply spins a separate thread for each index and 
waits for the results from all threads before returning results.

Depending on your hardware, you may or may not receive performance 
benefits over using plain MultiSearcher.  You would likely need each 
index on a separate disk so that you would benefit from parallel I/O.

Beyond standard multi-threaded Java concerns, there is nothing special 
about ParallelMultiSearcher, and tuning would be dependent on your 
environment.
