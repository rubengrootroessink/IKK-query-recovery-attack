Hacking Similarity wasn't covered in LIA for one simple reason - 
Lucene's built-in scoring mechanism really is good enough for almost 
all projects.  The book was written for developers of those projects.

Personally, I've not had to hack Similarity, though I've toyed with it 
in prototypes and am using a minor tweak (turning off length 
normalization for the "title" field) for the lucenebook.com book 
indexing.

And maybe you'd contribute what you write to LIA 2nd edition :)
