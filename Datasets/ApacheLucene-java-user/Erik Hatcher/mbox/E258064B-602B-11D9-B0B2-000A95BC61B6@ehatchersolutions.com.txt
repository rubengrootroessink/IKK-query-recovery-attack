This is incorrect information that has somehow gotten out.  Amazon and 
B&N are slow to update their information, but Manning assures me that 
they have provided the correct information to Amazon to update.  The 
actual price you're paying is certainly not indicative of a $60.95 list 
price - Amazon doesn't discount 50%, I'm sure.
