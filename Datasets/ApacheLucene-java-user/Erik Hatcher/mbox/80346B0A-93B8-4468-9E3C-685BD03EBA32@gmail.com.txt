SUBJECT: Free Webinar: Implementing Solr open source search in a .NET and DBMS environment; Thurs 27 May 13:00 GMT (9a EDT)
DATE: 23 May 2010

I'd like to invite you to tune in to a great talk I saw at Apache  
Lucene Eurocon (www.lucene-eurocon.org) this past week in Prague by Bo  
Raun, of Nordjyske Medier. The talk was on how he discovered Solr and  
introduced it successfully in an IT environment whose strategy  
otherwise totally rests on Microsoft technologies (and other  
traditional commercial solutions, like Citrix, VMware, etc). Bo also  
discusses the contrast between a traditional relational database  
background and the different development outlook he needed, along with  
discoveries, surprises, and lessons learned, from which newcomers to  
Solr from commercial search and DBMS backgrounds might benefit.

Today Nordjyske Medier uses Solr for an editorial archive, and for an  
online yellow page directory, with new plans for Solr technologies in  
the near future to incorporate advanced search features like geosearch  
and Solr integration with an ontology engine.

If your timezone has to wake up too early in the day for this, you can  
always sign up now and view it at your convenience, as it'll be cached  
for playback
