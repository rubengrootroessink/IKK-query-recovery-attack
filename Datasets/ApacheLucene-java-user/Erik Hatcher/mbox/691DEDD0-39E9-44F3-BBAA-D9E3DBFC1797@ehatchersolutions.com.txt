This is entirely up to you.  What gets indexed is entirely within the  
developers control.  What date do you want indexed?  I presume by  
"document date" you mean a file system document.  But I'm thinking  
more generally here - "documents" in Lucene can be pulled from thin  
air, not just from file system documents.  You are welcome to use the  
file system date.

LIA does have an example of this, which actually makes some tests  
fail if the data file dates are changed.   
TestDataDocumentHandler.java indexes .properties files via the Ant  
<index> task (in contrib/ant in Subversion), and that task indexes  
the file last modified timestamp automatically with each document.   
SortingExample.java has examples of sorting (though not by this  
datestamp, but same idea).
