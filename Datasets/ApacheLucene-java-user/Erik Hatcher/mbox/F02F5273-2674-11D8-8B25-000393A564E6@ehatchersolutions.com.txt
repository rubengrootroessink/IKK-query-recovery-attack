DateFilter will be the better option if you do use the same date range 
filter repeatedly - just keep the instance around and re-use it.

A more general question, though, is are you truly just representing 
dates? (and not timestamps)  If so, how many different dates are in the 
index?

If you are just using dates, I recommend using "YYYYMMDD" formatted 
Field.Keyword(String, String) fields.  Don't use java.util.Date.  
You'll get far fewer terms if you are just representing dates, and 
RangeQuery might become a more viable option for you.
