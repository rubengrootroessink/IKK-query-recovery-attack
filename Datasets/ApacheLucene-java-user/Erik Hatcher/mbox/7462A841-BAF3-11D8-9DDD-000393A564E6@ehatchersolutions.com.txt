Correct, QueryParser does not support open-ended range queries.  A 
hack, of course, is to use some text that comes ahead of the first or 
beyond the last term on either end of the range.  [term TO ZZZZZ] for 
example.

What would you suggest as a way to denote an open end?

FYI - You could override getRangeQuery on a custom QueryParser subclass 
and implement this yourself.
