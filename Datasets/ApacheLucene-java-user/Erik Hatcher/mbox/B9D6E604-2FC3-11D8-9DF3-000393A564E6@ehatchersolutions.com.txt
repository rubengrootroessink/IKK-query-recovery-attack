Ummm..... nevermind that last question... I just realized where you 
work!  :)

So, my recommendation would be to tap into some parser for the COBOL 
language that you have handy and have it feed your Analyzer 
appropriately.  Or, use something very very simple like the 
WhitespaceAnalyzer as a first try.
