No offense intended at all, but you'll really need some Java experience 
to do stuff with Lucene.  There is no real good out-of-the-box 
front-end at the moment, unless you went with something like Searchblox 
(www.searchblox.com).

My JavaDevWithAnt project provides a front-end (using Struts) similar 
to the one that comes with the demo.  You can get JavaDevWithAnt (and 
build it yourself) at http://www.ehatchersolutions.com/JavaDevWithAnt
