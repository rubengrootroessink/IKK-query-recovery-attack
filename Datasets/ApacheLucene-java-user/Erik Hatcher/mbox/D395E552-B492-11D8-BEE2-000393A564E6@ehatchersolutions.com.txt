My guess is you have documents none of your documents in that range 
have button AND shirt in them.

I don't understand the question, sorry.  Terms in the index are ordered 
lexicographically, if that is what you mean.

Because of your analyzer.  Try indexing as a Keyword and search using a 
TermQuery.  Don't use QueryParser at first - it gets in the way of 
understanding what is really going on.  For fun, look at the .toString 
of the Query generated by QueryParser if you like.  Look at the 
AnalysisParalysis page on the wiki for more details.  Read my java.net 
articles to get a better understanding.   The short answer is that it 
is analysis that is bogging you down here.

You need to decide how to index file names on how you plan on querying 
for them.  We cannot answer this for you.
