The "workaround" is to write a custom analyzer and and have it do the 
desired thing per-field.

Hmmm.... just thinking out loud here without knowing if this is 
possible, but could a generic "wrapper" Analyzer be written that allows 
other analyzers to be used under the covers based on a field 
name/analyzer mapping?   If so, that would be quite cool and save folks 
from having to write custom analyzers as much to handle this pretty 
typical use-case.  I'll look into this more in the very near future 
personally, but feel free to have a look at this yourself and see what 
you can come up with.
