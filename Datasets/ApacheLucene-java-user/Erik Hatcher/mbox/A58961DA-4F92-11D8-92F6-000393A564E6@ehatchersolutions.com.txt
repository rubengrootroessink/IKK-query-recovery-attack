Yes, I understand now.  I think it is reasonable to have a no-arg 
constructor in this case though.  Even if there is no one standard 
character set, it will be up to the user of the API to specify one if 
the default is not good enough.

I'd like to keep the no-arg constructor there, but perhaps if there is 
a more commonly used character set than RussianUnicode we could switch 
to that.

Any objections?
