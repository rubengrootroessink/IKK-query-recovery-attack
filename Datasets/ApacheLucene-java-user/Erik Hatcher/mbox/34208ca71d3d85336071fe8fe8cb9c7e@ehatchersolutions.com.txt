Well sure, but how about this query:

	title:Something AND anotherField:someOtherValue

QueryParser, as-is, won't be able to do field-name swapping.  I could 
certainly apply that technique on all the structured queries that I 
build up with the API, but with QueryParser it is trickier.   I'm 
definitely open for suggestions on improving how case is handled.  The 
only drawback now is that I'm duplicating indexes, but that is only an 
issue in how long it takes to rebuild the index from scratch (currently 
about 20 minutes or so on a good day - when the machine isn't swamped).
