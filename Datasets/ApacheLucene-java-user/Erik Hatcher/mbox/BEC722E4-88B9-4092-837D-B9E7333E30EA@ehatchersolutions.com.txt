Didn't we go over this before?!  :)

Follow these steps _exactly_:

1) Download the source code from Lucene in Action from http:// 
www.lucenebook.com (you'll see a link at the top of the page to get  
the source code .zip file)

2) Unzip it, read and follow the README.

3) Run "ant Indexer", follow the prompts entering the directory for  
the Lucene index (or press Enter to accept the defaults) and the  
directory of .txt files to index.

4) Run "ant Searcher" to search the index built in step 3.

Once you have all this running, borrow the code from Indexer.java and  
incorporate it into your own codebase however you'd like.

     Erik
