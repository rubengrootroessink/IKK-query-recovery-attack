A technique I've employed for a client is to convert a general Query  
object into a SpanQuery, and created custom code to walk the spans,  
via SpanQuery.getSpans(), to put markers around them (such as <span  
class="highlight">....</span>).

At this point the code is not public domain, though it is not  
particularly sophisticated either.  There may be some examples that  
have floated past this list in the past of SpanQuery highlighting?
