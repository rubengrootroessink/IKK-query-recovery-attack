The best first approach is to simply re-query every time the user goes 
to a new page, keeping around the query in some for or another (perhaps 
the expression if you're using QueryParser) and the page number.

If that is fast enough, then you're done!  :)

If it is not, then you could consider caching Hits and your 
IndexSearcher to re-use when paging.
