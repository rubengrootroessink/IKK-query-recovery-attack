It's not quite a "suggestion", but rather just stating the facts of  
what exists _now_.  I'm skeptical of Lucene acquiring too many  
listener kinda hooks more deeply, or whether that layer should be  
added in a Solr kinda way.  Interesting architectural topic, methinks.

What are the boundaries of what you call an "index"?  Is it the  
current Lucene API, or could it be a service-like layer such as Solr  
on top of it?

I wonder.
