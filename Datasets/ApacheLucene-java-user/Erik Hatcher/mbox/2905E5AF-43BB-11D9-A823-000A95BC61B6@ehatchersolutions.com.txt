Having Hits implement List sounds nice, but it could not function by 
itself if the backing IndexSearcher/IndexReader is closed or is not 
accessible.  Wouldn't it be too tempting for naive users to consider 
passing this List around between tiers and forget about the reader?

Having Document implement Map sounds reasonable to me though.  Any 
reasons not to do this?
