Yup... SpanNearQuery supports ordered and unordered proximity.   
PhraseQuery does not, though.  QueryParser will only create a  
PhraseQuery though, so you'll need to subclass QueryParser to add  
this functionality.  There is an example of this in the free code of  
Lucene in Action - http://www.lucenebook.com
