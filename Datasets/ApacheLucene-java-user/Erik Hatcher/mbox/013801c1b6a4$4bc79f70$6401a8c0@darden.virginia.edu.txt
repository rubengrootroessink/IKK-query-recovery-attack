Oops.... I see this patch went to lucene-users, but I'm sure all the -dev
folks are here too.

I would also recommend commenting out all the properties in
build.properties.sample so that if someone renames it that they'd have to
manually uncomment items to specify them - this would just make it that much
more explicit.
