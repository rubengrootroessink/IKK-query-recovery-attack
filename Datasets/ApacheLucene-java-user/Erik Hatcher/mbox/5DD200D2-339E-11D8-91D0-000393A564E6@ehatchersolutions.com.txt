An analyzer does not have to replace terms, it can also place metaphone 
encodings in the same position, using setPositionIncrement(0).  There 
are some fiddly issues that occur when position increment zero is used, 
however - for example it is not possible to use that same analyzer with 
QueryParser and have phrase queries work properly (but there is at 
least one nice workaround).

So, exact spellings can be made to still work.
