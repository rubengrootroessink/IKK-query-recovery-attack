Reindexed is the wisest choice.  There are very complicated ways of 
doing it only during searching, but not worth the effort I don't think. 
  You could write your own custom Query subclass that could walk all the 
terms and select the ones in the range.  But keep in mind that what you 
have indexed is not ordered in an efficient manner for searching - 
reindexing is recommended.
