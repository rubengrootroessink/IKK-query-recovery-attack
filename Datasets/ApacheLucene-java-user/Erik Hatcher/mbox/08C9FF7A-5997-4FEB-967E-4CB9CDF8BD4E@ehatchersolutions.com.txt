Right, so what Yonik is saying is Solr implements most (if not all)  
of your needs in this regard right now.  It is a working  
implementation of your stated end goals, but it is at a different  
layer than you'd like....

At this point we have to stop speculating and someone implement this  
in their local version of Lucene with performance profiling before  
and after listeners are added and ensure that we don't slow Lucene  
down with such things and then contribute the code along with use and  
test cases.
