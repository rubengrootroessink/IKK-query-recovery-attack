Lucene's Hits collection handles this automatically for you.  But, 
sure, the lower-level API allows you to do this sort of thing if you 
really need to.  But, again, Hits handles this pretty efficiently for 
you already.

Have you experienced some performance issues?  Do you have some numbers 
and code that you could share that point to some kind of inefficiency?
