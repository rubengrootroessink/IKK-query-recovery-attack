We're overdue for a release, no question.  It's a tough itch to  
scratch though, since I run from trunk myself for all my projects.   
No date is set and the only thing holding a release back is no one  
has yet stepped forward to push out a release.  If I ever find a free  
day I'd do it, but I can't predict when that would be.  Other  
committers are welcome to tackle it also.  There is a fair bit of  
administrative overhead to making a release, at least it seems that  
way to me since I've done it so infrequently that I have to re-learn  
how to do it each time.
