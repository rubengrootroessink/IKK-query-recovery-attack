Besides Daniel's comment about IDE's warning of this (calling a  
static method from an instance variable is usually a warning), you  
can also glean this information from Lucene's Javadocs.  The static  
parse method is more trouble than its worth, actually.  We should  
probably deprecate that for 1.9 and remove it in 2.0 and only allow  
QueryParser instances - this allows more flexibility with things like  
MultiFieldQueryParser and such too.
