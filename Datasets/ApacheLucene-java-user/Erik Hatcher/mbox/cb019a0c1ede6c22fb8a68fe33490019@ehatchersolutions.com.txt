You should use a single stored, tokenized, and indexed field for this 
purpose.  Be cautious of how you construct the Field object to achieve 
this.

Why wouldn't it work?  For ID-type fields, use a Field.Keyword (stored, 
indexed, but not tokenized).  Search for a specific ID using a 
TermQuery (don't use QueryParser for this, please).  If the ID values 
are unique, you'll either get zero or one result.

No, this would not be the case, unless you're analyzing the ID field 
with some strange character-by-character analyzer or doing a wildcard 
"*5*" type query.

You're on the right track and avoiding a database when it is overkill 
or duplicative is commendable :)
