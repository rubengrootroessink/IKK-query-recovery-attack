Only if it can be made generic somehow - but that might be a bit tricky 
to implement depending on how crazy we wanted to get with it.  The 
HtmlDocument class is really meant to be just an example of how to use 
the Ant <index> task I wrote along with the 
FileExtensionDocumentHandler that uses it.  So its original purpose was 
not to be a robust HTML document indexer, but an example piece of a 
larger puzzle.

I've seen this request come up in the recent past, in fact.  And its a 
perfectly reasonable one, especially if you are in charge of the HTML.
