Where do you see the problem solved at lucenebook.com?   The "Query  
parsed to:" for this query <http://www.lucenebook.com/search? 
query=aaaaa+AND+bbbbb+OR+ccccc+AND+ddddd> is

	Query parsed to: +aaaaa bbbbb +ccccc +ddddd

The OR caused the "bbbbb" term to not be required, yet all other  
terms are required.
