I guess if you keep asking, someone will eventually answer :)

Here's an example I use to get all categories from the Lucene index 
that drives my blog at http://www.blogscene.org/erik

         Set categories = new TreeSet();

         IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(indexDir);
         try {
             TermEnum terms = reader.terms(new Term("category", ""));
             while ("category".equals(terms.term().field())) {
                 categories.add(terms.term().text());

                 if (!terms.next()) {
                     break;
                 }
             }
         } finally {
             reader.close();
         }

IndexReader is enumerating all the terms in the "category" field 
(you'll use your filename field name instead).

Sure, but that would require that you walk every document returned from 
the search and pull its filename field.  This would be vastly slower 
than the above code that goes directly to the terms.

My apologies for not replying sooner on this.
