Here is some pseudo-code:

	start = 0 or the starting index for the page you want to display
	finish = last hits index you want to display
	for i = start; i < finish ; i++
		if hits.score(i) within tolerance
			grab hits.doc(i)

I'm working hard to be helpful here.  I'm running out of answers for 
you though.  You are ignoring my requests to actually post code.  If 
you want further assistance shows us *exactly* what you're doing.

See above.  I cannot help with this without actual code (succinct clear 
code!).  Lucene can sort and filter if you leverage it appropriately.  
Please grab a copy of Lucene in Action for lots of details on sorting 
and filtering.

This already exists.  Please try it out.  There have been numerous 
posts about this topic.  Lucene in Action covers it.  Our source code 
download has examples.
