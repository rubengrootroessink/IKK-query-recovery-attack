#2 shouldn't be too hard to implement, but you'll need to catch new  
lines in the initial tokenizer.  I'm not sure about the efficiency,  
both options would require a tokenizer detecting new lines and either  
injecting a new term or setting a flag such that the next term gets a  
position increment bump.
