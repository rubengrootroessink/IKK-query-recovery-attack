Is the port a completely manual process for you?  Could you describe 
how you do the porting to us?

In Lucene in Action (we promise, the e-book and code are being released 
soon - likely this week!!!), Mike Clark donated some performance tests 
to us using JUnitPerf (he's the creator of it).  JUnitPerf is a great 
way to do timed and load tests.  The Java version of Lucene could 
certainly benefit from a suite of performance tests, at least to ensure 
future changes do not adversely affect performance without a good 
reason to do so.

JUnitPerf is almost trivial to use - just a decorator for JUnit tests.

One of these days all of the Lucene ports should come together and come 
up with a compatibility test suite as well as some performance 
benchmarks.
