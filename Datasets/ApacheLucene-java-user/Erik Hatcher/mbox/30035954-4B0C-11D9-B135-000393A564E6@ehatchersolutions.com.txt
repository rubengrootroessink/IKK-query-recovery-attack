Thank you.  Let me know off-line when you receive your copy, so I can 
get an idea of when it actually ships.

Suggestions more than welcome!

It is true that LIA does not cover any details of indexing a database.  
The idea is that Lucene indexes text, and how you get text into Lucene 
is not usually generalizable - or at least not worth the complexity of 
trying to do so.

The jGuru case study makes some strong points about indexing your 
content rather than your website.  I've found that words of wisdom 
often are more potent than specific technical details that do not 
generalize.

These are all great points.  I will add these to my notes for future 
editions.

While this is not exactly what you mention, I did write a section on 
the new term vector feature allowing it to be used for for finding 
similar documents.

The Searching chapter has a brief section discussing this topic, with 
the advice that re-searching is the best first approach.

No worries.  Your points are all very valid.

To address the inevitable follow-up, I am setting up a blog site where 
we'll post items that need further clarification, correction, or 
completely new things that we did not cover.  This will take me a few 
weeks to get time to set up properly.  I will announce it here when it 
is available.

Thanks again for your feedback.
