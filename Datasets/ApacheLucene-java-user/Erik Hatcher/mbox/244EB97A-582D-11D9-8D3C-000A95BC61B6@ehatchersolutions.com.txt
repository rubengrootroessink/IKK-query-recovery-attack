As you can see, StandardAnalyzer tokenized RPG/4 as "rpg/4".  A 
TermQuery must be *exactly* that to match.  You could, alternatively, 
bypass QueryParser and use the analyzer directly making a TermQuery (or 
PhraseQuery) out of the results.  I do this in quite a few queries in 
the system I'm building for my primary work to allow queries against 
some library archives.

This is one of the most critical, but seemingly misunderstood, aspect 
to using Lucene effectively - how to manage the analysis process and 
match it to the searching side.
