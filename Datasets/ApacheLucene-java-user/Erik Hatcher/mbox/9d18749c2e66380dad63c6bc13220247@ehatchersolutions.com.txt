That would be slick!

The dilemma with Luke is that its not ASL'd (because of the thinlet 
integration).  Anyone up for a Swing conversion project?  :)

It would be quite cool if Lucene had a built-in UI tool (like or 
actually Luke).  Luke itself is ASL'd and I believe Andrzej has said 
he'd gladly donate it to Lucene's codebase, but the Thinlet LGPL is an 
issue.

Don't concern yourselves with Ant at the moment.  Anything that is 
easily callable from Java can be made into an Ant task.  In fact, the 
minimum requirements for an Ant task is a "public void execute()" 
method.  Whatever Java infrastructure you come up with, I'll gladly 
create the Ant task wrapper for it when its ready.

Wow... that is getting pretty clever.  I like it!

I don't personally have a need for relational database indexing, but I 
support this effort to make a generalized mapping facility.
