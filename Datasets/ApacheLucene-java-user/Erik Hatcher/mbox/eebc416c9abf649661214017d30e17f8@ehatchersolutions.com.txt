Ross - I'm really perplexed by your message.  You create HTML from a 
database so that you can index it with Lucene, yet wish you could 
simply index the data in your database tied to a primary key directly, 
right?

Well, you're in luck - you already can do this!

What are you using for indexing?  It sounds like you borrowed the 
Lucene demo and have just run with that directly.
