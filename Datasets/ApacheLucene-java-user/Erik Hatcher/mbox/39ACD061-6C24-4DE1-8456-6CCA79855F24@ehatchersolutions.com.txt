My java.net article and the (free) code from lucenebook.com has an  
analyzer demo that will show what comes out of the analyzer, but  
sounds like you've already troubleshot that aspect.

Luke (google for "luke lucene") will let you see what got indexed - I  
recommend trying that out.

Are you searching with QueryParser?   If you look at the generated  
Query.toString() does it match what you indexed?   If not, try a  
simple TermQuery for what gets returned from your analyzer and see if  
that works.  If not, Lucene is broken :)
