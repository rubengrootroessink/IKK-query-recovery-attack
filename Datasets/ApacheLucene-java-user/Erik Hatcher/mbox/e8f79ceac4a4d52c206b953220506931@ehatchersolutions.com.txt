The demo web application that comes with Lucene is exactly this, 
however its not quite as clean as we'd like.  The standalone 
application part is covered by that demo code, and there is also a 
cleaner codebase to start with in the Lucene in Action source code - 
http://www.lucenebook.com - (see the lia.meetlucene package code for 
Indexer and Searcher).
