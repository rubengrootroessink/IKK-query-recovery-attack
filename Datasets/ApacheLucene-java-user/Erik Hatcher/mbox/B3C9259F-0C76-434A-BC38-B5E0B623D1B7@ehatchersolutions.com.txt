I'm interested in what your use case is in desiring this.  What  
factors would you vary per field?  The only factor that seems to make  
sense is lengthNorm which is computed at indexing time and does allow  
per-field tweaking.  A custom Similarity subclass could be used to  
affect the lengthNorm based on the field name parameter.
