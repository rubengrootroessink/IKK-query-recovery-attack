Robert,

I'm very likely going to be using DSpace and some related  
technologies from the SIMILE project very soon :)

I would vote for option #2 as it gives the most flexibilty - you can  
query with or without concern for language.

Adding an additional field will be of little consequence.

I don't think #3 is all that complex to implement beyond the other  
options, except if you want to search across all languages - but the  
MultiSearcher can handle that.

It's tough to give a general recommendation - it really depends on  
how each of these solutions fit into the architecture and what needs  
you have in terms of querying across multiple languages and such.
