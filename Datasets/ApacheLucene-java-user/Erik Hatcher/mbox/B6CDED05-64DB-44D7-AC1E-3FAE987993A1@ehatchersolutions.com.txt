Certainly Lucene could do this quite easily, but since you're already  
using a database it would be worth it to explore whether LIKE queries  
or full-text capabilities of your database will achieve what you're  
after without adding another dependency and related code to your  
project.

It wouldn't be overkill to use Lucene for this scenario at all if you  
can't achieve what you're after within your database as-is.
