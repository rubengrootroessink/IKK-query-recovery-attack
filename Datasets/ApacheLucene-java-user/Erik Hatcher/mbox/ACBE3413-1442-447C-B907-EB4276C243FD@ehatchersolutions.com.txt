So you have a single RemoteSearchable on the client?  Or are you  
using multiple RemoteSearchables behind a MultiSearcher?

With a MultiSearcher you can find out which searcher a hit comes  
from, but I don't believe you can find that out with a single  
RemoteSearchable hitting a search server that in turn is doing the  
MultiSearcher.
