Dates require special considerations when dealing with QueryParser.  By 
default, you need to use the short format in the default locale for the 
expressions:

	lastModified:[08/27/2002 TO 08/27/2002]

If you want to deal with other formats, you will need to subclass 
QueryParser and override getRangeQuery and do your own thing there.
