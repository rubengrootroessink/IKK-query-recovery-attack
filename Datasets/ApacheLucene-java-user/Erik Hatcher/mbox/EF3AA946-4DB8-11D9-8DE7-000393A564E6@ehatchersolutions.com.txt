If your searches are taking 440 seconds, you have something more 
fundamentally wrong.  You are either doing some large 
wildcard/range/fuzzy expansions or you're accessing every document from 
all your hits.  Is the searcher.search() method taking that long?  I 
bet not.  Or rather is it the iteration over the Hits that is killing 
the "search" time, which is what I suspect?

We've emphasized numerous times that calling hits.doc(i) is a resource 
hit.  Don't do it for documents you aren't going to show.  To filter by 
score, use hits.score(i) first.

Please narrow your code down to a clean, succinct example that you can 
post.  It is difficult to help you without details of your code (but 
let me emphasize again - it needs to be clean and succinct so it is 
quick for us to get a handle on).

Ah, so you are accessing every document to get this field information.  
It is incorrect that you cannot filter prior to getting hits.  You have 
a couple of options in filtering by a field value - use a QueryFilter 
or simply AND a RangeQuery to the original query.
