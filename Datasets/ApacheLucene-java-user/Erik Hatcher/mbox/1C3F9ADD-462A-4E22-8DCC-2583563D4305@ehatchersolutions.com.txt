Use MultiSearcher.  Instantiate IndexReader's for each index, and  
then construct a MultiSearcher using those two readers.  This is  
exactly how lucenebook.com works - one index for blog content, one  
for book content.

Two options :

     1) Only use an IndexSearcher to the index you want to query if  
you are isolating it to only one type.
     2) Tack on a TermQuery for field "type" to the query (wrap the  
original query with BooleanQuery and add a required TermQuery clause  
for the type).

Personally I'd opt for #1 just to keep things simpler.

MultiSearcher across both indexes.

See above.
