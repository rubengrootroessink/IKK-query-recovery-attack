Yes, it can be achieved.  Not quite synonyms, but various forms of the  
same word can be found in this example, like this search for similar  
(see the highlighted variations):

	http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=similar

This is accomplished using the Snowball stemmer filter found in the  
sandbox.   For synonyms, you have lots of options.  In Lucene in Action  
I demonstrate custom analyzers that inject synonyms using the WordNet  
database (from the sandbox).  From the source code distribution of LIA:

% ant SynonymAnalyzerViewer
Buildfile: build.xml

SynonymAnalyzerViewer:
      [echo]
      [echo]       Using a custom SynonymAnalyzer, two fixed strings are
      [echo]       analyzed with the results displayed.  Synonyms, from  
the
      [echo]       WordNet database, are injected into the same positions
      [echo]       as the original words.
      [echo]
      [echo]       See the "Analysis" chapter for more on synonym  
injection and
      [echo]       position increments.  The "Tools and extensions"  
chapter covers
      [echo]       the WordNet feature found in the Lucene sandbox.
      [echo]
     [input] Press return to continue...

      [echo] Running lia.analysis.synonym.SynonymAnalyzerViewer...

      [java] 1: [quick] [warm] [straightaway] [spry] [speedy] [ready]  
[quickly] [promptly] [prompt] [nimble] [immediate] [flying] [fast]  
[agile]
      [java] 2: [brown] [brownness] [brownish]
      [java] 3: [fox] [trick] [throw] [slyboots] [fuddle] [fob] [dodger]  
[discombobulate] [confuse] [confound] [befuddle] [bedevil]
      [java] 4: [jumps]
      [java] 5: [over] [o] [across]
      [java] 6: [lazy] [faineant] [indolent] [otiose] [slothful]
      [java] 7: [dogs]

...

The phrase analyzed was "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogs".  
  Why no synonyms for "jumps" and "dogs"?  WordNet has synonyms for  
"jump" and "dog", but not the plural forms.  Stemming would be a  
necessary step in achieving full synonym look-up, though this would  
need to be done carefully as the stem of a word is not necessarily a  
real word itself - so you'd probably want to stem the synonym database  
also to ensure accurate lookup.

Also notice the semantically incorrect synonyms that appear for the  
animal fox ("confuse", for example).  Be careful!  :)
