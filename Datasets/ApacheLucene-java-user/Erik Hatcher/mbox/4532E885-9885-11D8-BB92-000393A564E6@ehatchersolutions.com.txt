No worries.  This is the type of thing that is a "gotcha" with dates, 
and is a prime candidate for a wiki page (nudge, nudge)...

You should represent dates (at index and search time) using YYYYMMDD 
format - it needs to be lexicographically ordered.  Forget DateField 
and Field.Keyword(String,Date) altogether.

Some tricks are needed if you need to use QueryParser to translate 
mm/dd/yyyy format to how you represent it, but it is quite simple. 
(subclass QueryParser, override getRangeQuery).
