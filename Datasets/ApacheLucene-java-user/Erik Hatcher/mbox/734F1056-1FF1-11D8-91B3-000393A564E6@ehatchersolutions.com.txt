This depends on the Analyzer you're using.  I'm assuming you're using 
the QueryParser and an analyzer that rips off special characters - so 
essentially the TermQuery underneath is always for AMP.

Have a look at my first java.net article which shows the analysis 
process.  Run your sample text through the code provided there to see 
the effect first-hand.
