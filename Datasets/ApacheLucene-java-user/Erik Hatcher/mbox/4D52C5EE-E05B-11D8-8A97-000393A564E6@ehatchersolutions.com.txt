I don't understand what you're attempting in the above.  You don't make 
a new Term and add it to a PhraseQuery instance with the term having 
quotes around it - it is QueryParser that deals with quoted strings and 
interpreting it into a PhraseQuery.

Are you using pQuery?  Or query?  You've got two Query instances there 
- query is the one you probably want.
