Sam - out of curiosity, what does Lucene in Action lack that you  
seek?   Along those lines, anyone with suggestions on what topics to  
add to the 2nd edition, or even better, what to remove, are gladly  
accepted.  Please e-mail me off-list.

There are many articles about Lucene, most (all?) are linked from here:

     <http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/Resources>

Those should give you plenty more material to work with, perhaps more  
concretely than covered in LIA.  Also, the source code to LIA is  
freely available, in case you were not already aware of that.

     Erik
