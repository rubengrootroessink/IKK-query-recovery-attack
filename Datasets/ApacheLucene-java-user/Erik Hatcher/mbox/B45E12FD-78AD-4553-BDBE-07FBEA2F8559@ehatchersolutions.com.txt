Lucene automatically merges segments periodically during large  
indexing runs.  Look at the parameters available on IndexWriter, and  
research the best practices mentioned about those settings in this  
forum archives, the Lucene wiki, and other resources (such as  
articles and "Lucene in Action").  With sufficient disk space you'll  
be able to tune those settings to keep the index as unsegmented as  
you like as you index, and then optimize after the batch is completed  
again for good measure.
