Not really.  Terms in the index are ordered lexicographically,  
including case.  It certainly would be possible to write customized  
Query subclasses to do this sort of thing at the expense of performance.

The only techniques I'm aware of are to either build separate indexes  
or index the same information into separate fields of the same  
documents using different analyzers per field.
