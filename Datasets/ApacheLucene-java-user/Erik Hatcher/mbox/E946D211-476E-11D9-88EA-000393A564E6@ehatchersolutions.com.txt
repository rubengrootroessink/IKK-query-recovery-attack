Actually Lucene 1.4.3 is now available and I recommend you use it 
instead, through the official Jakarta binary downloads.  We're still 
tidying up some loose ends on it before officially announcing it, but 
you can find it here:

	http://www.apache.org/dist/jakarta/lucene/binaries/

We did not release 1.4.1 or 1.4.2 properly, so those binaries are not 
available there currently.  Whether we retroactively put them there is 
still undecided.
