These all boil down to your choice of analyzer.  What analyzer are  
you using?

As you can see below, "processing-7-bit" is tokenized quite  
differently depending on the analyzer:

$ ant AnalyzerDemo
Buildfile: build.xml

     [input] String to analyze: [This string will be analyzed.]
processing-7-bit
      [echo] Running lia.analysis.AnalyzerDemo...
      [java] Analyzing "processing-7-bit"
      [java]   WhitespaceAnalyzer:
      [java]     [processing-7-bit]

      [java]   SimpleAnalyzer:
      [java]     [processing] [bit]

      [java]   StopAnalyzer:
      [java]     [processing] [bit]

      [java]   StandardAnalyzer:
      [java]     [processing-7-bit]

If you're using the StandardAnalyzer, you are not indexing the word  
"processing" at all.  Grab the source code from Lucene in Action at  
lucenebook.com and type "ant AnalyzerDemo" to try out the basic  
analyzers.
