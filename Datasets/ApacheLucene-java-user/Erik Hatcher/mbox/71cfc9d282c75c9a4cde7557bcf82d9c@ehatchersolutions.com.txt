It's hard to answer such a general question with anything very precise, 
so sorry if this doesn't hit the mark.  Come back with more details and 
we'll gladly assist though.

First, certainly do not copy/paste code.  Use standard reuse practices, 
perhaps the same program can build the two different indexes if passed 
different parameters, or share code between two different programs as a 
JAR.

What specifically are the issues you're encountering?
