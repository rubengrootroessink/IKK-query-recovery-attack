You mean to achieve AND'd clauses?   By default, OR is the operator,  
and AND must be explicit.  You can construct a QueryParser instance  
and set the default operator to AND, though, and then OR must be  
explicit.

Yes, this sounds like the default operator is what you're looking  
for.  Since you use "Lucene in Action" as an example, flip to page 94  
for more discussion on this, and then flip to the other pages  
mentioned here:
