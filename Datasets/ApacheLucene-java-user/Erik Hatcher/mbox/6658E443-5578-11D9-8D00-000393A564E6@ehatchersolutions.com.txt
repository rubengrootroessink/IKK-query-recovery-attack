Using YYYYMMDD works better for RangeQuery than Field.Keyword(String, 
Date) does.  Using the built-in Date field goes down to the millisecond 
level.  If you have lots of documents on the same day, but different 
milliseconds, you end up with lots of terms.  RangeQuery expands into a 
BooleanQuery OR'd with all the matching terms.  BooleanQuery has a 
built-in default of 1,024 allowed clauses, otherwise you get a 
TooManyClauses exception.

YYYYMMDD is a numeric, and to sort by that field I'd recommend you use 
a numeric type as it'll use much less memory.  But certainly doing some 
tests between using a numeric vs. String sorting type is advisable and 
see how it performs with each.
