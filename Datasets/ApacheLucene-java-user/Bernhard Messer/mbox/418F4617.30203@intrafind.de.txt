SUBJECT: Re: Does lucene makes any compression
DATE: 8 Nov 2004

The lucene version from CVS head does now have a option to store and 
compress whole text files (binary fields within a lucene document) thru 
GZip. The index itself is not GZip compressed. Due to the nature of how 
the index is created and stored, it is very effectiv regarding to 
diskspace without the need of additional compression.

I have no idea if the new functionality is already adapted within the c# 
port.

regards
Bernhard
