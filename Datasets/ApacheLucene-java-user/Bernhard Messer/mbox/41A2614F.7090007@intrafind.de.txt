SUBJECT: Re: auto-generate uid?
DATE: 22 Nov 2004

Just to clarify. I have a Field 'uid' those value is an unique integer. 
I  use it as a key to the document stored externally. I don't mean 
Lucene's  internal document number.

what you could do is to write your own IndexWriter class by extending 
the original one found in org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter. Than you 
have direct access to lucene's segment counter which could provide you a 
unique id for each document in the index. Those id's would stay sticky 
even if you modify the index after the intial creation process.

is that the hint you need to start ?
