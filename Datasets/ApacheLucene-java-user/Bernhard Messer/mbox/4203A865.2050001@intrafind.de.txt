there already was  a discussion about disk usage during index optimize. 
Please have a look to the developers list at: 
http://mail-archives.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org&msgId=1797569

<http://mail-archives.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org&msgId=1797569>
where i made some measurements about the disk usage within lucene.
At that time i proposed a patch which was reducing disk total used disk 
size from 3 times to a little more than 2 times of the final index size. 
Together with Christoph we implemented some improvements to the 
optimization patch and finally commit the changes.
