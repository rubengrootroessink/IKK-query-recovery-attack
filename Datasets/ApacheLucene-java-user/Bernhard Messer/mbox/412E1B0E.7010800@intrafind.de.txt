hi,

in general the query parser doesn't allow queries which start with a 
wildcard Those queries could end up with very long response times and 
block your system. This is not what you want.

I'm not sure if i understand what you want to do. I expect that you have 
a field within a lucene document with name "type". For this field you 
can have different values like "contact,account" etc. Now you want to 
search all documents where type is "contact". So the query to do this 
would be "type:contact", nothing else is required.

can you try that and give some feedback ?

best regards
Bernhard
