SUBJECT: Which searched words are found in a document
DATE: 25 May 2004

Hi,

I have the following question:
Is there an easy way to see which words from a query were found in a
resulting document?

So if I search for 'cat OR dog' and get a result document with only 'cat'
in it. I would like to ask the searcher object or something to tell me
that for the result document 'cat' was the only word found.

I did see it is somehow possible with the explain method, but this does
not give a clean answer.
I can also get the contents of the document and do an indexof for each
search term but there could be quite a lot in our case.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Edvard Scheffers
