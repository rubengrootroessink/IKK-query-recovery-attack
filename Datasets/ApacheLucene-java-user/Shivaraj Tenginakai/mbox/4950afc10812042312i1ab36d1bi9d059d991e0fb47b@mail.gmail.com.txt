SUBJECT: Sorting documents without a query
DATE: 5 Dec 2008

I have a usecase in which I have no search query, but still need to sort
documents. For example, items need to be sorted by price, though the user
has not yet selected any search criteria.

What would be the best way to achieve this?

Thanks and Regards,

Shivaraj
