SUBJECT: how to count stop words
DATE: 21 Oct 2003

Hi all,
For my job, in indexing stage, I would like to keep stop words such as the, with, of, by,
etc as normal words. I did this by instantiating a standardAnalyzer object (in INdexHTML program)
with an empty stopword array. But it seems to me that the IndexHTML still sweeps off the stop
words. Any help, please.
 
Thanks
 
T Le
