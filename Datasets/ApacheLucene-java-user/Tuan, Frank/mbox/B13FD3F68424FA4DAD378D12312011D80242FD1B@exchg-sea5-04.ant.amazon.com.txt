Thanks Koji, this "feature" always gets me.  It's working now.

Hi Frank,

Why your assertion fails because addOrUpdate() method doesn't work properly. The method is
called INDEX_LIMIT times in populateIndex() for loop, but the index is newly created every
time due to CREATE_NEW flag at the IndexWriter constructor:

>     protected void addOrUpdate(Document doc) throws IOException
>     {
>         IndexWriter indexWriter = null;
>         Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
> 
>         try {
>             indexWriter = new IndexWriter(directory, analyzer, 
> CREATE_NEW);
>             indexWriter.addDocument(doc);
>         } finally {
>             indexWriter.close();
>         }
>     }

You may want to move the code to setUp() method.

Hope this helps,

Koji
