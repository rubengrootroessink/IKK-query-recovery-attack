We've run into an issue with the term vectors. When indexing a small corpus
(~3k docs, 1.3G) everything works fine, as it does with a small number of
documents from TREC-6 (so we believe that our indexing code is ok).  However,
when we tried to index the full TREC-6 corpus (~300,000 docs, 2G) the term
vectors all seem to come back as null.  When the indexing process is going on,
we can see the .frq file being built so it appears as if the index routine is
doing its thing.

Has anyone experienced anything similar?

Thanks in advance for any insight you can offer
