I agree that is sensible.  Does FSDirectory provide anything more than a
wrapper around OS directory structures?

You should probably always try to use Directory, and not String nor
FSDirectory. Directory is the most abstract 'index type and location
entity', and using it smartly allows you to change your index type and
location more easily, should you ever choose to do that.
