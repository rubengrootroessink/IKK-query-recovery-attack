It sounds like this is the same feature as is in 1.4; it's just that 1.4
turns it on by default and 1.3 does not.  I've implemented this in my
code (essentially a one line fix) and will begin to test.
Unfortunately, we see the issue so infrequently, it will probably be
several months before we can conclude whether this resolved the problem
or not. 

Thanks

Scott

Scott,

Lucene 1.3 added a compound file format which may solve your out of file
handles issue.  Look at the new method on IndexWriter to use this mode.
