SUBJECT: Highlighting phrases in 2.9
DATE: 30 Sep 2009

I've been looking at the changes I have to make in my code to go from
2.4.1 to 2.9.  One of the features I have is to highlight query hits in
documents which meet the search criteria.   If the query has a phrase,
then I need to highlight the phrase, but not isolated words from the
phrase which also happen to be in the document.

 

In 2.4.1, I do this using the SimpleHTMLFormatter, the NullFragmenter
and the SpanScorer.  It looks like highlighter had a major overhaul in
2.9 and that SpanScorer is now the wrong scorer to use (it's been moved
out of the highlighter).   I also found some JIRA's that seem to imply
that SpanScorer is now used by default, but I don't see anything in the
javadocs that say this is the case. 

 

Do I just need to remove the SpanScorer completely and assume that the
highlighter takes care of that for me?  

 

Can someone suggest what I need to do or point me to some documentation?
