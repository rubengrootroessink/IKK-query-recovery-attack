SUBJECT: Large index question
DATE: 12 Oct 2006

Supposed I want to index 500,000 documents (average document size is
4kBs).  Let's assume I create a single index and that the index is
static (I'm not going to add any new documents to it).  I would guess
the index would be around 2GB.  

 

Now, I do searches against this on a somewhat beefy machine (2GB RAM,
Core 2 Duo, Windows XP).  Does anyone have any idea what kinds of search
times I can expect for moderately complicated searches (several sets of
keywords against several fields)?  Are there things I can do to increase
search performance?  For example, does Lucene like lots of RAM, lots of
CPU, faster HD, all of the above?  Am I better splitting the index file
into 2 (N?) versions and search on multiple indexes simultaneously?  

 

Anyone have any thoughts about this?
