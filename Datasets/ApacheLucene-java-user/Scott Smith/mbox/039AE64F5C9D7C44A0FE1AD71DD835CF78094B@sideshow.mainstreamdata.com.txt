After two rather frustrating days, I find I need to apologize to Lucene.  My
last run of 225 messages averaged around 25 milliseconds per message--that's
parsing the xml, creating the Document, and putting it in the index (2.5Ghz
cpu, 1G ram).  Turns out the performance problem was xerces sax "helping me"
by loading the DTD before it parsed each message and the DTD wasn't local to
our site.  After seeing Terry's response, I knew there had to be more going
on than what I was assuming.

Thanks for the suggestions.  I wonder how much faster I can go if I
implement some of those?

Regards

Scott

Scott,

Here are some figures to use for comparision.  Using the latest Lucene
release, I index about 200 similar-sized XML files at a time, on a Windows
XP machine (2Ghz).  First I create a new index, which adds the documents at
a rate of about 8 per second (I don't recall what the cpu % is during this).
Then I merge this new index with the master one (using, I think, the default
merge factor), which takes about 4.5 minutes (during which time the cpu
utilization stays near 100%).  The master index currently holds about
115,000 such documents.

HTH,

Regards,

Terry
