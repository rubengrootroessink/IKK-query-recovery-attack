SUBJECT: Lucene highlighting
DATE: 28 Nov 2007

I've been looking at the highlighter examples.  All of them seem to deal with fragments.  I
need to highlight an entire document as it is displayed (i.e., highlight all of the keywords
in it).  Can someone point me to some examples of this or does the highlighter code not do
this?
 
Thanks
 
Scott
