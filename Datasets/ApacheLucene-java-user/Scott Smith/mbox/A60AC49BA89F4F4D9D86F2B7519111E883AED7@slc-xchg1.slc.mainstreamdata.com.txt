Is anyone aware of an open source (non-GPL; i.e.., free for commercial
use) Arabic analyzer for Lucene?  Does Arabic really require a stemmer
as well (some of the reading I've seen on the web would suggest that a
stemmer is almost a necessity with Arabic to get anything useful where
it is not with other languages).
