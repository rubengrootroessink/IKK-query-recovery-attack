DATE: 7 May 2004

Look at the WebLucene project for the CJKTokenizer (CJK = Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). 
I have successfully used this to index Chinese and Japanese.  In fact, I have these along
with English, German and several other western European languages all in the same index and
it works fine.
