I believe that Lucene only indexes Unicode (or as Henry Ford might say
"you can search any encoding as long as it's Unicode").  Therefore, you
have to translate Big5 and GB1312 to Unicode before you put them in the
index.  Your code that reads in the html needs to be smart enough to
notice how the html is encoded and make the translation before it
creates the Document.  Likewise, your search terms need to be Unicode. 

Btw--you will also need to use something like Che Dong's CJK Analyzer.
I don't believe the standard analyzer's will handle Asian languages in
any kind of reasonable fashion.

Disclaimer: I am new to Lucene (about 6 months) and to processing Asian
languages.  In my defense, I do have a number of happy users using
Lucene to search Japanese and Chinese XML files for things of interest.

Can I find out if I  have both Big5 and GB2312 encoded HTML files in two
separate directories, and when I build the index, does Lucene able to
distinguish the character set? or Lucene only work with single encoding.

Thank you.
