DATE: 13 Dec 2006

One other thing I discovered that I mention so no one else is tripped up
by it.  

I set the boost to zero for the categories in the query.  When I ran my
unit tests, some of them started to fail.  I eventually realized that
the failures were in searches where I only wanted to find documents in
the right category (i.e., I wasn't looking for documents with any
particular words in them); I would get zero hits.  I'm assuming this is
because even though the document belonged to a category I was looking
for, because lucene computed its score as 0, it assumed I didn't want
that document.

I guess that all makes sense, it just means I have to be careful as to
which queries I set the category boost to zero and which I don't.

I've implemented the zero boost solution and it seems to be doing what I
want.  Thanks to everyone who had suggestions.

: Isn't it also true that using Field.Index.NO_NORMS when creating the
field will
: remove it from the scoring formula?  I thought I read that somewhere,
but now
: can't find where.

queries on fields with NO_NORMS will still contribute to the score, but
the field *length* and/or field bosts won't contribute to the score.
