I'm interested in comments on the following problem.  

 

I have a set of documents.  They fall into 3 categories.  Call these
categories A, B, and C.  Each document has an indexed, non-tokenized
field called "category" which contains A, B, or C (they are mutually
exclusive categories).  

 

All of the documents contain a field called "body" which contains a
bunch of text.  This field is indexed and tokenized.

 

So, I want to do a search which looks something like:

 

(category:A OR category:B) AND body:fred

 

I want all of the category A documents to come before the category B
documents.  Effectively, I want to have the category A documents first
(sorted by relevancy) and then the category B documents after (sorted by
relevancy).

 

I thought I could do this by boosting the category portion of the query,
but that doesn't seem to work consistently.  I was setting the boost on
the category A term to 1.0 and the boost on the category B term to 0.0.

 

Any thoughts how to skin this?
