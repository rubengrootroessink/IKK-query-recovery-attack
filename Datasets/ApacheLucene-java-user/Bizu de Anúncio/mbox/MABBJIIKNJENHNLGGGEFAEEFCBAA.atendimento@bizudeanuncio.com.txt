SUBJECT: My own steammer (brazilian)
DATE: 14 Feb 2002

	My brazilian steammer has the same structure as the German steammer, except
for the inner logic.

	I created it , tested it and now I'm trying to compile it with no success.
The problem is the 'StandartTokenizer.java' class ! I can´t find it in the
package org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard .

	The only file that exists there is a file named 'StandartTokenizer.jj'.
What is this file for ?

	I have lucene-1.2-rc2. Can someone help me,

thanks,

	jk
