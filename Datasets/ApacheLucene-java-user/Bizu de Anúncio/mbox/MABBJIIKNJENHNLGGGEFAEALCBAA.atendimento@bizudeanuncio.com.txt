SUBJECT: Filter and stop-words
DATE: 3 Dec 2001

	I'm new to Lucene. First of all I would like to know if there is a search
arquive like "sun servlets list".

	My first problem is that I want to index a Portuguese database and I need
to remove the "s" (plural) and acents (à é ...) from the words. Is there a
way of passing a filter class to the Lucene indexer ? And about the
stop-words, where should I configure Lucene to ignore it ?

	Any help would be appreciated,

	thanks a lot,

		jk
