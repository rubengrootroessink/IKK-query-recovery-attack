SUBJECT: Lucene 1.3 final -- Lock/Segment permission errors
DATE: 9 Feb 2004

We are in the process of migrating an application from WAS 5.1 to Sun
Application server 8 (for technical reason version 7 is incompatible with
our application). Under WAS Lucene works great; however, when building an
index under Sun we get a java.security.AccessControlException when Lucene
attempts to delete any segment file also any time the application attempts
to delete the write.lock file the same error is being thrown. It seems that
the permissions are fine for Read/Write; however, delete is illegal. Though
the documents created are deleted without error.

Has anyone gotten Lucene to work on Sun Application Server 8 or encountered
this problem?

Any help would be great.

Thanks,

Brian Clay
