SUBJECT: Re: Query Expansion Module for Lucene based on BM25 ranking 	function
DATE: 23 Oct 2008

Hi Grant and Jose,

just to give some more details, as Jose said avg_length is precalculated 
at indexing time using an specific Similarity class. Basically this can 
be done through the lengthNorm method, for each document and field the 
total length is stored, when the indexing process is finished these 
values are divided by the total number of docs, and results are saved in 
a file with the following format:

FIELD_NAME
FLOAT_VALUE
FIELD_NAME_2
FIELD_VALUE_2

for example:
CONTENT
459.2903f
ANCHOR
84.55523f

A more detailed explanation can be found at 
http://nlp.uned.es/~jperezi/Lucene-BM25/

Best Regards.
