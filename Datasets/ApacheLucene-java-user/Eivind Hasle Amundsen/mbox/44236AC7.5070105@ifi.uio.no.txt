Hello, World!

I'm totally new to Lucene, but I'll be dealing with it in my master 
thesis (among other things) for the next year or so. I've acquired the 
LIA book and started to have a brief look at the API.

First I want to thank Mr. Hatcher and Mr. Gospodnetic for what seems to 
be an excellent introduction to Lucene, but not least Mr. Cutting and 
the rest of the developers for Lucene itself.

I've started out fresh with the 1.9.1 release, trying to pick up the 2.0 
API, and there seem to be quite some changes already with the basic 
features. I'm already convinced they are for the better; more 'OO' 
thinking (less static methods) and better flexibility, along with less 
confusing naming conventions - that's my first impression. I bet there 
are tons of others, too.

Hope to stay with you here for a while and looking forward to see Lucene 
developing. Hatcher/Gospodnetic: The API change just gives me extra 
excitement in following your book and adopting to the changes!

Best regards,
