I do have other problems with PDFBox-0.6.4.  For one, it has annoying debug
information at very low level parsing process.  The other, I got infinite
loop while indexing pdf files although they say the infinite loop bug has
been fixed in their release notes.  Anybody knows what's going on?

Thanks,
Oliver

Yes, just add the log4j configuration.  The easiest way to do that is as a
system parameter like this

java -Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.xml org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML
-create -index c:\\index ..

Where log4j.xml is the path to your log4j config, PDFBox has an example
one you can use.
