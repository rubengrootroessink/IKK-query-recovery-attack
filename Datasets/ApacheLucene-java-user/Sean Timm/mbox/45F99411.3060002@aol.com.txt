SUBJECT: search timeout
DATE: 15 Mar 2007

Nutch recently added a search query timeout (NUTCH-308).  Are there any 
plans to add such functionality to the Lucene HitCollector directly?  Or 
is there some reason that this is a bad idea?

I'm using Solr which doesn't seem to support search timeouts.  It seems 
that it would make sense to add the feature at the Lucene level rather 
than implement the feature in each derivative.

Thanks,
Sean
