A wildcard query with 10 leading question marks, each of which requires a 
single character. This would also depend on leading wildcards being enabled 
in your query parser (if you are using one.)

first_name:??????????*

The performance would not necessarily be great, but functionally it would do 
exactly what you asked.

Subject: Performing a query on token length

Hello all,

Does anyone know if it is possible in Lucene to do a query based on the
string length of the value of a field?

For example, if I wanted all index matches where a specific field like
'first_name' was between 10 and 20 characters.

Thanks!
