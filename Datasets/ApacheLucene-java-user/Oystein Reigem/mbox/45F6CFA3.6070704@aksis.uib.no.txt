OK.

I guess there will be some details that need special attention. One case 
that springs to mind is the occurrence of words that in the original 
document are broken up by encoding, like "en<hyphen/>coding" or 
"<em>mid</em>range".

Do you know if tools (classes) for "appropriate" extraction from "my" 
file formats already exist in Lucene? I.e, something that not just 
extracts the text, but keeps track of its position in the original?

I saw POI <http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/> mentioned in a posting on 
this list. Perhaps a solution for Word documents can be based on POI.
