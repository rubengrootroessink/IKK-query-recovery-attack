SUBJECT: What about the index writing efficiency of large index ?
DATE: 6 Mar 2008

Hi All,
Does anyone do a benchmark to verify the index writing efficiency of lucene?
When the index size is larger than 10G, will it be much slower than smaller
ones ?

Actually i did some works about this issue,
and i found that, if build small index firstly then merge them all, the time
taken will significantly decline.

Hi Yonik,
How does Solr deal with this issue, does it just leave this problem to
lucene?


Thanks,

Eric
