SUBJECT: lucene sorting
DATE: 5 Apr 2006

Hi,
I need to change the lucene sorting to give just a bit more relevance to 
the recent documents (but i don't want to sort by date). I'd like to mix 
the lucene score with the date of the document.

I'm following the example in "Lucene in Action", chapter 6. I'm trying 
to extends the SortComparatorSource but I don't understand how to get 
the lucene score of the document.

Do you have some idea about how to solve my problem?
Or do you know where get some more example on custom sorting?

Thanks,
Gian Marco
