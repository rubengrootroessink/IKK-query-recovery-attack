SUBJECT: Store versus Index
DATE: 7 Nov 2008

I just need a little confirmation of my understanding here.

If i say that a field is to be stored, the entire thing is written to the
index.  It might also be indexed in a tokenized fasion if i also specify
that.

What are the advantages to storing a field then?
So you can search for that field?
Just so you can retrieve that field's value when you get a hit on the
document via another field?

Also along thes lines, if i don't "store" a field, can I still do my search
based upon that field?
