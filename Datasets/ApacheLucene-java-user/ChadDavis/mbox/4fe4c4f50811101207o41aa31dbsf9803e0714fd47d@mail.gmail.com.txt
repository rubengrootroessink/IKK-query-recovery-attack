The FAQ's have this index performance tip:

Use autoCommit=false when you open your IndexWriter

> In Lucene 2.3 there are substantial optimizations for Documents that use
> stored fields and term vectors, to save merging of these very large index
> files. You should see the best gains by using autoCommit=false for a single
> long-running session of IndexWriter. Note however that searchers will not
> see any of the changes flushed by this IndexWriter until it is closed; if
> that is important you should stick with autoCommit=true instead or
> periodically close and re-open the writer


But when I look at the API, there's no way to set autoCommit to false,
except via deprecated constrctors.

Is this tip deprecated?
