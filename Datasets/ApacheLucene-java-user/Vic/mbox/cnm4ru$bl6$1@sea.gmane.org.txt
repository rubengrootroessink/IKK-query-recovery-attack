SUBJECT: cache check?
DATE: 20 Nov 2004

Did somone write a cache of hits yet? Like they have for DAO.
For example I say Dao.search(XYZ);
It 1st checks the memory cache to see if this was just asked, on a cache 
miss it runs a search and puts in in cache.

If not, I will, it would take me a few weeks.
