SUBJECT: Lucene's Mean Average Precision
DATE: 4 May 2008


Hello all,

I have been doing some evaluation of Lucene on a TReC collection and get a
rather disappointing mean average precision (MAP) of 11%.  Other sources
seem to report a MAP of about 20%.

So I am here to ask all of you who have done some Lucene evaluation - what
did you find Lucene's MAP to be?  Did you do anything to special (e.g. query
expansion) to get it higher?

Thanks
Dana
