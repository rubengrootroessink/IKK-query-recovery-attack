SUBJECT: Extracting citation graph of ACM digital library and others DLs.
DATE: 16 May 2006

Hello everybody,

I have an question. It's not related to Lucene, I
know, but I post it here because many of you have
excellent knowledge in computer science and I hope
that you can help me. 

My question is how I can extract citation graph of ACM
digital library (or any important digital library in
computer science if you know). Given a citation graph
and the name of a predefined document, we can know
documents cited by this  predefined document and
documents that cite it. In my knowledge, ACM donot
provide API to access its bibliography database like
CiteSeer.

Thank you very much,
Trung.
