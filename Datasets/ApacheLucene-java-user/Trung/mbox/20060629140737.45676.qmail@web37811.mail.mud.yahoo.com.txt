SUBJECT: Test collection for digital libraries with Lucene
DATE: 29 Jun 2006

Hi everybody,

I'm searching a test collection for an academic
digital library (with relevant/judgement file like
TREC collections). Requirement:  documents are
scientific articles, with full references. 

I've heard about collection of INEX with scientific
articles from IEEE journals. Are there another
collections?

Thank you in advance,
Trung.
