Dear All, 
Thanks for your feedback.
I want to do research on how lucene performs compared to Latent Semantic analysis in terms
of recall and precision.
I welcome ideas on this,does anyone know a software tool using latent semantic analysis that
I could also download and try it?At the moment I am doing some simulation using Mathlab.
Thank you

David

Let's please don't forget the scoring function. Yes, *query* is
important,
however, everyone in IR knows that two different scoring functions may
return two different sets of results for the same query!

David, I think you have to be more explicit here. What exactly are you
trying to do? Are you gonna benchmark Lucene's performance between similar
queries (as Donna suggests) or between different frameworks. To use
metrics like precision and recall you need to do a test on the same
collection as well.
