SUBJECT: tfIdf weights
DATE: 1 Feb 2009

Hi,
Is it possible to retrieve the tfidf weights (or relative weight calculated
from any formula) instead of simple term frequencies through
getTermFreqVector()? I am more interested in knowing the relative weight of
each term in each field rather than just the frequency of terms.

Thank you very much
