Hi Andrej!

I'm taking a look to fuzzy signatures for near duplicate detection and 
and I have seen your TextProfileSignature. The question is: If I index 
the documents with their text signature, is there a way to filter near 
duplicates at search time without comparing each document with all other?

Thanks
Beto
