Hello together,


Who knows an easy, stable, already finished,  tool or an extension of
Lucene, where i can index XML-Files??

Unfortunately you canâ€²t download the tool from ISOGEN, it is  only a
demo-version.

It should also have a good documentation, it is for a beginner.

Could you please tell me any Tips/Recommendations????

Thank you very much

Gerhard
