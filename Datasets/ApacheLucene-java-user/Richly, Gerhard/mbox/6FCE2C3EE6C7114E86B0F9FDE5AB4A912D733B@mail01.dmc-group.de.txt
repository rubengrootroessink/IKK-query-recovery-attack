SUBJECT: Does this idea make sense???
DATE: 17 Oct 2002

Hello,

unfortunately iÂ´m not a professional, therefore i want to ask you for
advice.
i hope that is alright.

My company needs an application including database with the oppertunity of
full text search.
But they have no database with full text search.

So my idea is:

To save only the filenames in the database and the content of the Files in
XML-Files on the Filesystem. The XML-Files could i search then with Lucene,
the result is the Filename, which is saved in the Database. From this result
i can get all the related Data to this File.

What do you think?? Does this make sense?? Or is the performance not very
good???


Thank you very much for your help!!

Gerhard
