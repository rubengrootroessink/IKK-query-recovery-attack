DATE: 14 Dec 2006

Hi,
  I used the SAX api last year to parse and index the INEX 1.4 collection using Lucene (eventually
suceeded after many naive attempts). 
  Can you give me a sample of the XML you are trying to parse? 
  Email me and I should be able to send you some code which may help.
   
  regards,
  Malcolm Clark
