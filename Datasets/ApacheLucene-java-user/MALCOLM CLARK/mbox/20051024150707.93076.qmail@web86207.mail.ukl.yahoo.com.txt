Hi all,

I am relatively new and scared by Lucene so please don't flame me.I have abandoned Digester
and am now just using other SAX stuff.

I have used the sandbox stuff to parse an XML file with SAX which then bungs it into a document
in a Lucene index.The bit I'm stuck on is how is a elementBuffer split up into several items.I
have a elementBuffer with three 'article' documents but only shows as one when using Luke
to view the index? 

please advise.

Thanks very much.

MC
