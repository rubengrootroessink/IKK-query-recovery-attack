Hi thanks for your reply,

So when I delete a document the writer.close(); this actually commits the deletion to the
index which is not reversible?

I have a facility which deletes but leaves the delete 'undoable' until the change is commited
by closing the reader. I cannot access the doCommit or commit method as 'they are not visible'.

I have the LIA book at home and not with me.

Thanks.
