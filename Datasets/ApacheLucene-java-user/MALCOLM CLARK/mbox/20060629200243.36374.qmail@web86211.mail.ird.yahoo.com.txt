hi, all,
  I wrote my own html parser because it just meets my require and do not
depend on 3rd part's lib. and i'd like to share it (in attachment).

  This class provides some static methods to do html <-> text convertion:

  HtmlUtil.html2text(String html);
  HtmlUtil.text2html(String text);

and 
  HtmlUtil.removeScriptTags(String html);
can remove script and activex tags in html, this is use to check user's blog
post before writing into database.

Best regards,
  Xuefeng
