SUBJECT: Redefine the wildcards
DATE: 26 Sep 2003

Hello
I use lucene to index a big database (3 millions of articles).
When i search the ref number 1423* all is fine but when i search the 142* i have a java.lang.outofmemory.
I've read here that it is because a too big number of possibilities (for exemple 1420000001,
142000000A etc) and not because of too much hits.
So i wonder if it possible to redefine the wildcards in lucene to make them replace only numbers
and not caracters .

Thanks for your advices and excuse me for my poor english
