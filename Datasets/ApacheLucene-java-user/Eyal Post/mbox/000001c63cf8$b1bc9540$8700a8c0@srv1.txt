SUBJECT: Adding line count to a document
DATE: 1 Mar 2006

I'd like to add a line count field to my indexed document. The obvious way
is to read my file twice, once to tokenize it and add it's content to a
field in the document and once to count the number of lines in it and add it
to another field. 
Any idea how can I optimize this and read the file once? 

Regards,
Eyal
