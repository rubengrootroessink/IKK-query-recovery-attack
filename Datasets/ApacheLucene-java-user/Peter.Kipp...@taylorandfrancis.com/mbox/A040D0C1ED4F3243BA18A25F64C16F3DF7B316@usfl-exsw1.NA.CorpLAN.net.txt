SUBJECT: maximum string length in index field
DATE: 31 Jan 2006

I have some really long chemical names that I am storing in an index and
it looks like they are being split into two terms.  Is there a way to
increase the max term length?

Here is an example:

DTryptophanmethylLleucineethylLhprolinamidedeglycinamideluteinizing&nbsp
;hormonereleasing&nbsp;factor&nbsp;pig679010NN!#6-<h3>D<h0>-Tryptophan-7
-(<h1>N<h0>-methyl-<h3>L<h0>-leucine)-9-(<h1>N<h0>-ethyl-<h3>L<h0>-proli
namide)-10-deglycinamide-luteinizing&nbsp;hormone-releasing&nbsp;factor&
nbsp;(pig)
length of name: 298
Number of docs in index: 1

sort_name:DTryptophanmethylLleucineethylLhprolinamidedeglycinamidelutein
izing&nbsp;hormonereleasing&nbsp;factor&nbsp;pig679010NN!#6-<h3>D<h0>-Tr
yptophan-7-(<h1>N<h0>-methyl-<h3>L<h0>-leucine)-9-(<h1>N<h0>-ethyl-<h3>L
<h0>-prolinamide)-10-deglycinamide-luteinizing&nb   freq: 1

sort_name:sp;hormone-releasing&nbsp;factor&nbsp;(pig)   freq: 1

Total terms: 2   Total Occuracnes:2

I only put one name in the index using whitespace analyzer and making
sure there are no whitespaces.  However there are two terms in the
index.

Thanks,
Peter
