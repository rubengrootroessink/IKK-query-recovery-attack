Or, it could be because you have to set a higher value on maxFieldLength in
the IndexWriter you use.

>From the javadoc (IndexWriter):

"public int maxFieldLength

The maximum number of terms that will be indexed for a single field in a
document. This limits the amount of memory required for indexing, so that
collections with very large files will not crash the indexing process by
running out of memory. 

By default, no more than 10,000 terms will be indexed for a field."

 hi,
i have a big problem, i don't know if it is a BUG or my fault.
The problem is that indexing document bigger than 50/60 KB does
an error, they are not properly indexed.
In other words i tried to add a document of 100K and one of 1 MB,
in both files i add near the end a word "korfut", my nickname, and
when i run the search i don't get any results.
I get no errors when indexing.
My document class is almost the same as the default FileDocument.java.
Can someone tell me what's going on?
Can someone do the same test i did just to make sure?

thank you.
