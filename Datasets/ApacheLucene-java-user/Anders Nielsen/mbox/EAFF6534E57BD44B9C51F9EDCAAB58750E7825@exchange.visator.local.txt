Wouldn't that make it hard to search for phrases?

One option that hasn't been said is to code a custom filter that 
spits out a case-preserved token and a lower-cased token --per word.  
The common case is to return just one token since most words are all 
lower case anyway.  This option is better than the other ideas I've 
heard here so far because the size of the index would be smaller than 
the dual-index and dual-field strategies suggested.
