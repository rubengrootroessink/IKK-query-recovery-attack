Only use LUCENE_CURRENT if you do not care about backwards compatibility at
all: e.g. you are perfectly happy re-indexing all data when you upgrade the
lucene jar file in future.

its not about relying on quirks in previous versions of lucene, its about
being compatible with changes in future versions, you set it to LUCENE_30 or
whatever so that you can upgrade to 3.1 jar, without reindexing.
