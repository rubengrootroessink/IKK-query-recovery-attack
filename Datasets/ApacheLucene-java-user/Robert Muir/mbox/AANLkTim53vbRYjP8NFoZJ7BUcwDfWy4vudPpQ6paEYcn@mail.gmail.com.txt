  We are also setting autoGeneratePhraseQueries to false so that CJK and other languages
that don't use space to separate words won't get tokenized properly by the ICUTokenizer and
then the tokens automatically searched as a phrase.

bigrams?

Hi Tom, Let's open JIRA issue for this, we can add it.
The gist of it, is that ICUTokenizer sets a ScriptAttribute (an
integer) per token indicating its writing system.
So its easy to make an efficient filter that basically only "shingles"
on this attribute.

The reason there isnt one, is because I'd really like for us to
eventually somehow solve this with
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2470

But for now, i think it would be good to be practical and add the
explicit filter (we can just mark the api experimental, hoping we will
make it more general with 2470) so people can easily get good out of
box performance in situations like yours.
