Hi, can you provide some more details on these index size numbers?
* which one is PforDelta versus Pfor? We have 2 PFOR-delta impls,
PatchedFrameOfRef and PatchedFrameOfRef2, that are slightly
different... I'm pretty curious about the huge size differential
between the two though (e.g. 1.6GB versus 3.1GB, can you give more
info/breakdown of file sizes?
* are you using a stopfilter at index time or are you indexing all
terms including stopwords?
