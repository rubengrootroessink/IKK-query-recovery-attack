July 2011, Apache Luceneâ„¢ 3.3 available
The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 3.3.

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly
any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and
improvements, some of which are highlighted below.  The release
is available for immediate download at:
   http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java (see note below).

See the CHANGES.txt file included with the release for a full list of details.

Lucene 3.3 Release Highlights:

 * The spellchecker module now includes suggest/auto-complete functionality,
   with three implementations: Jaspell, Ternary Trie, and Finite State.

 * Support for merging results from multiple shards, for both "normal"
   search results (TopDocs.merge) as well as grouped results using the
   grouping module (SearchGroup.merge, TopGroups.merge).

 * An optimized implementation of KStem, a less aggressive stemmer
   for English.

 * Single-pass grouping implementation based on block document indexing.

 * Improvements to MMapDirectory (now also the default implementation
   returned by FSDirectory.open on 64-bit Linux).

 * NRTManager simplifies handling near-real-time search with multiple
   search threads, allowing the application to control which indexing
   changes must be visible to which search requests.

 * TwoPhaseCommitTool facilitates performing a multi-resource
   two-phased commit, including IndexWriter.

 * The default merge policy, TieredMergePolicy, has a new method
   (set/getReclaimDeletesWeight) to control how aggressively it
   targets segments with deletions, and is now more aggressive than
   before by default.

 * PKIndexSplitter tool splits an index by a mid-point term.

Note: The Apache Software Foundation uses an extensive mirroring network for
distributing releases.  It is possible that the mirror you are using may not
have replicated the release yet.  If that is the case, please try another
mirror.  This also goes for Maven access.

Thanks,
Apache Lucene Developers
