In current versions of lucene it is documented to be slow: "Warning: this
query is not very scalable with its default prefix length of 0 - in this
case, *every* term will be enumerated and cause an edit score calculation."

If you want it to be faster, use lucene trunk, which uses a different, more
sophisticated algorithm:
