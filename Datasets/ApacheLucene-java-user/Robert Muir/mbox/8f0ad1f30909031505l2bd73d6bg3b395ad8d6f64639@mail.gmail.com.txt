SUBJECT: Re: Can this regex be done?
DATE: 3 Sep 2009

just a side note, LUCENE-1606 is intended to address exactly the
performance issue that you described.

rather than depending upon constant prefix or enumerating terms, it
can efficiently skip through the term dictionary.

the downside is that this behavior depends upon the ability to compile
a regular expression into a DFA.
some regex features (such as capturing groups/backreferences) need NFA
representation, though it does not support those.
