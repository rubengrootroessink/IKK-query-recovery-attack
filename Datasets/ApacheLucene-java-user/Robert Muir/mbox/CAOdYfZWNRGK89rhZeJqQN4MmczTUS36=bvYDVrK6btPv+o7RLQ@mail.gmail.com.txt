so the IndexReader should be closed, too, right?). I have changed indexes, restarted Eclipse,
and run GC to no effect. I am thinking FieldCache.purge might help, but how do i get there?

pretty long, yet cached queries are fast. Overlap seems to benefit queries down the line,
e.g. "*ration" is much faster if sometime before "*ation" has been run. Would it be feasible
to warm an index with the most frequent ngrams for AutomatonQueries?

This is probably just your OS caching? this query has no caching.
