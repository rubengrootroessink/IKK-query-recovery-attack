just to clarify, GreekLowerCaseFilter really shouldn't exist either. The
final sigma problem it has (where there are two lowercase forms depending
upon position in word), this is also solved with unicode case folding or
collation. This is a perfect example of how lowercase is the wrong operation
for search.

and RussianLowerCaseFilter is deprecated now, it does the exact same thing
as LowerCaseFilter.
