should be no problem there, it always uses filter rewrite?
the problem is when you are doing boolean multitermrewrite... in how
the query is rewritten and combined from its sub-searchers.

in otherwords, you can also do this to workaround the issue:
qp.setMultiTermRewriteMethod(MultiTermQuery.CONSTANT_SCORE_FILTER_REWRITE);
