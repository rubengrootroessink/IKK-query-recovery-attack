ok, I will followup... what version of lucene are you using, 2.9?

no, theres no language involved... why would you not simply apply the
filter all the time.
if i am looking at Ｔ (fullwidth character T), it should indexed as T
everytime (or later probably t if you are going to apply
lowercasefilter)

this is ok, because normalization, if you want to do it that way, is
definitely not language dependent!
its not like collation, where you have a locale 'parameter', its a
language-independent process.

you are right, for you there are a couple issues.
first, i do not know what standardtokenizer does with
geresh/gershayim, forget about single quote/double quote.

but to fix the tokenization (gershayim example), you want to ensure
you do not split on these.
since this is used in hebrew acronym, i would modify the acronym rule to allow

[hebrew letter]+ (" | ״) [hebrew letter]+

next, if you want these to be indexed the same so that ארה"ב and ארה״ב
will match, you will need to create a tokenfilter
to standardize " to ״ for acronyms.

yes, you have a queryparser parsing ambiguity because " is also the
phrase operator.
I don't know what to recommend here off the top of my head... do you
allow phrase queries?

also as an fyi, when i say according to unicode they should be using
gershayim instead of double-quote, this is a little theoretical.
its not very user-friendly to expect users to use gershayim for input,
when its not even on hebrew keyboard layout...!
