SUBJECT: Re: LowerCaseFilter fails one letter (I) of Turkish alphabet
DATE: 1 Dec 2009

Hi Ahmet,

After thinking about what Shai brought up, I changed my mind and think it is
not good enough that we only have Collation as a way to solve this.
Because you might want turkish stemming too, and right now there is no way
for the included snowball turkish stemmer to work.
I really do not like this.

So as much as I want to reduce clutter and not have lots of filters that can
be solved in a general way with unicode, I think this is one case
where the best solution for now would be to have a turkish-specific
lowercasefilter...

I don't think we have to use String for this either, we can just apply rules
to the two uppercase I's, and lowercase everything else.

Will you open an issue?
