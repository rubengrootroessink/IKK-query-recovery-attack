right, but the problem is when something is currently ranked as doc 20 but
should be in the top 1, 5, or 10, and you aren't seeing it.

so I think if you are judging top-N docs from an existing system, you should
look a little farther ahead than the top-N you care about.
I think you should also index your data a few different ways and judge those
top-N too, for example, use n-gram tokenizer.

It doesn't have to be crazy like a formal trec-like pooling process, but I
think you need to introduce enough variation that you have judgements for
docs that should be ranked higher than they currently are.
