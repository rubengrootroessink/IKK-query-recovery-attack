Personally I use the generated submission.txt, and run it thru
trec_eval to get all numbers.

by default, trec_eval will dump ircl_prn.xxxx values, and you could
plug them in openoffice.
I prefer to use trec_eval as the results from the benchmark summary
often differ with trec_eval.

it would be great if somehow this process could be improved by default.

Nicola Ferro mentioned on the list once that for the CLEF work, they
have written a JNI wrapper around trec_eval to access all its
computations, this might be one thing we could consider, then we could
access the correct calculations and produce fancy output.
