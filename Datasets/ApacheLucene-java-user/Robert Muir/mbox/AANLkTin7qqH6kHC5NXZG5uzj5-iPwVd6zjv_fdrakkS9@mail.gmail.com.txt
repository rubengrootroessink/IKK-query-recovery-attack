its working correctly, your chinese wildcard query doesnt make sense, as you
havent indexed the text in a way to do queries like that (you have indexed
individual chars).
in practice this is where you would do a chinese phrase query of "在电力虎"
(with quotes) instead of *... but if you use the positionfilterhack, you
cant do phrase queries.
