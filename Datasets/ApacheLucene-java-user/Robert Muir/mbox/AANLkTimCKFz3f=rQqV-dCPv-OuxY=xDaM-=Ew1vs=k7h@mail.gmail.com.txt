Hi, the way you set this up is to use SimilarityProvider to configure
Similarities per-field: for example maybe field A, B, and C use
Similarity1 and field D use Similarity2.
So you just set your SimilarityProvider on the IndexWriter and
IndexSearcher, and it must implement this factory method:

  Similarity get(String field)

Here are the reasons for this factory design (versus simply adding
field to every method):
1. performance: up-front we ask the SimilarityProvider for the
per-field Similarity. So you probably use a hashmap or something here
to return the correct one. If you had to do this on every single call
to tf(), this would slow down queries significantly.
2. flexibility: we are working to generalize Similarity, and maybe the
existing stuff you see becomes TFIDFSimilarity. So in the future you
might have field1 that uses TFIDF and field2 that uses something else
(e.g. BM25), with a totally different API and scoring system.
