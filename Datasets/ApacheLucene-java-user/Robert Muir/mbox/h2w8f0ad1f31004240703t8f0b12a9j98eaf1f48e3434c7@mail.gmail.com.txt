Rest assured we are working on this... but it unfortunately won't happen
overnight. First of all, the development of Lucene and Solr was merged such
that there is now one team working on this stuff. This way, both Solr and
Lucene developers can maintain this stuff.

There is now the practical issue to combine all Lucene and Solr analyzers
(not just the two components listed on that issue) into one package that can
then be used by both Lucene and Solr users:
