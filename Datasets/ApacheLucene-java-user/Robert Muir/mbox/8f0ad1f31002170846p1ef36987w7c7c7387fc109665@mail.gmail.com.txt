I tend to agree with you Marvin, you are right, the different scoring
mechanisms need different information available and this is the problem.

although last I checked, one hard part of BM25 rotates around fields versus
documents... e.g. BM25's IDF calculation.

but maybe this is just an extreme form of your example :)
