yet another thing to look into that might improve things a bit is using
ShingleFilter in contrib.

this way cheese sandwich would form a shingle of "cheese sandwich" and would
get a higher score for the "Toasted Cheese Sandwich" document.

it wouldn't solve the proximity problem in general, but maybe it would help,
depending on your requirements.
