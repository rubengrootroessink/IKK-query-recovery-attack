Valery, I think it all depends on how you want your search to work.

when I say this, I mean for example: if a document only contains "C++"
do you want searches on just "C" to match or not?

another thing I would suggest is to take a look at the capabilities of
Solr: it has some analysis stuff that might be beneficial for your
needs.
wiki page is here: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters
