Hi,

(Since this is an issue you brought up on the Compass forums)

I wonder what stage you are in the development process?
Have you considered SolR, or does compass provide some other
functionality that you need?

The reason I say this, is because the easiest solution might be to use
a nightly SolR for your application.

I'm not personally biased one way or the other for any particular
framework, but recently there has been some improvements added to SolR
so that the default type 'text' is pretty good for multilingual
processing.

In fact I hope in the future it will be improved in lucene so that
your decision is really based upon other application needs...
