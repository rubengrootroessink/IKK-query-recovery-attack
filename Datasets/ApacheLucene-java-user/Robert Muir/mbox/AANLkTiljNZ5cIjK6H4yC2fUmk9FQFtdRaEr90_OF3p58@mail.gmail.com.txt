you can make your own analyzer, or do something like the below at
query-time.

QueryParser queryParser = new QueryParser(Version.LUCENE_30, "myfieldname" ,
new PositionHackAnalyzerWrapper(new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_30)));

public class PositionHackAnalyzerWrapper extends Analyzer {
  Analyzer wrapped;

  public PositionHackAnalyzerWrapper(Analyzer wrapped) {
    this.wrapped = wrapped;
  }

  @Override
  public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
    TokenStream ts = wrapped.tokenStream(fieldName, reader);
    return new PositionFilter(ts);
  }
}
