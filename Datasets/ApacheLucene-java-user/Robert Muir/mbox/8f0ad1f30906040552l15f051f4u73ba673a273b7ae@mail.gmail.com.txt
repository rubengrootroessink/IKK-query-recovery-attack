SUBJECT: Re: How to support stemming and case folding for english content	mixed with non-english content?

uwe what KK needs here is 'proper unicode handling'.

since the latest WordDelimiterFilter has pretty good handling of unicode
categories, combining this with WhiteSpaceTokenizer effectively gives you a
pretty good solution for unicode tokenization.

KK doesn't need detection of anything, the porter stem filter will simply
leave the indic text alone... so it will just work.
