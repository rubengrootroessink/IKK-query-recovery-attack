this is just what i would do.

the only reason this would not work, is if we broke backwards
compatibility in lucene itself.
When we do this, its always at the top of the CHANGES.txt... I don't
think we did this since 3.1 with anything analysis related.

But if you want to be super-careful! I would do this:

take your specific revision of contrib/icu and plop it in a lucene 3.3 checkout.
then run all its tests, and use that, so its recompiled and tested
against lucene-3.3's core.

I definitely would not reindex though!
