DATE: 21 May 2009

its definitely an area in lucene that could use some improvement.

my recommendation for multilingual text is to apply the unicode "default"
algorithms:

Tokenize text according to UAX #29: unicode text segmentation
Apply full case-folding (unicode ch. 3.13) with FC_NFKC closure
Apply UAX #15: unicode normalization

for now you will have to write code to do this, but i'm looking forward to
contributing my implementation soon.

i definitely feel your pain.
