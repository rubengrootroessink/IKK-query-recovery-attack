SUBJECT: Re: How to query/search unicoded docs in lucene using unicode text as	query?
DATE: 21 May 2009

hello, your example (hindi), is probably suffering from a number of search
issues:

i dont recommend standardanalyzer as for this example, it will break words
around dependent the vowels and nukta dot, etc.
whitespaceanalyzer might be a good start.

also, is it possible to apply unicode normalization to your text before
indexing it?
normalization will standardize things in indian languages.

in your example, the pha + nukda dot you queries on is the normalized form,
but i wonder if in your text its encoded as fa (u095E)
if you apply normalization mode NFC it will standardize to pha + nukda dot.
