well its hard to tell what you are supplying as topics and qrels.
have a look at /src/lia/benchmark in the LIA2 sample code: it has an
example topic and 3 rows in qrels for it.

basically, the topicsFile contains the "queries", and the qrelsFile
contains judgements as to which documents are relevant.

P.S.: once you have an index, a topics, and a qrels file, you can just
use org.apache.lucene.benchmark.quality.trec.QueryDriver (it has a
main method)
