in addition to what Grant said, even if your documents are similar, what
about queries?

For example, if only a few trec queries contain proper names, acronyms,
abbreviations, or whatever, but your users frequently input things like
this, it won't be representative.

i will disagree with him on a few things though, I would rather have less
queries (25 or so), but more judgements, definitely a lot more than 10.
Maybe your users only care about the top-10 results but its crucial to judge
some lower-ranking docs too, especially if you have recall problems...
