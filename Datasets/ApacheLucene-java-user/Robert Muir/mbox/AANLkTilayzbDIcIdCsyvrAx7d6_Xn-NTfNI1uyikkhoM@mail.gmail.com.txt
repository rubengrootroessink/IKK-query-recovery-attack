its really just a bad situation for chinese :(

with queryparser, you either get no phrase query support (by using the
hack), or all queries automatically become phrase queries.

if you want to do the equivalent of *在电力虎*, then you need to use queryparser
without the hack, just do a query of "在电力虎" (with quotes).
if you want to do the equivalent of 在 电 力 虎, then you need to use
queryparser with the hack, just do a query of 在电力虎 (without quotes).
