June 2011, Apache Luceneâ„¢ 3.2 available
The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 3.2.

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly
any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and
improvements, some of which are highlighted below.  The release
is available for immediate download at:
   http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java (see note below).

See the CHANGES.txt file included with the release for a full list of details.

Lucene 3.2 Release Highlights

 * A new grouping module, under lucene/contrib/grouping, enables
   search results to be grouped by a single-valued indexed field.

 * A new IndexUpgrader tool fully converts an old index to the
   current format.

 * A new Directory implementation, NRTCachingDirectory, caches small
   segments in RAM, to reduce the I/O load for applications with fast
   NRT reopen rates.

 * A new Collector implementation, CachingCollector, is able to
   gather search hits (document IDs and optionally also scores) and
   then replay them.  This is useful for Collectors that require two
   or more passes to produce results.

 * Index a document block using IndexWriter's new addDocuments or
   updateDocuments methods.  These experimental APIs ensure that the
   block of documents will forever remain contiguous in the index,
   enabling interesting future features like grouping and joins.

 * A new default merge policy, TieredMergePolicy, which is more
   efficient due to being able to merge non-contiguous segments.
   See http://s.apache.org/merging for details.

 * NumericField is now returned correctly when you load a stored
   document (previously you received a normal Field back, with the
   numeric value converted string).

 * Deleted terms are now applied during flushing to the newly flushed
   segment, which is more efficient than having to later initialize a
   reader for that segment.

Note: The Apache Software Foundation uses an extensive mirroring network for
distributing releases.  It is possible that the mirror you are using may not
have replicated the release yet.  If that is the case, please try another
mirror.  This also goes for Maven access.

Thanks,
Apache Lucene Developers
