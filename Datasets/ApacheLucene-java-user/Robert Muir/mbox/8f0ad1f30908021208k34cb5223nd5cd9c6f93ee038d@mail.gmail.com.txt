Walid, I'm not sure this is true. Many plurals are supported
(certainly not exceptional cases or broken plurals).
This is no different than the other language analyzers in lucene, even
english stemmers: the most common forms are grouped together and thats
about all you can say :)

maybe in the future we can improve it though for your particular
concern, add simple dictionary mappings for at least the most common
broken plurals, something like that.
