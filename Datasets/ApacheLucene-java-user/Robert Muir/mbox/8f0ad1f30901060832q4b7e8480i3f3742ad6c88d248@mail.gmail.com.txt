SUBJECT: Re: FastSSFuzzy for faster fuzzy queries in Lucene
DATE: 6 Jan 2009

hi,
yes, the results that come back from the lucene index i verify at runtime
before expanding the query. i considered trying to store delete positions as
payloads or something but fastssWC is good enough for me.

i'll see about posting my code today.
