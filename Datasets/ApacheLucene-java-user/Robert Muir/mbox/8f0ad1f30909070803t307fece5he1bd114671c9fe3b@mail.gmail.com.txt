I will update LUCENE-1488 with the latest code so you can steal the
ICUTransformFilter from there.

yes, fullwidth latin forms are distinct characters that have a different width:
http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:East_Asian_Width=Fullwidth:]

so yes, you can use charfilter to map these to their standard latin forms.

beware though, there is a similar issue with halfwidth characters:
http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:East_Asian_Width=Halfwidth:]
example, ﾅ is halfwidth for the standard ナ
so you might want to include mappings for those as well.

the reason i brought up normalization is because this issue (width) is
a subset of things normalization can help with.
if you click on some of the characters in the two sets i provided you
will notice properties like 'toNFKC' containing the 'standardized'
form.

if in the future, you run into trouble with things in other languages
that aren't matching as expected,
because they aren't being considered the "same" when perhaps they
should, then a more general approach would be applying Unicode
normalization form NFKC in a TokenFilter.
