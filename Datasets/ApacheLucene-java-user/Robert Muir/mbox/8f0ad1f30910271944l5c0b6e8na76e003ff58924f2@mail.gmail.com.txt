SUBJECT: Re: Split single string into several fields?
DATE: 28 Oct 2009

Will, I think this parsing of documents into different fields, is separate
and unrelated from lucene's analysis (tokenization)...
the analysis comes to play once you have a field, and you want to break the
text into indexable units (words, or entire field as token like your urls).

i wouldn't suggest make a big complicated analyzer that tries to parse html
in addition to breaking text into words, I would keep parsing and analysis
separate.
then i would handle different fields with different analyzers, i think Erick
already mentioned PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper, its useful for this.

if there is some performance consideration... it seems you are worried about
this wrt parsing, not actual analysis.... then maybe use the sax api?
