if you can't find a wordlist of correctly-spelled words somewhere
else, you can always try
http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries, grab the
openoffice spellchecker dictionary for that language, and use the
hunspell "unmunch" command (sort of like morphological generation) to
generate a list of words you could then use with PlainTextDictionary.

in this case i would also investigate the openoffice thesaurus data,
if you cant find anything else.
