SUBJECT: Re: LowerCaseFilter fails one letter (I) of Turkish alphabet
DATE: 30 Nov 2009

Hello, there is already an issue of this.

The basics are that lowercase with locale is still not even right. because,
its intended for presentation (display), not for case folding.

the problem is case folding is not exposed in the JDK, and you have to use
the alternate "turkish/azeri" mappings anyway

an even better way to solve this issue, which solves more than just case
distinction, is to simply use contrib/collation.
in the javadocs, there is a specific example of how to solve this turkish
issue this way.
this is now available in solr trunk also, and there's a test for this
specific issue there, too.
