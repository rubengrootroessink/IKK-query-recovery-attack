I recommend you use addAttribute instead. Its buggy to use
getAttribute in this way because you cannot rely upon the fact that a
previous tokenstream has added the attribute[1]. I think your code was
only working before because of TokenWrapperAttributeFactory (the
backwards compatibility layer in 2.9 for the old Token API) being
present.
