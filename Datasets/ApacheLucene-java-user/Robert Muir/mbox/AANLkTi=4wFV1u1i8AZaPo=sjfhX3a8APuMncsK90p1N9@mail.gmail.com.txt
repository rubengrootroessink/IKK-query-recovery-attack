Have a look at contrib/benchmark under the
org.apache.lucene.benchmark.quality package.
There is code (for example
org.apache.lucene.benchmark.quality.trec.QueryDriver) that can run an
experiment and output what you need for trec_eval.exe
I think there is some additional documentation on how to use this in
Lucene in Action 2.
