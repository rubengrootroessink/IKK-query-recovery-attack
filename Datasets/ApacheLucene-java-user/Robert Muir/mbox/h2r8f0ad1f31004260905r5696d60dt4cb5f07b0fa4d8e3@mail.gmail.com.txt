Not really, in general its a little bit more organized in lucene trunk
though. Analyzers and snowball were merged, and analyzers are just organized
by language... (if they use snowball its an implementation detail).

You can see this here:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/trunk/lucene/contrib/analyzers/common/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/

Shai Erera mentioned a while ago the idea of having a method to get the most
suitable analyzer for a given Locale... this is similar to your idea of a
map, but would give some more flexibility...
