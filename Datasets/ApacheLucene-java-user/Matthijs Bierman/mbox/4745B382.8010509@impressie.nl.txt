Hi

Simply create your own analyzer with JavaCC. See the repository for the 
latest StandardAnalyzer.jj file, make sure the Analyzer accepts anything 
with a hypen as a single token.
And try not to yell, please. Most of the questions are urgent, there is 
no need for emphasis - especially in this manner.

Good luck,
Matthijs
