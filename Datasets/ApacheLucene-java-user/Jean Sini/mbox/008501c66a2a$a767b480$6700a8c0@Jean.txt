SUBJECT: Efficiently paginating results.
DATE: 27 Apr 2006

Hi,

Our application presents search results in a paginated form.

We were unable to find Searcher methods that would return, say, 'n'
(typically, 10) hits after a start offset 'k'.

So we're currently using the Hits collection returned by Searcher.search,
and using its Hits.doc(i) method to get the ith hit, with i between k and
k+n. Is that the most efficient way to do that? Is there a better way (e.g.
some form of Filter on the query itself)? 

Thanks,

Jean
