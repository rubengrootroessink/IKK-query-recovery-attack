Thank  you for the reply, As you said

Sure, just iterate over the first 100 entries in your Hits object

It means before Iteration Lucene has already spent time and memory in 
finding all the 50k documents and sorting them, then i will retrieve 100 
documents. Hence it is costing me a search for 50k documents + sorting of 
these 50k matching documents + retrieval of first 100 documents.. Right?

But what i want is the way, to get the same result as per the above 
process but with not costing me to search and sort all 50K matching 
documents. is this possible?

Many Thx!

Sure, just iterate over the first 100 entries in your Hits object
(or topdocs).

If you're asking how to ignore 49,900 of your documents (that
is, not even consider them at all), you're asking the impossible
because you can't know whether to ignore those other docs
unless you sort them first.

If you're asking if you can get the 100 most relevant docs and
then sort only those, then you should look at FieldSortedHitQueue.
What you'd do is feed the top 100 documents into an instance
of FieldSortedHit queue then read traverse the queue.

If none of this applies, could you explain in a bit more detail?

Best
Erick
