Hi,

I need first 100 documents in a sorted order lets say sorted on the 
document id and there are more then 50K documents in the index. My search 
query is matching all those 50K documents. Is there any way to get only 
first 100 documents that too in a sorted order of document id. I mean 
Lucene will only give out those 100 documents?

Many Thx!
