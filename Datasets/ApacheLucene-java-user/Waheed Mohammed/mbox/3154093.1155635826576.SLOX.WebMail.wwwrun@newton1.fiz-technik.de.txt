SUBJECT: Re: Handling OR, NOT, AND operators in search query
DATE: 15 Aug 2006

you are propbably lower casing your queryString before being given to QueryParser.

String queryString = queryString.toLowerCase();
Query query = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(queryString, ....);

make sure that your queryString has operators in upperCase before being given to QueryParser
