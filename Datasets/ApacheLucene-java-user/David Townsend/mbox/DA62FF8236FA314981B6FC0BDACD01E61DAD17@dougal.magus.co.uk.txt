There is no problem with updating and searching simultaneously.  Two threads updating simultaneously
on the same index on NFS can be a problem, as the locking does not work reliably.  Have a
look through the archives for NFS, there are some solutions scattered about.

Hi,all,

Can we do search and update one index simultaneously?Is someone know sth
about it? I had done some experiments.Now the search will be blocked
when the index is being updated.The error in search node is like this:
    caught a class java.io.IOException
    with message:Stale NFS file handle

Thanks

Xuemei Li
