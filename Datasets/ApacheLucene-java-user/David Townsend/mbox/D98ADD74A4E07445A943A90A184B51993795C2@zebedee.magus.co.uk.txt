DATE: 6 Jan 2005

Sorry if this is the wrong forum but I wondered what's happened to 'Lucene In Action' in the
UK.  Looking forward to reading it but amazon.co.uk report it as a 'hard to find' item and
are now quoting a 4-6 week delivery time and  tacking on a rare book charge.  Amazon.com are
quoting shipping in 24hrs.  Is this a new 'Boston Tea Party'? 

cheers

David
