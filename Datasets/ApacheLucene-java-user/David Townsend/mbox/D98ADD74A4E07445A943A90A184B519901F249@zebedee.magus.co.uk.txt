Hi Santosh,

Lucene doesn't search pdfs per se.  To make anything searchable you have to first extract
the content and then put it in lucene in a form it understands (i.e document objects).  So
in order to search your pdfs you first need to extract the info from the PDFs using something
like PDFBox.  So your battleplan should be forget lucene for a while, get the raw data out
of all the items you want to search. Then look at the lucene articles about creating simple
searchable indices.
