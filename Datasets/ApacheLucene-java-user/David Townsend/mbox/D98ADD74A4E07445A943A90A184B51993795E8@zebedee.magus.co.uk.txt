Just read your old post. I'm not quite sure whether I've read this correctly.  Is the search
worker thread also doing deletes from the index 

"a test script is going that is hitting the search
part of our application (I think the script also updates and deletes
Documents, but I am not sure."

Deleting also locks the index, so maybe the indexwriter is waiting for the search thread to
release the lock.

The problem could be you're writing to an index with multiple processes. This can happen if
you're using a shared file system (NFS?).  We saw this problem when we had two IndexWriters
getting access to a single index at the same time.  Usually if you're working on a single
machine the file locks prevent this from happening.

I didn't get any response to this post so I wanted to follow up (you can
read the full description of my problem in the archives:
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=11986).

Here's an additional piece of information: 

I wrote a small program to confirm that on Windows, you can't rename a
file while another thread has it open.

If I am performing a search, is it possible that the IndexReader is
holding open the "segments" file when there is an attempt by my indexing
code to overwrite it with File.renameTo()?

Thanks,
Luke Francl
