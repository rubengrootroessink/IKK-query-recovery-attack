SUBJECT: DateField vs DateTools
DATE: 6 Apr 2006

Hi
   
  We are in the process of upgrading Lucene from 1.2 to 1.9.
   
  There used to be 2 methods in DateField.java in 1.2 
   
    public static String MIN_DATE_STRING() 
    public static String MAX_DATE_STRING() 
   
  This basically gave the minimum and the maximum dates we could index using Lucene. We used
these dates for building DateFilters.
   
  Also if we got a date before 1970 to index, we would get an exception as  "Time too early"
and if we got a date after the MAX_DATE_STRING, which kind of boiled down to some time in
Apr 5188 or so... we would get an exception as "time too late". We used this functionality
also.
   
  I have not drilled down into the implementation details too much, but what was the reason
for getting rid of these methods in Lucene 1.9?
  
Is it still possible for us to get similar functionality in Lucene 1.9. If so, can anyone
help us with this.
   
  Thank you
