SUBJECT: how to get all terms as search results (or "*" equivalent)
DATE: 28 Jun 2004

Since it is not allowed to use "*" or "?" symbols as the first character
of a search, I tried the following query as an alternative:
"Field_1: ([a* TO z*] OR [A* TO Z*] OR [0* TO 9*])"
but the QueryParser complains saying:
"org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses".
 
Any idea why this approach does not work and how to get all terms in an
index when doing search ?
 
 
Thanks,
Polina
