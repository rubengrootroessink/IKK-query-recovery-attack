DATE: 16 Sep 2004

Hi Daniel,

I just downloaded the latest version of Lucene and tried the whole thing
again: I ran my code first with lucene-1.3-final.jar, getting the query
Field:(A AND -(B)) parsed into +Field:A -Field:B, and then I ran exactly
the same code with lucene-1.4.1.jar and got the output parsed into
Field:A Field:- Field:B.

I also read Lucene's documentation (http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*
checkout*/jakarta-lucene/CHANGES.txt?rev=1.85), and it does mention a
change to the "+" and "-" operators:

    13. Changed QueryParser.jj to allow '-' and '+' within tokens:

    (Morus Walter via Otis)


So is this behaviour a bug, or Lucene1.4 is not backwards compatible?

I can't remember any changes in this area, but I just tried with the 
current version from CVS and the output is the one which you want.
