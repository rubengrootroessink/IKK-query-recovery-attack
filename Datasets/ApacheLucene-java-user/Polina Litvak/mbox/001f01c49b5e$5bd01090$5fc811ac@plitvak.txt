SUBJECT: QueryParser.parse() and Lucene1.4.1
DATE: 15 Sep 2004

I have a question regarding QueryParser and lucene-1.4.1.jar:
 
When using lucene-1.3-final.jar, a query of the form: Field:(A AND -(B))
was parsed into +Field:A -Field:B (using QueryParser.parse()). 
After making the switch to lucene-1.4.1.jar, the same query is being
parsed into Field:A Field:- Field:B which is not the desired outcome.
 
Does anyone know how to work around this new feature ?
 
Thanks,
Polina
