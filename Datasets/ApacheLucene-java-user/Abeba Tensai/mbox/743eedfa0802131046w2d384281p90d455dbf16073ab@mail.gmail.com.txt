SUBJECT: Question .. advanced query
DATE: 13 Feb 2008

Hi,

I am trying to perform a query that will enable me to run the following
logic against the index:
"4 3 [>=7] [>=4]" .. [>=7] means the third number must be greater or equal
to 7 and [>=4] means that the fourth number must be greater or equal to 4 ..
I have reviewed the query syntax and it seems that it is not possible to run
something like that .. can you confirm?

Thank you for your time,

Abeba.
