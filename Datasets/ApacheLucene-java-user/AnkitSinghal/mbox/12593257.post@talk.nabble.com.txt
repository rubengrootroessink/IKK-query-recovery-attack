SUBJECT: Storing Host and IP Information in Lucene
DATE: 10 Sep 2007


Hi

I have query about storing hostname and IP information in lucene,

For eg: In my Application I have some field with name host.
In my App sometimes i get value as host name and sometimes as ipaddress.
like sometimes i get ankit.xyz.com and sometimes i get 10.10.01.01

In my code i have made the Lucene field as
Field("host",value,TOKENIZED,NOSTORE).

Now the problem with above is that I cannot search for host:10.10.*

And if i make the field as UNTOKENIZED  i cannot search for queries like
host:xyz.* .

The only solution that came to my mind is to parse the value and decide if
it contains the IPaddress or hostname and then decide which type of
tokenizing to use.

But this seems to a pretty big overhead as my data us huge and parsing for
each record is not feasible.

Can any body provide with some better approach. I believe this is a very
common problem.
