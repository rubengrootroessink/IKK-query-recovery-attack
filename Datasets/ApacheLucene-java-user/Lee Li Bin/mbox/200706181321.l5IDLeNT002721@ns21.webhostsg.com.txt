Hi,

For indexing, there is no problem, there is Chinese text similar to my
datasource (XML) in the index file when opening on a note pad.

When I try to use the utf8 in jsp and, getbytes array of 'utf-8' or
ISO88599_1 or Cp1252 in Java servlet, but we getting search problem, the
search result does not display for Chinese term.

I mixed English and Chinese text in my datasource, the search is working for
English term, and Chinese char display as '???' in the result output.

Please advice or send some sample / solutions 
 
Thanks.

try first with simple junit test, after you can fight with UTF8 parameters.
