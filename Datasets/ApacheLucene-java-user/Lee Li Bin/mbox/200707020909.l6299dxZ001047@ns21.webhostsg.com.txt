Hi,

I still have no idea of how to get it done. Can give me some details?

The web application is in jsp btw.

Thanks a lot.

After search, you will just get an object Hits, and go through all of the
documents by hits.doc(i).

The pagination is controlled by you. Lucene is pre-caching first 200
documents and lazy loading the rest by batch size 200.
