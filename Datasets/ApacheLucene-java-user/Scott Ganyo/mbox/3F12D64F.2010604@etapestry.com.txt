Nifty cool!  I'm gonna like this, I can tell already!

I'm having a really hard time actually using Luke, though, as all the 
window panes and table columns are apparently of fixed size.  Do you 
think you could through in the ability to resize the various window 
panes and table columns?  This would make the tool truly useful.  Pretty 
please? :)

Thanks,
Scott
