SUBJECT: Memory Usage?
DATE: 8 Nov 2001

We're having problems with memory allocation (and thus garbage collection)
that seem to be directly attributable to our heavy use of Lucene indexes.  I
don't have a lot of data on this yet, but has anyone else seen this as an
issue?  Is there any way that Lucene could be tuned to use less memory
during searches?

Thanks,
Scott
