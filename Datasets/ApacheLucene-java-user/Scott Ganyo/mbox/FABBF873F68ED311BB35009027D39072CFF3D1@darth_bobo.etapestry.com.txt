1) Are you sure that the index is corrupted?  Maybe the file handles just
haven't been released yet.  Did you try to reboot and try again?

2) To avoid the too-many files problem: a) increase the system file handle
limits, b) make sure that you reuse IndexReaders as much as you can rather
across requests and client rather than opening and closing them.
