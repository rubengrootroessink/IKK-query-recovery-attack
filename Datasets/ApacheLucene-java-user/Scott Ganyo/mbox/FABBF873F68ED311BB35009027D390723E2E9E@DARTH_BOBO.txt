I don't use a query parser at all, so that's no issue.  I just need a
BooleanQuery to realize that it only has negative clauses and do the right
thing.  Right now I have to include a bogus static field in every single
document so that I can use a TermQuery on that bogus field as the left side
of a BooleanQuery subtract.  Sure, it works, but it ain't pretty...
