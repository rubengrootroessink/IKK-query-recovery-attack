"IBM plans to release as open-source a sophisticated new search and  
text analysis technology that is able to find relationships, trends  
and facts buried in a wide range of unstructured data, including e- 
mails, Web pages, text documents, images, audio and video.
Called the UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture),  
the technology is able is able to go beyond the keyword analysis  
typically used by most search engines to discern the semantic  
meanings within text and other unstructured data, said Nelson Mattos,  
vice president of information integration with IBM in San Jose, Calif."
