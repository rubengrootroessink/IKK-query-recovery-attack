Hi Eugene,

Yes.  Doug (Cutting) added this to eliminate OutOfMemory errors that 
apparently some people were having.  Unfortunately, it causes 
backward-compatibility issues if you were used to using version 1.2.  
So, you'll need to add a call like this:

BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount(Integer.MAX_VALUE);

(Of course, you can set the parameter to whatever you want, but 
unrestricted works best for me.)
