SUBJECT: Re: Keyword search with space and wildcard
DATE: 29 Aug 2003

Basically, yes, I am trying to put a wildcard in a phrase.  My field (a 
Keyword) is the name of a project.  It can be 40 characters long (I'm 
basically indexing some database columns).  Since it is a Keyword and not a 
Text field, it doesn't get tokenized (I do this on purpose) and must match 
up exactly.  I would like for users to be able to search on partial phrases 
such as "Hello w*" and match up to "Hello world" and "Hello washington", 
etc.  Is this not possible?  Is it documented anywhere?

Thanks.
-Brian
