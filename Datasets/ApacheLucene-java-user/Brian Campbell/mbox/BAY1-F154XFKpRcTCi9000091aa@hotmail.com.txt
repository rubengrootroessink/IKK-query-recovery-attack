SUBJECT: Keyword search with space and wildcard
DATE: 28 Aug 2003

I've created and index that has a Keyword field in it.  I'm trying to do a 
search on that field where my term has a space and the wildcard character in 
it.  For example, I'll issue the following search:  project_name:"Hello w*". 
  I have an entry in the project_name field of "Hello world".  I would 
expect to get a hit on this but I don't.  Is this not the way Lucene 
behaves? Am I doing something wrong?  Thanks.

-Brian
