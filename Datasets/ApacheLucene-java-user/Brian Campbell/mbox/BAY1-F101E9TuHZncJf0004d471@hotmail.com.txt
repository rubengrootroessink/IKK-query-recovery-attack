Great.  Is there an example anywhere on how I might be able to build such a 
Query?  QueryParser isn't really all that simple since it's built with 
JavaCC.

What might be ideal for me is if I can continue to use the highlevel 
interface to build the main query (ie use it to parse my query string and 
return me some kind of Query - BooleanQuery, TermQuery, etc) and then build 
a WildcardQuery by hand and "combine" the two together?  For example, is it 
as simple as calling Query.combine() to combine the two?  Is there a better 
way?  Is there a documented example like this?  Thanks!
