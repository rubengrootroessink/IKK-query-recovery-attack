Yes you must delete the entire document and then re-index a new one,  
to update a single Field.

There is some work underway, or at least a Jira issue opened, towards  
improving this situation, here:

     https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1231

But it will be some time before that's available.
