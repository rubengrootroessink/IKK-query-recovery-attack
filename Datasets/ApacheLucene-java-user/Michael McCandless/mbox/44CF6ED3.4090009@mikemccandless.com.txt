Lucene has file-based locking for exactly this reason.  Can you 
double-check that the same lockDir is being used in both your 
IndexModifier process and your searching process?

Also: this directory can't be an NFS mount -- there are known problems 
with the current Lucene locking implementation and NFS file systems. 
Are you using NFS?
