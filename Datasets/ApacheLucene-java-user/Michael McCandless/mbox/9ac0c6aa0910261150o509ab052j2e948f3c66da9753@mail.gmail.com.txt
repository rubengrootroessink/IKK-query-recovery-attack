That's spooky.  Do you have the full exception for this one?  What IO
system are you running on?  (Is it just a local drive on your windows
computer?) It's almost as if the IO system is not generating an
IOException to Java when disk fills up.

You mean, to intentionally test the disk-full case?

In this case, the SegmentMerger was trying to open this segment, but
on attempting to read the first int from the fdx (fields index) file
for one of the segments, it hit EOF.

This is also spooky -- this looks like index corruption, which should
never happen on hitting disk full.
