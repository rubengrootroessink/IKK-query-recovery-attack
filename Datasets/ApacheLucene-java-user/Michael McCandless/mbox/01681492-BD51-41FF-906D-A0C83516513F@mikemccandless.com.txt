SUBJECT: Re: Best practice for updating an index when reindexing is not an option
DATE: 10 Jul 2008


Why does SubversionUpdate require shutting down the IndexSearcher?   
What goes wrong?

You might want to switch instead to rsync.

A Lucene index is fundamentally write once, so, syncing changes over  
should simply be copying over new files and removing now-deleted  
files.  You won't be able to remove files held open by the  
IndexSearcher, but, once the IndexSearcher restarts you'd then be able  
to delete those files on the next sync.
