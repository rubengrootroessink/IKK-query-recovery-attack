Hi Renaud,

You should be able to do your own merging by overriding the merge
method of Fields/Terms/PostingsConsumer classes, in your codec.  Each
of these classes has a default impl for merge, which just does the
normal postings merging (fields/terms are merged,
docs/positions/payloads are concatenated, mapping around deletions).

Please give feedback how it goes!  These are very new and still very
malleable APIs...
