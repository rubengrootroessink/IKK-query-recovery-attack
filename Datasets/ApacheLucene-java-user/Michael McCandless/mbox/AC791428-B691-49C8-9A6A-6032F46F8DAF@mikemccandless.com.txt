Are you on Windows?

If so, you'll need to then open & close a new IndexWriter after the  
old reader has switched to the optimized index.  That will delete the  
old files.

On other OSs, which usually implement "delete on last close", the disk  
space should be automatically freed up once you close the old reader.
