But, RangeQuery.rewrite is simply enumerating terms, which I think is
working "OK".

It's enumerting terms, then seeking a sister TermDocs to each term,
that tickles the over-seeking problem.  FieldCache does that, and
RangeFilter on 2.4 does that, but RangeFilter (or RangeQuery with
constant score mode) on 2.9 should not (they should do it per
segment), which is why I'm baffled that Raf didn't see a speedup on
upgrading.
