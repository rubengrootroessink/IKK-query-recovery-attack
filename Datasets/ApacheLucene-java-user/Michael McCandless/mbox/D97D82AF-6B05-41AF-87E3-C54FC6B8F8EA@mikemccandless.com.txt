SUBJECT: IndexReader.isDeleted
DATE: 23 Jan 2009

We are considering replacing the current random-access
IndexReader.isDeleted(int docID) method with an iterator & skipTo
(DocIdSet) access that would let you iterate through the deleted
docIDs, instead.

At the same time we would move to a new API to replace
IndexReader.document(int docID) that would no longer check whether the
document is deleted.

This is being discussed now under several Jira issues and on
java-dev.

Would this be a problem for any Lucene applications out there?

How is isDeleted used today (outside of Lucene)?  Normally an
IndexSearcher would never return a deleted document, and so "in
theory" a deleted docID should never "escape" Lucene's APIs.

So I'm curious what applications in fact rely on isDeleted, and how
that method is being used...

Thanks,

Mike
