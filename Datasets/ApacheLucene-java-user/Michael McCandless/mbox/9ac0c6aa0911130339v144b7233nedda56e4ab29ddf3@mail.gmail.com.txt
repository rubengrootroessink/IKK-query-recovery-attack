Alas, I can't repro this problem ("leaking file descriptors with NRT"), either.

I've got a decent stress test setup -- start with a 5M Wikipedia
index, update (delete & add) @ 1000 docs/sec (using 2 threads), reopen
10X per second, searching at redline (using 9 threads), and the open
file descriptors look contained.

Are you using compound format or not?  Do you hit any odd exceptions
in your test?  Any other differences in how Zoie uses Lucene NRT that
you can think of...?
