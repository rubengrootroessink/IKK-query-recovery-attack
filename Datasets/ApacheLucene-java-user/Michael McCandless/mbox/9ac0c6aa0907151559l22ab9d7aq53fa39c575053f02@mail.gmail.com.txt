 run as BS? what does it mean to have MUST +() at the top level?

Your query is +(((X Y Z))^2).  In BQ.rewrite, any single-clause query
that hasn't had minNRShouldMatch set will return its single sub-query,
rewritten.  So your query should (recursively) rewrite to a simple
BooleanQuery (ie just OR'd terms), which is eligible for BS.

And we see BS in your hung stack trace ;)
