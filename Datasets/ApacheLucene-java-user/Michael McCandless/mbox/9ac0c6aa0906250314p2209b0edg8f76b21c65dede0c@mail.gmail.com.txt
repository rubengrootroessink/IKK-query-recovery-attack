No, it's loads 1/5th of the 1/128th of all the terms available.  Ie,
by default Lucene loads every 128th term into RAM for searching.  If
you call setTermInfosIndexDivisor(5), then it loads every 128*5 =
every 640 terms.

set setTermInfosIndexDivisor(5); during re-opening of the index also. I tried this, first
time it accepted and second time onwards it throws "terms already loaded" expection

Calling setTermInfosIndexDivisor on a reopened reader won't work,
because of a [just now discovered] bug in Lucene.  The workaround (if
you really must use setTermInfosIndexDivisor) is to not use reopen.
