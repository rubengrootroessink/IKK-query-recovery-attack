Summary: I think there will be no real impact if you use longer field  
names.

Details:

Index size will be just a tiny bit bigger.  There is a single file  
per segment (*.fnm) that resolves the field names into integer IDs,  
then the rest of the index uses these integer IDs.  So only that  
file, which holds one copy of the string name of each field, will be  
bigger.

Indexing may be a bit faster with shorter names just because Lucene  
does a hashtable lookup of that string (one per field per document)  
to find the corresponding integer.  My guess is this is a very  
negligible impact, especially if the content of each field is long.   
Searching goes through a similar hashtable lookup, after which the  
field name is interned, but for a largish index that time is surely  
negligible as well.  But you should test!  And please report back :)
