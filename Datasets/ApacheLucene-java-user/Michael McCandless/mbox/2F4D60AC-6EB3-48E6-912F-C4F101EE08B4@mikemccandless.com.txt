SUBJECT: Re: Incorrect Token Offset when using multiple fieldable instance
DATE: 5 Mar 2008


This is how Lucene has worked for quite some time (since 1.9).

When there are multiple fields with the same name in one Document,  
each field's offset starts from the last offset (offset of the last  
token) seen in the previous field.  If tokens are skipped at the end  
there's no way IndexWriter can know (because tokenStream doesn't  
return them).  It's as if we need the ability to query a tokenStream  
for its "final" offset or something.

One workaround might be to insert an "end marker" token, with the  
true end offset, which is a term you would never search on?
