SUBJECT: Re: termDocs / termEnums performance increase for 2.4.0
DATE: 17 Feb 2009


It's interesting that you found this speedup... I'm not sure offhand  
what changes led to the speedup (but I'm still happy about it!).

But... why do you need to iterate through all terms, and all docs for  
each term, in the first place?

EG this is what FieldCache does in order to populate values the first  
time a given field is loaded.  It's also what segment merging does.

In 2.9, we've switched searching to proceed segment by segment,  
instead of using the MultiSegmentReader API to get TermEnum/TermDocs  
(this was LUCENE-1483).  This gives a good speedup for sort-by- 
relevance queries, and also especially sort-by-field queries.  And,  
when sorting by field it no longer loads the FieldCache at the  
MultiReader level, which means reopen cost for a large index that has  
sort-by-field queries should be much better on average since the cost  
is now in proportion to which segments are new.
