SUBJECT: Re: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Segment is too large
DATE: 31 Mar 2008


This happens when addIndexesNoOptimize finds a segment that's larger  
than maxMergeDocs in the index(es) it's given.

If you leave maxMergeDocs at Integer.MAX_VALUE it will fix that.

Though really it's being a little too pedantic because that setting  
(maxMergeDocs) sets the maximum size of a segment that's may be  
selected for merging.  So it's easily possible to have segments in  
your index that are larger than this (eg by merging segments that  
were all just a bit smaller than the limit).

I think we should remove those checks and allow addIndexesNoOptimize  
to import and index even if it has segments over this limit.  I'll  
open an issue.
