Best explanation is the source code itself -- it should be correct ;)

Look at how SegmentTermsEnum.next is implemented, pre-flex.  (If
you're looking @ flex (= trunk), then the format is slightly different
and not yet correctly documented (issue is open)).

Yes vInt/vLong are the same, except vLong can take up to 9 bytes.  But
we look @ the high bit of each byte, and keep reading/shifting bytes
as long as that's 1.  It's a rather CPU unfriendly format since that
if is usually hard to predict.

Each term is delta coded against the last term, ie we only write the
changed suffix.  First vInt is suffix start.  Next vInt is suffix end.
 Then comes the bytes (UTF8 pre-flex, opaque in flex).  In your case
these both look to be 0?  Ie, first term is the empty string.  Next
comes the field number as a vInt (pre-flex), but at that point you
have -1 (encodes as FF FF FF FF 0F in vInt), which is odd -- field
numbers should be positive.  Must be missing something...

The deltas are then vLong's, delta coded.
