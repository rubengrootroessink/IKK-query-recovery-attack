Ahh, OK, but: 2.3.3 won't have deletion by query because it's just  
another point release after 2.3.2.  Ie it will only have bug fixes  
specifically backported from the trunk.

2.4 is the next release off the trunk (that will have deletion by  
query).

Understood!

Well if you could try out the trunk (not in production) and see if  
it's working for you, raise any issues you hit, etc, that'd help us  
make sure it's working right...
