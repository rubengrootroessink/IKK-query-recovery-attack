I'm assuming this is easily repeated (question from my last email) and
not a transient error?  If it's transient, this could be explained by
locking not working properly.

If it's not transient (ie, happens every time you open this index),
it sounds like indeed the segments file is referencing a segment that
does not exist.

But, how the index got into this state is a mystery.  I don't know of
any existing Lucene bugs that can do this.  Furthermore, crashing
an indexing process should not lead to this (it can lead to other things
like only have a segments.new file and no segments file).

Were there any earlier exceptions (before indexing hit an "improper
shutdown") in your indexing process that could give a clue as to root
cause?  Or for example was the machine rebooted and did windows to run
a "filesystem check" on rebooting this box (which can remove corrupt
files)?
