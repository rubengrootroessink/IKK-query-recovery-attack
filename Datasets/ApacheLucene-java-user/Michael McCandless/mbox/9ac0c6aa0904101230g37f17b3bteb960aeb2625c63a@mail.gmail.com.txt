I'd be curious just how true this really is (in general)... my guess
is the "long tail of tiny segments" gets into the OS's IO cache (as
long as the system stays hot) and doesn't actually hurt things much.

Has anyone tested this (performance of unoptimized vs optimized
indexes, in general) recently?  To be a fair comparison, there should
be no deletions in the index.
