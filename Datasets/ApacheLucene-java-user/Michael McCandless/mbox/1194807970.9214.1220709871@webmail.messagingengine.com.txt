Phew!  I think you are the first user (besides me).

This should be safe.  This tool does not delete any files: it only
writes a new segments_N+1 file that has dropped references to those
segments that had trouble loading.

Not as it currently stands: the tool does not acquire the write lock,
so, if another writer is working on the index, it would cause problems
in that both this tool and the writer would try to write the
segments_N file, possibly at different times (in which case the later
one would overwrite the first one) or at/near the same time (in which
case on Windows one would hit an IOException).

We could fix the tool to acquire the write.lock, though this isn't
perfect since the tool doesn't know the locking configuration for your
index (eg using NativeFSSLockFactory or SimpleFSLockFactory, maybe
with a different lock directory, etc.).
