BooleanQuery uses BooleanScorer when possible because that gives
better performance than BooleanScorer2.

If you really want to force it, you'd need to create the weight/scorer
yourself, passing "true" for scoreDocsInOrder.  Alternatively, you
could make your collector, for example wrapping another collector,
that returns "false" for acceptsDocsOutOfOrder.

But: why do you need/want to do this?
