SUBJECT: 2.4 release candidate 1
DATE: 18 Sep 2008


Hi,

I just created the first release candidate for 2.4, here:

   http://people.apache.org/~mikemccand/staging-area/lucene2.4rc1

Please download the release candidate, kick the tires and report back
on any issues you encounter.

The plan is to make only serious bug fixes or build/doc fixes, to
2.4 for ~10 days, after which if there are no blockers I'll call a
vote for the actual release.

Happy testing, and thanks!

Mike
