It's complicated.

In 2.3, you can use IW.flush to write docs to disk.  But that method  
will be deprecated in 2.4 and replaced with commit.  Or, you can close.

If application (jvm) dies or killed, the index will be fine but won't  
have any un-flushed buffered docs.

If machine dies (os crashes, power cord pulled) then there is a real  
risk that the index will become corrupt.  This is because Lucene has  
never explicitly sync()'d the files to ensure they are on stable  
storage.  LUCENE-1044 fixes that (adds syncs).
