If possible, could you call IndexWriter.setInfoStream(...) and  
capture the log produced leading up to the exception?  It could help  
see if there is a bug here, by showing whether IndexWriter actually  
deleted that file or not.

What is your mergeFactor set to now?

You can lower mergeFactor, but, if file exhaustion is the cause here,  
it simply may not be enough.

Yes, you can do this:

   ConcurrentMergeScheduler cms = (ConcurrentMergeScheduler)  
writer.getMergeScheduler();
   cms.setMaxThreadCount(1)

This way only one BG merge may run.  The next one that wants to kick  
off will stall until the first one is done.

You can fallback to SerialMergeScheduler, which matches the behavior  
pre-2.3.  In this case a merge kicks off, synchronously, in an add/ 
updateDocument call after flushing a segment.

Doing so only at close() is trickier.  Maybe, you could 1) use  
SerialMergeScheduler, 2) set mergeFactor to something immense (to  
prevent merging on a normal basis), 3) when you want to merge, set  
mergeFactor to something normal (eg the default, 10) and then call  
writer.maybeMerge().  Then call close().
