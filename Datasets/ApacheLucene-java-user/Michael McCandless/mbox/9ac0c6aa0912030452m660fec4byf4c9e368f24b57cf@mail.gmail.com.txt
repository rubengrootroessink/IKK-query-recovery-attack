Do you simply create the IndexWriter & IndexReader, but do no
searching/indexing?

How are you measuring RAM?  You should use a RAM profiler (eg YourKit)
to get the "real" usage, not counting garbage that's yet to be
collected.

My guess is the shear process of Lucene scanning your terms index
creates lots of garbage and you're measuring the RAM consumed by that
garbage.  The garbage should be harmless (it'll eventually get GCd &
reused).

No RAM is consumed.

memory will be allocated / increased.

Only a little RAM is allocated up front, I think.  It's only as you
start indexing docs that the big RAM is really allocated.  After a
flush the RAM is then reused (ie, not freed) for subsequent segments.
