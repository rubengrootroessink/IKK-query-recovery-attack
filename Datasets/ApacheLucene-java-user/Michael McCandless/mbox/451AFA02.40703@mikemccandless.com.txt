I am at a loss on this one.

That function that writes the segments file is quite simple -- it opens 
a "segments.new", writes a smallish number of bytes, then closes it, 
then renames it to "segments".  Your exception happens in the close (in 
a finally clause).  I don't get why server version of the JRE would do 
this but the client version would not.

Do you have any interesting customizations in how you are using Lucene?
