What do you mean by "deletable" indexing files?

Moving to RHEL5 should have no effect (vs other platforms) on how much  
disk space is used.

However, Lucene's disk usage can be surprising.  While merging  
segments it will temporarily require free space equal to the size of  
the resulting merged segment.  For a large merge this can be a sizable  
percentage of your total index size.
