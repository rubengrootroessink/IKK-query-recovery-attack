SUBJECT: Re: SOC: Lulu, a Lua implementation of Lucene
DATE: 1 Mar 2008


I am looking forward to a pure Lua version of Lucene.  Lua looks like  
a neat and amazingly compact programming language.  I especially like  
Lua's "table" container type which is both a list and a hash/dictionary.

One issue to watch out for is LUCENE-510, which has been an issue  
with other Lucene implementations trying to match the Lucene index  
format exactly:

   http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-510

I'm working on this one but not sure when exactly it will be fixed  
since it's a difficult tradeoff (loses some indexing performance)...
