Interesting!

I would be inclined to allow this, and fix CheckIndex's paranoia.  As  
far as I can tell, Lucene itself does not mind if the position is -1  
(at least PhraseQuery, SpanTermQuery happily find that Term at  
position -1), although we do prevent setting positionIncrement to a  
negative number in Token.java so you can't get less than -1.  Does  
anyone know of actual cases where Lucene would choke on this?
