SUBJECT: Re: Will doc ids ever change if nothing is deleted?
DATE: 18 May 2010

If you never delete docs, then w/ the default merge policy, the docIDs
should never change.

But... this should be considered an impl detail of Lucene.  In theory
someday this could change.  EG there's an issue open (LUCENE-1076) to
allow a merge policy to select out-of-order merges, which they cannot
do today.
