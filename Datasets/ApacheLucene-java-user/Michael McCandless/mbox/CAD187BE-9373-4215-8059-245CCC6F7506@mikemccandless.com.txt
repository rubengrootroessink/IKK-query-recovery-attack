OK, that query does create a PhraseQuery.

Payloads consume no space if you don't use them.  Term frequency can't  
be separately turned off.

Other things to try:

   - Turn off field storing (Field.Store.NO) and turn off term vectors  
(Field.TermVector.NO), if you haven't already.

   - Disable norms saves a tiny amount of disk space, but you lose  
boosting.

   - Reduce the number of fields on each doc

   - Run optimize.
