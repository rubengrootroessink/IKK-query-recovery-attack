I think you mean Lucene trunk (not 2.0)?  LockFactory hasn't been
released yet.

With the trunk, you can still instantiate an FSDirectory with your own
LockFactory using FSDirectory.getDirectory(*)?

Maybe you are referring to the boolean "create" argument?  That was
deprecated/removed from FSDirectory.getDirectory as part of:

     http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-773
