Hmm BalancedSegmentMergePolicy was over 2X slower to optimize...?
That's curious.

Though, BSMP is supposed to be better only for the non-optimize case
(ie just adding/deleting docs and never calling optimize).  It tries
to defer picking very large segment merges.

You could also try the TieredMergePolicy (currently still a patch on
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-854); it also tries to not
over-merge like LogByteSizeMergePolicy does (sometimes).  I wrote
about this in http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/02/visualizing-lucenes-segment-merges.html
