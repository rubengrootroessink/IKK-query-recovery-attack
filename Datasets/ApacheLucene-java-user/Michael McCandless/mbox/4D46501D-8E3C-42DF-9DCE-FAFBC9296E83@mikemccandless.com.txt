SUBJECT: Bug in Sun's 1.6 hotspot compiler that can cause index corruption
DATE: 30 Jul 2008


FYI -- there is a nasty bug that affects Lucene in Sun's 1.6 hotspot
compiler, starting with 1.6.0_04.  At least 3 known cases have been
seen on this list.

Details are here:

   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1282

The bug causes silent index corruption during merging, such that the
merge completes successfully but in fact has introduced corruption
into the index that goes undetected until you open an IndexReader on
it.

Sun has now fixed the bug as of build 28 of the 1.6 JRE update 10 beta
(1.6.0_10-rc-b28), here:

   http://download.java.net/jdk6/binaries

If you are using 1.6.0_04 or higher, you should consider upgrading to
this JRE release, or, upgrading once it's an official release (it's  
beta now)!

Mike
