SUBJECT: Re: best way to ensure IndexWriter won't corrupt the index?
DATE: 26 Nov 2009

The leftover write.lock is expected on ungraceful shutdown; you just
have to remove it.  Or, switch to NativeFSLockFactory, which correctly
detects when the lock is no longer in use.

Next time this happens, try running CheckIndex on the index.

Are you sure the Luke version you're using is new enough to read 2.4.1 indexes?
