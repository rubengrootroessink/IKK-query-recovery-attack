SUBJECT: WARNING: re-index all trunk indices!
DATE: 17 Dec 2010

If you are using Lucene's trunk (nightly build) release, read on...

I just committed a change (for LUCENE-2811) that changes the index
format on trunk, thus breaking (w/ likely strange exceptions on
reading the segments_N file) any trunk indices created in the past
week or so.

Mike
