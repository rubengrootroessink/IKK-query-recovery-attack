SUBJECT: Re: Merge and commit behaviour - changed between 2.4 and 2.9?
DATE: 5 Oct 2010

Well, the merges continue running and altering the segments files, but
the changes done by the merges are not committed until the app calls
commit (or closes the IW).  Ie, no new segments_N file is written due
to merging after the last commit.

the document updates are safely committed (flushed as new segments) and the merges are essentially
just a background tidying of committed state that can fail with no detrimental effect on the
previous transaction.
