No, that's not changed.  You must still reopen an IndexReader to see  
changes to the index.  An IndexReader always searches a point-in-time  
snapshot of the index.

LUCENE-1044 does mean that you should call IndexWriter.commit() (or,  
close the writer) to ensure all changes you've made become visible to  
the reader.
