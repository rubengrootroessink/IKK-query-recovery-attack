If the application (JVM) crashes or is killed or otherwise  
ungracefully shut down, it should never corrupt the Lucene index.

The only known "normal" (ie, assuming no errors in your hard drives,  
bugs in the OS/filesystem, etc.) cases where corruption may occur is  
if power is lost to the machine or the OS crashes.  In such cases,  
written bytes may still be cached in RAM and not flushed to stable  
storage, which can lead to corruption.

2.4.0 fixes that case, by explicitly sync'ing all files in the index  
for a given commit before removing the past commits.

I would recommend upgrading to 2.4.0 to avoid index corruption on  
power loss or OS crash.
