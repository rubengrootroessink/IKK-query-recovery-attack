Can you provide the full stack trace, and any details of what you  
were doing when you tripped that assert?

Another thing to try is to run the org.apache.lucene.index.CheckIndex  
tool (new in 2.3) to check your 2.2 index.  It's possible your 2.2  
index has some undetected corruption which this new assert is detecting.
