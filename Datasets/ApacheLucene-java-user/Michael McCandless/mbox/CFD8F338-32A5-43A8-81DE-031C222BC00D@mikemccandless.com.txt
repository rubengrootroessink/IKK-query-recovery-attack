You can also create a Lucene field using a Reader, if the String is  
really too large to materialize at once.  Such fields cannot be stored  
though.

But, if the String really is so large, I would worry about the end  
user's experience (normally you want a Document to be a rather bite- 
sized piece of content so users browsing through search results won't  
see a single monolithic result covering tons and tons of content).
