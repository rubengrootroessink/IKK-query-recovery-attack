The answer to all 3 is yes, but, you'll have to re-open your  
IndexReader to see any of those changes.

An IndexReader always searches the "point in time" snapshot of the  
index as of the moment it was opened.

Any & all changes done with an IndexWriter (including opening a new  
index in the directory with create=true) will not be visible to any  
already open IndexReader.
