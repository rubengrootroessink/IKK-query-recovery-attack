SUBJECT: Re: How to read the index in terms order
DATE: 14 Nov 2009

You can't easily change the order in which terms are enumerated from
the index.  They are stored in unicode code point sort order, and then
TermEnum reads them back.

You'll have to do your own buffering & collation on top of
TermEnum.... which if you have alot of terms, and you really need all
of them, sorted, could consume mucho RAM.

SortComparatorSource/FieldComparatorSource is only used for sorting
hits during searching.
