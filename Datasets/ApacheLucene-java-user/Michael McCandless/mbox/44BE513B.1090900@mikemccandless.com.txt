Is it your IndexSearcher instantiation that's raising the Lock obtain 
time out exception?

Can you look in your java.io.tmpdir and see if there are any Lucene lock 
files present even when Lucene is not running?  If so (and you're 
certain you don't have Lucene running) you should remove those files 
manually and then retry your program?
