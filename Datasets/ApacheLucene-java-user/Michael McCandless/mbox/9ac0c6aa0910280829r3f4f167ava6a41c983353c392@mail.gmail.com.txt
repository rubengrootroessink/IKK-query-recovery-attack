That patch certainly shouldn't lead to this.

OK may as well check just so we cover all possibilities.

OK, maybe we can modify your CheckIndex instead.  Let's start with
this, which prints a warning whenever the docFreq differs but
otherwise continues (vs throwing RuntimeException).  I'm curious how
many terms show this, and whether the TermEnum keeps working after
this term that has different docFreq:

         if (freq0 + delCount != docFreq) {
-          throw new RuntimeException("term " + term + " docFreq=" +

         }
       }
