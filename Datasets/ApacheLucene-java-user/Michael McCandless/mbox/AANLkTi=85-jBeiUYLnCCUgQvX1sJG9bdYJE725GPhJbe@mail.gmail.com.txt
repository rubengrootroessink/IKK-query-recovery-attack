SUBJECT: heads up -- index corruption on Solr/Lucene trunk/3.x branch
DATE: 2 Aug 2010

This issue:

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2574

which was committed 3 days ago (Friday Jul 30) can cause index corruption.

I just committed a fix for the corruption, but if you've been using
Solr/Lucene trunk or 3x branch updated after the first commit on
Friday, and you built any indexes with it, you should rebuild them!

Sorry,

Mike
