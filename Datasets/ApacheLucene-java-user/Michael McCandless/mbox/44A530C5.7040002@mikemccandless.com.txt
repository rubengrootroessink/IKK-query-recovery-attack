Correct, because it's final you cannot change it directly.

But, you can set the Java system property org.apache.lucene.lockDir. 
This will change the lock directory, because the final lockDir is 
initialized by looking up that property, and if it's unset, looking up 
java.io.tmpdir instead.  Finally if java.io.tmpdir is still unset, the 
directory of your index will be used.
