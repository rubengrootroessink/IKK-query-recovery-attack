SUBJECT: Re: best way to ensure IndexWriter won't corrupt the index?
DATE: 25 Nov 2009

Before 2.4 it was possible that a crash of the OS, or sudden power
loss to the machine, could corrupt the index.  But that's been fixed
with 2.4.

The only known sources of corruption are hardware faults (bad RAM, bad
disk, etc.), and, accidentally allowing 2 writers to write to the same
index at once (this will very quickly cause corruption).  Lucene's
write lock normally prevents this from happening.

kill -9, JRE crashing, OS crashing, power loss, etc., should not cause
corruption for Lucene >= 2.4.

Backing up is definitely a good idea -- Lucene's
SnapshotDeletionPolicy makes it easy to do a hot backup (backup even
though IndexWriter is still changing the index).  There's a paper on
this (NOTE: I'm the author!) available  at
http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/ that gives details (look for "Hot
backups with Lucene (green paper - html)".
