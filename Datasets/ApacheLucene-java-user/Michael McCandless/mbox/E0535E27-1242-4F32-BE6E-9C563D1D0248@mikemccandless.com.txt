Thanks for the data point!

This is expected -- alot of work went into increasing IndexWriter's  
throughput in 2.3.

Actually, I'd expect even more speedup, if indeed Lucene is the  
bottleneck in your app.  You could test how much time just creating/ 
parsing & tokenizing the docs (from whatever is holding them) takes,  
to see.  Also you might eke more performance out following the  
suggestions here:

     http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveIndexingSpeed

Since you've got 4 CPUs and lots of RAM you should definitely use  
multiple indexing threads with a large RAM buffer.
