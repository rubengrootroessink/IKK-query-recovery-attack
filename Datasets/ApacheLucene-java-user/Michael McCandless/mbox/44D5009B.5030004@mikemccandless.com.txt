Indeed it seems like Windows somehow believes the "deletable" file must 
be still held open, given that the File.renameTo and also the "fallback" 
open failed.

I tried a quick test to reproduce this but could not.  I just modified 
the demo IndexFiles command line tool to add documents forever, then 
used Windows Explorer to refresh like crazy...  I tested with Sun JDK 
1.4.2 on Windows XP Pro SP 2.

Which JDK / version, and Windows XP version, are you using?

Mike
