There have been some discussions on java-dev, but there's no clear  
consensus/date yet.  We do have quite a few Jira issues marked as 2.9  
at this point, which we need to make progress on or push out:

Can you provide some detail on what's different about range queries,  
or any other differences?  Is it the lack of numeric operators (<, <=,  
 >, >=, !=) via QueryParser? Minion definitely looks like a neat  
search engine.

With the recent addition of TrieRangeQuery (in 2.9), I think Lucene's  
range querying is actually very strong, though you'd have to subclass  
QueryParser and override getRangeQuery to have it create TrieRangeQuery.
