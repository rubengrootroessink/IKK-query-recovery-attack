Hmm: do you know for certain that a particular document causes this?
If you make a standalone test indexing only that document, does the
problem happen?

OK sounds like plenty, though likely the OS won't give you 3.8 GB (if
the JRE is 32-bit).

For infoStream, eg:  IndexWriter.setInfoStream(System.out);

And, yes, since you're using a non-deprecated ctor of IndexWriter, you
are getting autoCommit=false, so that's good.
