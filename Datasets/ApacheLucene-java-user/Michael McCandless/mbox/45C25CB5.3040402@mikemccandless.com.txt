Are you running Windows on your macbook pro?

There are known issues like this, but only on Windows, eg:

   http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-665

We believe such cases are now fixed by lockless commits, on the trunk
of Lucene (which is not yet released).  If you could try the trunk
(but beware that API, file formats, can change) and see if this still
happens that'd be great!
