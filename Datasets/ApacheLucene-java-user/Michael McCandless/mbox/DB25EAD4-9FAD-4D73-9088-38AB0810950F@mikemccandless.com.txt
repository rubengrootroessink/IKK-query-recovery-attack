Yes this should reduce transient (while merging) disk usage.   
However, optimize disregards this parameter, so it will still use the  
same disk space. However, if you call optimize(N) then that should  
use less space since it does not merge all the way down to 1 segment.

Note that the limit applies to segments-to-be-merged not to the final  
merged segment size.  Ie, any segment > maxMergeMB will never be  
merged, but at any given time you can easily have segments quite a  
bit larger than maxMergeMB.
