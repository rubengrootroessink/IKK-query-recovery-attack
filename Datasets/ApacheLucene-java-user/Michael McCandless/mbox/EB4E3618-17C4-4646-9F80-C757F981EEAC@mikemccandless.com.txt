That's right, this is fine.  Many unit tests rely on it.

RAMDirectory is similar to UNIX in that deletion of an open file is  
allowed, yet anything that had the file open can continue to read  
from it.  "Delete on last close".

Also note that we don't write & rename a segments.new file anymore  
(as of 2.1).  Instead we write segments_N, where N increases each  
time the writer commits.
