I can't tell if this is a bug yet... I need more details, like the  
stack traces, but
also more details about how you are using Lucene.  Can you post the  
parts
of your source code that actually do the indexing/searching?

If you could reduce this to a small test case that shows one or both of
the exceptions then I can track down what's happening.
