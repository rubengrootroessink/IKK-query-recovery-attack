I agree Lucene should not be affected by things like having Windows 
Explorer windows up!

Can you post the traceback you're seeing?  In particular, what's failing 
about the fallback approach?

Is it in the FSDirectory's renameFile method?  There is this comment in 
there:

     // Rename the old file to the new one. Unfortunately, the renameTo()
     // method does not work reliably under some JVMs.  Therefore, if the
     // rename fails, we manually rename by copying the old file to the 
new one

and correspondingly this comment in the original commit for this (back 
on March 1 2003):

- Added a manual renaming of files in case the java.io.File's renameTo(File)
   call fails.  It has been reported that this happens on Windows JVMs.
