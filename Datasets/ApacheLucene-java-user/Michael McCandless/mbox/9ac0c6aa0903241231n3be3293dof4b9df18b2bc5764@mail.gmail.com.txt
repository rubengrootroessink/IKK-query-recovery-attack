I'd rather not make SegmentInfos public; it's a large API and we do
make changes to it as we change the index format.  It's also quite
internal to Lucene.

Making your own MergePolicy/Scheduler is very much an "advanced" use
case... so I think it's acceptable to have to put it into o.a.l.index
package?
