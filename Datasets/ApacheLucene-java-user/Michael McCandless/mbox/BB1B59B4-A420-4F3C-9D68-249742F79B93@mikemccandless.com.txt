This makes me a bit nervous.  Does this only run on startup of your  
process, or each time you need to open the IndexWriter?  Could you  
add some logging whenever an unlock is necessary so we can double- 
check that you're not accidentally un-locking the lock out from under  
an IndexWriter (which could cause exactly this exception)?
