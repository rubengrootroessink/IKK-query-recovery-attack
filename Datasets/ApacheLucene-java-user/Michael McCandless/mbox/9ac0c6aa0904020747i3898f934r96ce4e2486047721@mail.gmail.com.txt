Are these divisions overlapping?  Ie, 2nd index includes all docs from
the first one (8 days) plus another 14 days, and 3rd index (60 days)
includes all 22 days from 2nd one plus another 38 days?

If so, I don't understand eg why the 60 day index is smaller than the
22 day index.  That's odd.

there a reason why a 22 day index would be 10x the size of an 8 day index when the document
indexing rate is fairly constant? Also, is there a way to shrink the index without regenerating
it?

You can't shrink the index without deleting docs... eg you could
delete docs, and add newer docs that store less stuff, to shrink the
index over time (merging/optimizing will reclaim disk space).
