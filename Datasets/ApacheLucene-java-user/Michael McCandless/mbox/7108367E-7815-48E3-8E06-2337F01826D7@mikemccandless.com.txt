IndexWriter currently has no way to check if a doc is deleted; you'd  
have to use IndexReader...

The deleteDocuments methods in IndexWriter do not return a count  
(unlike IndexReader) because the request is simply buffered and then  
processed in bulk when the deletes are flush.  So at the time of that  
call, IndexWriter does not know how many documents were affected by  
the delete.

But why do you need to check this in the first place?  EG searching  
will never return to you a deleted document...
