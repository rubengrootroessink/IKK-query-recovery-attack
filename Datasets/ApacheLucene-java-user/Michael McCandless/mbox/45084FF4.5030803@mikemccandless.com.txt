SUBJECT: intermittant "Access Denied" IOExceptions on Windows
DATE: 13 Sep 2006

Hi all,

There is an issue opened on Lucene:

     http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-665

that I'd like to draw your attention to and summarize here because
recently users have hit it.

The gist of the issue is: on Windows, you sometimes see intermittant
"Access Denied" errors in renaming segments.new to segments or
deletable.new to deletable, etc.  Lucene typically writes files first
to X.new and then renames then to X.

I know there was at least one recent thread where someone was hitting
this and there have been others in the past (including other Jira
issues).

Anyway, at the end of the issue it was discovered that there was an
unrelated piece of software (TortoiseSVN client) installed which was
using a filesystem "change log" capability in Windows that was
"causing" the problem: uninstalling it made the errors go away.

Unfortunately, there are apparently many software packages that use
this "change log" capability in Windows (virus checkers, Microsoft's
indexing service, etc.) and so the above issue remains open to figure
out whether / how to make Lucene robust to these cases.

But the bottom line is: if you hit these "Access Denied" errors, one
workaround is to try to turn off or uninstall the software that might
be doing this.  I realize in many cases that's not an option (it's a
production box; you can't turn off virus checkers; etc.), but at least
it's something to try if you can, until there's some resolution on
that issue.

Mike
