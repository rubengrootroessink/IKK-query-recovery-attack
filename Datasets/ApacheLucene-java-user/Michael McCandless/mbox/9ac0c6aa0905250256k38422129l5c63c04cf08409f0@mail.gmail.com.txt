SUBJECT: Re: How to extract 15/20 words around the matched query after getting	results from lucene searcher?
DATE: 25 May 2009

Can't you use contrib/highlighter to achieve this?

It can do both excerpting (grabbing chunk of text around each hit) and
highlighting (highlighting the specific tokens that matched, within
that excerpt).
