Not quite... SegmentTermEnum.seek takes "int p".  TermInfosReader.get
takes int position, though I think (not certain) that method is not
currently used anywhere.  I thought I had found one more place, but I
can't find it again, now.  I guess one could make a stress test and
find out what breaks first ;)

It certainly seems like (so far) relaxing this limitation is far
easier than relaxing the int doc limitation.
