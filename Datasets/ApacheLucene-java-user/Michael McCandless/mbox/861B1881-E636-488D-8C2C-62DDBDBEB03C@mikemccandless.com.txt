For now, keep using the deprecated API and specify autoCommit=false.   
Then in 3.0, when IndexWriter switches to autoCommit=false, remove the  
boolean autoCommit from your constructor.

Actually, this (maxBufferedDocs, as well as ramBufferSizeMB) controls  
when buffered docs in RAM are written as a new segment to disk.  When  
such a segment is created, it's not yet referenced by a segments_N  
file (thus a newly opened IndexReader won't see them) until a commit  
(or flush) happens.

autoCommit=true, instead, means IndexWriter will periodically (on it's  
own schedule) call commit() internally.
