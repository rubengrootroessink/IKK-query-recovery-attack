You should run CheckIndex to quickly get back to a usable index, but  
it will remove any segments that have problems loading.

But... I'd like to get to the root cause here.

It looks like this is Lucene 2.2.0.

Somehow the file _w5.cfs is entirely missing.

Can you describe how your indexing process works?  Do you copy your  
index after using IndexWriter?

Is it at all possible two IndexWriters are in use against the same  
directory?  Can multiple machines do indexing against this directory?   
(It looks like (since you're using a UNC path) you have an IndexWriter  
open on a remote computer's directory.)
