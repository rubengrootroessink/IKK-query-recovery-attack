You can always open a new IndexWriter on your index, do things like
addDocument, optimize, etc., and then close it.

There's no requirement that you do addDocument / optimize in a single
session of IndexWriter.

But do be careful not to pass "create = true" to IndexWriter.

The trunk (soon to be 2.1 release) version of Lucene has new
IndexWriter constructors that "create when needed, else append", see
here:
