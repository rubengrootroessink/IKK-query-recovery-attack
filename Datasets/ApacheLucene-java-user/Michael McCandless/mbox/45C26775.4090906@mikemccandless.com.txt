Phew!

Uh-oh, I can't explain why you would hit these errors on OS X 10.4.8;
we have only seen these one Windows.

Are you sure switching to trunk has fixed it?  Lockless commits makes
Lucene "write once" so this works around a number of file system
"quirks".  Still it'd be good to get to your root cause.

Is the index stored on a remote (Windows CIFS) mount?  Or is it stored
on a local (Mac OS HFS+) drive?

Yes this will be included in 2.1 -- I think 2.1 will be released soon
(there's been discussions on the dev list to get the release process
started soon).
