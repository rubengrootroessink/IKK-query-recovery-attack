This is normal behavior, unfortunately.

The default LogByteSizeMergePolicy does mergeFactor (default 10) small
merges in a row, then must do a 10X bigger merge.  Every 100 small
merges it does a 100X bigger merge, etc.

You can try using the BalancedSegmentMergePolicy (in contrib/misc) --
it tries to reduce the large merges, and never "inadvertently
optimizes" like Lucene's default merge policy.

If you do use it, please report back... we are tempted to improve the
default merge policy by either slurping BSMP into core, or, borrowing
it's approach...

If you are on Linux, you could also try using the
DirectIOLinuxDirectory, which avoid messing up the OS's buffer cache
due to merging.  But that dir impl is experimental, and you can't just
"use" it across the board (you should use it only for IndexWriter, and
possibly only when merges are kicking off).
