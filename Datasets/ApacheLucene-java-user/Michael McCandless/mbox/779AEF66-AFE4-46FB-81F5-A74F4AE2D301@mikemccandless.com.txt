Right, I mean delete by internal docID.

I guess the question is how you got that docID in the first place?  If
you got it by running a query, and deleting all docIDs that are
returned, then you could dBQ instead?

Lucene's (IndexWriter's) dbQ doesn't force a flush: it's buffered just
like other deletes and then applied in bulk at certain times.  When
autoCommit is false, currently the deletes are applied when a
merge wants to start (ie not at each segment flush).  Or, if you call
commit().
