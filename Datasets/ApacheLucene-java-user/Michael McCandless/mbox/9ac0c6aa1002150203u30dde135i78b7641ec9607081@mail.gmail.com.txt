SUBJECT: Re: Further refinement of search results - distinguishing hits with	exact phrase match from the rest
DATE: 15 Feb 2010

I don't think Lucene makes this easy, today, out of the box.  The
scoring process for a boolean query doesn't track which sub-clause had
matched.

Though, it does track the number of clauses that matched (coord).  EG
you'd be able to tell that a given hit had both clauses match, vs only
1 (just not which one).  But coord is not current exposed - you'd have
to modify BooleanScorer/2 to make that available per hit.

Alternatively, you could make a simple custom query that delegates all
scoring to another query, but tracks whether it matched a given
document.  Then, you'd make your own custom Collector that, on seeing
a competitive hit, also records which clause of the query had matched.
