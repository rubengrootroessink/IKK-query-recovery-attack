DATE: 24 Apr 2009

Make a RangeFilter that visits only docs in your time period, then run
a search w/ a custom HitCollector that looks at the source of each doc
and tallies up the results?  For performance, you'll probably need to
load the source using FieldCache (FieldCache.DEFAULT.getStrings(...)).

Or, use Solr's faceted search, or http://www.browseengine.com, or some
other facets impl, to tally up the sources.
