OK, though I still don't understand why the existence of "write.lock"
caused you to lose most of your index on creating a new writer.

Good question ... there is no good documentation, sample code, etc.,
for this as of yet ... I've been secretly hoping the first person
who creates this deletion policy would share it :)  I don't think it's
very difficult to create.  If that doesn't happen sometime soon I'll
try to make time to create an example.
