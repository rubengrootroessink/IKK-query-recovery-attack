It's probably best to use a nightly build JAR of Lucene to play with
LUCENE-843.  But, please realize this is an unreleased version of
Lucene so "use at your own risk"!  You can get nightly builds here:

You don't have to flush by ram to work with this patch; it's just that
doing so will get you best performance, when your docs have variable
sizes.  You could likewise set a large maxBufferedDocs instead (if docs
are typically the same size).  The idea is you can flush far less often
than you were before because LUCENE-843 greatly improves RAM
efficiency of buffered docs...
