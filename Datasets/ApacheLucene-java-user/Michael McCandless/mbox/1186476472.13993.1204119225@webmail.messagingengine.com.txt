Right, it's important to not overstate things here...

First off, the speedups in LUCENE-843 *only* apply to the actual time
spent in Lucene's indexing code.  Ie, time spent retrieving the doc,
running the analyzer, etc., will not get any faster (though there is
ongoing work to speed up the core analyzers...) so if the bulk of the
time in an application is not in Lucene's indexing then the speedups
will be minor.

Second off, the speedups are best for smaller docs, and, at present
you still need to either change your writer to flush by RAM or set a
large "maxBufferedDocs" in order to see the best gains.

It's also important to try these suggestions too -- they can
potentially make even more difference than LUCENE-843:
