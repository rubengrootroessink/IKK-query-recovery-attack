It indeed looks like you have an X.cfs file that is truncated.  It would
be good to get to the root cause that led to this ...

Were there any other errors leading up to this?  For example, when you
move your index after it's built, is this actually a copy (and maybe
the disk filled up when copying)?  Or a previous [initial] exception
when building the index?

Are you really sure only one writer is building the index at once?

Also is this easily reproduced?
