SUBJECT: Re: merging Parallel indexes (can indexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize be	used?)
DATE: 3 Nov 2009

addIndexesNoOptimize is only for shards.

But this [pending patch/contribution] is similar what you're seeking, I think:

  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1879

It does not actually merge the indexes, but rather keeps 2 parallel
indexes in sync so you can use ParallelReader to search them
coherently.
