I'm just going w/ the info that Log*MergePolicy use today -- checking
CFS, separate dels & norms, is done for "isOptimized"; oh, actually
IndexReader has an isOptimized(), which we could simply use, instead.

Yeah this might be acceptable in practice, though users who add a
bunch of tiny docs followed by a bunch of big docs (or v/v) may see
poor merge choices.  Maybe in practice it wouldn't be a big deal.

Right, this one seems like the deal breaker: IndexWriter should not in
general go and pool readers on all segments in the index.
