SUBJECT: Re: IndexMergeTool - Close indexes before merge?
DATE: 10 Oct 2007


Yes, you should close the indices before adding them.  Both of the addIndexes*
methods that take Directory[] require that there are no writers changing the
index in those directories.

They do not acquire the write lock in those Directories, so it's up to your
application to ensure no writer changes the index while addIndexes is running. 

I'll update the javadocs with this caveat.  Thanks for pointing it out
Patrick!
