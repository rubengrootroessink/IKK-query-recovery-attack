It's fine to do so, and you should see good concurrency (and if you
don't, please report back!).

But, note that the semantics of optimize() is that it only ensures
those segments present when the call started are the ones that will be
merged down to one.

Any newly created segments (eg flushing the docs you're adding) will
not be optimized away.
