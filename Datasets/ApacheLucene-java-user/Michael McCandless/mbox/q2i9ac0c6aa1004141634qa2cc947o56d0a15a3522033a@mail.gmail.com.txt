SUBJECT: Re: Utility program to extract a segment
DATE: 14 Apr 2010

I don't think there's an existing tool, but it shouldn't be too hard to create.

Create a new SegmentInfos(), then call its .read(oldDir) to read all
segments.  Look up the SegmentInfo(s) you want to copy and call their
.files() methods to see which files to copy.  Copy them.  Remove all
other segments from the SegmentInfos, then .write(newDir).
