The description here sounds exactly like what we were seeing before  
LUCENE-669 was fixed -- from his writeup it doesn't look like he  
tested with Lucene 2.2 to see if the problem went away.  I think it  
very well may.

That said, as a precaution, maybe we should no longer call close() on  
our file descriptors in the finalizers in FSIndex{Input,Output}?
