It's really easy to make a codec that eg copies Standard but swaps in
FixedGap terms index instead...

Though, if you just want to get to the last term... VarGap's terms
index can quickly tell you the last indexed term, and from there you
can scan to the last term?  (It'd be at most 32 (by default) scans).
