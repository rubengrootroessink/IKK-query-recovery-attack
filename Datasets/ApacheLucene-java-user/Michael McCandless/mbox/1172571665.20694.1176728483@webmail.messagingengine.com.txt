These two issues (fixed in 2.1) look like they could be what you
are hitting:

  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-669

  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-665

Also, newer versions of Lucene don't try to directly delete a file like
that.  Instead, it attempts the delete but catches an IOException and
queues the file to retry deletion later.
