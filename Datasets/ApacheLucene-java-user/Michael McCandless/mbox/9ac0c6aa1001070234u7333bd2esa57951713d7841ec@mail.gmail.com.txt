SUBJECT: Re: Is there a way to limit the size of an index?
DATE: 7 Jan 2010

I don't think this is implemented [yet] today.  You'd have to
implement the Directory, IndexInput and IndexOutput classes, to make
this work.

Do you have a hard 2GB limit on index files?  Setting
maxMergeDocs/Size (via LogByteSizeMergePolicy) lets you approximately
limit the size...
