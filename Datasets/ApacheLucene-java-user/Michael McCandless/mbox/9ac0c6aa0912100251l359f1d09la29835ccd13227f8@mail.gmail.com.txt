Integer field should take much less RAM than String, today, for
sorting.  And there's no efficiency gained by doing this globally (per
segment is just fine).

GC will "eventually" reclaim it, but there is this issue in progress:

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2135

to improve the immediacy, ie, on closing your reader, the FieldCache
entries will be reclaimed.  (There's also an exciting LUCENE-2133 in
progress, with a good improvement to FieldCache, that'll fix the issue
even better).

are referenced to single cache?

They'll be GCd, as long as your app doesn't hold references to the old
readers.  They're stored in a WeakHashMap, keyed by the IndexReader.
