I think to do this efficiently you'd need to modify Lucene's builtin  
query classes (eg TermQuery) such that during the scoring process, in  
addition to simply computing its contribution to the document's score,  
it would also record further information like total number of  
occurrences of each term, which docs had which terms, etc.

I don't think there's a simple efficient way to do this with Lucene  
today, though if your result sets are small enough term vectors might  
be fine.
