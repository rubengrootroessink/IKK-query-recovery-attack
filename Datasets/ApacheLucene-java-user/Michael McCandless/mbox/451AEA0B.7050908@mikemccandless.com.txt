Also, you could use a try / finally and always close the IndexWriter in
the finally clause, which should release the lock.  However, it sounds
like something else is up if you are hitting alot of errors when writing
the index.

We are working on a locking implementation that uses OS native locks
(instead of file existence locking now used).  This would fix the case
where the JVM has crashed or was killed (ie, the OS will release the
lock for us).
