Hmm, OK.  Pre-2.1 Lucene will overwrite at least the file "segments",
*.del (per segment deletions) and *.sN (only if you set norms, which
is a rather advanced function).  So probably best to use something
like "rsync" which I believe looks @ timestamp and file size to
determine that a file has changed, and then copies it over.

Also make sure all writers are closed before running the backup and no
writer opens until the backup completes (ie they are exclusive).
