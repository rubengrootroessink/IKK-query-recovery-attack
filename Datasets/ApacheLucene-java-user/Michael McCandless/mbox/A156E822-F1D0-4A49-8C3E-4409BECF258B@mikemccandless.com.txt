By default (in 2.3) the writer only flushes when RAM usage hit 16  
MB.  It should not flush due to # buffered docs nor # buffered delete  
terms, and, that method call shouldn't be necessary since it's  
already the default.

Right, if you disable it (as above), it won't flush by count but  
rather by RAM.

Yes whenever a flush occurs (due to any trigger) both buffered docs  
and buffered deletes are flushed.
