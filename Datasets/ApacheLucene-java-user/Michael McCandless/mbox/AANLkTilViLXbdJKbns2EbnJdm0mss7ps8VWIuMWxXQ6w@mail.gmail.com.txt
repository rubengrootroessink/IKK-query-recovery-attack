This is a bug in how Lucene handles IOException while closing files.

Look at SegmentMerger's sources, for 2.3.2:

  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/tags/lucene_2_3_2/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/SegmentMerger.java

Look at the finally clause in mergeTerms:

    } finally {
      if (freqOutput != null) freqOutput.close();
      if (proxOutput != null) proxOutput.close();
      if (termInfosWriter != null) termInfosWriter.close();
      if (queue != null) queue.close();
    }

You are hitting an exception in that freqOutput.close, which means the
proxOutput (*.prx) and termInfosWriter (*.tii, *.tis) are not
successfully closed.  It looks like the bug is still present to some
degree through 3x, but fixed (at least specifically for segment
merging, but likely not in other places) in trunk.

Likely what happened is you hit a disk full inside the "try" part, and
so the finally clause went to close the files, but close then tries to
flush the pending buffer, which also hits disk full.
