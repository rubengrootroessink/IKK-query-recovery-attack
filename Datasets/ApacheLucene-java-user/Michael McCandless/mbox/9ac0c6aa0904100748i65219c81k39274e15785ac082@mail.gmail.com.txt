SUBJECT: Re: RangeFilter performance problem using MultiReader
DATE: 10 Apr 2009

Unfortunately, in Lucene 2.4, any query that needs to enumerate Terms
(Prefix, Wildcard, Range, etc.) has poor performance on Multi*Readers.
 I think the only workaround is to merge your indexes down to a single
index.

But, Lucene trunk (not yet released) has fixed this, so that searching
through your MultiReader should give you the same performance as
searching on a single consolidated index -- if you test this (which
would be awesome!) please report back and let us know how it went.
