SUBJECT: WARNING: re-index all trunk indices
DATE: 20 Jan 2011

If you are using Lucene's trunk (to be 4.0) builds, read on...

I just committed LUCENE-2872, which is a hard break on the index file format.

If you are living on Lucene's trunk then you have to remove any
previously created indices and re-index, after updating.

The change cuts over to a faster on-disk terms dictionary format,
which block-encodes term data & metadata between indexed
terms.
