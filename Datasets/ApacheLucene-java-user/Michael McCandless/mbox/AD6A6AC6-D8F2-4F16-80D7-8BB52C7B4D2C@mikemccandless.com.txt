This example is the exception not the rule, though (simple things  
should be
simple... complex things should be possible).  I think we should make
this case possible, but it need not be simple.

EG one could always still use an untyped field to do expert things.

Whereas we have the reverse today: if I simply want to add a number
field to my docs, and search it by range and sort by it, it's far from
simple.
