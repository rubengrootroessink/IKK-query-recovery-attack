OK but 2.3.3 isn't going to help you here -- it doesn't change  
anything about deletion of docs.

If you need to delete by doc id, this is true.  You must close your  
IndexWriter before attempting the delete from an IndexReader, and vice/

Can you delete by query instead?  That you can do from IndexWriter.
