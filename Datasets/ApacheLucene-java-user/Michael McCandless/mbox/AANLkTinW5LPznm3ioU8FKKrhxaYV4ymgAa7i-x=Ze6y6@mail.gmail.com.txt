DATE: 1 Dec 2010

The FSDirectory does not itself hold any open files.

All that its close method actually does is disable future operations against it.

Still, it is a good practice to close it (after you've closed all IRs
and IWs) since this can help you catch bugs in your app (ie, if you
hit AlreadyClosedException you'll know you're using a "stale" FSDir).

There are behavior differences eg b/w Windows & Unix, but OS X and
Linux ought to behave similarly.  Can you describe more details on
what you're seeing?

FYI, we use FSDirectory with a SingleInstanceLockFactory for all of our indexes right now.

need a directory object (e.g. opening an indexWriter, checking to see if an index is locked,
etc.).
