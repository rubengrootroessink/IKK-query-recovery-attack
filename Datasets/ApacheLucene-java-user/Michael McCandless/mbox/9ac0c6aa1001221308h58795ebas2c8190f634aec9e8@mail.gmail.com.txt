It looks like each IW writes to a private log file -- could you zip up
all such files and attach as a zip file (CC me directly because the
list strips attachments)?  It can give me a bigger picture than just
these fragments...

OK

I suspect the corruption happened before that, ie, somehow the
deletions file for a segment got overwritten.  To bound the time I
guess we have look back to the reopen before the corrupt IndexReader
(which didn't hit the corruption).

Right but we need to see logs from earlier...

Need to see all the infoStream log files to really be sure...

There was one delete-by-Term buffered (and no added docs) for the
first commit, and the reverse for the 2nd case.

It looks like the deleted Term did not in fact match a document and so
the flush & commit were skipped.

You should also try making new RAMDirs instead of reusing the same one
-- if that still hits GC problems then something else is wrong: once a
RAMDir & all readers/writers using it are closed, it should be easy to
GC.

Or, another thing you could try is to swap in MockRAMDirectory (from
Lucene's tests): it will throw an exception if you attempt to close it
when the readers/writers didn't in fact close all their files.  If you
hit that exception you know something isn't being closed... it's a
good way to catch bugs...
