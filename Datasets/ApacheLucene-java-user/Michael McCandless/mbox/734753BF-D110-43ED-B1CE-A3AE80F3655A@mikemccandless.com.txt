SUBJECT: Re: updating existing field values
DATE: 7 Aug 2008


It's also possible to create your own code that uses FieldsReader and  
FieldsWriter (both in org.apache.lucene.index) directly to create new  
fdx/fdt files, with the date fixed on each document.  You'd have to  
enumerate over all segments in your index, create a FieldsReader  
instance on each, create a FieldsWriter writing to a new segment name,  
iterate through the docs fixing your date, calling  
FieldsWriter.writeField per field then flushDocument to finish the  
document.

I think that should work, but I've never tried it!

Your code would have to be in org.apache.lucene.index since these  
classes are package private.
