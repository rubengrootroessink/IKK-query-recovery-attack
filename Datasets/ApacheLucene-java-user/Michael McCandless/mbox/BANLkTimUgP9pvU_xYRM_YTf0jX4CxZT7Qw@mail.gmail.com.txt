That's fine -- even if you don't keep multiple commit points in your
index, when a commit() op fails, then you can end up with two
segments_N files.  The older one is "good" (last successful commit)
and the new one is broken.

OK, so you have 2 segments_N files because something went wrong during
commit of the 2nd one.

It will always be the "older" one that was the last successful commit,
unless you keep multiple commit points in the index.

Hmmm -- what code are you running here, to print the number of docs?
new IndexWriter(), with create=true?  I would have expected IR.open to
throw an exc here.

I'm not sure, unless you are opening with IW and create=true.
