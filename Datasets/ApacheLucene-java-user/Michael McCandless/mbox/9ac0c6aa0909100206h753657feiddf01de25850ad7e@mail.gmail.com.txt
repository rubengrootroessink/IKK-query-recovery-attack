DATE: 10 Sep 2009

First, you need to limit the size of segments initially created by
IndexWriter due to newly added documents.  Probably the simplest way
is to call IndexWriter.commit() frequently enough.  You might want to
use IndexWriter.ramSizeInBytes() to gauge how much RAM is currently
consumed by IndexWriter's buffer to determine when to commit.  But it
won't be an exact science, ie, the segment size will be different from
the RAM buffer size.  So, experiment w/ it...

Second, you need to prevent merging from creating a segment that's too
large.  For this I would use the setMaxMergeMB method of the
LogByteSizeMergePolicy (which is IndexWriter's default merge policy).
But note that this max size applies to the *input* segments, so you'd
roughly want that to be 1.0 MB (your 10.0 MB divided by the merge
factor = 10), but probably make it smaller to be sure things stay
small enough.

Note that with this approach, if your index is large enough, you'll
wind up with many segments and search performance will suffer when
compared to an index that doesn't have this max 10.0 MB file size
restriction.
