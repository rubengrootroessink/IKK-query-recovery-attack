The lengthNorm() method, I believe, is only called during indexing.  Its 
purpose is to translate the number of terms that occurred in a given 
field, into a score factor that is used at query time.

Can you verify that you called IndexWriter.setSimilarity() (as above) 
before adding documents to the index?  And then see if your lengthNorm() 
is then being called?
