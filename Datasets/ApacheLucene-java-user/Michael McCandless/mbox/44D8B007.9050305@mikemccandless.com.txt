The lock files are just files, so you can up and remove them.

However: this is in general dangerous and should not be necessary.

Lucene uses the lock files to ensure index readers/writers across 
different JVMs, or within a single JVM, do not step on each other.  If 
you remove them you can corrupt your index.

It's fine if you have multiple Lucene indices sharing the same lock 
directory; each index will create a different name for its lock file.
