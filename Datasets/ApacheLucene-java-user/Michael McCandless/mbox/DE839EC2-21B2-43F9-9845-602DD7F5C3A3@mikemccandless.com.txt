SUBJECT: [ANNOUNCE] Lucene Java 2.4.1 released
DATE: 9 Mar 2009


Release 2.4.1 of Lucene is now available.

This release fixes bugs from 2.4.0, including one data loss bug where
in certain situations binary fields would be truncated to 0 bytes.
2.4.1 has no new features, nor API changes or changes to file formats,
so it's fully compatible with 2.4.0.

See changes at http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/changes/Changes.html

Binary and source distributions are available at
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/

Lucene artifacts are also available in the Maven2 repository at
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/lucene/
