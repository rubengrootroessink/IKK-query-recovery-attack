This isn't quite true.  If you open IndexWriter with autoCommit=false,  
then none of the changes you do with it will be visible to an  
IndexReader, even one reopened while IndexWriter is doing its work,  
until you close the IndexWriter.

With autoCommit=true, it's true IndexWriter will periodically make  
some part of the changes visible to a reader that reopens.
