Release 2.9.1 of Apache Lucene java is now available.

This release fixes bugs from 2.9.0, including one serious bug whereby
BooleanQuery could silently fail to retrieve certain matching
documents.

There are also some minor API changes, including a Version parameter
added to QueryParser and contrib Analyzers, so that version dependent
defaults are consistent across classes, as well as un-deprecating of
certain methods (we were too zealous in a few cases!).

Otherwise the changes are all bug fixes and documentation
improvements.

This release is fully compatible with 2.9.0.  We strongly recommend
upgrading to 2.9.1 if you are using 2.9.0.  Furthermore, because some
additional APIs were deprecated in 2.9.1, to ensure a clean ("JAR drop
in") upgrade to 3.0 you'll need to verify your code compiles against
2.9.1 without deprecation warnings.
