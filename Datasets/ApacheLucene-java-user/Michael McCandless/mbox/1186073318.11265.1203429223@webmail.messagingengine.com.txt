SUBJECT: Re: Clustered Indexing on common network filesystem
DATE: 2 Aug 2007


I have been meaning to write up a Wiki page on this general topic but
have not quite made time yet ...

Sharing an index with a shared filesystem will work, however there are
some caveats:

  * This is somewhat unchartered territory because it's fairly recent
    fixes to Lucene that have enabled the things below to work, and,
    it's not a heavily tested area.  Please share your experience so
    we all can learn...

  * If the filesystem does not protect against deletion of open files
    (notably NFS does not, however SMB/CIFS does) then you will need
    to create a custom DeletionPolicy based on your app logic so
    writer & readers "agree" on when it's safe to delete prior commit
    points.

    This can be something simple like "readers always refresh at least
    once per hour so any commit point older than 1 hour may be safely
    deleted".

  * Locking: if your app can ensure only one writer is active at a
    time, you can disable locking in Lucene entirely.  Else, it's best
    to use NativeFSLockFactory, if you can.

  * If you are using a filesystem that does not have coherent caching
    on directory listing (NFS clients often do not), and, different
    nodes can "become" the writer (vs a single dedicated writer node)
    then there is one known open issue that you'll hit once you make
    your own DeletionPolicy which I still have to port to trunk:

      http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-948

But as Mark said, performance is likely quite poor and so you may want
to take an approach like Solr (or, use Solr) whereby a single writer
makes changes to the index.  Then these changes are efficiently
propagated to multiple hosts (hard link & rsync is one way but not the
only way), and these hosts then search their private copy via their
local filesystem.
