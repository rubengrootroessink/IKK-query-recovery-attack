Is that IndexReader reading multiple segments or single segment?

comparing 2.4.0 and 3.0.2 revealed that there is some new synchronization on the SegmentTermDocs
constructor and the SegmentReader.getTermsReader().  The first call to next() hits this synchronization,
causing a 4x slowdown on an 8 CPU machine.

There was some added sync, however, the code within those sync blocks
is minuscule (looking up a field).  It's weird that you're seeing a 4X
hit because of this.  We could conceivably optimize this code to avoid
the sync blocks if the reader is readOnly.

list that would be more efficient?  The synchronization appears to be on aspects of these
classes that the next() operation is not concerned with.

Are you sorting your terms in index-sort order (UTF16, ie
String.compareTo)?  This can be an important gain especially if you
have many terms.

Also, if you are working with your top reader, you should see some
perf gain by instead working w/ the sub readers directly, ie:

  for(IndexReader subReader : indexReader.getSequentialSubReaders()) {
     ...
  }

Also, instead of getting a new TermDocs every time, you should get a
single TermDocs up front (IndexReader.termDocs()), and then seek it to
your term (termDocs.seek(term)), validate the term in seek'd to in
fact matches what you asked for, then iterate its docs.

These APIs are very different in the next major release (4.0) of
Lucene, so except for problems spotted by users like you, there's not
much more dev happening against them.
