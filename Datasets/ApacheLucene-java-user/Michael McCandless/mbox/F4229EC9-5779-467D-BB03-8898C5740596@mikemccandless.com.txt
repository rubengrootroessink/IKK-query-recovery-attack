Or ... split the two notions apart so that you have Field.Index. 
[UN_]ANALYZED and, separately, Field.Index.[NO_]NORMS which could then  
be combined together in all 4 combinations (we'd have to fix the  
Parameter class to let you build up a new Parameter by combining  
existing ones...).

I think naming things well is just as important as good javadocs  
explaining things.

But: I think these changes should probably wait until we work out how  
to refactor AbstractField/Fieldable/Field?
