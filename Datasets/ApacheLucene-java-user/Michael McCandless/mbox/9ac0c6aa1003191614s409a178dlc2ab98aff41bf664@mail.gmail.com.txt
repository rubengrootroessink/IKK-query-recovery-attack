SUBJECT: Re: PhraseQuery Performance Issues [Lucene 2.9.0]
DATE: 19 Mar 2010

Nutch/Solr's CommonGrams is the right way to solve this.  It combines
frequent terms (eg stopwords) with adjacent terms.  So "the wizard of
oz" will be indexed eg as the_wizard wizard_of of_oz.  It'll require a
full re-index though, and you have to fixup searching so that the same
term expansion works.

Lucene does no caching that'd speed up PhraseQuery (unless that was
the very first query against the field since you opened the reader) --
this is probably the OS's IO cache.

In our index, we do not remove stopwords, so things like "the" and "is" are getting indexed
on purpose.
