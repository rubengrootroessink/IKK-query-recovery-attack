Lucene doesn't actually have any builtin ability to "notify" all other
searchers that they should re-open.  So you have to do this part yourself.

However, the IndexReader class has an "isCurrent()" method, which you
could periodically call (say once every N minutes or something) to check
if it's time to re-open.
