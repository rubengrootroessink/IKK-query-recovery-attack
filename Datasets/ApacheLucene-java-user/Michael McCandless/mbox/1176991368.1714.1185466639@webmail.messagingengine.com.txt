NFS performance is generally slower than local filesystem, though
there may be ways to tune it (I'm not sure).  I have heard but not
personally verified that mounting NFS read-only (eg for your readers)
gives performance gains.

However one big caveat on having readers access index via NFS: the
"point in time" searching that a reader normally guarantees will not
work, because the writer will remove files in use by the readers.  But,
as of the Lucene trunk (not yet released) it is now possible to fix
this with knowledge of when readers will refresh (based on your
application's design) by creating your own custom deletion policy.

See here for gory details:
