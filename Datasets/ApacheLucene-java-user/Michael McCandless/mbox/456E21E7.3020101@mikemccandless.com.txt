Hi,

It's been 2 months since this thread, but, in a separate JIRA issue:

     http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-669

We see an IOException very similar to the one at the start of this
thread.  It's due to a bug in Lucene (and we believe also a bug in the
JVM -- but this is sort of speculation) where Lucene is closing an
already closed RandomAccessFile in a finalize() method.

Anyway, Van, if you are still here then you may want to test the patch
on that issue above (just committed to the trunk version of Lucene) to
see if it fixes your issue!

Mike
