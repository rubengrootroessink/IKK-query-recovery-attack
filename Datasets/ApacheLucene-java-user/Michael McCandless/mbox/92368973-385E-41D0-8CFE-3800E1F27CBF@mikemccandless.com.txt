If you create IndexWriter with create=true in a directory that has no  
Lucene index, segments_1 is created.

If you do the same, but in a directory that already has a Lucene  
index, segments_(N+1) is created (where N was the last generation of  
the current index in that directory).

But... this is an internal detail to Lucene's index format and could  
change in some future release.
