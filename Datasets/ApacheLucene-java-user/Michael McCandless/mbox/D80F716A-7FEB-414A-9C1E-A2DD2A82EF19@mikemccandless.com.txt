DATE: 4 Feb 2009


These files are normal Lucene segment files (in compound file  
format).  What's odd is that Lucene is not merging them down to a  
smaller set of segments.

Have you done any advanced things, like customize the deletion or  
merge policy?

When you close you writer, are you using just close() or close(false)?

If you can set the InfoStream on the writer for one of your  
incremental update sessions and post the results, maybe that will shed  
some light one what's going on.

Are you sure there are no exceptions being logged somewhere?  Lucene  
runs merges with background threads (by default), and if those threads  
hit unhandled exceptions it's possible they are logged somewhere you  
wouldn't normally look?
