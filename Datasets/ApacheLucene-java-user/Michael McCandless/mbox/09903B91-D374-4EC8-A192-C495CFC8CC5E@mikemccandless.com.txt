No, they aren't.  Not until 2.4 (trunk).

You're welcome!  I agree: optimizing seek time seems likely to be the  
biggest win.

Segments aren't kept in memory during merging... it's more like a  
cursor that sweeps through each of the files for the 50 segments being  
merged.  Lucene does buffer its reads, so we read a chunk into RAM and  
then pull bits off that chunk.  And the OS does readahead.  But  
otherwise it's all on disk and we make a single sweep through each of  
the segments to be merged.

So I wouldn't expect the disk cache's performance to impact Lucene,  
during merging or flushing.
