SUBJECT: Re: best way to ensure IndexWriter won't corrupt the index?
DATE: 26 Nov 2009

Right, in 2.4, if you kill -9, pull power, OS crashes, etc., it should
not corrupt the index.

Can you share details on what corruption you see?  Is it possible
there are two IndexWriters open on the index at once?
