Note that this use case (accessing one shared Lucene index from
different JVMs even on different machines) is supposed to work, but
there are known issues on certain platforms/filesystems.

For example, see this post for recent progress on intermittent file
renaming errors some people hit on Windows:

     http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/39974

And see this for progress on getting Lucene to work over NFS (and
likely other remote filesystems):

     http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-673

And finally we are working on small changes to Lucene's file format so
that the commit lock (a source of quite a few issues) is not necessary
("lock-less commits"), to prevent the various problems people have
with locking (and NFS!):

We would like to the bottom of all such low-level robustness cases so
if you are hitting unexplained exceptions that don't seem to fit into
one of these three cases (windows renaming errors; nfs errors; locking
errors) please reply to this!  Thanks.

Mike
