SUBJECT: Re: Multiple IndexReaders from the same Index Directory - issues with Locks / performance
DATE: 23 Dec 2008


Locking is completely unused from IndexReader unless you do deletes or  
change norms, so sharing a remote mounted index is just fine (except  
for performance concerns).

If you're using 2.4, you should open your readers with readOnly=true.
