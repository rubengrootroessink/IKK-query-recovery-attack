Well, you could use IndexReader.getSequentialSubReaders(), then step
through that array of SegmentReaders, making a seprate external file
for each?

This way, when you reopen your readers, you would only need to make a
new external file for those segments that are new.

But if re-creating the entire file on each reopen isn't a problem for
you then there's no need to change this :)

Looks like you already answered this (Lucene asks the Query's weight
for a new scorer one segment at a time).

Hmm -- if you are extending HitCollector and passing that to search(),
then the docIDs fed to it should already be top-level docIDs, not
segment relative.
