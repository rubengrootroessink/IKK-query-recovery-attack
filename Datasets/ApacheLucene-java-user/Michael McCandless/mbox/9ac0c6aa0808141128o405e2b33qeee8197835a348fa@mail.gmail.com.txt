SUBJECT: Re: Do doc-ids always increment by 1 if no deletion is done?
DATE: 14 Aug 2008

This is true of Lucene today, with one exception: if an
add/updateDocument call hits an exception it's possible it consumed a
docID (which is immediately marked as deleted).  This will cause your
index to have deletions.

I don't think this behavior is guaranteed in future releases of Lucene.
