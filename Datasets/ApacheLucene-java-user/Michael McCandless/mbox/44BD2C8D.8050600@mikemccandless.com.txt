Unfortunately, there are known issues with locking and NFS.  The lock 
files (and underlying locking protocol) do not work reliably when used 
over NFS, and I believe this exception (FileNotFoundException) is one of 
the manifestations of this.

We're working on making locking more flexible (see 
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-305), so this issue will 
hopefully be correctly addressed in a future version of Lucene.

But in the meantime as a workaround you could either do your own 
external locking (tricky) or you could take safe snapshots of your index 
and share that.  For example, your single Writer could make a safe 
snapshot of the index when the Writer is closed, and then have all 
Searchers cutover to this safe copy once it's done.

Definitely look at how the Solr project:

   http://incubator.apache.org/solr/features.html
   http://incubator.apache.org/solr/tutorial.html

accomplishes this.  They have developed a sophisticated "snapshot" 
capability for distributing index copies around.  Even if you don't use 
Solr and even if you still want a single copy of the index (not 1 per 
Searcher) you can still borrow Solr's techniques (the nice "cp -l -r" 
trick for example) for making a safe copy of the index.
