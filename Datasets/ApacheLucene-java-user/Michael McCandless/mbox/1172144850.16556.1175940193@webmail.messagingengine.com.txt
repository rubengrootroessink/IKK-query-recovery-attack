Yes.  More generally, whenever there have been changes to an index
that you want your readers/searchers to see, you need to re-open the
reader/searcher.  A reader keeps a "point in time" view of the index
as of when it was open, and will not show any changes until it is
re-opened.

I don't really understand this question -- could you provide more
detail here?
