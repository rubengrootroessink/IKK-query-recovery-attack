Can you look in the Lucene core JAR's manifest and report back what  
version information you see?  (It should contain the timestamp that  
the JAR was built).

I committed this workaround to the 2.3 branch on May 22.

We don't currently have any automated build that pushes snapshot  
builds into maven on the 2.3 branch; my guess is that 2.3-SNAPSHOT in  
maven was from the last trunk build before 2.3 was released (which  
would not contain this fix), though I'm not sure why it has timestamp  
July 22.
