Yeah good point.  Seems like a long shot (wishful thinking on my
part!).

Your errors seem to happen around the same area (~20K docs).  If you
skip the first say ~18K docs does the error still happen?  We need to
somehow narrow this down.

Or is there any way I could get a temporary account to log into this
box and try to track this down?  (If indeed it doesn't happen on an
x86 box -- I unfortunately don't have access to a PPC machine).
