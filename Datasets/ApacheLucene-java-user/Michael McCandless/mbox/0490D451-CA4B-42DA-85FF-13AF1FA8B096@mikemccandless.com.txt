If you're on Windows, the safest way to do this in general, if there  
is any possibility that readers are still using the index, is to  
create a new IndexWriter with create=true.  Windows does not let you  
remove open files.  IndexWriter will gracefully handle failed deletes  
by retrying them over time...
