Right, you just need to make a custom IndexDeletionPolicy.  NFS makes
no effort to protect deletion of still-open files.

A simple approach is one that only deletes a commit if it's more than
XXX minutes/hours old, such that XXX is set higher than the frequency
that IndexReaders are guaranteed to have reopened.

The TestDeletionPolicy unit test in Lucene's sources has the
ExperiationTimeDeletionPolicy that you can use (but scrutinize!).

Another alternative is to simply reopen the reader whenever you hit
Stale file handle (think of it as NFS's means of notifying you that
your reader is no longer current ;) ).  But, if reopen time is
potentially long for your app, it's no good to make queries pay that
cost and the deletion policy is better.
