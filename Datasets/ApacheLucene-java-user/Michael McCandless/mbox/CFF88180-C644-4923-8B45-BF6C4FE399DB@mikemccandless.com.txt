Hi Stu,

I just committed the fix for this, on 2.4 & 2.3.2.  If you're able to  
test that this fixes your hang that'd be great.  If not that's fine  
(I got a unit test to reproduce the issue).

It's quite easy:

   svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/branches/ 
lucene_2_3 lucene.23x
   cd lucene.23x
   ant jar-core

(you need svn & ant)

then copy build/lucene-core-2.3.jar to your application.
