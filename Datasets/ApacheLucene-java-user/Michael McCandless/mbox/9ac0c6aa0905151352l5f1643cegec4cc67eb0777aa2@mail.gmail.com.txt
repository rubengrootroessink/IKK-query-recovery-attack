You should try to share a single IndexWriter instance across "Build
Indices" and "Application".  Also, you shouldn't open a new
IndexWriter for each document added (nor, call optimize), if possible.

Lucene doesn't allow more than one IndexWriter to be open at once on
the same index (the write lock enforces this).

the index file.  I am sure that the writer in the build indices loop is closed after each
element is added therefore releasing the lock.  I have set the WRITE_LOCK_TIMEOUT to 10 seconds.
 I can see the build indices process close the writer many times over those 10 seconds, but
I see the application wait 10 seconds and timeout with a lock timeout exception.  The loop
in the build indices process is running very fast but I would guess that when the application
asks for the lock it should be able to see the lock free (even for just a short amount of
time) because it should be next in line.   Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here,
or is this a problem with the way lucene locks.
