That's right.

The transactional semantics are still intact... it's just that an NRT
reader sees the uncommitted changes, ie, all changes done since the
last commit.

If disaster strikes (machine/os/jvm crashes, power loss, kill -9,
etc.) then on reboot/restart your index will still only show the last
successfull commit.
