OK.

For your multiple-index-writer test, how much time is spent building  
the N indices vs merging them in the end?

So in the single-index-writer vs multiple-index-writer tests, this  
part (64 threads that construct document objects) is unchanged, right?

How do you rate limit the 64 threads?  (Ie, slow them down when they  
get too far ahead of indexing).

If you only process documents with the 64 threads (but not index  
them), what percentage of the total time is that?  I'd like to tease  
out "building documents" vs "indexing" times.

Also, for the indexing tests, make sure you run with autoCommit=false.

But I'm confused: why do you need 64 threads to build up the  
documents?  Gunzipping should be very low CPU cost.  Are you pre- 
analyzing the fields on your documents?
