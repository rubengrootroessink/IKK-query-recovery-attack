You could look at the docID of each hit, and compare to the .maxDoc()  
of each underlying reader.

MultiSearcher logically "concatenates" the docIDs.

However, docIDs are an internal identifier for Lucene, so it's always  
possible in a new release of Lucene that how docIDs are mapped by  
MultiSearcher would change.
