SortField.FIELD_SCORE lets you sort by relevance.

So then make a Sort that contains an array of two SortFields, eg:

   new Sort(new SortField[] {SortField.FIELD_SCORE, new  
SortField(myField)})

and pass that when searching.  Lucene will then sort first by score,  
and when there are ties, second by myField (doing auto-detection to  
infer that field's type; if you know the type, pass that down when you  
create the SortField).
