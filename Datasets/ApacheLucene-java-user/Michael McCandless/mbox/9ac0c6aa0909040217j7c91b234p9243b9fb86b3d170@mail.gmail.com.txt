+1

Or, so that the current consumers of FieldCache (that hardwire to
FieldCache.DEFAULT) could simply accept any other FieldCache
instance, as Hoss suggested.

+1, sounds cool!

Me too... 2.9 train is moving out of the station now!

FieldCache is only opened on demand, ie, the first time that a newly
opened reader calls FieldCache.DEFAULT.getXXX does it get populated.

So it's not during the reopen... it's during the first query that eg sorts
by a field.

It'd be great if your use case gives us enough clarity on LUCENE-831
to make concrete progress.

Note that function queries already "wrap" FieldCache w/ an alternate API
for native value per doc (ValueSource, DocValues, FieldCacheSource),
that do allow custom ValueSources to be provided.  It'd be great if
as part of LUCENE-831 they could be more unified w/ FieldCache's
API.
