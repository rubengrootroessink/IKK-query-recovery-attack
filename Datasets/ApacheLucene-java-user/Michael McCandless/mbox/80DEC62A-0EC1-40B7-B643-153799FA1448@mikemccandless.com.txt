Looks like you already found it, but the javadoc says this:

      * @deprecated please call {@link #commit()}) instead

I just fixed the javadoc to say:

    *  Use {@link  
#IndexWriter(Directory,Analyzer,boolean,MaxFieldLength)} instead.

There were two changes that affect that constructor.  First, the  
autoCommit boolean will go away in 3.0, and IndexWriter will be  
hardwired to "autoCommit=false".  You can always call commit on your  
own schedule if needed.  Second, all IndexWriter ctor's now take an  
IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength instance (you can use LIMITED or UNLIMITED,  
or make your own).  This is just making the usual maxFieldLength  
setting in IndexWriter more in-your-face so that everyone is aware  
when they make an IndexWriter that it can truncate input documents  
(since it was a trap before).
