Well... there are a couple threads on java-dev discussing this "now":

   http://www.nabble.com/2.9-3.0-plan---Java-1.5-td20972994.html
   http://www.nabble.com/2.9,-3.0-and-deprecation-td20099343.html

though they seem to have petered out.

Also we have 29 open issues for 2.9:

   https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&&pid=12310110&fixfor=12312682&resolution=-1&sorter/field=priority&sorter/order=DESC

For 2.4 it took at least a month to whittle the list down to 0.

So it's hard to say?  I'd love to see 2.9 out earlyish next year though.
