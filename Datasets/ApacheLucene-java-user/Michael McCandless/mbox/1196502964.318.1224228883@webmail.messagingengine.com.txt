How do your separate servers share the index?  What remote filesytem
are you using here?

Which version of Lucene are you using?  Read-only use of the index
(using an IndexReader without using any of its "writing" methods like
deleteDocument or setNorm) should not do any locking against the
index, as of Lucene 2.1.

If you have a reader open on the index, then the reader will hold
these files open so they cannot be deleted (until that reader/readers
close).  If you then fully re-index into that same directory, that
would explain the 2X usage.

This is simple:

  Directory dir = new RAMDirectory(otherDir)

will load all files in otherDir into RAM.  Then you can pass that dir
to IndexReader.open or IndexSearcher.  This will work fine with
MoreLikeThis and all other searching, etc.  But just remember since
this is a RAMDirectory, if you make any changes to it, they won't be
saved to disk unless you explicitly do so.

You can call IndexReader.isCurrent() if you have a reader open on the
disk-based Directory, or, IndexReader.getCurrenVersion (static method)
if you don't; when that version number changes, your index has
changed.
