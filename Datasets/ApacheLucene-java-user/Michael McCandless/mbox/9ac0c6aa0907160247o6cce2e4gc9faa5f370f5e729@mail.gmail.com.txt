Whoa, so LUCENE-1744 did in fact fix the problem?  (I thought you had
accidentally failed to setAllowDocsOutOfOrder(true) and that made us
falsely think it had fixed it when it had not).  I keep getting
confused here.

>From the trace I can see you have a toplevel BS that somehow uses 2
BS2 sub-scorers.  I don't get how the query you posted can do that --
your query should get rewritten to a big OR-query such that we see a
BS with many TermScorers as its subscorers.  Ie it's as if you're
somehow actually running a query like this:

    (x OR y OR z) OR (a OR b OR c)
