DATE: 3 Mar 2010

The worst case RAM usage for Lucene is a single doc with many unique
terms.  Lucene allocates ~60 bytes per unique term (plus space to hold
that term's characters = 2 bytes per char).  And, Lucene cannot flush
within one document -- it must flush after the doc has been fully
indexed.

This past thread (also from Paul) delves into some of the details:

  http://lucene.markmail.org/thread/pbeidtepentm6mdn

But it's not clear whether that is the issue affecting Ajay -- I think
more details about the docs, or, some code fragments, could help shed
light.
