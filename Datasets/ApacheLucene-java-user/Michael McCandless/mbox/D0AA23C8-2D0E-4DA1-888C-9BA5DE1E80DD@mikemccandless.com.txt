SUBJECT: API changes in 2.4
DATE: 1 Dec 2008


Heads up: there are two API changes in 2.4 that might bite you on
upgrading:

   * If you are subclassing QueryParser and override addClause or
     getBooleanQuery, you need to change the argument type from Vector
     to List, else your method won't be called.  This was caused by
     LUCENE-1369, where I accidentally broke back compatibility
     (sorry!!).

   * If you use Document.getFieldables, getFields, getValues or
     getBinaryValues, these methods now return an empty list instead of
     null if there are 0 things to return.  If you have code that
     checks != null you need to change it to .size() != 0.  This was
     from LUCENE-1233
