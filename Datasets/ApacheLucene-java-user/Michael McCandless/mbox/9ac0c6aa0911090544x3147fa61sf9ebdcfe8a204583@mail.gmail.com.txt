I don't expect IndexFileNameFilter will ever look at that (File
directory) argument.  Lucene itself does the same thing (passes null),
internally, whenever it uses IndexFileNameFilter.

Honestly I thought the effort to write the above code was trivial
enough that preserving this inside Lucene was not necessary.  But I
guess would have been good to include such a code fragment in the
javadocs for list().

Stepping back, since presumably your app knows what it's storing in
the directory, can't you filter for files you know you've created?
What's the larger use case here?
