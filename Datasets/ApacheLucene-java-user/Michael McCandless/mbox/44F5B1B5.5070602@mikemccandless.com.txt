Yes, good catch :)

This always confuses people, but it's actually "normal" (when a segments 
file is missing) because Lucene first checks whether the compound-file 
exists and if it does it will use that.  If it does not, it falls back 
to trying to directly open the individual files against the filesystem.

So, when there is a problem and a given segment is referenced but does 
not exist, you will see this [confusing] exception making it look like 
Lucene "forgot" that it's using the compound file format.
