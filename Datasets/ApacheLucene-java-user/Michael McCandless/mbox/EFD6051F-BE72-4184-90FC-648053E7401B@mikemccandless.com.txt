Technically you should call directory.close() as well, but missing  
that will not lead to too many open files.

How often is that RuntimeException being thrown?  EG if a single  
document is frequently hitting an exception during analysis, your code  
doesn't close the IndexWriter in that situation.  It's better to use a  
try/finally and close the IndexWriter in the finally clause, to cover  
that case.

Are you sure nothing else is using up file descriptors?  EG the  
createDocument call does not open any files?
