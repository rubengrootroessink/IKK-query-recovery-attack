Unfortunately, this is not an easy question to answer ... it's really  
up to you to test it out for your application & production env, and  
see.  We certainly try very hard not to break things, but  alot of  
sizable changes have gone into the trunk since 2.3.

Lucene has good test case coverage, and that coverage keeps improving  
with time -- every time we find something broken we make a test case  
first to catch it & prevent it in the future, then fix it.

If you do test the trunk it'd be great to hear back how it went, good  
or bad, because that helps us improve, faster...
