I haven't actually tried it, but I think very likely the current code  
in contrib/benchmark might be able to extract non-English Wikipedia  
dump as well?

Have a look at contrib/benchmark/conf/extractWikipedia.alg: I think  
if you just change the docs.file to reference your downloaded XML  
file it could just work?
