Can you turn on IndexWriter's infoStream, get the failure to happen,
and post the resulting output?

How are you adding the multiple indices together?  Can you post the
code that does that?

The number of open file handles needed during indexing is a function
of how many merges are running and how large (how many segments) each
of those merges are.  Lucene in Action 2, chapter 11, has a cool graph
showing this... (and also file handle usage by IndexReader, reopening
periodically).
