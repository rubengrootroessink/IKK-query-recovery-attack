SUBJECT: The org.apache.lucene.SegmentReader.class system property
DATE: 21 May 2009

Does anyone set that property in order to customize the SegmentReader
class that Lucene uses?

A while back, this was added for GCJ specific code (appears under
src/gcj/* in a source checkout), but that code hasn't kept up w/
recent changes to Lucene (eg readOnly IndexReader) and won't work
out-of-the-box for such cases.

We are discussing on java-dev whether to remove that property, and the
GCJ specific code, but wanted to first check whether anyone relies on
these.

Please respond if so!

Mike
