Also note that in the unreleased version of Lucene there
are now constructors for IndexWriter (one for String, File
and Directory) that do this exact logic for you.  This was
the fix for JIRA issue LUCENE-301:

     http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-301

So the next release of Lucene will have this functionality.
