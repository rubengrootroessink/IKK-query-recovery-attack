DATE: 27 Feb 2010

You can also access payloads through the TermPositions enum, but, this
is by term and then by doc.

It sounds like you need to iterate through all terms sequentially in a
given field in the doc, accessing offset & payload?  In which case
reanalyzing at search time may be the best way to go.

You can store term vectors in the index, which will store offsets (if
you ask it to), but, payloads are not currently stored with term
vectors.
