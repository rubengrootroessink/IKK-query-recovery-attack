SUBJECT: Re: gracefully interrupting an optimize
DATE: 21 Jan 2011

If you call optimize(false), that'll return immediately but run the
optimize "in the background" (assuming you are using the default
ConcurrentMergeScheduler).

Later, when it's time to stop optimizing, call IW.close(false), which
will abort any running merges yet keep any merges that had finished
(so some work, but not necessarily all work, is lost); it should
return quickly.
