Well... the problem is when merges kick off.

You could have N segments that each are below the limit, but when a
merge runs the merged segment would try to exceed the limit, because
you can't easily predict how many unique terms the merged segment will
have.

I guess you could guarantee safety by never allowing the sum of the
unique term count across all segments to exceed 2^31-1, but that may
be a too-restrictive safety margin.
