It's complicated.  You can read about the known issues here:

  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-673

To summarize: NFS has issues with lock files, with "write/read cache
consistency" and with "delete on last close" semantics, all of which
Lucene relies on.

With Lucene 2.1 we have addressed the lock file and write/read cache
consistency limitations.

With the trunk version of Lucene (not yet released) we have addressed
the "delete on last close" limitation, however you need to implement
your own deletion policy (which is not hard).  Details are here:

  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-710

As far as I know, with the trunk version of Lucene, if you make your
own deletion policy then NFS works fine.

However, typically performance of searching/indexing over NFS will not
be as good as a local filesystem.
