Also remember that a String object in Java has a high overhead -- the
object header (maybe 8 bytes), 3 int fields, a pointer (4 or 8 bytes)
to the (separate) char[], and then another object header for that
char[], and 2 bytes per character in the string.

Lucene trunk (4.0-dev) has cutover to shared byte[] holding the term
data as UTF8 encoded bytes, and mapping the doc -> ordinal using
packed ints... this is a sizable memory reduction in most cases.

Details are in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2380
