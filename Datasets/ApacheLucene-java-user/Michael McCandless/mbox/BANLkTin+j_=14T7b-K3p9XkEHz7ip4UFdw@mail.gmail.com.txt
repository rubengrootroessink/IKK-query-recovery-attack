This (HashDocSet, and any other impls that handle the sparse case
well) could be useful to have in Lucene's core.

For example, for certain MultiTermQuerys  we have this
CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO_REWRITE, which has iffy smelling heuristics to try
to determine the best cutover point from
ConstantScoreQuery(BooleanQuery(<OR of Terms>)) to FILTER_REWRITE,
because FILTER_REWRITE is costly in the sparse case.
