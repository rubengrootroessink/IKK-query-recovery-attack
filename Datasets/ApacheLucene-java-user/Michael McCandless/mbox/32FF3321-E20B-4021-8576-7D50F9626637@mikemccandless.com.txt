Yeah I realize that.  Now that we have omitTF as an option we could  
really go crazy ;)

  I figured since we already have NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS we may as well  
round it out with ANALYZED_NO_NORMS, and then stop there.  Plus,  
people have been surprised that you could do ANALYZED_NO_NORMS, yet it  
is useful.
