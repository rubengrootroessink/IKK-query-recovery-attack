SUBJECT: Re: semi-infinite loop during merging
DATE: 24 Apr 2009

OK I opened https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1611.

Christiaan, could you try out that patch to see if it fixes the
semi-infinite merging?  Thanks.  (You'll need to back-port to 2.4.1,
but it's a very small patch so hopefully not a problem).

Mike
