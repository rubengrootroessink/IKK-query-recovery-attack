Assuming there is an implicit:

  0. Open a reader/searcher

Then it's expected after step 6 that you have leftover files, because
the writers in step 2 and 3 were unable to delete the files since the
reader from step 0 still had them open.  Once you open a new writer,
or commit any changes with the existing writer, the files will be
deleted.

It's fine to leave a reader open... it just means the old files will
persist until the writer is able to delete them.
