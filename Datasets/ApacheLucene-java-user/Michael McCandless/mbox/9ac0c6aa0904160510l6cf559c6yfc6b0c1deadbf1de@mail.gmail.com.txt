One question: are you using IndexWriter.close(false)?  I wonder if
there's some path whereby the merges fail to abort (and simply keep
retrying) if you do that...

More inlined below...

Sigh.

Could they "kill -QUIT" or  Ctrl-Break when it's happening?

How about adding this at the top of IndexWriter.handleMergeException:

  if (infoStream != null) {
    message("handleMergeException: merge=" +
merge.segString(directory) + " exc=" + t);
  }

?

You could also sprinkle prints in between where message("merge:
total"...) occurs and the call to commitMerge, in
IndexWriter.mergeMiddle.  The mystery here is why you see these two
lines in a row:

  IW 0 [CrawlThread]: merge: total 18586 docs
  IW 0 [CrawlThread]: LMP: findMerges: 10 segments

That first line is supposed to be followed by a "commitMerge: ..."
line.  I suspect some exception (maybe a MergeAbortedException) is
being hit, leading to the commit not happening.

This would be great -- I would add that in handleMergeException as well.
