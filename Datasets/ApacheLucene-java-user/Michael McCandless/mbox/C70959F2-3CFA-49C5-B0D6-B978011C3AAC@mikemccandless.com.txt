When you previously saw corruption was it due to an OS or machine
crash (or power cord got pulled)?  If so, you were likely hitting
LUCENE-1044, which is fixed on the trunk version of Lucene (to be 2.4
at some point) but is not fixed in 2.3.

If that is what you were hitting, then unfortunately neither buffering
updates into RAM nor using autoCommit=false in 2.3 will fully protect
you from this issue.  Though, both of these approaches should reduce
your chance of hitting LUCENE-1044 since they both reduce frequency of
commits to the index.
