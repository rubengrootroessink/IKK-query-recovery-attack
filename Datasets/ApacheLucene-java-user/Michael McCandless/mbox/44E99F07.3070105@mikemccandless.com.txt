That is an excellent point Jason -- that thread I linked to doesn't
talk to how to have transaction isolation with your DB updates.

I like the idea of a separate "IndexTasks" table.  This is better
than a simple timestamp column added to all content tables because it
can handle deleted docs correctly.  And it allows full decoupling of
when the DB transaction is committed vs. when Lucene commits its
corresponding index updates.

I think ideally you would indeed want to commit both at once (your
last paragraph above), meaning, your end users see changes to DB
simultaneous with changes to searching on the Lucene index.  Compass
sounds like it will address this nicely!

Solr also adds some transactional semantics on top of Lucene, in that
you add/delete documents, but these changes are not visible to the end
user until a "commit" is issued.
