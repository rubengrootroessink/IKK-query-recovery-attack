Can you give more details on what's not working right?

This (getting more details per-doc on why a doc matches) is an often
requested feature, that Lucene does not make easy today.

Is it really just single terms you need to measure?  (eg, not "how
many times did phrase XYZ occur in the doc").  If so, then getting the
term vectors and locating your term in there, should work.  This is
probably OK if you just do it for each of the hits on the page (like
10 hits), but will be way too slow if you try to do it for say all
docs that matched the query.

Otherwise, iterating through matches as found by the highlighter's
SpanScorer is probably best for now.
