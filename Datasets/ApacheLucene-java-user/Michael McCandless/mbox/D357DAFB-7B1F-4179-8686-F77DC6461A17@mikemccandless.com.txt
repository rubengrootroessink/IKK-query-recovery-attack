That is true.

Good question on converting an already optimized index... I haven't  
tested this, and it's somewhat roundabout, but you may be able to open  
an IndexWriter, then call setUseCompoundFile with the opposite of what  
your index presently has, run optimize, set that back, and run  
optimize again.  I think it should work.

You could also add and then delete a single doc, then call optimize.
