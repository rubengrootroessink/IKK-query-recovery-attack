Make that "Collector" (new as of 2.9).

HitCollector is the old (deprecated as of 2.9) way, which always
pre-computed the score of each hit and passed the score to the collect
method.

Whereas Collector makes scoring optional (your collect method must
actually request the score).

EG sorting by field makes use of this (in 2.9) by making scoring optional.
