Do you mean Lucene 2.2?  Your stack trace seems to line up with 2.2,
and 2.3 isn't quite released yet.

Can you share some details of how you are using Lucene, and, how/why
it's killed or crashed so often?  When it crashes, do you get an
exception from Lucene (which could be the root cause here)?

What OS and filesystem is the index on?  Are you changing any default
settings like autoCommit, lock factory & lock file location, etc?

Even if Lucene (JVM) is killed, the index should not become corrupt in
this particular way, unless the IO system fails to complete its
"write" operations.  Lucene always writes & closes new segments files
(_llb.cfs) before writing the segments_N file that refers to them.

I just took a first stab at just such a tool, here:

  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1020

Please be very very careful!: I just wrote this code and it could have
some horrible bug that destroys your index.  So make a backup of your
index first.

Could you first run that tool without the "-fix" option and post back
the resulting output?
