Something must still have these file handles open at the time the

EG do you have a reader open on this index?

enabled the info stream and found the below entries. I used ProcessExplorer from SysInternals

optimized segment files. Â The same code works fine in Linux. I am facing this issue in Windows
XP and 2003.
