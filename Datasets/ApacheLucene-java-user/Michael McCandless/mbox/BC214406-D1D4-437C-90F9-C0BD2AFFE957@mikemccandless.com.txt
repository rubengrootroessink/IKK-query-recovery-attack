I'd be curious how much of a performance difference you see between  
the different SSD drives.

This test was with OCZ "Core Series" but previous tests were with  
different SSDs right?

EG Intel just released a new 80 GB SSD (X25-M) which is getting rave  
reviews, even compared to the OCZ "core series" which seemed to be the  
previous favorite:
