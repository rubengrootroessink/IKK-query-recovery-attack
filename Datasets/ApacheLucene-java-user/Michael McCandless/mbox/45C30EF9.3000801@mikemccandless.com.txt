I agree we don't have enough documentation around why an IOException
might be thrown for the various Lucene methods.

For your example (IndexReader.deleteDocuments) there are some
"interesting" cases that I think we should call out:

   * Another "writer" (IndexWriter or IndexReader with pending deletes)
     is already open against the index (this will be the "Lock obtain
     timed out" IOException).

   * The reader is "stale" meaning another writer has committed changes
     to the index since this reader was opened.

Then of course index corruption, transient IO problems, permission
problems, etc, can lead to IOExceptions.

I will open a JIRA issue.
