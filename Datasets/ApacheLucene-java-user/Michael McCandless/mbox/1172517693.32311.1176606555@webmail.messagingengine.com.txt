OK, glad you got to the bottom of it!

But, I don't think this error (NPE) is particularly clear (though it
is better than pre-2.1 which, I think, would in fact let the writer
run without holding the write lock).  I will open a Jira issue for
this.  I think we should explicitly detect when the IndexWriter is
used after being closed.
