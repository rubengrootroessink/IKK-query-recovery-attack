To be honest, you are sort of forging new territory here :)

The intention of TermsHash was to allow a null nextTermsHash.
Hopefully fixing a few places will in fact make it work that way.

EG for this, maybe change (in TermsHashPerThread.java) this:

    if (nextTermsHash != null) {
      // We are primary
      charPool = new CharBlockPool(termsHash.docWriter);
      primary = true;
    } else {
      charPool = primaryPerThread.charPool;
      primary = false;
    }

to:

    if (nextTermsHash != null || primaryPerThread == null) {
      // We are primary
      charPool = new CharBlockPool(termsHash.docWriter);
      primary = true;
    } else {
      charPool = primaryPerThread.charPool;
      primary = false;
    }

?
