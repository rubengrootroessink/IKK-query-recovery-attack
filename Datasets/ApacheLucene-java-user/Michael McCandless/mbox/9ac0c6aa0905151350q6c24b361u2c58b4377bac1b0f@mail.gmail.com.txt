I think you could subclass ConcurrentMergeScheduler, overriding
merge() to only call super.merge() if the time is right?  (And just
return right away if it's not the right time).

Though you might want to allow small merges to run in real-time, and
big merges to wait until after hours.

- I've seen cases where merging will cause 200% load on a system (dual quad core x86_64 running
Centos) with a raid-5 disk subsystem of 15k drives.

as over-riding the mergeScheduler.merge() method with a method that checks to see if a merge
is allowed (by wall clock time)? Â If a merge is not allowed at that time, can I just return();?
Or do I have to sleep the thread until the merge is allowed?
