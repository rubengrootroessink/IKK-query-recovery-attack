As of 2.9, org.apache.lucene.util.Constants.LUCENE_VERSION is a good
way to get this.

That constant is set by first looking at the implementation version,
and then making sure the version Lucene thinks it is (2.9 on trunk
now) is contained in the resulting string.  It also takes care of a
null implementation version (returning 2.9).
