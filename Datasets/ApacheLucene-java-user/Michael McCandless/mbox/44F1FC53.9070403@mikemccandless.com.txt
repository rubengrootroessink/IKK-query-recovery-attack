You can start with the getting started page which walks through the demo 
code:

   http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/gettingstarted.html

I'm not sure what you mean by "2.0 API examples": not all that much 
changed in the 2.0 release of Lucene besides removing deprecated APIs. 
I don't know of any tutorials that are "focused" on 2.0.

There are a number of good introductory articles to Lucene that Google 
will find for you...
