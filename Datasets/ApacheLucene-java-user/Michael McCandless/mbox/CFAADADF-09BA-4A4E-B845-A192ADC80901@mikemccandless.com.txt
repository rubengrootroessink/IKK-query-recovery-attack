IW will simply use up to the RAM you told it to, and then flush.

Add onto that RAM consumed by merging, which in the presence of
deletes is totDocCount * 4.125 bytes, plus numberOfFieldsWithNorms *
totDocCount * 1 byte.

I guess plus all the BufferedIndexInput buffers held open during  
merging,
though that's likely smallish (4 KB per).

I think that's roughly it?
