SUBJECT: Re: Change the merge factor for an existing index?
DATE: 29 Oct 2008


It's fine to change any of IW's parameters on an existing index.   
Nothing will break.

However, in general, such changes won't be retroactive: they only  
apply to future actions the IW will take.

So, changing maxMergeDocs will only prevent future merges from  
producing segments larger than that size.

But mergeFactor is an exception to this rule: if you suddenly create  
an IW with a lower mergeFactor, the MergePolicy will likely look at  
your current index and choose to do a bunch of merges (if your index  
has alot of segments) which ConcurrentMergeScheduler will then run,  
concurrently.
