Ahhh, OK.  Suman, it seems likely that this is what you are hitting.
Since you are planning on trying the nightly build of Lucene with the
fix for LUCENE-729 (now committed), can you watch & see if indeed
you no longer see 5000+ segments being created?  Would be nice to be
sure that this is in fact the cause of your 5000+ segments.
