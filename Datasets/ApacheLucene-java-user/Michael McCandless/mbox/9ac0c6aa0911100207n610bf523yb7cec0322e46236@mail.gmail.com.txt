I see.

There's IndexReader.indexExists(), but it sounds like that's not what
you want because you want to check whether in fact it has > 0 docs in
it.

Otherwise, I think something like this (requires 2.9, since prior to
that SegmentInfos isn't public) should work:

    SegmentInfos sis = new SegmentInfos();
    try {
      sis.read(dir);
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
      // presumably no index exists
    }
    int totDocCount = 0;
    for(SegmentInfo info : sis) {
      totDocCount += info.docCount;
    }

It's not a one-liner, but it's fast to run since it just reads the
segments file.  But remember that SegmentInfos has forward rights to
break back-compat ("subject to change suddenly in the next release")!
