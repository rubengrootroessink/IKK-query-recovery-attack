SUBJECT: Re: ThreadLocal in SegmentReader
DATE: 7 Jul 2008


So now I'm confused: the SegmentReader itself should no longer be  
reachable, assuming you are not holding any references to your  
IndexReader.

Which means the ThreadLocal instance should no longer be reachable.

Which means it should be GC'd and everything it's holding should be  
GC'd as well, even if some threads under it are still alive.

I think?

So it seems like what we currently do should be working fine, yet it's  
apparently not.  Are you certain you don't keep a reference to your  
IndexReader somewhere?  Also, are you sure that you waited long enough  
for GC to reclaim these objects?
