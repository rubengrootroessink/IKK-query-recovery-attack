Concurrency using multiple threads in a single JRE is perfectly fine
and strongly encouraged, since modern hardware is very concurrent.

But, concurrent access via different JREs is not supported by Lucene.
Lucene's write lock will protect the index against such cases, but if
you bypass the write lock then you will easily corrupt the index if
two writers are opened at once.
