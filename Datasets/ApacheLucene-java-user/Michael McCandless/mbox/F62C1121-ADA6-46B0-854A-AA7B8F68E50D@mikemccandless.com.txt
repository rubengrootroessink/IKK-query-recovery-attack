Hmmm, ok.  Empty content is fine.  Can you provide more details on  
how you're creating your documents?  Are you using threads?  (Or if

Well, asserts are meant to catch bugs, whereas exceptions are meant  
to catch "expected" errors.  But, you're right, it would be nice if  
the asserts included more details about the particular values that  
caused problems.  I'll add that for this...
