Yes.  And, on getting the char[] buffer, if you need more space than
its current length, call resizeTermBuffer(int newSize), which returns  
a buffer
of size >= newSize.

Or, better, directly alter the char[] buffer you just got, in place.

If you really need/want to do a new buffer, then you can call
Token.setTermBuffer and it will do the copy (into its buffer) for
you.
