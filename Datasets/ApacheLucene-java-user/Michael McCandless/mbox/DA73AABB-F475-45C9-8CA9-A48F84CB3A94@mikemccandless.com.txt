SUBJECT: Re: Javadoc wording in IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize()
DATE: 5 Sep 2008


IndexWriter.{set,get}MaxMergeDocs isn't deprecated, but it is a  
convenience method for the corresponding calls on the MergePolicy.

Sorry, that javadoc is now false -- we decided that check (2nd point  
in the javadoc) was overly pedantic so it was removed (this was  
LUCENE-1254), but I forgot to fix that javadoc in 2.3.

This has already been fixed on the trunk so it'll be fixed in 2.4.

Sorry for the confusion,

Mike
