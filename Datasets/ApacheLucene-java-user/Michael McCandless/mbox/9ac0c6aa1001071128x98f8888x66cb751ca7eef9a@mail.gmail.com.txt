Well... that setting is already in LogByteSizeMergePolicy (not
IndexWriter), so I think in that context it's pretty clear?

Though I'd love to find a better name that conveys that the size
limitation applies to the segments *being* merged, not to the
resulting merged segment.  maxStartingSegSizeMB?
