How many indexed fields do you have, overall, in the index?

If you have a very large number of fields that are "sparse" (meaning  
any given document would only have a small subset of the fields), then  
norms could explain what you are seeing.

Norms are not stored sparsely, so when segments get merged the "holes"  
get filled (occupy bytes on disk and in RAM) and consume more  
resources.  Turning off norms on sparse fields would resolve it, but  
you must rebuild the entire index since if even a single doc in the  
index has norms enabled for a given field, it "spreads".
