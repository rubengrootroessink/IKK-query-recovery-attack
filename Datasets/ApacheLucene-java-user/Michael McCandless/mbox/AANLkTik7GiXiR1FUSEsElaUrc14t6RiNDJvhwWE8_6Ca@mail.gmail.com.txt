FYI... I was curious to confirm that PulsingCodec (in trunk, with
flexible indexing) gives good performance gains specifically for
primary key fields... so I ran some performance tests and wrote up the
results:

Net/net PulsingCodec shows ~45-50% speedup on uncached (in OS's IO
cache) lookups, and ~15% speedup on cached lookups...
