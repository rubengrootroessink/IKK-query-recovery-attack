SUBJECT: Re: how to adjust buffer size of reading file?
DATE: 5 Aug 2010

Which Directory impl do you use now?  EG MMapDir does no buffering in
javaland when reading.

You can make your own Directory impl, subclassing the one you use now,
and calling BufferedIndexInput.setBufferSize on every (certain?),
IndexInput/s returned from openInput?

Also, the low level API for opening a single segment does allow you to
specify the buffer size, but we've never punched this through to the
top API (IndexReader.open).

If you have performance numbers on difference buffer sizes please report back!
