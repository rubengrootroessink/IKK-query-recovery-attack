SUBJECT: Big Bad Bug in Lucene 2.9.0
DATE: 14 Oct 2009

Team,

There is a nasty bug in 2.9.0, whereby BooleanQuery will sometimes
silently fail to match possibly many documents that it should.
Details are here:

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1974

Fortunately, there is a very simple workaround: just call
BooleanQuery.setAllowDocsOutOfOrder(false).  This is a static default;
you only have to call it once, before running any searches.

We are working towards getting a 2.9.1 out to fix this bug... if you
know of issues we've fixed on Lucene's trunk that'd be good candidates
for porting back to 2.9.1, speak up!

Sorry,

Mike
