Which method (abort or close) do you see taking so much time?

It's odd, because IW.abort should quickly stop any running BG merges.

Can you get a dump of the thread stacks during this long abort/close
and post that back?

Can't answer if Lucene 3.x will improve this situation until we find
the source of the slowness...

 To achieve this, I set a shutdown flag which causes it to break from the loop and call first
abort() and then close().  The problem is that with a large index (say, 15Gb) in Lucene 2.3.2,
it can take over an hour.  (Yes, I know I should be on a later version of Lucene, but that's
another issue - we are stuck with this for now!).
