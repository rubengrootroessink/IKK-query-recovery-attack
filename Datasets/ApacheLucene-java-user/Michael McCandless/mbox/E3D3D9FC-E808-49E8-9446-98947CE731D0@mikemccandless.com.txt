What do you mean by "manually"?

Once an IndexWriter commits a change to the index after the  
IndexReader was opened, then IndexReader.isCurrent() will return false.

Assuming it's a local filesystem on Linux (eg, not NFS) then if  
IndexReader has the file open and you delete it from the filesystem,  
that IndexReader is unaffected.

But, you should not delete files yourself -- IndexWriter does that for  
you at the right times.
