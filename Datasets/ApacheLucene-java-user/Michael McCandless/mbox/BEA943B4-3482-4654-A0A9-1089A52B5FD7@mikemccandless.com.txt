1) For Lucene's scoring, there's this:

   http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/scoring.html#Scoring

And Lucene in action also describes the scoring formula.

2) It's up to you to build a Lucene document from your content, so you  
decide which parts of your content (body, link, meta) become which  
fields in Lucene.  At that point Lucene's scoring formula kicks in.
