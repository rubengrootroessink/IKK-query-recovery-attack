Flex is still in flux, though :)

You should (when possible/reasonable) instead use
ReaderUtil.gatherSubReaders, then iterate through those sub readers
asking each for its flex fields.

But if this is only for testing purposes, and Multi*Enum is more
convenient (and, once attrs work correctly), then Multi*Enum is
perfectly fine.
