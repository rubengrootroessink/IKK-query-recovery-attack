SUBJECT: WARNING: re-index all Lucene trunk indices
DATE: 5 Jan 2011

If you are using Lucene's trunk (to be 4.0) builds, read on...

I just committed LUCENE-2843, which is a hard break on the index file format.

If you are living on Lucene's trunk then you have to remove any
previously created indices and re-index, after updating.

The change cuts over to a more RAM efficient and faster terms index
implementation, using FSTs (finite state transducers) to hold the term
index data.
