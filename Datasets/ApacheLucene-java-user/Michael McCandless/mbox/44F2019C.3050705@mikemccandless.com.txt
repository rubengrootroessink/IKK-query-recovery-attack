I would agree: the retry/timeout logic already exists above so let's 
just return false on hitting any IOException when calling createNewFile.

(Doron, this still wouldn't fix the other strange "across the board" IO 
problems you see on Windows.  I'd really like to reproduce this but so 
far (running your stress test) I can't -- are you sure it's not a virus 
checker or something?).
