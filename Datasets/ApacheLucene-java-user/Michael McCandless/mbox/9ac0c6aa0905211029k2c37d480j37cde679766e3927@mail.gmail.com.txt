Darned that Google; they need to do better ;)

Here's the entry from CHANGES.txt on Lucene's trunk:

 2. LUCENE-1382: Add an optional arbitrary String "commitUserData" to
    IndexWriter.commit(), which is stored in the segments file and is
    then retrievable via IndexReader.getCommitUserData instance and
    static methods.  (Shalin Shekhar Mangar via Mike McCandless)
