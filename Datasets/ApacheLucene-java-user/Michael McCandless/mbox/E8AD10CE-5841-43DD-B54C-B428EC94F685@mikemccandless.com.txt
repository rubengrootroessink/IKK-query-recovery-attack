Hmm -- once a document is deleted, your HitCollector won't ever see  
it.  During searching, isDeleted is called per document at a very low  
level.

If your HitCollector is seeing it, it sounds like it wasn't really  
deleted.  Are you sure you closed the IndexWriter and then reopened  
your searcher, so that the searcher will see the deletion?

This is odd -- the document should either be deleted (entirely), or  
not.  You shouldn't get different behavior if you search for the doc  
one way vs another.
