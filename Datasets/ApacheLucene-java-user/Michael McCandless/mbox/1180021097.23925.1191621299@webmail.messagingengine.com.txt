I *think* something close to this would allow you to count the number
of docs matching a query without scoring:

  Scorer s = query.weight(searcher).scorer(reader);
  int count = 0;
  while(s.next()) {
    count++;
  }

I'm not certain that avoids all scoring work but at least for some of
the scorers it should save some CPU time; I'm not sure how much.  Also
note that the TopDocCollector (used by default if you don't provide
your own collector) does not count docs that have score <= 0.0, so the
above code fragment would overcount in such cases.
