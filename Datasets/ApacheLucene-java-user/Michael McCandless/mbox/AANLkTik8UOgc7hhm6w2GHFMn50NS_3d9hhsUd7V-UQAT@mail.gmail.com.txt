SUBJECT: Re: API that return the amount of terms indexed
DATE: 16 Oct 2010

4.0 will have an API to get the number of unique terms for a given
field, or across all fields, but only at the segment level.  (Getting
the count across segments requires a merge sort).

3.x and before doesn't have such an API, though the information is
tracked under the hood.  If you open the _X.tis file, skip the first
int, then call readLong(), that should be the number of unique terms
in that segment.

You can always simply fallback to getting the term enum and stepping
counting how many .next()'s there are until exhaustion...
