Can you post the Python sources of the Lucene part of your application?

One thing to check is how the JRE is being instantiated from Python,  
ie, what the equivalent setting is for -Xmx (= max heap size).  It's  
possible the 140 MB consumption is actually "OK" as far as the JRE is  
concerned, if it was told it's allowed to use that much heap (or more).

Try letting it continue to run for a very long time to see how the  
size grows... if it's really a leak it will truly keep growing and  
eventually hit an OutOfMemory exception in Java or Python; if instead  
it's just the JRE thinking it's allowed to use that much heap it  
should at some point level off, but possibly at a high value.

Are you able to get the same memory leak to happen with a java only  
version of the Lucene part of your application?
