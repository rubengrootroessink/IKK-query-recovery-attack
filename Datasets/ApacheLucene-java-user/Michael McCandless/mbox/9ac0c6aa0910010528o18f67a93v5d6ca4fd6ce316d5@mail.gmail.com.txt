In general there's no separate document detailing how Lucene's source
code works; the code itself (and its comments) is all there is.  If
you are going through the code, please add comments & post a patch and
we can improve its comments over time.  Source code is a living thing
and constantly evolving :)

But, for the index file format in particular, there is this:

    http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_0/fileformats.html

If you want specifically to parse the terms dict/index, you should
look at SegmentTermEnum and TermInfosReader for inspiration...
