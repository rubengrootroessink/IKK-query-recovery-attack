Is the creation of the index in your control?  If so, try something like this:

  ((LogByteSizeMergePolicy) writer.getMergePolicy()).setMaxMergeMB(1.0));

(NOTE: not tested).  This works because [currently]
LogByteSizeMergePolicy is the default for IndexWriter.  Would be safer
to create your own LogByteSizeMergePolicy and set it on the writer...

This tells the IndexWriter NOT to merge any segment that's over 1.0 MB
in size.  With a default merge factor of 10, this should "generally"
mean you don't get a segment over 10MB, though it may not be a hard
guarantee (you can lower the 1.0 if you still see a segment over 10
MB).

Implementing a custom directory that splits files @ 10 MB is also
possible, but is a good amount more work.  You'd have to have your
IndexOutput write to the separate 10 MB sized files, then make an
IndexInput that "pretends" they are one file.
