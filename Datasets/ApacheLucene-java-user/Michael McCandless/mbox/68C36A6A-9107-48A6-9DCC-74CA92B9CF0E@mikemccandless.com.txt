That is correct, as long as you incRef the reader before starting each  
query, and decRef the reader after finishing each query.

If you call close() during this time, the reader is not actually  
closed until decRef is called for all previous incRefs.

Be certain that once you close() a reader there is no way a new query  
can grab that reader.  That would be a thread hazard that could result  
in using an already closed reader.

Also be certain you always decRef, eg in a finally clause.
