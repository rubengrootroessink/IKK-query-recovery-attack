No, IndexOutput has no such method.  We could consider adding one...

I think that's the best to do w/ today's API; but, you should save the
first IOE you hit, then force close the remaining files, then throw
that IOE.

I don't think any release of Lucene will have fixed all of these
cases, yet.  Patches welcome :)

Actually, the best fix is something Earwin created but is not yet
committed (nor in a patch yet, I think), which adds a nice API for
closing multiple IndexOutputs safely.  Earwin, maybe you could pull
out just this part of your patch and open a separate issue?  Then we
can fix all places in Lucene that need to close multiple IndexOutputs
to use this API.
