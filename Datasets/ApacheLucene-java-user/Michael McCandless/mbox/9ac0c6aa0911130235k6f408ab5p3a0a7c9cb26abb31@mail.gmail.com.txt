Interrupting optimize shouldn't cause any problems.  It should have no
effect on the index, except possibly the partially created files might
be orphan'd (left on disk but not referenced by the index), in which
case they'll be cleaned up the next time you open a writer on the
index.

Still, running CheckIndex is always a good idea ;)
