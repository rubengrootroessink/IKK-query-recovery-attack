It augments contrib/benchmark.

It's really more singularly focused on specific benchmarks for
indexing, searching, NRT performance, and you obviously have to know
Python to make use of it.

Whereas contrib/benchmark is far more powerful -- the algorithms
language give you lots of freedom on what to "run", plus, it can do
other things beyond benchmarking, eg evaluate search relevance, create
line files, do deletions, etc.

It does have an indexer tool, here:
