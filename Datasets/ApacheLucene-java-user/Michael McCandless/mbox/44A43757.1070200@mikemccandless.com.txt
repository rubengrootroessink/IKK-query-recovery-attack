Yes, there is.

You can call the static FSDirectory.setDisabledLocks() to disable 
locking entirely.  But you need to be certain this is safe for your 
application.  Lucene uses this lock to ensure the index does not become 
corrupt when IndexReaders and IndexWriters are working on the same index.

Or, if you want to change which directory the lock file is stored in you 
can set this Java property:

    org.apache.lucene.lockDir
