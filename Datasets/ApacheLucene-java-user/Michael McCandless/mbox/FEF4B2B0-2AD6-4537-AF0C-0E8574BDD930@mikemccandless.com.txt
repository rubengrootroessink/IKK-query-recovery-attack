Well ... if the thread dies, the value in its ThreadLocal should be  
GC'd.

If the thread does not die (eg thread pool in an app server) then the  
ThreadLocal value remains, but that value is a shallow clone of the  
original TermVectorsReader and should not be consuming that much RAM  
per thread.

So I think it's OK?
