OK, phew.  Thanks for bringing closure here.

You mean you ran CheckIndex on the original index (input to scp) and  
it was fine, but CheckIndex on the copy produced by scp showed the  
corruption?

I think it's unusual for scp to corrupt the copy unless something  
catastrophic happens (eg disk full, disk is bad, RAM is bad, etc.).
