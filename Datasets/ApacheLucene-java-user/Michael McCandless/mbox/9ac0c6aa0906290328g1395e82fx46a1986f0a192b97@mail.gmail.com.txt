Right, it's only the terms in your query that need to be looked up.

There's already an LRU cache for the Term -> TermInfos lookup, in
TermInfosReader (hard wired to size 1024).  It was created as a "short
term" cache so that queries that look up the same term twice (eg once
for idf and once to get freq/prox postings position), would result in
only one real lookup.  You could try privately experimenting w/ that
value to see if you can get a reasonable it rate?

Lucene only loads the "indexed" terms (= every 128th) into RAM, by default.
