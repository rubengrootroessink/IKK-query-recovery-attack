But please note these are not yet part of any release (ie, only
committed to the "trunk" right now).

See also JIRA issue LUCENE-773:

     http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-773

The fact that there are two "create" options (one at the FSDirectory

FSDirectory's create and only use IndexWriter's create going forward.
