SUBJECT: Re: MergePolicy public but SegmentInfos package protected?
DATE: 25 Mar 2009

I'm torn.  MergePolicy (and MergeScheduler) are "expected" to be
something expert users could alter; their API is designed to be
exposed & stable.  I think they should be visilbe in the javadocs.

But, unfortunately, to do their job they must use other package
private APIs (SegmentInfos) which we intentionally would like to keep
more malleable.

Is there some way to make them package private, yet include them (and
only them, ie not all package private classes) in the javadocs?

At a minimum we should update the javadocs expressing this
issue.
