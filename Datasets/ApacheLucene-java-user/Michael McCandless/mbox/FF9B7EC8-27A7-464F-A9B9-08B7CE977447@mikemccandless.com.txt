Actually you do need to make a new IndexSearcher every time you  
reopen a new IndexReader.

However, that should not lead to leaking file descriptors.  All open  
files are held by IndexReader (not IndexSearcher), so as long as you  
are properly closing your IndexReader's you shouldn't use up file  
descriptors.
