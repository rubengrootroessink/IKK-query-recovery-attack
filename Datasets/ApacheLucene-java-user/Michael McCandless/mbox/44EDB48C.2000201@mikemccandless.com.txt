You could start with the javadocs here:

    http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/index.html

Click on the "Document" class to see some decription for Documents in 
particular.

Or for a broader "get your feet wet" introduction, here:

   http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/gettingstarted.html

And the FAQ is also helpful:

   http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/LuceneFAQ
