What exactly do you mean by "fresh index created for the first time"?

Ie, does opening an IndexWriter with create=true over a Directory that  
previously had a Lucene index not count as "fresh" for some reason?   
(If so, then it sounds like generation==1 is the test you want).

What's the use case behind this?
