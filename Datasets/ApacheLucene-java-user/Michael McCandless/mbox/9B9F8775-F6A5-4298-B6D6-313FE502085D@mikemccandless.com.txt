SUBJECT: Re: differences in deleting docs using IndexWriter and IndexModifier?
DATE: 18 Apr 2008

I believe your docs are being deleted.  It's just that
IndexWriter.docCount() does not count deleted docs.  That method
matches IndexReader.maxDoc(), not IndexReader.numDocs().

If you open an IndexReader and call numDocs() does it reflect the
deletion?

Really I think we should add "maxDoc()" and "numDocs()" to
IndexWriter, and deprecate docCount() in favor of maxDoc().  I'll
open an issue.

The two indeed take very different routes for deletion.  IndexModifier
closes its writer, opens a reader, and does the deletions with the
reader.  These deletions are "immediate" in that the reader can tell
you how many docs just got deleted, but not committed until the
modifier closes its reader.

Whereas IndexWriter.deleteDocuments simply buffers up all terms and
periodically these are flushed in bulk to the index.  Only closing the
IndexWriter ensures that the deletions are visible to a reader.

We are trying over time to move towards a read-only IndexReader, and
absorbing all write operations into IndexWriter.
