Would it be possible to get a copy of this document's text (only if 
you're able to share it)?  I'd like to run some tests to work out the 
tradeoff (time taken vs % deflated) of the different levels we can pass 
to the zip library.  If not that's fine, I'll just run on various random 
text sources I can find.

Thanks.

Mike
