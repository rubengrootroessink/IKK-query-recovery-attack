Right, you'd have to work directly w/ the FSTEnum (ie, code changes).
The FSTEnum "feels" like a TreeMap, so, you can eg seekFloor to eg
0xffffffff, get the term, seek the TermsEnum there, then .next() until
you hit the end.

Maybe we need a seekFloor in the TermsEnum?  (What we have now is
really seekCeil).  But, what's the larger use case here..?
