It's also odd that you can repeat this so easily.  What OS/platform are 
you using?

The IndexWriter and IndexReader have their own finalizers to release 
(remove) the lock files.

Is it possible your JVM is exiting in a non-graceful manner (ie crashing)?

One known issue is Lucene just calls java.io.File.delete to remove the 
lock file, but doesn't check/confirm the returned result of this call 
that the file was actually deleted.  We are working on improving the 
locking by using native (OS) locks instead, which should correctly free 
lock files whenever the JVM process exits.  But this won't happen until 
a future Lucene release...
