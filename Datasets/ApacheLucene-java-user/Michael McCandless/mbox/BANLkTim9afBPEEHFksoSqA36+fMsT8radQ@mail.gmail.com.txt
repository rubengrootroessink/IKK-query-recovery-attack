Yes, you're right, it is!  That would work, as long as the all 0s file
isn't exactly 8 bytes long (this time yours was 20).  But then we are
still vulnerable if the corruption just happens to produce an 8 byte
all 0s file...

Simon also had a good idea, which is to check the version of the prior
segments file, and refuse to accept this ancient version of the newer
segments if the prior one is "modern".
