DATE: 24 Jan 2009

TrieRangeQuery/Filter are only available on Lucene's trunk, under
contrib in contrib/queries/*.  You can either download a recent
nightly build, from here (click on a specific build, then click on
"Build Artifacts"):

   http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk

Or you can checkout Lucene's full sources and go from there:

   http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/SourceRepository
