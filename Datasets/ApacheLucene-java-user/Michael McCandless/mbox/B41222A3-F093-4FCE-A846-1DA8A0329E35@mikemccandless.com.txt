It's risky.

How would you get the IDs to know which ones to delete?  A separate  
reader running on the side?

The problem is, as IndexWriter merges segments, the IDs shift.  Any  
reader you have already open won't see this shift (until you reopen  
it), so you could end up deleting the wrong IDs.
