This is maxBufferedDocs.  Right now, every added doc creates its own
segment in the RAMDir.  After maxBufferedDocs, all of these single
documents are merged and flushed to a single segment in FSDir.

This is actually not really a very efficient way for IndexWriter to
use RAM.  I'm working on improving this / speeding it up under this
Jira issue:

    http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-843

But it will be some time before this is stable & released!

Actually, no.  The segments created due to maxBufferedDocs are in FSDir.

This is always in FSDir.
