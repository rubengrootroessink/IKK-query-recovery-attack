If we go this route, we should add deleteByQuery to IndexWriter,  
which I think is a good idea, but just hasn't been done yet....

It was discussed before, in the context of LUCENE-565, but never  
actually added to IndexWriter.  I think the approach would be similar  
to how IndexWriter now deletes by Term.

Basically, the terms are buffered into a HashMap.  Then when a flush  
happens, a SegmentReader is opened one by one on all segments, and  
the delete is applied to each segment.  Special logic is used to  
apply the delete to the just-flushed segment since you have to take  
care to only delete docIDs up until the point when the delete by term  
was called.
