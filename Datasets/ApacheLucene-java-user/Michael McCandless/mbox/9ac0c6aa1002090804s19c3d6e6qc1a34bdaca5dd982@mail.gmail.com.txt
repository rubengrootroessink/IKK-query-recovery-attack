This particular patch doesn't change the Codecs API -- it "only"
factors out the Multi* APIs from MultiReader.  Likely you won't need
to change your codec... but try applying the patch and see :)

However: if you consume the flex API directly, on top of multi readers
(something you shouldn't do, for performance reasons), you will have
to use MultiField's static methods to get the enums.

Got it, so you're directly consuming the flex API in your test.
Whenever the index has > 1 segment, you'll get a multi enum.
