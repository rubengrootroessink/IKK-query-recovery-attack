SUBJECT: Re: Modifying a document by updating a payloads?
DATE: 30 Jul 2008


Unfortunately you will have to delete the old doc, then reindex a new  
doc, in order to change any payloads in the document's Tokens.

This issue:

     https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1231

which is still in progress, could make updating stored (but not  
indexed) fields a much lower cost operation, but that's not for sure  
and it's not clear when that issue will be done.
