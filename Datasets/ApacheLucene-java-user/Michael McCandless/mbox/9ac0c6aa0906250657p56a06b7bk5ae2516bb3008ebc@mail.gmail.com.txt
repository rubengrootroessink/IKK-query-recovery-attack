Interesting that excessive deletes buffering is not your problem...

Even if you can't post the resulting test case, if you can simplify it
& run locally, to rule out anything outside Lucene that's allocating
the byte/char/byte[] arrays, that can help to isolate.

Also, profilers can trace where allocations happened, eg YourKit.

all tables and create for each row a String representation similar to a toString method containing
all database data. This string is then fed together with the primary key to lucene. Full-text
search of my db is then possible. Each document in Lucene represents a row in the database.
