Lucene attempts to drive the query by the clause that's least
frequent, so order or your clauses will not matter.

But, it uses a simplistic heuristic to do so: it looks at the first
docID for each sub-clause and then reorders them in decreasing docID
order.  This isn't a perfect optimization since conceivably a
low-count sub-clause could just happen to have eg docID 0 matching.
