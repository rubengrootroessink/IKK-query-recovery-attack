You do need to be careful with this because if a writer commits while
you are copying you can easily get a copy that's unusable (is missing
files).

When you instantiate an IndexReader, it actually holds open most files
that it uses which protects them from being deleted.  So in theory if
you could open a reader successfully, ask it which files it is using,
then copy those files.  Hmmm actually some files it does not hold open
(eg the *.del files, and the segments_N file) which means this
approach won't work.  Also on Unix the filenames disappear even though
the underlying files are still held open.

One way that would work is to use the new custom deletion policy
feature.

Unfortunately, this is not yet released (only available on trunk).
The idea is fairly simple.  Make your own deletion policy which at
normal times (no backup running) is the default policy (delete all but
the last commit point).  Then, when you want to start a backup, this
policy would mark the one commit point its now on as not deletable.
This ensures the writer will not remove any of its files, even as new
commits are being done.  Then, your backup copies these files off, and
it's OK if this takes a while (eg if it runs with low priority or
something) since writer won't delete the files.  Finally when backup
is done, the deletion policy lets that commit point be deleted again
and writer will remove its files.

This should allow you to do "live" (not pause indexing) backups of
a Lucene index, cross platform.
