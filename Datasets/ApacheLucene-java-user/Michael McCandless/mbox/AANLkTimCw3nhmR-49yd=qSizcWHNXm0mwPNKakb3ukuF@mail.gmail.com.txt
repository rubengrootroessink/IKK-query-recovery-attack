SUBJECT: Re: Merge and commit behaviour - changed between 2.4 and 2.9?
DATE: 5 Oct 2010

Hmm that shouldn't be the case, I think?

In both 2.4 and 2.9.x (and all later versions), neither .prepareCommit
nor .commit wait for merges.

That said, if a merge happens to complete before you call those
methods, then it is in fact committed.
