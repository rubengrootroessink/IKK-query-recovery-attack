I think I've actually seen a FileNotFoundException thrown when the  
underlying root cause was file descriptor exhaustion, but I'm not  
certain.

Can you use lsof (or something similar) to see how many files you have?

Merging, especially several running at once, can greatly increase  
open file count, and especially if mergeFactor is increased.

Right, kill -9 should never corrupt the index, and 1044 should not  
affect the "kill -9" case; it only fixes the risk of corruption on a  
non-graceful machine/os crash/power loss.
