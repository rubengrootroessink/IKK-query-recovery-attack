One small clarification: optimize can run in the BG.  It doesn't block
other IndexWriter operations.  EG you can continue adding & deleting
docs.  Optimize() just guarantees that those segments that existed at
the start will be merged together.  Other segments that are flushed
after optimize had started will not be merged.

Of course, optimize is tremendously IO intensive so this may still
block out searches if the performance becomes hideously bad because
the IO system is saturated.
