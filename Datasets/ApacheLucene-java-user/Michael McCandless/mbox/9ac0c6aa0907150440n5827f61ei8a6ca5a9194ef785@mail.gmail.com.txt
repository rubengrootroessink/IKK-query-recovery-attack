SUBJECT: Re: Index doubling in size when adding extra terms
DATE: 15 Jul 2009

It looks like your "text_substrings" field will have many more unique
terms than the original text, right?  And, since it's indexed (I
assume), the docIDs will in fact be stored twice (once in the postings
for your orig text and once in the postings for text_substrings).  So
I think it's expected that the postings (*.frq/.prx/.tis/.tii) would
at least double in size.
