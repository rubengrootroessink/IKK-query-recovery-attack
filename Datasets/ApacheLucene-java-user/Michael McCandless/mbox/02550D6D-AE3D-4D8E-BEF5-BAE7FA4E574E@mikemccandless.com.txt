Are you using multiple computers?

Probably what's happening is: because older versions of Lucene store  
the lock file in the /tmp directory by default, multiple computers  
sharing an index will be able to open multiple writers because they  
have their own /tmp directories.  They don't see each other's lock.

Newer versions of Lucene store the write lock in the directory  
itself, which resolves this.  You can also change the lock directory  
to a shared mount point.

But ... are you using NFS?
