Paul,

One more question: when you hit that exception, does the offending  
file in fact not exist (when you list the directory yourself)?

And, does the exception keep happening consistently (same file  
missing) once that happens, or, does the same index work fine the  
next time you try it (ie, the exception is intermittent)?
