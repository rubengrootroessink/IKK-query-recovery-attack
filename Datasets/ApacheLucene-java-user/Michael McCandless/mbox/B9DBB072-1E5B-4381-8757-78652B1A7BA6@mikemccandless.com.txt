SUBJECT: Re: Lucene 2.3.1 IndexReader and IndexWriter Synchronization Issues
DATE: 29 Mar 2008


That use case of Lucene should be fine, ie no further synchronization  
should be necessary.

Your debug output below is great, but it doesn't seem to cover the  
occurrence of that exception.  Can you post the full debug output?

Can you describe how you reindex in more detail?  Are you manually  
removing files from the index and then opening a new IndexWriter with  
create=true?
