If you look at the javadocs for IndexWriter it explains how to do it.
You just provide a class that implements the warm method, and inside
that method you do whatever app specific things you need to do to the
provided IndexReader to warm it.

Note that the SearcherManager class from LIA2 handles setting up the
MergedSegmentWarmer, if you implement the warm method.
