Oh, so you do not see the problem with SerialMergeScheduler but you  
do with ConcurrentMergeScheduler?

Hmmm ... optimize does record which segments need to be merged away  
in a HashSet.  Then ConcurrentMergeScheduler will run the necessary  
merges (possibly several at once).  But the merges are still done on  
"contiguous" segments, and when committed the newly merged segment  
replaces that range of segments.  So I don't think this should be re- 
ordering documents.  Can you try running with infoStream set such  
that you get the problem to occur and then post the resulting output?

Oh, there are no deletions?  Then this is very strange.  Is it  
optimize that messes up the docIDs?  Or, is it when you add docs  
after having done an optimize that the newly added docs are messed up?
