This is an important point: a multi-segment index naturally allows for
utilizing IO concurrency with multiple searches against a single
IndexReader.  It's actually a reason against optimizing, strangely
enough.

However, as of Lucene 2.4 there's a new directory impl NIOFSDirectory
that on Unix should eliminate that bias (on Windows it will be slower,
due to problems with Sun JREs impl of nio APIs specific to Windows).
Also, you can and should open read-only IndexReaders since that also
removes further internal locking.  If you do test these please report  
back on
what difference they made...
