Yeah I agree.

There was also a new Document impl attached in Jira somewhere to more
strongly type fields (can't find it now), ie IntField, DateField, etc.

And it also ties into refactoring AbstractField/Fieldable/Field.

And eg KinoSearch has a fixed schema I believe.

I'm just wondering if we can somehow make incremental progress
here... it's ashame that most people who use Lucene will simply use
RangeQuery in its current incarnation since that's the "default".
