SUBJECT: Re: NearSpansUnordered payloads not returning all the time
DATE: 9 Dec 2009

That sounds familiar... try to track down the last thread maybe?

I think it was this: if the payload was already retrieved for a prior
span then the current span won't be able to retrieve it, so even
though you know a payload falls within the span you're looking at, you
won't get it back, if it already fell on a prior span.
