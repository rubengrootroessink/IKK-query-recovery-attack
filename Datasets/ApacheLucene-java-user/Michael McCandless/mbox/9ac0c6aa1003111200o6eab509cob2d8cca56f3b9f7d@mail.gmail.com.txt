SUBJECT: Re: Can 2.3 read indexes created by 2.4?
DATE: 11 Mar 2010

Urgh, I failed to update the opening in fileformats.html (describing
what's changed on each version).  We also had a change in 3.0, from
removing compressed fields.  I'll fix...

But: 2.3 can't read indexes created with 2.4 (and in general older
Lucene releases very likely will not be able to read indexes created
by newer versions, when there's been an index format change).
