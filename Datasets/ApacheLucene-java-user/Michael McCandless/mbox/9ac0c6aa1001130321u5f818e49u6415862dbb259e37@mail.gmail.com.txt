OK.  If your index directory has *.cfs files, then you are using the
default compound file format (I'm not sure whether Compass changes
that default either).

ramBufferSizeMB controls how big the initially created segments are.
Just how big a segment you get for a given ramBufferMB is very app
dependent, because the RAM efficiency of IndexWriter depends on things
like whether you have many unique terms (= worse RAM efficiency).
Generally larger RAM buffers have better efficiency.

Merging can only create bigger segments from those flushed segments.

So, you have to ensure ramBufferSizeMB is set such that in your use
case it never up and flushes a segment bigger than your 10 MB size
limit.
