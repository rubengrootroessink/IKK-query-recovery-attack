SUBJECT: lucene complains about invalid class file format in rt.jar
DATE: 3 Oct 2003

Hi,

I'm having quite a bit of success with Lucene designing a new search
tool for our website -- the only problem is that I've had to drop down
to java 1.3.6 (all our production system are java 1.4.x)

The typical error I get on the jsp is:

error: Invalid class file format in 
/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0/jre/lib/rt.jar(java/io/ObjectInputStream.class). 
The major.minor version '48.0' is too recent for this tool to 
understand.
/usr/local/tomcat/work/localhost_8080%2Fluceneweb/_0002fresults_0002ejs
presults_jsp_73.java:8: Class java.io.ObjectInputStream not found in 
import.
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;

I used javacc to process the .jj files and then rebuilt all the source
using java 1.4.0, and I can build the index just fine, but the copy of
the demo results.jsp, which I've been modifying for our needs, 
generates
a number of the above example errors.

What's going on here?

Thanks,
Rob
