SUBJECT: Modifying scores
DATE: 23 Jul 2002


I'm trying to implement a HITS/PageRank type algorithm and need to modify
the document scores after a search is performed. The final score will be a
combination of the lucene score and PageRank. Is there currently a way to
modify the scores on the fly via HitCollector? so that calling the
Hits.score() function will return my combined score?

Thanks, Mike
