I've been using webSphinx with Lucene by simply extending the Crawler class
and placing my Lucene code in the overridden 'visit' method. Seems to work,
but I've encountered problems with 'OutOfMemory' errors when crawling large
sites with 512mb and also using the -Xmx VM args. The sphinx faq mentions
the problem, but the recommened fixes don't seem to help. Alas I've resorted
to implementing a custom crawler.
