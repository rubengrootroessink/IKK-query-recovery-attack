I suppose I could take the users search string and use it to query on
multiple fields using the query syntax. Then weight the resulting scores for
the individual fields as I wish. Something like this..?

score_1 = results of searching with 'title:"user search string"'
score_2 = results of searching with 'heading: "user search string"'
 ...
score = ((score_1 * 5) + (score_2 * 10)) / 15
