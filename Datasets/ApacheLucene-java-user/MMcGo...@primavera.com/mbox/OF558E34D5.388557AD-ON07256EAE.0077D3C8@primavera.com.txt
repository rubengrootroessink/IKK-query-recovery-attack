SUBJECT: Wildcards and complete words
DATE: 9 Jun 2004

Hi,
 
I noticed that if I append a * to the words, create, created, creating,
creates, etc. then the search does not return the expected document. But
if I use creat* then the search does return the expected document. 
 
I would like to be able to use the complete words and append a wildcard
to the end. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!!!
 
Regards,
Michael
