Hey Otis,

I saw this FAQ :
   http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=538312
Is it possible to turn on stemming for wildcard searches. In my example
below, if the document contains "create" then I want the query "create*"
to return this document. So, in my case it is better to have the stemmed
query  "creat*" which returns the document rather than the unstemmed
query "create*" which does not return the document.

Regards,
Michael

I believe I covered this in a Lucene FAQ entry at jGuru.
