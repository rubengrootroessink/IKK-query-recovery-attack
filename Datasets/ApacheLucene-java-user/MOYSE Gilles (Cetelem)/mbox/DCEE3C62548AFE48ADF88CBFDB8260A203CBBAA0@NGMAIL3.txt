Do you want to define expressions, i.e. a set of terms that must be
intpreted as a whole ?
For instance, when the Analyzer catchs "time" followed by "out" it returns
"time_out" ?

Wouldn't I achieve the same result if I index "time out" like "time_out",
using StandardAnalyzer and later if I search for "time out" (inside quotes)
I should get proper result, but if I search for "time" I shouldn't get
result. Is this right?
