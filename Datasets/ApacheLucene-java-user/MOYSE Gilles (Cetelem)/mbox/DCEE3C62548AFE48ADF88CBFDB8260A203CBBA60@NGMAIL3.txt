SUBJECT: Compound expression extraction
DATE: 21 Oct 2003

Hi.

I'm trying to extract expressions from the terms position information, i.e.,
if two words appears frequently side-by-side, then we can consider that the
two words are only one. For instance, 'Object' and 'Oriented' appears
side-by-side 9 times out of 10. It allows us to define a new expression,
'Object_Oriented'.
Does anyone knows the statistical method to detect such expressions ?

Thanks.

Interesting option. Do you have a rough idea of what the performance
impact of using this setting is?
