I figured it out.  We are using Hibernate Search and in my ORM class I
am doing the following:

@Field(index=Index.TOKENIZED,store=Store.YES)
protected String objectId;

So when I persisted a new object to our database I was inadvertently
creating a document in the Lucene index with the tokenized and stored
field "objectId".  This is a left over from when we were letting
Hibernate Search build our index for us.  We're now building the index
ourselves so I think if I just remove this, it should work ok.

Thanks for the help, Doron.

Bill
