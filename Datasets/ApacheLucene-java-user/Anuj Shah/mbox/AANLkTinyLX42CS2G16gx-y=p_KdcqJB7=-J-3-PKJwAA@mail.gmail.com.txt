Hi,

I've upgraded from 3.00 to 3.0.3 and am now hitting assertion errors from
IndexWriter.ReaderPool.commit, at this line:

      // We invoke deleter.checkpoint below, so we must be
>       // sync'd on IW:
>       assert Thread.holdsLock(IndexWriter.this);
>

Has anyone encountered this before? I'm hoping this is a common scenario and
there is a quick fix to avoid it.

Thanks

Anuj
