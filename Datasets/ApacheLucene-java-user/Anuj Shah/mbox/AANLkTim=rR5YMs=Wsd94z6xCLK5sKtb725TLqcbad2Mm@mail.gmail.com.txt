SUBJECT: Re: Get fields from a Query object
DATE: 2 Aug 2010

My code has been given a query string, which we parse into the Query object
and would like to get a list of fields from.

I'm assuming there exists a method to do so, as it seems like a useful
function. If not should I be parsing the string for fields myself.
