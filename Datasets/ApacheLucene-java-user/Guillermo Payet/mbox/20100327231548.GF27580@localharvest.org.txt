Hello,

We've been using locallucene for years and years in our search engine of
family farms: http://www.localharvest.org/

We'd like to upgrade Lucene to 3.0.1, which also means migrating from
locallucene to lucene-spatial. However, Lucene spatial seems very different
from locallucene, and I can't even find any documentation on how to use 
it!  Can someone tell me if lucene-spatial is production ready?  Maybe point
me to some docs?  Is there any sample code for a basic lucene search using it?

This is the best i've found so far:

Thanks
