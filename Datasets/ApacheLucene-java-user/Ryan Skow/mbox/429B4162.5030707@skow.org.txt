SUBJECT: Adding to the termFreqVector
DATE: 30 May 2005


How would one go about adding additional terms to a field which is not 
stored literally, but instead has a termFreqVector?  For example:

If DocumentA was indexed originally with:
    myTermField: red green blue

termFreqVector would look like:
   freq {myTermField: red/1, green/1, blue/1}

Now, I'd like to add some more terms (red, yellow) and desire the 
termFreqVector to look like this:
   freq {myTermField: red/2, green/1, blue/1, yellow/1}

It would seem like there would be a covenant way of accomplishing this, 
but I must be missing something.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
