SUBJECT: eclipse birt with lucene
DATE: 27 Oct 2008

Hi,

I'd like to use Eclipse Birt in order to make reports based on Lucene index content as if
I use a database. The idea is to use SQL statement to read this index with a JDBC wrapper
like the one existing for LDAP (http://www.openldap.org/jdbcldap/). Perhaps somebody already
have done a custom ODA datasource or a scripted datasource to read such index ?

Regards,
Blured.
