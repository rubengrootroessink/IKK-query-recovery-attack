DATE: 4 Aug 2005

hello all,

lucene is already pretty fast, but i was wondering if you guys have 
experience with using gcj (on linux). how much faster is it for 
indexing? personally i have best performance with java-ibm, at least 
under linux.

it would be interesting to hear how your experiences are.

thanks in advance,
martin
