 Hi Jan,

I think, you require version number for each commit OR updates. Say
you added 10 docs then it is update 1, then modifed or added some more
then it is update 2.. If it is so then my advice would be to have
field named field-type, version-number and version-date-time as part
of the field in the index. You could set this field as like any other
field. Retrieve the record by filtering the value to the field
field-type.
