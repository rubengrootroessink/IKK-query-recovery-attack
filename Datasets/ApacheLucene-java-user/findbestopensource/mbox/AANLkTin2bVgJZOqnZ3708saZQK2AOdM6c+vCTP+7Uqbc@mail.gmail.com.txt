SUBJECT: Re: Search requires too long search term

You may need to use ngrams.
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/api/all/org/apache/lucene/analysis/ngram/EdgeNGramTokenFilter.html

Another option would be doing wildcard query without enabling leading
wildcard search. search for cr* and not *cr* as the auto suggest
feature should give suggestion for words after "cr" and not before "cr".
