SUBJECT: Re: Converting an existing index format to Lucene Index
DATE: 25 Feb 2011

Hello Lokendra,

You could updates frequently. Anyway i think it is one time job.

My advice would be do insertion and updates in batch.
1. Parse your file and read 1000 lines
2. Do some aggregation and insert / update with lucene.
