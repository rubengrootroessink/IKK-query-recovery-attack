SUBJECT: Re: Cache full text into memory
DATE: 14 Jul 2010

You have two options
1. Store the compressed text as part of stored field in Solr.
2. Using external caching.

    You could use ehcache / Memcache / Membase.

The problem with external caching is you need to synchronize the deletions
and modification. Fetching the stored field from Solr is also faster.
