SUBJECT: Memory-based indexing

I've been doing a few tests, and I'm finding creating an index in Lucene to
be somewhat slower than other engines I've worked with. Is there a way to
cache, batch, or otherwise speed up indexing of a large number of documents?
This is mainly a problem when creating the index for the first time.
