SUBJECT: RE: Question about RangeQuery and strings...
DATE: 6 Jun 2002

I'm replying to my own message because I think I now understand the problem,
and part of it is, in my opinion, a bad implementation of RangedQuery.

When you create a ranged query and omit the lower term, my expectation would
be that I would find everything less than the upper term. Now if I pass
false for the inclusive term, then I would expect that I would find all
terms less than the upper term excluding the upper term itself.

What is happening in the case of lower_term=null, upper_term=x,
inclusive=false is that empty strings are being excluded because inclusive
is set false, and the implementation of RangedQuery creates a default lower
term of Term(fieldName, ""). Since it's not inclusive, it excludes "". This
isn't what I intended, and I don't think it's what most people would imagine
RangedQuery would do in the case I've mentioned.

I equate lower=null, upper=x, inclusive=false to Field < x. lower=null,
upper=x, inclusive=true would be Field <= x. In both cases, the only
difference should be whether or not Field = x is true for the query.

I'm still quite new to Lucene, so maybe I'm wrong about all this because I
just don't understand it well enough. If so, could someone tell me where
I've gone astray?

Thanks much,

James

PS: The rest of the problems I had below I was able to fix by changing how
the fields were tokenized and indexed.
