Nader,

I drew the same conclusion upon looking at the code, though we are only now
testing Lucene with large files. Much of the Lucene high level code appears
to me to be very brute force. I see the same problems with Filters. At the
company I'm working for, we're looking at re-implementing much of this code
to make it more efficient.

Subject: Boolean Query + Memory Monster



I have 1 Geg of memory on the machine with the application 
when I use a normal query it goes well, but when I use a range 
query it sucks the memory out of the machine and throws a servlet 
out of memory error, 
I have 80 000 records in the index and it's 43 MB large

anything people ?
