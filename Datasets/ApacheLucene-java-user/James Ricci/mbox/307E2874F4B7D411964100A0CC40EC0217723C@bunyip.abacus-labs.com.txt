SUBJECT: Are IndexReader objects always up to date?
DATE: 11 Jun 2002

Hi,

If I have an IndexReader object open, and someone else is using an
IndexWriter to update the contents of an index, will my IndexReader
automatically reflect the current contents of the index? If not, what must I
do to refresh it?

James
