SUBJECT: Numeric support
DATE: 24 May 2002

Is there any existing (or soon to exist) support in Lucene for handling
numeric data. Specifically, I'm looking for the same type of support that
exists in the DateFilter so that I can specify equality or ranges of numeric
data on certain fields.

Thanks,

James
