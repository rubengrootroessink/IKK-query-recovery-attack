SUBJECT: how to display text with \n,\r in jsp from textarea?
DATE: 25 Feb 2010


I am wondering as how all these sites (like this Expert-Exchange, hotmail,
etc etc) works which are able to show all 

kind of chars (KEEPING format) in your mail/postings. All these data are
entered in the TextField (like this one, 

where a I am typing this content), which goes to some database (like Oracle
in mycase). And then they are able to 

show the whole data back in some TextArea without any problem. I think if I
start taking care of each special char 

for me (like new line, ', " etc) then there could be no end for my code. I
believe there should be some mechanism by 

which whatever data you get from DB (Oracle) --> JSP Java String object -->
HTML TextArea and Vice-Versa without 

loosing any data and preventing the "Unterminated string constant". I
believe that some sort of encoding and 

decoding need to be done, but what those are? How all these sites do it.

Textarae:------

<tr>
<td>NOTES :-</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TEXTAREA Name="notes" rows="4"
cols="30"></TEXTAREA></td>
</tr>

JavaScript:----

var notes=document.Form.notes.value;
notes = notes.replace(/\n\r?/g, '<BR/>');

and saving it in db...as string..
and again retrivewing from db:------
notes = resultset.getString("notes"); 
notes = notes.replace("<BR/>","\n"); <--- is it corerect?

and displaying in jsp:----
<%
String notes =request.getAttribute("notes").toString();
out.println(notes);
%>


upto here ok....when i am edittng that notes in jsp as below:--
<tr>
<td>NOTES</td>
<td>:&nbsp;&nbsp;<html:textarea rows="6" 

cols="30"name="searchPrfForm" property="fprofilevo.notes"
styleId="notes"/></td>
</tr>

here also showing correct ,..but when i was click submit button..it was
showing error as unterminated string constant error..

on svae function:---
var notes=document.getElementById("notes").value;
notes = notes.replace(/\n\r?/g, '<BR/>'); 

plz tell me ..where i have to modify it?
how to display text with \n,\r in jsp from textarea?
