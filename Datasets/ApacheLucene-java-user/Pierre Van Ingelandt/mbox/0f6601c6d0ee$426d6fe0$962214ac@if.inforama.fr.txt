SUBJECT: Highlighting "really" found terms
DATE: 5 Sep 2006

Hello,

After a search, I need to highlight only the terms that do "really"
correspond to the query.
For instance :
1/ I search docs with toto and titi in the SAME sentence (using
SpanNotQuery(spanNearQuery({"toto","titi"},99999)),".") )
2/ Then I try to highlight "toto" and "titi" found (I use the queryscorer
from highlight package)

Then the problem is that it highlights ALL the titi and toto terms in the
documents. (even if they are not in the same sentence).
Is there a way to highlight only the terms really found ?

Thanks a lot !

Pierre
