Hi!

I'm using Lucene Proximity Searches, but I've seen Lucene only scores
documents which contain all the terms in the phrase. I also need to score
documents although they don't contain all those terms.  Is it possible with
Lucene PhraseQueries or SpanNearQuery? If not, could you tell me a way to
find my solution?

Thank you very much.
