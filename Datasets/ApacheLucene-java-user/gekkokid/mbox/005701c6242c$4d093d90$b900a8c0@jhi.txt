SUBJECT: deleting duplicate documents from my index
DATE: 28 Jan 2006

Hi, im trying to delete duplicate documents from my index, the unique indentifier is the documents
url (aka field "url").

my initial thought of how to acomplish this is to open the index via a reader and sort them
by the documents url and then iterate through them looking for a match with the current document
and the previous document, if it matches i would delete the current document etc.

what other methods that are not too taxing could i try?

how could i sort the documents via url internally? what classes should i be looking at to
do this


Thanks,
