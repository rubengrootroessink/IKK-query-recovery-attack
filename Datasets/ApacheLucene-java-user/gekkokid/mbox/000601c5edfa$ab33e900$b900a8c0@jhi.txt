DATE: 20 Nov 2005

Hello fellow lucener :), firstly im no tutor but i will try my best to 
explain, if anyone believes im wrong please state it so our friend doesnt 
get the wrong idea,

here it goes. O_o
stemming is reducing the word to the root form, where lemmatisation is 
concerned with linguistics i believe

lemmatisation is "go", "gone", "going", "goes", "been" and "went"

where stemming a word would be reducing a word from "gone" to "go", so it 
can be matched to other stemmed words such as "going", as "going" stemmed 
would be "go" also,

a better example.
"engineering", "engineers", "engineered", "engineer"

these four words would not match up if they were tested for equality, 
however by stemming these words we can reduce them to a more basic form,

engineering --> engineer
engineers --> engineer
engineered --> engineer
engineer --> engineer

now we have stemmed words they will match for equality, so now if i try 
searching using the word for engineer, documents on engineering, engineers 
and engineered would be returned from a stemmed index/database.


I hope that helps. Do a search for "porter stemmer" for more information.
