Can i use lucene to search the internet.you could use the google api, that would seem the easiest
method, however im not 100% sure what the program is meant to do, search the whole site or
just that page?

with the google api, you create a window, with inputs for the url and the keyword and it would
search that domain returning the first 10 results

if you are after a program that when you search with the url and keyword, it crawls that domain,
you can use lucene but you would have to find or create a basic crawler http://java-source.net/open-source/crawlers,
so it would crawl the domain and index the pages into RAM and once queried you could get the
result.

am i close? or miles off?
