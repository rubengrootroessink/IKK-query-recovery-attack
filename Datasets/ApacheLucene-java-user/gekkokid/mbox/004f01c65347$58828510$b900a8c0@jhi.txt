Hi,
    Lucene is a component that indexes data and allows you to search that 
indexed data, you need to be able to program in Java(various ports for other 
languages are available) or find a crawler you can adapt  to download the 
required data of the internet (still requires basic knowledge of Java), from 
what I can tell you are wanting (i.e. a tool that downloads files and 
indexes it and allowing you to search it), you should use Nutch, it is a 
Application unlike Lucene which is a software component that interfaces with 
the programmers code to provide a search facility of some sort for their 
application.
