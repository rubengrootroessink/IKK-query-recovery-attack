if your using windows just download subversion from subversion.tigris.org 
and install it - then just enter the command found on the lucene homepage or 
wiki :) via the command input (i.e. cmd), pretty much the same for linux i 
guess

Normally I wouldn't post this here, but I haven't been able to find any
info about how I would go about downloading the latest source from the
SVN repository. I've got a bit of experience with CVS, but I can't even
figure out where to start with SVN.

If anyone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it (we
could do it offline to avoid polluting this list any further).

Thanks
