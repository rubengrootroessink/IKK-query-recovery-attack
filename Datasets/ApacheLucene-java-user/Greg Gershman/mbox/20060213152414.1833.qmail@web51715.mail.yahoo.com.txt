SUBJECT: Re: Help with mass delete from large index
DATE: 13 Feb 2006

No problem; this is not meant to be a regular
operation, rather it's a (hopefully) one-time thing
till the index can be restructured.

The data is chronological in nature, deleting
everything before a specific point in time.  The index
is optimized, so is it possible to remove specific
files?  I'm open to other suggestions as to how to
approach this.

Also, I neglected to mention I'm using version 1.4.3.
