You may consider incrementally adding documents to
your index; I'm not sure why there would be problems
adding to an existing index, but you can always add
additional documents.  You can optimize later to get
everything back into a single segment.

Querying is a different story; if you are using the
Sort API, you will need enough memory to store a full
sorting of your documents in memory.  If you're trying
to sort on a string or anything other than an int or
float, this could require a lot of memory.

I've used indices much bigger than 5 mil. docs/3.5 gb
with less than 4GB of RAM and had no problems.
