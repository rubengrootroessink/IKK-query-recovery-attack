SUBJECT: FileDocument - Confused and Need Help.
DATE: 3 Sep 2007


Dear all, I am new to Lucene, am trying with the basics.

Basically I created sample text files with fields as follows:

textid 17
pubdate 63/01/04
pageid 20

I have been trying to edit FileDocument.java to read the fields above and

1. Index “textid” with value “17”
2. Index “pubdate” with value “19630104”
3. Index “pageid” with “20”

The pubdate field must be converted from the current format to the format
YYYYMMDD in order for a range search to be executed later.

Can anyone advise me how I can do this?

Thank you so much.
