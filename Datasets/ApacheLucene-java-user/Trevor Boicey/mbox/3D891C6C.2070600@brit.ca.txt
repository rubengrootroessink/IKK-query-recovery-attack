   I get that a lot, with varying numbers...

   Still holding on a solution... :<

   It seems once it starts getting the above error it'll never optimize 
again, and the drive slowly fills up. (I think the optimize partially 
succeeds, but leaves stray files around when it fails, so I end up with 
an index directory with dozens of very large files)

   The only solution I have is to delete the index and build it again, 
but with my app I only have to time that to run over a weekend. :<
