  Empty page from Tomcat often means that you are generating
an exception or smoething and the page is dying, but
you don't get very good debug information or output because
of output buffering and such, so where the page is dying isn't
clear from what you get.

  Put some more try {} sections in your dangerous code, and see
if you can get more info. Also try commenting in and out a few sections
at a time and see what you can find.
