SUBJECT: how to do simple search paging results of 100 each? and query syntax question
DATE: 19 Jun 2011

On the link
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/queryparsersyntax.html#Range%20Searches


There is ranged searched, how do I specify everything above a date from date 20020101  to
end of time?



Next, I am temporarily using lucene in a noSQL solution(to switch to Solr later after prototype)
and

So I am just indexing basic columns..no need for "top search results", etc.



When I look at the IndexSearcher and it's list of methods I am not sure how I can grab the
first 100

Results, then the second 100 results(that is if I need them), then the third 100 results (again
if needed)



I see a TopScoreDocCollector.create method but the IndexSearcher.search(Query, Collector)
method states only to call that method if you need ALL the results.  I definitely don't need
all but need to page through the

Results and typically exit out around the third page.  This is not a web app, so ideally I
want a reference held into the indexed tree so it can keep giving me the next 100 results.



Thanks,

Dean
