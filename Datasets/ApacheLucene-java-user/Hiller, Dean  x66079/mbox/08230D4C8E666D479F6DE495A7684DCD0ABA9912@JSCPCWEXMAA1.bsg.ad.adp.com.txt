SUBJECT: anyway to store value as bytes?
DATE: 20 Jun 2011

I see the api in Lucene is new Field(String, String, Store, Index)

Is there anyway to store one of the fields as byte[]?  Specifically the value I am looking
up I would like it to be byte[] instead of String.  All my other ones are String anyways.

Thanks,
Dean
