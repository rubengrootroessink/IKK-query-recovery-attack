Sweet, thanks.... hmmm, yeah, you should have just given me a http://lmgtfy.com/ link ;)...darn,
should have found that one myself.

I am storing pretty small data.

Thanks,
Dean

Does this help?
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_1/api/all/org/apache/lucene/util/IndexableBinaryStringTools.html

If not, here's a note from Ryan McKinley on another thread (googling
lucene storing binary data brought it up)...

******
You can store binary data using a binary field type -- then you need
to send the data base64 encoded.

I would strongly recommend against storing large binary files in solr
-- unless you really don't care about performance -- the file system
is a good option that springs to mind.

Best
Erick
