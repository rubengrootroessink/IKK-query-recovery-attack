SUBJECT: any documentation on creating a query without query language
DATE: 20 Jun 2011

I would like to skip creating the query using the query language.  Our queries are simple and
fixed
Like account = :account and strategy=:strategy and date > :date

So I would prefer maybe not to use a parser in the future sometime and am really just wondering
how.

For now, I am just going to use the parser to get my stuff done but was just curious on how
to form it manually if I wanted to.
Thanks,
Dean
