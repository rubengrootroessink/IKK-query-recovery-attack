I could kick myself in the head for that one....duh...that worked!  Thanks!!!  I should have
tried that earlier from your earlier email but for some reason I was stuck on trying to get
* working.
Thanks,
Dean

I'm not sure, but I'd try

author:dean AND date:[ 20110623 TO 99999999]

> You would think this second query would return the single result that was returned in
the first query, wouldn't it???  I mean it is asking for the same date inclusive and more...why
does Collector.collect never get called like nothing matches....stepping through the Lucene
code, Scorer is null for some reason and it skips collecting everything because of that. 
Any ideas?
