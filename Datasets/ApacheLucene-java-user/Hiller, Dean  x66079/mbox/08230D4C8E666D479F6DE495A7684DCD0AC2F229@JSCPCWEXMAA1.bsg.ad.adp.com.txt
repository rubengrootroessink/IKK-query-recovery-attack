SUBJECT: IndexWriter.optimize not using it breaks my test case :(
DATE: 22 Jun 2011

I read that in a lot of cases IndexWriter.optimize does not have to be called.

I then deleted it and my junit test case broke because results were coming back in the query
that were not supposed to be coming back :(.  I think everything is single tested.  Maybe
I should write a more raw junit test first? But I thought I would ask what exactly is optimize
doing and is Lucene thread safe...I read that it was somewhere(but also read elsewhere it
wasn't).

I kind of assumed my IndexWriters are not thread safe, but my IndexSearcher could be running
while another thread is using the IndexWriter, right?

(Of course, while my unit test is single threaded and failed with just this one line change,
our production system will be multithreaded which is why I ask).

Thanks,
Dean
