SUBJECT: Too many open files and ulimit limits reached
DATE: 30 Jun 2011

When I do a writer.open(), writer.add(), writer.close(), how many files can I expect to be
opened with Lucene.

I am running indexes on some very big data so we have 160000 writers open and I hit the limit
of 200000 on my machine so I increased it to the max of 1048576 files open, BUT that might
not be enough???  I may have to lower my cache of 160000 to be smaller so curious on how many
files open per index.

Thanks,
Dean
