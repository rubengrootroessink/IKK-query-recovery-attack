SQL IN operator behaves as OR operator. So as Occur.SHOULD does. It will match document only
if _one or more_ of the child queries match.

BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
query.add(new TermQuery(new Term("accountId", "1")), Occur.SHOULD);
query.add(new TermQuery(new Term("accountId", "2")), Occur.SHOULD);
query.add(new TermQuery(new Term("accountId", "3")), Occur.SHOULD);
