SUBJECT: PrefixQuery returning 0 results
DATE: 17 Feb 2010


I have indexed RDF in N-triple format (with three fields -- "subject",
"predicate", "object") and now am trying to query the index with a
PrefixQuery on the "subject" field. My test case is to get back all
documents whose subject field starts with the prefix "<http", and I would
expect to get back all documents. Instead, the PrefixQuery returns 0
documents. I have read and can't see why the PrefixQuery is returning 0
results. 

Here is the relevant code:

	IndexReader n3reader = IndexReader.open(FSDirectory.open(new File(index)),
true);	
	Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(n3reader);
	Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT);

	String test = "<http";

	Query nsQuery = new PrefixQuery(new Term("subject", test));
	
	TopDocs hits = searcher.search(nsQuery, 10);

	System.out.println("Hits: "+hits.totalHits);

This code prints out '0' hits ... Any suggestions for why this isn't
working?? Thanks,

Alison Callahan
