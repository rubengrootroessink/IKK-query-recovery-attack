SUBJECT: Re: query parser syntax -- does "-" require no-space after it to act as "prohibitor"?
DATE: 23 Jan 2007

Thank you. Lucene documentation is vague on this subject.

On the LIA-book -earch powered by Lucene it seems the "-" operator works as a prohibitor regardless
of the number of spaces after the "-".   Still can't tell if this is a bug or by design.

A Nutch parser, however, seems to have changed that.  I checked two Nutch/Lucene implementations
the web - Indeed.com and at Oregon State. Their parsers provide a more "standard" public web
search behavior.  I.e. the "-" is treated as a minus only if no space between it and the search
term.  Otherwise the "-"becomes just another search term in the query.

I think this is expected, and changing it would be more confusing.  Consider:
If "-" is expected to find a dash, surely "-x" should find a dash
followed by an x?

If you want literals, put quotes around your terms...
"Sales +    service"
