SUBJECT: Re: search on colon ":" ending words
DATE: 28 Jan 2007

We want to be able to return a result regardless if users use a colon or not in the query.
 So 'work:' and 'work' query should still return same result.

With the current parser if a user enters 'work:'  with a ":" , Lucene does not return anything
:-(.   It seems to me the Lucene parser issue.... we are wondering if there is any simple
way to make the Lucene parser ignore the ":" in the query?

any thoughts?

words without colons and search without them too? Let's say you index the
word "work:" Do you really want to have a search on "work" fail?

By and large, you're better off indexing and searching without
punctuation....
