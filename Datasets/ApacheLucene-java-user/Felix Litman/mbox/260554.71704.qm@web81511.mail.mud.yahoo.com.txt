SUBJECT: Re: search on colon ":" ending words
DATE: 6 Apr 2007


We ended up using String newquery = query.replace(query, ":", 
with space in quotes after the ":".   It worked great. Now results come back even if you use
colon in the query.  And one can still use ":" as a special operator if there is no space

afterwards.  Great suggestion.

Thanks!

 So 'work:' and 'work' query should still return same result.

anything :-(.   It seems to me the Lucene parser issue.... we are wondering if there is any
simple way to make the Lucene parser ignore the ":" in the query?

The StandardAnalyzer already strips out the colons from the indexed 
text, so all you need to do is get rid of them in the query.  Would

   String newquery = query.replace(query, ":", " ");

work?  It uses a space as the new text so that two query words that 
happened to be separated by the colon would still be separate words ...
