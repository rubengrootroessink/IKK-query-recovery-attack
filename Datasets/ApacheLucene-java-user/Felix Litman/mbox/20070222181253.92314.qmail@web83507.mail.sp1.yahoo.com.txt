Yes. thank you.  How did you make that modification not to treat ":" as a field-name terminator?

Is it using this  Or some other way?

String newquery = query.replace(query, ":", " ");
Thank you,
Felix

but I had a similar issue and I 
modified QueryParser.jj to not treat : as a field name terminator, so work: 
would then just be given as work: to the analyzer and treated as a search term.

anything :-(.   It seems to me the Lucene parser issue.... we are wondering if there is any
simple way to make the Lucene parser ignore the ":" in the query?
