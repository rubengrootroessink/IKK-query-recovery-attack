SUBJECT: query parser syntax  -- does "-" require no-space after it to act as "prohibitor"?
DATE: 23 Jan 2007

Does a special character lika a "-" prohibitor operator require no-space after it in order
to work as a prohibitor?
   
  Typically on the web, e.g. Google and others, the "-" operator works as a boolean prohibitor
only when not followed by a space. Otherwise it is treated as just a dash query term.
   
  But in our Lucene implementation the the "-" seem to be acting as a prohibitor even if there
is space after it.   For example. in a query:  Sales +    service    , the 'service' term
is excluded by Lucene.  (Same for the "+" operator.)
   
  Is this space-treatment a bug or a standard Lucene query parser behavior?
  
Thank you,
  Felix
