SUBJECT: search on colon ":" ending words
DATE: 28 Jan 2007

Is there a simple way to turn off field-search syntax in the Lucene parser, and have Lucene
recognize words ending in a colon ":" as search terms instead?

Such words are very common occurrences for our documents (or any plain text), but Lucene does
not seem to find them. :-(

Thank you,
Felix
