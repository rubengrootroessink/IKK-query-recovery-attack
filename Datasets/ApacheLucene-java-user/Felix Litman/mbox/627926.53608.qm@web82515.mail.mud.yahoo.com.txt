Yes, thank you. That would be a good solution.  But we are using Lucene's Standard Analyzer.
 It seems to index words with colons ":" and other punctuation by default.  Is there a simple
way to have the Analyzer not to index colons specifically and punctuation in general?

words without colons and search without them too? Let's say you index the
word "work:" Do you really want to have a search on "work" fail?

By and large, you're better off indexing and searching without
punctuation....
