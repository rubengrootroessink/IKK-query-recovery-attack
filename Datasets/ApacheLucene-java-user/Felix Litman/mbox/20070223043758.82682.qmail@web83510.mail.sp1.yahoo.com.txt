OK. Thank you.  We'll have to consider using this approach.
   
  I guess the drawback here is that ":" will not longer work as a field operator. ?:-(
   
  We were also considering using the following approach.
   
  String newquery = query.replace(query, ": ", " "); 
   
  It seems this way a colon should still work as a field operator if followed by a query term
with no space in between
   
  Thanks,
  Felix.

I removed the : handling stuff from QueryParser.jj in the method:

Query Clause(String field) :

I removed this section
---
[
LOOKAHEAD(2)
(
fieldToken= {field=discardEscapeChar(fieldToken.image);}
| {field="*";}
)
]
---

and you can also remove the COLON and : related bits to do with start terms and 
escaped chars if you want to exclude treating : as a separator, but from memory, 
it's the above section that does the field recognition.
