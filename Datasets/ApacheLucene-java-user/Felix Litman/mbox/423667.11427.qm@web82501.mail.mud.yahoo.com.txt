SUBJECT: "did you mean..." feature
DATE: 30 Jan 2007

We are implementing the  "did you mean..."  on top of Lucene,  leveraging ideas of the "Did
you mean Lucene?" article.   (Many thanks to Tom White for such a useful and clear  article...!)
   
  We are having some difficultiies getting good "did you means"  for multiword queries.
   
  Did anyone have success in getting "did you mean..." to work well for multiword queries?
   
  Any thoughts on the latest recommended approach?
   
  Thank you,
Felix
