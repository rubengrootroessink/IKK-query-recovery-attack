SUBJECT: proximity and location scoring
DATE: 23 Jan 2007

Is there a straightforward way to extend the "standard" parser to incorporate proximity into
the score in multi-word queries, including boost factors?  I.e. score results higher when
query terms appear closer toghether then when scattered?
   
  How about incorporating search term location in the score?  I.e. score results higher where
terms appear closer to the beginning of the search field...
   
  Thank you,
  Felix
