SUBJECT: Need an analyzer that includes numbers.
DATE: 25 Dec 2004

I've seen some discussion on this and the answer seems to be "write your 
own".  Hasn't someone already done that by now that would share?  I 
really have to be able to include numeric and alphanumeric strings in my 
searches.   I don't understand analyzers well enough to roll my own.

Thanks,
Jim.
