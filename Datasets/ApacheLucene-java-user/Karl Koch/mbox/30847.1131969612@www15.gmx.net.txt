Hi Jian,

Are you sure of that? This would be quite a bad thing to do. I am refering
to the paper by Robertson at al

http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/robertson04simple.html

in which it is shown that summing up of multiple scores violates a number of
basic assumptions in TF/IDF. Although it is shown on the BM25 algorithm it
is generalisable to a scoring function like the one used in Lucene.
