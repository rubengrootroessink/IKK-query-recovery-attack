SUBJECT: Applied Lucene: Search functionality on PDAs
DATE: 17 Aug 2005

Hello all,

I am developing code for Lucene 1.2 on a Sharp Zaurus using Java 1.1/1.2.
(Unfortunately I was not able to run version 1.3 on this setting.) Does
somebody know projects (eventually Open Source) also concerned with running
Lucene on platforms that only allow small footprint applications. 

Does anybody know mailinglists, forums, books, etc. with this topic?

Best Regards,
Karl
