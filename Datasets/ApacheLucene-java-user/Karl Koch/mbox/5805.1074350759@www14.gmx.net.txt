Hello back,

according to the JavaDoc it means:

"Returns the stored fields of the nth Document in this index."

In your case than if would mean the greater n the younger the doc. However I
am not sure how you can create such an index. I think you should have a look
to the Luke project, which allows you ot access and  look into Lucene
Indices.

If I did not answer your question, please explain a little bit further...

Karl
