SUBJECT: Re: which HTML parser is better?
DATE: 3 Feb 2005

I am using Java 1.1 with a Sharp Zaurus PDA. I have very limited memory
constraints. I do not think CPU performance is a big issues though. But I
have other parts in my application which use quite a lot of memory and
soemthing run short. I therefore do not look into solutions which build up
tag trees etc. More like a solution who reads a stream of HTML and
transforms it into a stream of text.

I see your point of using an external program. I am however not entirely
sure if this is available. Also it would be much simpler to have a 3-5 kB
solution in Java, perhaps encapsulated in a class which does the job without
the need for advanced libraries which need 100-200 KB on my internal
storage. 

I hope I could clarify my situation now.

Cheers,
Karl
