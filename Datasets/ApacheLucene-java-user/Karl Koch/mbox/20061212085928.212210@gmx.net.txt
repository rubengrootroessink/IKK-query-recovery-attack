Hello Doron (and all the others who read here):),

thank you for your effort and your time. I really appreciate it. :)

I understand why normalisation is done in general. Mainly, to normalise the bias of oversized
documents. In the literature I have read so far, there is usually a high effort on document
normalisation (simply because they may be very different in size), and usually no normalisation
on queries (simply because they are usually only a few words anyway). 

For this reason, I do not understand why Lucene (in version 1.2) normalises the query(!) with


norm_q : sqrt(sum_t((tf_q*idf_t)^2)) 

which is also called cosine normalisation. This is a technique that is rather comprehensive
and usually used for docuemnts only(!) in all systems I have seen so far.  For the documents
Lucene employs its norm_d_t which is explained as:

norm_d_t : square root of number of tokens in d in the same field as t

basically just the square root of the number of unique terms in the document (since I do search
over all fields always). I would have expected cosine normalisation here... 

The paper you provided uses document normalisation in the following way:

norm = 1 / sqrt(0.8*avgDocLength + 0.2*(# of unique terms in d))

I am not sure how this relates to norm_d_t. Did I misunderstood the Lucene formula or do I
misinterpret something? I enclosed the formula as a graphic (from LaTeX) so you can have a
look should this be the case here...

I will post the other questions separately since they actually also relate to the new Lucene
scoring algoritm (they have not changed). Thank you for your time again :)

Karl
