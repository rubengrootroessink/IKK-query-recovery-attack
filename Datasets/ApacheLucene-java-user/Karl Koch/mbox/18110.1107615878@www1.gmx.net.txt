SUBJECT: Some questions about index...
DATE: 5 Feb 2005

Hi all,

for simplicity reasons I would like to use the index as my data storage
whilst using the advantage of the highly optimised Lucene index structure.

1) Can I store all the information of the text file, but also apply a
analyser. E.g. I use the StopAnalyzer. After finding the document, I want to
extract the original text also from the index. Does this require that I
store the information twice in two different fields (one indexed and one
unindexed) ?

2) I would like to extract information from the index which can found in a
boolean way. I know that Lucene is a VSM which provides Boolean operators.
This however does not change its functioning. For example, I have a field
with contains an ID number and I want to use the search like a database
operatation (e.g. to find the document with id=1). I can solve the problem
by searching with query "id:1". However, this does not ensure that I will
only get one result. Usually the first result is the document I want. But it
could happen, that this sometimes does not work. What happens if I should
get no results? I guess if I search for id=5 and 5 did not exist I would
probably get 50, 51, .. just because the contain 5. Did somebody work with
this and can suggest a stable solution?

A good solution for these two questions would help me avoiding a database
which would need to replicate most the data which I already have in my
Lucene index...

Kind Regards,
Karl
