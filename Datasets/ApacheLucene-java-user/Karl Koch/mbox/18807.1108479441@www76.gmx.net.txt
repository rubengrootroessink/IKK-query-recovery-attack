SUBJECT: Re: Lucene on PersonalJava ?? HELP!
DATE: 15 Feb 2005

Hello,

thank you for the tip. I have solved the problem in a different way. If
anybody else want to run Lucene on PJava, he/she might go for the same.

I am using the cvm VM instead of the jeode VM. Then it works fine with
Lucene 1.2 withtout any change in my code or in the Lucene code. Perhaps
even with a newer version (but havn't tested yet). :-)

Thank you anyway,
Karl
