DATE: 21 Jan 2004

Hi Doug,

thank you for the answer so far.

I actually wanted to add a large amount of text from an existing document to
find a close related one. Can you suggest another good way of doing this. A
direct match will not occur anyway. How can I make a most Vector Space Model
(VSM) like query (each word a dimension value - find documents close to
that)? You know as good as I that the standard VSM does not have any Boolean logic
inside... how do I need to formuate the query to make it as much similar to
a vector in order to find similar document in the vector space of the Lucene
index?

Cheers,
Karl
