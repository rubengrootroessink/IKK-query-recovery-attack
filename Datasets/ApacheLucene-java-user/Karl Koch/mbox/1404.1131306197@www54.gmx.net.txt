DATE: 6 Nov 2005

Hello Ira,

I am not sure if I know exactly what pivoted normalisation is. I can tell
you what I do, in the meantime I will have a look to your paper and I hope
that we can discuss this issue further.

I work in personalised searching where a second model - a user model - 
expresses extra relevance of a document; however from a different
prespective. I also value the use of TF/IDF to represent the content sided
view on content relevance. Therefore, I would like to combine both scores
(the one from Lucene and the one from my model) into a combined score.
Furthermore, I need to normalise this score so it cannot get higher than
1.0. At the moment, I have a visulisation scheme that works on this premise.

In Lucene, scores seem to be normalised only if they exceed the 1.0 maximum
border. If they do not exceed this max value, they are left where they are. 

Based on that I have now solved my problem to combine my two scores (Lucene
and mine) and if they exceed, I normalise the scores like Lucene does. I
think this is the most accurate think I could do in this case where I do not
violoate the overall meaning of scoring for the user. 

I realise that if I always normalise (to a 0.0 to 1.0 range) I will
introduce a dangerous feature that basically boosts a bunch of low scored
documents (e.g. all between 0.1 and 0.2) unnecessarily high (in this case
right up to between 0.5 and 1.0).

What would you say about that? Does is make sense?

Kind Regards,
Karl
