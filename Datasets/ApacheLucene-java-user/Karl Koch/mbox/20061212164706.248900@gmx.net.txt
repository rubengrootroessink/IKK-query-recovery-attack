Hello Steven,

I looked up the paper and read the relevant part. The text quote you provided is from the
introcution. I belief that quote referes to the basic purpose of an information retrieval
system in general. At least to the purpose of a vector space model IR system. 

If this is the theoretical justfication of the coord_q_d normalisation than it is actually
replicating the the other part of the scoring formula to some degree. The entire forumla is
actually concerned with this - comparing the term frequencies of query and document.

Is there any other paper that actually shows the benefit of doing this particular normalisation
with coord_q_d? I am not suggesting here that it is not useful, I am just looking for evidence
how the idea developed.

Karl
