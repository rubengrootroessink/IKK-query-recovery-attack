SUBJECT: Re: HELP! JIT error when searching... Lucene 1.3 on Java 1.1
DATE: 8 Feb 2005

I have a colleague which uses Lucene 1.3 on PersonalJava (equally to Java
1.1.8). I can't find a significant difference to his code (sill searching)
but he did not many any changes. He did also not recompile Lucene 1.3 on
1.1.8 etc.

It must be something simple. I will look for that switch...

In the meantime, I am thankful for any other help.

Cheers,
Karl
