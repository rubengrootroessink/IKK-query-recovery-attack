Hello all,

oh, I just found a mail from Doug where he wrote that Dmitry Serebrennikov
developed something who provides Document vector access:

Who has this code? Could somebody email it to me? I would highly appreciate
it.

Is there any attempt from Dmitry or somebody else to adapt it to Lucene 1.3?


I wish you all a nice weekend,
Karl
