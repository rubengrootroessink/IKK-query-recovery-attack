SUBJECT: XML index
DATE: 27 Jan 2005

Hi,

I want to use kXML with Lucene to index XML files. I think it is possible to
dynamically assign Node names as Document fields and Node texts as Text
(after using an Analyser). 

I have seen some XML indexing in the Sandbox. Is anybody here which has done
something with a thin pull parser (perhaps even kXML)? Does anybody know of
a project or some sourcecode available which covers this topic?

Karl
