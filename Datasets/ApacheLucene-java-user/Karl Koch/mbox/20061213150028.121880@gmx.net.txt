Hello Steven,

unfortunately I don't have access to these books right now. I will try to get hold of them.
Thank you for these pointers. :)

I had a quick look at "coordination level matching" on the web and found evidence that this
seemed to be an early retrieval strategy. My question is mainly, why one should use coordination
level matching, if one is already doing (proper) TFxIDF based matching. When I look at Lucenes
scoring forumla, it seems to me that two kinds of matching are performed and combined together
in a single matching formula. 

In the paper, "Exploiting the Similarity of Non-matching Terms at Retrieval Time" which can
be found here:

http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/~fabioc/papers/00-jir.pdf

it is directly compared with TFxIDF. To me, it seems that coordination level matching could
be used if I don't want to use TFxIDF but not together with it. In this context, I wonder
what benefit the "coordination level matching" has in combination with TFxIDF?

It is likely that I have some kind of misunderstanding here. Perhaps with your help I can
untangle that a bit further. As I said earlier, I am only looking for a reasonable explaination
(perhaps augmented with some evidence in literature) that makes it clear why it is used together
with TFxIDF.

Thank you,
Karl
