SUBJECT: Question about scoring normalisation
DATE: 5 Nov 2005

Hello all,

I am wondering how many of you actually work with own scoring mechanism
(overwriting Lucenes standard scoring) and how many of you do work on how to
normalise this score. 

I would like to add a second score on top of Lucenes TF/IDF score. The
resulting score is most likely higher then 1.0. However, the score should be
between 0.0 and 1.0. What is the best way to do that? If Lucene is
normalising its score (if no boosting is applied) to a maximium of 1.0, how
is this done (in Lucene 1.2 and/or beyond) ?

Regards,
Karl
