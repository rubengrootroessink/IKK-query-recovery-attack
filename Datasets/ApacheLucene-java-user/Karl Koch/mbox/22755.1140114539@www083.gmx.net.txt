SUBJECT: Vector Space Model <-> Probabilistic Model
DATE: 16 Feb 2006

I am looking for a comparison between the theoretical Vector Space Model and
the theoretical Probabilistic Model in Information Retrieval. I know that
comcrete implementations do differ from that. However, I am looking for
papers that compare the performance of both in particular applications.

Does anybody know about good books that focus on this matter?
