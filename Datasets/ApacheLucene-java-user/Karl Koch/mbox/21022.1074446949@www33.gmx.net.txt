SUBJECT: Re: Extracting particular document from index
DATE: 18 Jan 2004

Hi all,

I have only the file information about its location and the name of the
file. I want to know two things. There is also an index made from suche files
also containing the file I am looking for. I want to know two things:
1) first of all, all fields witch can be searched within this index.
2) secondly, the content as it is represented in each field. 

As you can see, I am asking for the way back. From the file itself I cannot
interfere how it was indexed. The indexer has parsed and devided it somehow.
Something I dunno know. This information should be in the index. I am
basically looking for a functionalty like this:

Index index = new Index("X:/myindex");
Field[] fields = index.getAllFields();
String[] fieldNames = new String[fields.length];
for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++){
  fieldNames[i] = fields[i].stringValue();
}

Using the field name I know now, I could perform a search and get the first
entry of the Hits list, which would be my Document. :-)

Does something like that exist in Lucene?

Cheers mates,
Karl
