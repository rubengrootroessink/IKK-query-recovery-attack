It does sound very strange to me, to default to a WildCardQuery! Suppose I am looking for
"bold", I am getting hits for "old". 

IMO, you should move the WildcardQuery and just use a simple QueryParser (with the analyzer
you use at indexing time). Your problem below arises from the fact that you construct your
search with WildcardQuery(Term t) and t = new Term("field","Joe's");

But, now you are looking for a term that is very likely not to be present in the index, although
you idnexed text that contains "Joe's". The StandardAnalyzer() for example would probably
split in ' , and ignores the s. If you use queryparser instead of creating your own term,
you are save (and you have no problems with case-sensitive either).

If you do not really understand why it works like this, it might be good to play around with
luke: open your index with luke, go to plugins tab, and put in some text and see how it is
tokenized with some sample analyzers.
