Hello Askar,

Which analyzer are you using for indexing and searching? If you use an analyzer that uses
stemming, you might see that "change", "changing", "changed", "chan" etc al get reduced to
the same word "chan".

In luke you can test with plugins that show you what tokens are created from your analyzer,

Regards Ard
