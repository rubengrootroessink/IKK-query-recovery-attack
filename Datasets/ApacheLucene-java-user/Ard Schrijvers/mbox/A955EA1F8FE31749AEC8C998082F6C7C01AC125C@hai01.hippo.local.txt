Yes....so you think that if you use StandardAnalyzer(), and you index a field with 192.168.102.151,
and then you use the queryparser [1] to search for "102", you do not get a hit? Lucene would
not have the status it has if it could not do this. Obviously, it depends on your analyzer
how the indexing is done exactly. 

I disencourage you to use the WildCardQuery when it is not needed.
