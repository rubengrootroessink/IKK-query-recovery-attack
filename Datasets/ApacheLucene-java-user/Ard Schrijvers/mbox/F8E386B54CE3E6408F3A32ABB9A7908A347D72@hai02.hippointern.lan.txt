SUBJECT: RE: how can i store lucene results from a webpage to a oracle database
DATE: 8 Nov 2007

I suppose you have for about 5 minutes to display a single search ? :-)

Perhaps before pointing out your possible solutions, you might better
start describing your functional requirements, because your suggested
solution is headed for problems. So you need custom ordering, check out
lucene scoring and see if you can hook it in there. First gathering
*all* results, store *all* of them in a database, and do some new
ordering is like....pretty horrible :-)
