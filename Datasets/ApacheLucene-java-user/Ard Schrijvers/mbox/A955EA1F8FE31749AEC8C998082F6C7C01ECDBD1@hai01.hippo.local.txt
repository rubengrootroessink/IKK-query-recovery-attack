10 updates per minute is not very much? Why not invalidate your used reader after every commit,
and reopen it? If your index is really big, you might want to reopen it fewer times, but this
is very simple to do (reopen every x updated times)

Also the RAM and FS solution Erick suggests is possible, but this is only really neccessary
for *big* indices. At [1] you can find an example of this RAM/FS methodoly working together
(see VolatileIndex, PersitentIndex and SearchIndex)

I'm not reindexing the entire index. I'm just commiting the updated. But I'm
not sure how it would affect performance to commit in real time. I think
right now I have like 10 updated per minute.
