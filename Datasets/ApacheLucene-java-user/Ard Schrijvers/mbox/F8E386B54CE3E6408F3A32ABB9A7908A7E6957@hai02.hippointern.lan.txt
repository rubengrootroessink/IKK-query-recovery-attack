SUBJECT: Reusing indexed and analyzed documents
DATE: 21 Jan 2008

Hello, 

is there a way to reuse a Lucene document which was indexed and analyzed
before, but only one single Field has changed? The use case (Jackrabbit
indexing) is when a *lot* of documents have a common field which
changes, and the rest of the document is unchanged . I would guess that
there is a more efficient way then reindexing and analyzing all fields
(it is present in the index already). I understand that I need to append
a new Lucene Document, so the old one needs to be deleted, but I hoped I
can somehow reuse the already analyzed unchanged fields. Does anybody
know if this is possible? 

Do I understand correctly that the per-document payload feature will
give me this possibility in the future? Can I also query on payload
values (might be dumb question but I just learned about the Payload
feature :-) )?

thanks for any pointers,

Regards Ard
