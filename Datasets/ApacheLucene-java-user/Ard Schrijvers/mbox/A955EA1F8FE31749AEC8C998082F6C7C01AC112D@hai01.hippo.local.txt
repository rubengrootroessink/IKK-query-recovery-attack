It is obviously not possible to get the original tokens of the document back when you haven't
stored the document, because:

1) the analyzer might have removed stop words in the first place
2) the terms in lucene index are perhaps stemmed words / synonyms / etc etc
3) how would you expect things like spaces, commas, dots etc to be restored?

And, I think what you want does not comply with an inverted index. When you do not store the
document, you always loose information about the document during indexing/analyzing

How many documents are you talking about? They must be either somewhere on FS or accessible
over http...when you need the document, why not just provide a link to the original location?
