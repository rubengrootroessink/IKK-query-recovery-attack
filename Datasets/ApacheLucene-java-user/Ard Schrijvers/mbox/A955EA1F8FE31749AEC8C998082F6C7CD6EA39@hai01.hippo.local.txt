What do you mean by retrieving? Do you mean retrieving terms, or do you mean doing a search
with words you know that should be in, but you do not find a match?

In the latter, you must make sure that you are using the same analyzer for the search as you
used for indexing.

Look at other clases that implement TokenStream. Also take a look at setPositionIncrement
when you are putting in your own terms
