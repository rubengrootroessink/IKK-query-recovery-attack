I was already afraid I could not reuse document instances. Caching
pre-tokenized fields won't be a solution to our issue: for Jackrabbit
NGP (next generation persistence) we are thinking about storing path
info (a hierarchical data structure) of nodes (node+props = lucene
document) in the lucene index. 

Now, to be able to still have a reasonal acceptable performance in
moving nodes (and thus possibly changing a large subtree of nodes) we
would only like to reindex the changed path of all the subnodes, thus a
single Lucene Field. The other fields stay the same, so re-indexing and
analyzing all the content would really be inefficient (impossible). 

Aaah, I just see your next mail arriving while typing :-) I think that
exactly covers my issue,

thanks a lot Karl for your pointers!

Regards Ard
