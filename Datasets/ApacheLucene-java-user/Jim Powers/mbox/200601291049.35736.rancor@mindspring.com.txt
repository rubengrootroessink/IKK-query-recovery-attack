SUBJECT: Re: grouping results by fields
DATE: 29 Jan 2006

We're doing something very similar.  Recently C|Net started using Lucene and 
there is a blog entry about how they implemented a "category" scheme that 
basically does what you want.

http://www.nabble.com/Announcement%3A-Lucene-powering-CNET.com-Product-Category-Listings-t266441.html#a748420

The idea is to generate a bunch of bitsets where the ordinal bit number is 
based on the document number in the index.

First result set: perform your search.  Then generate a bitset called FRSBS 
(full result set bitset).

Next: foreach "word" you want to count generate a bitset (you do this by 
traversing the index directly for each word).  Call these bitsets WBS(n) 
(word bit set n.  n spans 1..m where m is the total number of words you want 
to count against)

Finally: to get a count per word bit-wise AND each WBS(n) with FRSBS and count 
up the 1s
