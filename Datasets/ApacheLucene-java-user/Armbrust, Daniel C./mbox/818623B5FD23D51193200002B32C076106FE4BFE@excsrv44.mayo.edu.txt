SUBJECT: Multithreaded MultiSearcher?
DATE: 22 Apr 2003

The Jguru FAQ states:

MultiSearcher searches indices sequentially.
Multi-CPU machines would benefit from a multi-threaded version of MultiSearcher that performs
multiple searches in parallel. 

Assuming this is still true in 1.3RC1, my question is has anyone out there implemented a multi-threaded
version of the MultiSearcher?

Would you be willing to share?

Thanks, 

Dan
