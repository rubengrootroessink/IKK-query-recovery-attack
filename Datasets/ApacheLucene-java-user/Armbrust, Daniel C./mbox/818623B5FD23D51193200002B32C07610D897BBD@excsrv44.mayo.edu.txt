SUBJECT: Query creation
DATE: 4 Dec 2003

Is it possible to create a query that would find a match in a document if and only if the query
(a one word query) matched with the first word in the field I am searching?

Or do I have to rebuild my indexes, with a field that only contains the first word?

Thanks, 

Dan
