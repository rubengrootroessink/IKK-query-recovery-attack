As long at the field can be sorted alphabetically, you can build your own
filter.  

If you put your field in as the same length number, i.e.

001
010
136

Then you can build a filter (that will be mostly cut and paste from the date
filter class)

which will allow you to do less than and greater than operations.

Subject: Searching greater than/less than


Can I use lucene to search greater than / less than a value in the field? I 
have a field in the document that function as a score. I would need to be 
able to search the index + the option having to say a field > 50
