SUBJECT: RE: Indexing very large sets (10 million docs)
DATE: 28 Jul 2003

Oh, and you may be short on diskspace.... You must have double the amount of diskspace available
as the end size of your index to call optimize - you may get by with less diskspace if just
do a single merge - never calling optimize - but I'm not sure about this.  

Our index of 15 million documents is over 100 GB.  But the index size will vary a lot depending
on how many of the fields you store (vs just index) and how big your documents are....
