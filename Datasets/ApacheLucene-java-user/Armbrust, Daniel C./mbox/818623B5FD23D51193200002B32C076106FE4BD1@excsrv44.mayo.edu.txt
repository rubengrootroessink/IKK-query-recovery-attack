SUBJECT: Extra blank field in index?
DATE: 15 Apr 2003

When I create an index, and then read back the available fields on my index using IndexReader.getFieldNames,
the collection it returns always has one more field than I added.  

In the simplest case, when I added one document which only had one field to the index, according
to my debugger, the SegmentReader class's fieldInfos object is holding two fields, one of
which is the one I added, the other is the mystery field.  It reports isIndexed=false, name="".

Is this just normal operation, or is it a bug of sorts?  

(Using 1.3 RC1)

Thanks, 

Dan
