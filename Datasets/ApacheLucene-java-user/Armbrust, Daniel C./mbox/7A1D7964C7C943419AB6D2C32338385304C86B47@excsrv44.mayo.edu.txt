Ahh - two new discoveries:

You have to add a document, remove a document, and then call optimize.   Then everything works
(nearly as expected)

The version of Lucene that ships with Luke still has the broken optimize code in it that didn't
clean up after itself - so you need to just download Luke, and then run it with 1.4.1 of Lucene,
rather than what is ships with (which the website indicates is 1.4 RC4)
