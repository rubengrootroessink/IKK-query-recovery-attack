You can also still use a date filter... You just have to write your own (this is what we did)

Its basically a copy of the current date filter... With a couple of minor changes.

The other option that some people have used is to not use the DateField 
and just create your own format following the
yyyyMMdd format

So 20020101 for Jan 1, 2002

Note that you cannot use the Date Filter to filter dates.

However you can use the built in range query (see query syntax for more 
details).

So to search for all dates in 2002 in the pubDate field you can use

pubDate:[20020101 - 20021231]

Note the space on either side of the dash (-).

Since this is just a string, it is not affected by the 1970 issues. I 
hope this helps.
