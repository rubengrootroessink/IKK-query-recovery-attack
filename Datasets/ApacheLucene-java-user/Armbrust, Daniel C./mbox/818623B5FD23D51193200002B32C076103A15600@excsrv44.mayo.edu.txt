I currently have an index of ~ 12 million documents, which are each about
that size (but in xml form).

When they are transformed for lucene to index, there are upwards of 50
searchable fields.

The index is about 10 GB right now.

I have not yet had any problems with "pushing the limits" of lucene.

In the next few weeks, I will be pushing my number of indexed documents up
into the 15-20 million range.  I can let you know if any problems arise.

Is there a known limit to the number of documents that Lucene can handle
efficiently?  I'm looking to index around 15 million, 2K docs which contain
7-10 searchable fields. Should I be attempting this with Lucene?

Thanks,

Joel
