As I understand hyperthreading, this is not true:

You still have the full speed of the processor available - the processor itself just keeps
switching between different threads of execution.  Some people have noted that some (single
threaded) applications will run 5-10% slower when hyperthreading is turned on - but that depends
on the app.  It certainly won't be running at half speed.
