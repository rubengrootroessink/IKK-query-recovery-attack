I believe optimization will take 2X your index size, as it has to rewrite out the entire index
into a new set of files.

It may not be quite 2X, but its pretty close in my observations.

Hi,

I have a index which is about 4g.b in size . now if i opmimize this index it seems to take
extra space of abt. 2-3g.b during the optimization step. Once this is done the size again
comes down. 

What i would like to know is weather there is a basis on which i can calculate the amount
of space which would be required for optimizing a given index . 

Thanks and Regards
Harpreet
