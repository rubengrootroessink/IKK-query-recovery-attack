Thanks.  It makes much more sense now.  For a while there I thought maybe
the BitSets were performing some black magic that I hadn't yet learned

Dan,

Totally my bad. I had since changed it but hadn't posted it to the list coz

Here's the correct version. I haven't really documented since it's pretty
straightforward. Just holler if you need any help.

Regards,
Kelvin
