SUBJECT: Compound File Format question
DATE: 8 Sep 2004

Is it safe to change the compound file format option at any time during the life of an index?

Can I build an index with it off, then turn it on, and call optimize, and have a compound
file formatted index?

And then later, turn it on, call optimize again, and go back the other way?

The JavaDocs don't say much of anything about it (oh - and PS - there is a copy and paste
error in the description for the getUseCompoundFile() method)

Thanks, 

Dan
