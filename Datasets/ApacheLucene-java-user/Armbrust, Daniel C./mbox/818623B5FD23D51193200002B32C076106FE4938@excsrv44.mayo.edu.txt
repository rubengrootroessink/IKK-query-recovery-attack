Class that was used (attached)

And correction, the UnStored field had 1000 words, not 500.

Otis doesn't mind.

-------------

One more bit of info that I should have included:

The randomly generated documents consisted of 2 fields, one Text with 3 words, and one UnStored
with 500 words.  Average word length was 7 characters.

If Otis (he wrote it, I just made a tweak or two) doesn't mind, I'll post the source code.
