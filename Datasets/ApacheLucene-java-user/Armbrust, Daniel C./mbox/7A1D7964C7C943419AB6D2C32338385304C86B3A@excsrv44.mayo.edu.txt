Hmm, I tried that in Luke - but it doesn't seem to take.  When I uncheck the use compound file
check box, and then select optimize, it doesn't change anything.

I guess I should just write some code already :)

In my experience it's safe. I've been doing this in a couple of real 
applications, and also in Luke there is an option to re-pack the index 
using compound or not.
