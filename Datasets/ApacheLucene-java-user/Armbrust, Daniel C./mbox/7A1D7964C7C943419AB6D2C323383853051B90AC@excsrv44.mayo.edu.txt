There was a broken version of Lucene in there - (I think the 1.4 release?) which was not cleaning
up old files after you did an optimize in certain cases.   For me, upgrading to 1.4.1, and
re-optimizing automatically cleaned up the index.

You may have to add and remove a "dummy" document first, so the optimize actually occurs (if
your index is currently optimized)
