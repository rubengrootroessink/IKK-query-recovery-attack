So I should be able to safely use a list of stopwords while creating an index, and then not
pass in any stopwords when searching the index, and get the same behavior as if I had passed
in the list of stopwords - Since they weren't put into the index to begin with, they are impossible
to search with regardless of the stopwords that I use for searching.

I think Otis's example was backwards...

Consider a simple example:
When indexing you list 'house' as a stop word.
When searching you do not list 'house' as a stop word.

Consequence:
You did _not_ index 'house' terms, but you cannot find any documents if you search for 'house'.

The inverse is more interesting to make the point:
When indexing you do not list 'house' as a stop word.
When searching you list 'house' as a stop word.

Consequence:
You did index 'house' terms, but you cannot find any documents if you search for 'house' (because
it was removed from the query).
Your index is bloated with terms that can never be successfully searched.

I'm missing something obvious, I know it.... But, if I list 'house' as a stop word when I
am indexing, doesn't that mean that any occurrence of the word house is not indexed, and therefore
not findable in the index?  So it wouldn't matter if 'house' was in my stopwords list when
searching, because its not findable anyway?

Yes.

Consider a simple example:
When indexing you list 'house' as a stop word.
When searching you do not list 'house' as a stop word.

Consequence:
You did index 'house' terms, but you cannot find any documents if you search for 'house'.
