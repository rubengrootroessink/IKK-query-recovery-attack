SUBJECT: Lucene, Cannot rename segments.new to segments
DATE: 22 Feb 2006

I am getting intermittent errors with Lucene.  Here are two examples:
java.io.IOException: Cannot rename E:\lucene\segments.new to E:\lucene\segments
java.io.IOException: Cannot rename E:\lucene\_8ya.tmp to E:\lucene\_8ya.del

This issue has an open BugZilla entry:
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36241

I thought this error must be caused by an error in my application.  To
try and solve the error I used the LuceneIndexAccessor in my
application:
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34995

I am still getting the error.

1) Is there a reason (other than time and resource) why the bug report
is still set to "NEW" after 6 months (since August 2005)?

2) Is the problem likely to be in my application?  Any ideas how I
could go about solving this issue?

Thanks for your help
Patrick
