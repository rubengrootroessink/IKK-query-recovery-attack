It seems when I do a search such as "covered wagon" ~5 or the like,
the systems disregards the order of my terms.  I.E., it will find covered
within 5 of wagon and it will also find wagon within 5 of covered.

Is there anyway to make the system respond only to the order of the
terms as entered in the query?
