SUBJECT: Indexer not fully indexing documents
DATE: 21 May 2003

I have just downloaded the Lucene 1.2 distribution.  

After running through the demo, I decided to index (using IndexFiles that is used to load
the demo documents) about 100 XML files that I have available - most of which range in size
from 0.6 to 3 megabytes.  I thought the indexer would treat these files as very large text
files (no fields) and essentially index all of the "words" in the document.  

After the indexing operation, I used the SearchFiles demo to query the database and noted
what appears to be a problem with the way the indexing occurred.  In particular, I tried to
query on simple phrases (or unique words) that appeared near the end of some of these XML
files and got zero results.  I.E., it would appear that only terms which occurred at relatively
speaking the "beginning" of these files got indexed.  (Not really sure what relative beginning
means in terms of size).

Is this a limit based on the classes I am using - or some kind of product limit based on document
size?

Thanks to anyone who can help!

Joe
