Hope this isn't out of context - but Dan makes a very valid point.
Besides the potential performance slowdown if NLP was always applied to
a users query - there are times that an exact term match is desired
without the "query expansion" that an NLP process normally requires.

My only concern with this being integrated into lucene is that it be
done in
a way that doesn't make its use mandatory.  Lucene is powerful enough
that
it can be used for a lot of cases where NLP doesn't make any sense.  For
example, I think that sentence boundaries would severely screw up the
project I recently did using lucene because there are no sentences, but
there is punctuation.
