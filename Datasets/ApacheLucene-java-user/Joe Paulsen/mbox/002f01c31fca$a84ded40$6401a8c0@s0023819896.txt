Thanks - this really helps - sorry I hadn't read more documentation before
submitting the question.

Check out: <http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/index.html> -
class org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter - description of maxFieldLength:
"    The maximum number of terms that will be indexed for a single field in
a document.
This limits the amount of memory required for indexing, so that collections
with very
large files will not crash the indexing process by running out of memory.
By default, no more than 10,000 terms will be indexed for a field. "

You have to increase this limit for your IndexWriter object before adding
any
document in your program. That means you have to reindex your documents
after
changing you code.
Regards,
Wolf-Dietrich
