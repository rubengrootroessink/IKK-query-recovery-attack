Brian,

This seems akin to the Phrase Searching problem that I encountered (haven't
heard anything back from my posting yet) - which goes as follows:  I try to
do the phrase search "center* form" but the system seems to simply ignore
the wildcard (throws it away) when processing the search - so I get only
results for "center form".  My guess is the parser is processing your search
simply as if it were "hello w".

I've got no solution - was hoping to hear something from the list.

Joe
