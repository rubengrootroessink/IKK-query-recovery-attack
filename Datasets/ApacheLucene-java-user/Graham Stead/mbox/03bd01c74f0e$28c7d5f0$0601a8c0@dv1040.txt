SUBJECT: RE: Question about applications using different versions of Lucene
DATE: 13 Feb 2007

I believe the Lucene file format changed in version 2.1, and your nightly
.jar file is probably v2.1. See
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/fileformats.html#Segments%20File.

I'm afraid I'm not an expert on the related compatibility issues. It has
been my experience that pre-2.1 Lucene cannot read 2.1 indexes (error: can't
find segments file). You seem to have shown the converse is also
true...although I could have sworn that Lucene 2.1 slurped my pre-2.1 index
without problems.

Hope this helps,
-Graham
