Given that you want to score new documents higher (implicitly sorting them),
I wonder whether Solr's FunctionQuery (specifically ReciprocalFloatFunction
-
http://incubator.apache.org/solr/docs/api/org/apache/solr/search/function/Re
ciprocalFloatFunction.html) may also be helpful. It gives newer documents
higher scores than older documents. 

I believe ReciprocalFloatFunction uses the document order within the index
to help accomplish this (see ReverseOrdFieldSource), so your code would have
to index new documents after older ones. Usually this is not a problem.

In your case, I'm not sure when it's better to use Sort or
ReciprocalFloatFunction. Perhaps someone with more knowledge than I could
advise?
