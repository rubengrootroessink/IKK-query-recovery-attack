Jim,

IMHO, Solr is excellent and perhaps your best bet.

There's a new-ish Lucene WS project here: http://lucene-ws.net/. I have not
tried it, but it looks fine if you want to interface vanilla Lucene to, for
example, Opensearch.

There's an older Lucene WS project here: http://lucene-ws.sourceforge.net/.

Hope this helps,
-Graham
