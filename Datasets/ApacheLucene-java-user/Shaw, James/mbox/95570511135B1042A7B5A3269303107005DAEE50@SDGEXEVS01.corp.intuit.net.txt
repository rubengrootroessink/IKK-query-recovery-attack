Hi, guys,
I found Analyzers for Japanese, Korean and Chinese, but not stemmers;
the Snowball stemmers only include European languages.  Does stemming
not make sense for ideograph-based languages (i.e., no stemming is
needed for Japanese, Korean and Chinese)?

Also for spell checking, does the default Lucene SpellChecker work for
Japanese, Korean and Chinese?  Does edit distance make sense for these
languages?

What other gotcha's can you guys think of when making Lucene work with
foreign languages, besides analyzer, stemmer and spell checking?  Thanks
in advance for your help.
