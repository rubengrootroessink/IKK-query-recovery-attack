SUBJECT: Newbie question on what can be indexed
DATE: 12 Feb 2003

Hello all,

Any tips on how to index the following?

xml / xschema files in both the filesystem and inside jars in the 
filesystem?

I would only want to index based on certain markers like
	<description>....

and some way to get back the name of the file / the jar the file is in 
so it can be retrived and then xslt displayed

Thanks
