Hi,

I think you have to use IndexReader.isCurrent and then reopen the reader 
if there are changes.
You will need an automatism that periodically checks if any changes 
where made to the index. If that happens und need to reopen the your reader.

But a real lucene expert maybe can give you a better advice.

Thorsten
