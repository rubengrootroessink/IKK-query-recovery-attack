SUBJECT: R: PDF parser for Lucene
DATE: 23 Nov 2001

I also used this technique to index PDF files. Here's the class I used to
obtain a "text" input stream by a PDF file, using then it to build a Reader
for the indexing engine:


import java.io.*;
import java.util.Properties;

public class PDFToTextConverter extends FileToTextConverter
 {
  public PDFToTextConverter(String as_file_path,
  				    Properties ax_props)
   {
   	super(as_file_path,ax_props); //superclass just save args in
instance variables 
						//is_file_path and
ix_props...
   }
   
  public InputStream getInputStream()
   {
    String ls_command;
    Process lx_child = null;
    
    ls_command = ix_props.get("pdftotext-path") + " " + is_file_path + " -";
         
    try
     {
      lx_child = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(ls_command);
      
      return lx_child.getInputStream();
     }
    catch(Exception e)
     {
      return null;
     }
   }
 }


The application I used to convert pdf to text (called by
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...)) was xpdf 0.93, that you can find at
http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf in both unix and windows versions.

Oggetto: Re: PDF parser for Lucene


Inspired by the Unix "strings" command, I have written a subclass of
FilterReader; which I have called BinaryReader.  The idea is simply to index
any proprietary file format by filtering out all non-printable characters.
The assumption is that text is text.  It will end up with more than the
"visible" text, but not less.  After I have tested and made some examples I
will post it here.
