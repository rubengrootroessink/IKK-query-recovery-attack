SUBJECT: Is NEAR supported?
DATE: 14 Nov 2001

Hi, I'm using Lucene in an archived e-mail full-text search system and I'm
agreeing with it's flexibility and speed, but I've got a doubt about
querying capabilities. In one of Lucene's site linked external articles (
http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2000/jw-0915-lucene.html ), under
"Query features" paragraph, you can read that Lucene queries support the
NEAR operator, but I can't find it in Lucene's FAQs, in point 5 of searching
section. Which one is right? Javaworld or Lucene's FAQs?

Thanks.
Alessio
