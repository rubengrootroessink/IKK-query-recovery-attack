Hi Mike and Martin,

We have a similar use-case.   Is there a scalability/performance issue with the getDocIdSet
having to iterate through hundreds of thousands of docIDs?

It sounds like you should implement a custom Filter?

Its getDocIdSet would consult your foreign key-value store and iterate
through the allowed docIDs, per segment.
