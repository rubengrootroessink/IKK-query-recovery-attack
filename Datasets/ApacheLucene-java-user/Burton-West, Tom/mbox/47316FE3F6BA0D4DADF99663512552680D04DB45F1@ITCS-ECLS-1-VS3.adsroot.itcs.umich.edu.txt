Thanks Robert,

Looks like we indexed with icu4j-4_4_2.jar, which I assume is a 4.4 version using unicode
5.2

3.1 dev: icu4j-4_4_2.jar
3.3:     icu4j-4_8.jar

So do I just put the icu4j-4_4_2.jar in $SOLR_HOME/lib alongside the lucene-icu-3.1-SNAPSHOT.jar?

Is there any easy way to test?

Sounds like we will need to re-index the whole 9 million books with the Solr/Lucene 3.3 (4.8
jar) to be on the safe side.

It could be the case, but I am not sure what version of icu jar you
had before without looking thru svn logs.

if you are currently using 4.6, you are probably ok, as that was when
the unicode version was bumped to 6.0.
most of the rules etc are driven by the unicode version itself.

I would suggest just using your old icu jar and lucene-icu.jar until
you yourself want to upgrade... its not guaranteed to work but I
suspect it will :)
