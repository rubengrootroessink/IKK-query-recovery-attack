DATE: 5 Aug 2010

The work on MultiPassIndexSplitter is being done by Andrzej Bialecki, the creator of Luke.
See http://lucene-eurocon.org/sessions-track1-day1.html#3

http://lucene-eurocon.org/slides/Munching-&-crunching-Lucene-index-post-processing-and-applications_Andrzej-Bialecki.pdf

The slides say  "SinglePassSplitter work started, to be contributed soon."

You might try asking him directly or posting to the java-dev list.

Here's some code: http://pastie.org/1077591
We re-index everything offline from scratch. You'll need to modify the code to support reopening
and updating documents if that's a requirement...
