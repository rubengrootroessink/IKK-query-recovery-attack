SUBJECT: Indexing a single product in multiple categories.
DATE: 28 Sep 2006

We have an existing lucene based search, and a recent change to the way we 
organise our products has caused a bit of a problem for search results.

Our products are arranged into subcategories, categories & stores. A product 
can only be in 1 subcat or cat, but a cat can be in multiple stores. We only 
index the primary cat because historically the multiple store feature was 
depracated.

Obviously I don't want to simply add another row to the index for each store, 
as it would skew the results, especially when displaying a count of the 
results, I can't add a new column for each store, because I don't know how 
many stores it's going to be in.

Does anyone have any ideas?
