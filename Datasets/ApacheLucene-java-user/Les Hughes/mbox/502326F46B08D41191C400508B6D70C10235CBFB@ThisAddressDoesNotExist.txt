SUBJECT: Queryparser croaking on "[" and "]"
DATE: 20 Feb 2002

Hi,

I'm currently building a small app that allows searching of Java sourcecode.
The problem I'm getting is when parsing a query string that contains an
array specifier (ie. String[] or int[][]) the query parser seem to croak
with a

Lexical error at line XX, column XX. Encountered:   after : "[]"


So what am I doing wrong / what should I write to fix this?


Les
