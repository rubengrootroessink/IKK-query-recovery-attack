Let's suppose you modify your WhitespaceAnalyzer not to use a
WhitespaceTokenizer, but a modified version of the Tokenizer which
token-ize not by space but by something else, like '/'. (this is just an
example of course).
So suppose your real txt document contain :
/text2 text3/text4 text5/text6
When you add this document to the index using the tokenizer I explained,
terms returned by indexreader.terms should be:
text2 text3
text4 text5
text6
