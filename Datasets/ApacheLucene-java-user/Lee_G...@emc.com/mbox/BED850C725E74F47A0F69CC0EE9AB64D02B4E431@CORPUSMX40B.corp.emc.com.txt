SUBJECT: wildcards in phrase searches
DATE: 10 May 2006

Is it possible to have wildcards in a phrase search? For example, if my
object is indexed with a phrase "benchmark properties", is there a way to
specify a phrase search that uses wildcards, such as "benchmar* properties"
or "benchmark pro*"? I have tried using WildcardQuery, but it doesnt seem to
work with phrases, only single terms. Using the QueryParser doesnt seem to
work either, and ive tried it with the StandardAnalyzer and KeywordAnalyzer.
Perhaps there is something simple Im missing here. Has anyone gotten this to
work?
 
Thanks in advance,
-G
