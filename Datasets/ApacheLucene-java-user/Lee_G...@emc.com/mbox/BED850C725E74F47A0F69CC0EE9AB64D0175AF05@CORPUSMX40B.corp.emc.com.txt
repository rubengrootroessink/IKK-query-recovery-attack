SUBJECT: number of objects indexed
DATE: 3 Feb 2006

Hi all,
 
Im just wondering if anyone has done any scalability tests with Lucene. Has
anyone been able to index up to the 10 million mark in terms of number of
objects indexed in a single index? An estimate of how many objects you have
indexed is appreciated.
 
Thanks!!
Gary
