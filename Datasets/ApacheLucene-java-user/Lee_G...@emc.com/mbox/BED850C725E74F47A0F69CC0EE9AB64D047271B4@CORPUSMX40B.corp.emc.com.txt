SUBJECT: RE: wildcards in quoted phrases?
DATE: 25 Sep 2006

I encountered this issue before and was led to use SpanQueries for
wildcards within phrases. Take a look at the SpanQuery family of
classes. SpanQueries can give you the ability to specify a wildcarded
term within a phrase since you can nest different SpanQueries within a
SpanQuery. One of these is the SpanRegexQuery, which allows you to
specify a regular expression that would serve as your wildcard term
search within the phrase. 

I ended up using a SpanNearQuery to represent the overall phrase nested
with SpanRegexQueries for the wildcarded parts, and SpanTermQueries for
all other non-wildcarded terms. 

Hope this helps,
Gary

I think it shouldn't be difficult, but to expand the PrefixQuery, your
QueryParser would need an IndexReader. Currently IndexReader/QueryParser
don't depend on each other. Maybe this is the reason why it hasn't been
done or why it hasn't been published.
