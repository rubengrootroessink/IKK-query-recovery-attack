Thanks for your reply. Is there any sample code that would demonstrate how
to use these classes properly to get the desired effect of what im looking
for? 

Thanks

It's a fair bit trickier than using any of the stock core classes like that.
But it can be done, using SpanNearQuery nested with SpanRegexQuery's for the
wildcarded parts in the contrib code (note, this uses regex syntax, not
WildcardQuery syntax), along with SpanTermQuery's for the non-wildcarded
parts.
