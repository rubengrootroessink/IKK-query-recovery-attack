Tim,

Thanks for your reply.  Believe me, the sorting in 1.4
is greatly welcomed, but I don't think it fits my
particular needs.  My criteria for the sort can change
without notice on the fly, and I'd rather not have to
recreate the index to accomdate this.

Using 1.3 I played with including the sort criteria
(in integer form) in the index, and had every query
include a range in conjunction with a custom
similarity that essentially made the "sort" field the
heaviest criteria.  This worked, although I had
concerns about the speed (including a range in every
query that spanned all documents), and I still had the
issue of how to change scores easily.  I went as far
as to hack up a tool that could modify the index
itself and change the termfreq for my sorting field,
but this is not the road I want to go down! :)

So, assuming that sort as implemented in 1.4 doesn't
work for me, my original question still stands.  Do I
have to worry about merges that occur as documents are
added, or do I only have to rebuild my array after
optimizations?  Or, alternatively, how did everyone
sort before 1.4?
