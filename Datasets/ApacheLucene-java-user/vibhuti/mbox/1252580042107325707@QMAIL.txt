SUBJECT: Problem in lucene query
DATE: 10 Sep 2009

Hello 

 

I am new to Lucene and facing a problem while performing searches. I am
using lucene 2.2.0.

My application indexes documents on "keyword" field which contains integer
values. If the value is negative the query does not return correct results.

 

Following is my lucene query:

 

(keyword: \-1)

 

I also tried: 

(keyword: "-1")

 

 

But none of them returns correct results. It seems that Lucene ignores '-'.
My purpose is to search documents with index value "-1".

 

Any ideas??

 

Thanks
