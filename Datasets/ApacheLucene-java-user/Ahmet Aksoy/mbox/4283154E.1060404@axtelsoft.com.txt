SUBJECT: Re: Top most frequent words

Hi John,
I haven't investigated the sources yet, but you might be right.
However, as you stated, those type of lists directly depend on the 
subject, and the source.
Anyway, it is not very important for my study, and I'm sure it will help 
me very much.
I will prepare optimized lists if I can obtain some different sets.
Best regards.
Ahmet
