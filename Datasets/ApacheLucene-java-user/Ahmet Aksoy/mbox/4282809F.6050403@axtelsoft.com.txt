SUBJECT: I need 100 most frequently used words in different languages.
DATE: 11 May 2005

Hi,
I have a project which will be used in order to supply automatic 
dictionary helps in different languages.
I'm using Lucene for indexing, and searching the words in it.
It is an open source project in java at address 
http://belletmen.dev.java.net
Now, I will prepare a function to find the natural language used in the 
documentations.
For this purpose, I'll use the 100 most frequently used words in 
different languages.
Now I have only Turkish, English, German, and Finnish lists.
If you can help me, I'll be very glad.
Regards.
Ahmet Aksoy
