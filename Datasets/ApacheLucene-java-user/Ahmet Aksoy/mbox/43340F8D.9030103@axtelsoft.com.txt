SUBJECT: May I use a mixture of indexing methods altogether?
DATE: 23 Sep 2005

Hi,
I have a project seed in my mind.
I will try to collect everything which have a possibility to be 
remembered by me some day, and I will index them with Lucene.
Instead of using simple keywords, I will try to index whole documents 
wherever possible. So, I can start searching with a simple word, and 
then continue to ask for more detailed answers.
For example, frequently I forget the name of  my acquintances. But I 
don't forget their gender. Or, I can remember some other details of 
them. So, I should index every possible clues.
But, at the other end, I have some other documents -such as some 
passwords, etc- which must be encrypted. Then, I must use some keywords 
for them.
Is it possible to use a mixture of indexing methods for the same 
clusture of documents? Some of them will be very detailed, and some of 
them will contain only a simple keyword.
Is it possible?
Thanks.
Ahmet Aksoy
