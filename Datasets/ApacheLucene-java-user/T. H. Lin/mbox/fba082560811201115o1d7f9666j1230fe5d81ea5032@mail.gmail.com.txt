SUBJECT: Re: can I set Boost to the term while indexing?
DATE: 20 Nov 2008

hi,

thanks for your suggestions.

actually, my original idea is that the same term may have different "weight"
in different doc.
of course the TF/IDF has already embedded some kind of term relavance to a
doc.
But I would like to explicitly set different "weight" to the same term in
diferent docs.

For instance,

the query is "T1 T2"

Both Doc1 and Doc2 have T1 and T2. They may also have exactly the same term
frequency!
But I want to bring some "semantic enhancement".
I want to let T1 has higher weight in Doc1 than in Doc2, and let T2 has
higher weight in Doc2 than Doc1.

I think, setBoost on a whole doc, on a field or on the term in query may not
achieve this.

Maybe "payload" is a solution, I will take a look!
