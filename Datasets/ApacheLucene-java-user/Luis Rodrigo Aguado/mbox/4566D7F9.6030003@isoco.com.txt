SUBJECT: Hit.getDocument performance
DATE: 24 Nov 2006

    Hi all,

    I am having a performance bottleneck that is driving me crazy. Maybe 
anyone there has a clue of the source...

    I am working with an index of 2400 pdf files. For each of them, I 
index the contents, and I store the filename and the creation date. 
Nothing else. The resulting index is about 6Mb.

    The application generates several queries for each user input, and, 
depending on the queries I launch, it may take up to 10 minutes to get 
the results!!!  It depends on the number of hits, being around 1500 docs 
the highest number of hits I have tested. After a profiling session I 
have located the Hits.getDocument as the primary source of time (and 
memory) waste.

    Is this reasonable?  Maybe I did something wrong to create the 
index?  Are there any workarounds that you imagine?

    Thanks in advance!!!

    Luis.
