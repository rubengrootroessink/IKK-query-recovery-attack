SUBJECT: Re: Hit.getDocument performance
DATE: 24 Nov 2006

I have just read in the API doc that going through the Hits returned is 
not really adviceable. However, I am not developing the final 
application, but a middleware that accesses Lucene, so I would not want 
to take the decision to cut the number of docs returned, but let the 
application do that. Is there any way to bypass this limitation?

Thanks!
