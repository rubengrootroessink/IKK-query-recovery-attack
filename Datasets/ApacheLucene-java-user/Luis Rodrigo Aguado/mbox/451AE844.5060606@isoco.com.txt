SUBJECT: Writing - Searching synchronization
DATE: 27 Sep 2006

Hi all,

I have a problem with a lucene-based application I am trying to build. 
The application is mainly search oriented, and the core of the index is 
built in a batch process before starting the system. In the application 
initialization an IndexSearcher object is built, to perform all the 
searches.

However, in some special conditions, an addition to the index may be 
necessary. In these situations, I build an IndexWriter, add the new 
document and finish with a writer.optimize() and a writer.close().

After an addition, the index returns perfectly the ideas before the 
addition, but not the ones that where added when the application was 
running.

Should I renew the IndexSearcher after the additions to be able to 
return the new Documents?

Thanks in advance!
