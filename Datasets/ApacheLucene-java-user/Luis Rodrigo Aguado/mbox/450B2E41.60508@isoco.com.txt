    Hi all,

    I have used Lucene so far for solving toy exaples and making 
tutorial examples, but now I am facing my first real-world high-quality 
application.

    I need to manage around 50.000 docs, ranging from a few lines to a 
couple pages. I also need to handle lemmas and synonyms, and here is 
where my main doubts arise. I have considered two options: adding the 
synonyms and lemmas to the indexes and keeping the queries simple, or 
expanding the queries with these lemmas and synonyms and keeping the 
indexes simple. Is one of the two preferrable over the other? What are 
the benefits of each of them?

    Thanks in advance!
