SUBJECT: Combining scores
DATE: 21 Nov 2006

Hi all,

I am working in a project that, for each query from the user, builds 
four or five different queries and tries to combine the results. The 
first part is already working, but, as I have read that the scores from 
different queries are not comparable at all among them, I am a bit stuck 
in the second part. Which could be a good strategy to get a unified 
score merging the results from different queries over the same index. Is 
there anything already done on that?

I have searched through the list, but all I have found is threads like this:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.jakarta.lucene.user/10810

that only warn about the incompatibility of scores, but not any clue 
about how to solve it.

Thanks!

Luis.
