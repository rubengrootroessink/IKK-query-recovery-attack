Hi,

Some time ago, I had to modify and extend the Lucene StandardTokenizer grammar (flex file)
so that it preserves URIs (based on RFC3986). I have extracted the files from my project and
published the source code on github [1] under the Apache License 2.0, if it can help.

Thanks.

I was hoping Lucene would already have a solution for
this since it seems like it would be a common problem.

I am new to the lucene API. If I were to implement something from
scratch, are my options to extend the Tokenizer to support http regex
and then pass the text to StandardTokenizer...
