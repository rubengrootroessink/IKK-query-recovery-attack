SUBJECT: How to calculate the DGaps value in *.del file?
DATE: 9 Sep 2009

Hello,

I want to know how to calculate the DGaps value  in *.del file?

For example, if there are 8000 bits and only bits 10,12,32 are set,  
DGaps would be used:

                            (VInt) 1 , (byte) 20 , (VInt) 3 , (Byte) 1

I do not understand why the DGraps is 1 and 3.

Please tell me the conversion method.

Thanks very much.

Kan
