Steve,

Thanks for the helpful information, the addition of the new document  
methods makes things much better.

One more question, is there JSON support in Lucene? JSON is more fat- 
free compared to XML and would be preferred. Digester works well for  
indexing XML but something along the same lines for JSON would be  
even sweeter.

Cheers,

Thom
