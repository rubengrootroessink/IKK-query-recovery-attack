SUBJECT: Relative term frequency?
DATE: 6 Jun 2005

Is there a way to calculate term frequency scores that are relative to
the number of terms in the field of the document?  We want to override
tf() in this way to curb keyword spamming in web pages.  In
Similarity, only the document's term frequency is passed into the tf()
method:

float tf(int freq)

It would be nice to have something like:

float tf(int freq, String fieldName, int numTerms)

If this isn't available out of the box, how difficult would it be to
hack up Lucene to allow for this?

Thanks,
Andy
