Sounds like you might have an I/O issue.  If you have multiple partitions /
disks on the searching server you can search from one partition and copy to
another and alternate.  If you're using RAID different RAID levels are
optimized for simultaneous reads and writes.

If you have a 3rd machine you can load balance 2 search servers and take one
out of the cluster when the index is being copied.  Alternatively, if it's
possible, you can copy the index at an offpeak hour.
