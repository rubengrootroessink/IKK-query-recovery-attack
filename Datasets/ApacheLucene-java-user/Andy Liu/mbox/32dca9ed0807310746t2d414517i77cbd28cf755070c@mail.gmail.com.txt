SUBJECT: Re: Using lucene as a database... good idea or bad idea?
DATE: 31 Jul 2008

If essentially all you need is key-value storage, Berkeley DB for Java works
well.  Lookup by ID is fast, can iterate through documents, supports
secondary keys, updates, etc.

Lucene would work relatively well for this, although inserting documents
might not be as fast, because segments need to be merged and data ends up
getting copied over again at certain points.  So if you're running a batch
process with a lot of inserts, you might get better throughput with BDB as
opposed to Lucene, but, of course, benchmark to confirm ;)
