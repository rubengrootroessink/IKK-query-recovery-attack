I try 2 way for get count results:

1)
Query q = ....
IndexSearcher is = ....
int count = Is.search(q).length();

2)
Query q = ....
IndexSearcher is = ....
CountCollector collector = new CountCollector();
Is.search(q, collector);
Int count = collector.getCount();

First way return results for 1.644 sec.
Second way return results fot 3.088 sec.
Why first way faster then second?
Can I accelerate it? And how? Can you offer any ways for get number of
results?
