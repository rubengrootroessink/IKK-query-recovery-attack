ulimit -n [max number].

Subject: OutOfMemory during optimize

I am periodically getting "Too many open files" error when searching.
Currently there are over 500 files in my Lucene directory. I am attempting
to run optimize( ) to reduce the number of files. However, optimize never
finishes because whenever I run it, it quits with a Java exception
OutOfMemory error. I have tried using the -Xmx and -Xms switches to increase
heap size, but that has not helped.
 
Any suggestions?
