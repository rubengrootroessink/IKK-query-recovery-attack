2) assuming what you want is not all brands and all prices, but just the
prices and brands of the documents in you results, then i would strongly
recommend doing your search twice -- once do get the Hits object you need
and once using a HitCollector.  Within the HitCollector, use FieldCaches
to lookup the values of the fields you want.  this requires that those
fields are indexed and not tokenized, but it should be *much* faster then
your current approach.

Where can I see the example using HitCollector ?
