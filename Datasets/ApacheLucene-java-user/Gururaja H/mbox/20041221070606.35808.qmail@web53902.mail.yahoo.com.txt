Thanks much for the reply.

you would need to recompute
it. You could either call explain() and parse the result string, or
better, look at explain() and implement what it does more efficiently
just for coord(). If your queries are all BooleanQuery's of
TermQuery's, then this is very simple. Iterate down the list of
BooleanClause's and count the number whose score is > 0, then divide
this by the total number of clauses. Take a look at
BooleanQuery.BooleanWeight.explain() as it does this (along with
generating the rest of the explanation). If you support the full Lucene
query language, then you need to look at all the query types and decide
what exactly you want to compute (as coord is not always well-defined).

I'm on the West Coast of the U.S. so evidently on a very different time
zone from you -- will look at your other message next.
