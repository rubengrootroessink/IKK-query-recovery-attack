Hi,
 
How to implement the following ?  Please provide inputs ....
 

For example, if the search query has 5 terms (ibm, risc, tape, drive, manual) and there are
4 matching documents with the following attributes, then the order should be as described
below.

Doc#1: contains terms (ibm, drive) and has a total of 100 terms in the document.

Doc#2: contains terms (ibm, risc, tape, drive) and has a total of 30 terms in the document.

Doc#3: contains terms (ibm, risc, tape, drive) and has a total of 100 terms in the document.

Doc#4: contains terms (ibm, risc, tape, drive, manual) and has a total of 300 terms in the
document

The search results should include all three documents since each has one or more of the search
terms, however, the order should be returned as:

Doc#4 

Doc#2

Doc#3

Doc#1

Doc#4 should be first, since of the 5 search terms, it contains all 5.

Doc#2 should be second, since it has 4 of the 5 search terms and of the number of terms in
the document, its ratio is higher than Doc#3 (4/30). Doc#3 has 4 of the 5 terms, but its ratio
is 4/100.

Doc#1 is last since it only has 2 of the 5 terms.

 
                                                                  ----
 
Thanks,
Gururaja
