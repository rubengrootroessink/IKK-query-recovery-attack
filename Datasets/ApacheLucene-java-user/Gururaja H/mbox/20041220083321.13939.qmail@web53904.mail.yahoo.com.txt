How to find out the percentages of matched terms in the document(s) using Lucene ?
Here is an example, of what i am trying to do:
The search query has 5 terms(ibm, risc, tape, dirve, manual) and there are 4 matching 
documents with the following attributes:
Doc#1: contains terms(ibm,drive)
Doc#2: contains terms(ibm,risc, tape, drive)
Doc#3: contains terms(ibm,risc, tape,drive)
Doc#4: contains terms(ibm, risc, tape, drive, manual).
The percentages displayed would be 100%(Doc#4), 80%(doc#2), 80%(doc#3) and 40%
(doc#1).
 
Any help on how to go about doing this ?
 
Thanks,
Gururaja
