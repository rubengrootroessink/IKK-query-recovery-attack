SUBJECT: Lucene index files from two different applications.
DATE: 21 Dec 2004

Hi !
 
Have two applications.  Both are supposed
to write Lucene index files and the WebApplication is supposed to read
these index files.
 
Here are the questions:
1.  Can two applications write index files, in the same directory, at the same time ?
2.  If two applications cannot write index files, in the same directory, at the same time.
 
     How should we resolve this ?  Would appriciate any solutions to this...
3.  My thought is to write the index files in two different directories and read both the
indexes
(as though it forms a single index, search results should consider the documents in both the
indexes) from the WebApplication.  How to go about implementing this, using Lucene API ? 
Need inputs on which of the Lucene API's to use ?
 
                                              ----
 
Thanks,
Gururaja
