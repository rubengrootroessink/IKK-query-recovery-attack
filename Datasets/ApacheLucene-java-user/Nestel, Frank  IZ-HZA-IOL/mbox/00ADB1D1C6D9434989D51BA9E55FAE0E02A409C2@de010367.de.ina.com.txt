SUBJECT: RE: IndexSearcher hanging on to old index files in Windows
DATE: 28 Apr 2005

Maybe it is .NET specific?! We use a very similar
Szenario with Java under Windows and the Server is
now running for 40 day since we launched it productively.
No problem at all! We have two index directories between
which we switch back and forth though?
