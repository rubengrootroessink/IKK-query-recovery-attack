SUBJECT: RE: Strategies for updating indexes.
DATE: 5 Apr 2005

Hi,

we are using a very cautious method for batch upating. 

We have long (hours) running updates on our index, but 
complete reindexing would even be longer (days). But I
guess our strategy could be scaled down to hours or even
less.

So what we do is, we keep two instances
of the index. There is a file which contains a link to the
currently used index for reading. The search application
accesses the index through a thin transparent API which
whatches this file and can switch from one search request
to the next, but does keep the IndexReader open as long
as no switching is need.

When we reindex, we duplicate the "read" instance of the 
index and then do an selective update on this copied duplicate. 
Note we need some HD space and time for this. After indexing
there is some checking and comparison between old and new
instance of the index. Only if this looks successful we 
toggle the above "pointer" file and the transparent API switches
to the new index. In case human recognition still finds the
checked index bad, we can still switch back to the second
last presumably "good" index. 

Cheers,
Frank
