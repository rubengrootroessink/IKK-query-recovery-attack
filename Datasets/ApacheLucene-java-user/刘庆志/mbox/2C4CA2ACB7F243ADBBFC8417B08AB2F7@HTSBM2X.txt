Erick:
    Thanks for your information.    
    I search for the similar question and get a very like issue:Best Practice: emails and
file-attachments on 15 August 2006,in mailing list archives(http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200608.mbox/browser),but
there is no final answer in that thread.

This problem has been discussed several times, although I can't
remember the answer. So I'd recommend searching the mail archive

Lucid maintains a searchable archive, see:
