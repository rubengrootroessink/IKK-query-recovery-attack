Did you check that the request string you get at the analyzer
level is corectly encoded as UTF-8?
We had the same problem with french accentuated char encoded
also as UTF-8, and transmited by tomcat as ISO-8859-1. It was
just for a test, also we didn't investgated a lot, but
re-encode in URL/ISO-8859-1 and re-decode from URL in correct
UTF-8, and it worked.
Don't know, if it may help you ...
