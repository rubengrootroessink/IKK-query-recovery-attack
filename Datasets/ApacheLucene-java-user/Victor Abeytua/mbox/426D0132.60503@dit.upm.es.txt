SUBJECT: Multiple field search problem
DATE: 25 Apr 2005

Hello everyone,
    In the project I'm currently involved we are using lucene (+ 
Digester) to index a small number of XML files. To be able to perform 
the searches I want, I should need to query the index with something 
similar to (where fieldN are XML tags):
(field1:"Policy and planning" OR  field1:Newspapers) AND field2:Spanish

    I haven't been able to find any class that suits my needs and if I 
try to use QueryParse.parse() to be able to write the query in "human" 
form, the analyzer takes the "and" away and changes the string to lower 
case. This is something I can't afford as I need to be able to search by 
the exact keywords.
    Any ideas are welcome. Perhaps the answer is right in front of me 
but I haven't been able to figure it out.

    Thanks in advance,
    Victor Abeytua
