SUBJECT: Storing a field as byte[[]
DATE: 13 May 2010

Hi,
I am new to lucene. the constructors in Feild show that I can give the value
as byte[] I wanted to ask if I store a integer as a byte array the how it
will ve searched during search say file size!!!

because if I use text format the range search will be poor say fs of 10 12
20 30 50 100 101 102 will be organised as
10
100
101
102
12
20
30
50

so range search of size between 10 and 20 will be relatively poor if I store
values like the order given

Thanks and regards
Saurabh Agarwal
