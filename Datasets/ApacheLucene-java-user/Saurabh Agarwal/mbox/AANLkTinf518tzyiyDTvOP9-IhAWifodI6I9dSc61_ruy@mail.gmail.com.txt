Hi,
when I am running Lucene on a 512 MB system.
I am getting the following error
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
        at
org.apache.lucene.index.DocumentsWriter$ByteBlockAllocator.getByteBlock(DocumentsWriter.java:1206)
and sometimes
 An unexpected error has been detected by Java Runtime Environment:
# Problematic frame:
# J  java.nio.ByteBuffer.arrayOffset()I


if I decrease my corpus size it indexes it perfectly!!!

Can someone tell me how to index a larger corpus even if it takes more
time!!!

Thanks

Saurabh Agarwal
