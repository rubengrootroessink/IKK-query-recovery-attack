Hi friends

I have just started using lucene and the way i want to use it is the
following:

i have documents consisting of names of users as one field.
i have a sentence that may contain the name of some user.
i perform a search for the sentence in the index using the searcher.
if it contains the name of the user, then that user's document is listed on
top by lucene.

now i want to determine the position in the sentence where the string has
been found.

i am using fuzzy query matching by adding the character '~' to the sentence
i am searching.
so this means i cannot use the find function of the String class as is to
get the position of the match.

Thanks in advance
