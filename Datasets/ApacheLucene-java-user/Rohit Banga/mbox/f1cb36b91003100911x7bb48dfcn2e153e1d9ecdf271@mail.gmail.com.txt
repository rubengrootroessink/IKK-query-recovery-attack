SUBJECT: examples of using explain method
DATE: 10 Mar 2010

Could you help me understand how to use the explain method:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_1/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/Searcher.html#explain%28org.apache.lucene.search.Query,%20int%29

I was wondering if I could use it to find out which terms in my query
matched against a particular document.
I am using fuzzy matching with the QueryParser.

Thanks

Rohit Banga
