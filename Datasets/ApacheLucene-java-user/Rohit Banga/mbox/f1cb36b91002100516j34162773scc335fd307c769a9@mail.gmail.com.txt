SUBJECT: read more tokens during analysis
DATE: 10 Feb 2010

i want to consider the current word & the next as a single term.

when analyzing "Arun Kumar"

i want my analyzer to consider "Arun",  "Arun Kumar" as synonyms.

in the tokenstream method, how do we read the next token "Kumar"
i am going through the setPositionIncrements method for considering them as
synonyms, but i don't understand how to implement look ahead in the
analyzer.
