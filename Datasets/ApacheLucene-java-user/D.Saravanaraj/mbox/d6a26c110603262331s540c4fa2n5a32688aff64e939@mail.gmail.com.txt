SUBJECT: Wildcard query
DATE: 27 Mar 2006

Hi,

I am performing wildcard query on the contents of the indexed documents.
Using the extractTerms() method, i am extracting the terms which match the
wildcard query. Since my index is of a large size, is it possible to get the
top N terms which match the wildcard query. What is the ranking behind while
performing wildcard queries and then using extractTerms() method.

Thanks
D.Saravanaraj
