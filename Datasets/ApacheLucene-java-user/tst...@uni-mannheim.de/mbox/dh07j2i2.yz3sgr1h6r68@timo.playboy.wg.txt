SUBJECT: Too many files open
DATE: 16 Jun 2003

I try to include Lucene1.3-rc1 in a Java mail client.
The idea is to have an index for every folder that contains
mails. This might not be the best design though, because
i have to add and remove documents when moving mails...

My problem is that I sometimes get Exceptions like too many files
open or Out of memory after some mailmovement.

Any help or ideas how to better integrate Lucene in such an
enviroment?

Cheers
Timo
