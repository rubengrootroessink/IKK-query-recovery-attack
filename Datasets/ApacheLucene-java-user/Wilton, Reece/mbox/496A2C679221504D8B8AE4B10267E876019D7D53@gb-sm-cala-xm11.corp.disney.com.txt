Hi,

Does Lucene support exact matching on a tokenized field?

So for example... if I add these three phrases to the index:
- "The quick brown fox"
- "The quick brown fox jumped"
- "brown fox"

I want to be able to do an exact field match so when I search for "brown
fox" I only get the last one returned.  I can do this in my own code by
storing the data and then comparing it to the search phrase.  Is that
the best way of doing this?

Thanks,
Reece
