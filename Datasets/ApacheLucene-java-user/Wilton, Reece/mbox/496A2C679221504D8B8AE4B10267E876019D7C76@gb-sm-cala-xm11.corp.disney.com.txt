This occurs for me on Windows XP when the mergefactor is low or when
there is more than one reader or writer open.  Try increasing the
mergefactor.  Also, don't open and close the writer after each document.
Open the writer once, index all your docs and then close the writer.
You'll have much better success!

Subject: cant rename segments.new to segment


all,
when i'm trying to run my index writer program at idea (IDE) i got this
error (cant rename segments.new to segments, sometimes the deletable
file got an error), but when im going to run the program in the command
prompt, it looks fine, no error returned.
 
im just making 1 index and no threads
