Subject: too many files within one index


Hi,
I am using Lucene 1.3 rc released on March.20, 2003.
For some reason, the files in the index directory increase very very
quickly for some documents and reach over 3000 files within half hour
and even can not optimize the index.Then it grows up to 33000 files
within one index. In most of other testing cases, it normally never
reach 1000 even without optimization.

Any idea about this?

regards,
Hui
