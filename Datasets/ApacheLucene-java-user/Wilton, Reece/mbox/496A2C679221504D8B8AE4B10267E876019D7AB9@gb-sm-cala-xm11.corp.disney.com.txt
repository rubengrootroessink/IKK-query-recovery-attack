Thanks for the reply.  

Just to clarify:
You are saying that I can optimize and add a document at the same time
as long as both threads use the same IndexWriter.  Is that correct?

No.  It is not safe, and the code makes every attempt to prohibit it.

No, but you can have two threads adding documents to a single 
IndexWriter concurrently.

No, but, so long as you use a single IndexWriter object, synchronization

should handle things correctly so that one thread can add documents 
while another optimizes.
