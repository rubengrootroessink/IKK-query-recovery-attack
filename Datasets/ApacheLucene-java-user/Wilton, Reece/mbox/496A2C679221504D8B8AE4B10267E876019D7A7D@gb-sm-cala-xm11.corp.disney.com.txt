Thanks Ype.  What do you mean by multiple documents?  Do you mean
multiple indexes?

Or do you mean, delete several documents from the index and then add the
new copies of them.  And then get the next batch of new documents.

AFAIK, yes.
You can speed this up by using multiple documents, ie. use
a document set.
Also, you don't need to close the index writer before optimizing.

One variation: you might leave the IndexReader open in case you need it
for searching, but I wouldn't recommend that under Windows because there
an open file cannot be deleted from a directory. Lucene deletes such
files during later optimizations.

Kind regards,
Ype
