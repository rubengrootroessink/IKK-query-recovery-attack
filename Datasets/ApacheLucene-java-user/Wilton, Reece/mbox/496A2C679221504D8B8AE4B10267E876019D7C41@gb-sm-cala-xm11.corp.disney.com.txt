The lower the number, the more often a new file is created.  Since
creating/opening files with Lucene seems to cause issues on Windows, I
increased this to 100.  This solved my file locking problems and still
gave me good performance (I am able to perform over 200 queries/second
from a servlet being hit from a remote machine).

Hi Reece,
Thank you for the clue.
Based on the document from Otis, if I understand welll, it seems a lower
mergeFactor should be used.

Set the mergefactor to a higher number.

Hi,
I am using Lucene 1.3 rc released on March.20, 2003.
For some reason, the files in the index directory increase very very
quickly for some documents and reach over 3000 files within half hour
and even can not optimize the index.Then it grows up to 33000 files
within one index. In most of other testing cases, it normally never
reach 1000 even without optimization.

Any idea about this?

regards,
Hui
