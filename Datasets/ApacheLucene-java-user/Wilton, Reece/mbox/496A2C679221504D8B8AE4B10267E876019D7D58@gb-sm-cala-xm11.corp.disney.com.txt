To ensure I understand...

If you have:

1)  A B C
2)  B C
3)  B C D
4)  C

You want "B C" to match #2 only
But, "C" to match #1, #2, #3, and #4

If so, you can have a tokenized field and an untokenized one...

Use the untokenized for matching 'exact' strings
Use the tokenized for finding a single word in the string

I.e.  check "B C" against untokenized
      check "C" against tokenized

That is, if you don't mind indexing the same data into 2 different
fields.

If I use an untokenized field, would "fox" match this as well?  I need
to support both exact match searches and searches where one word exists
in the field.

Why not just use an untokenized field?  Then just use a TermQuery, 
searching for the term "brown fox".
