SUBJECT: Reopen IndexWriter after delete?
DATE: 11 Nov 2003

Hi,

A couple questions...

1).  If I delete a term using an IndexReader, can I use an existing
IndexWriter to write to the index?  Or do I need to close and reopen the
IndexWriter?

2).  Is it safe to call IndexReader.delete(term) while an IndexWriter is
writing?  Or should I be synchronizing these two tasks so only one
occurs at a time?

Any help is appreciated!
