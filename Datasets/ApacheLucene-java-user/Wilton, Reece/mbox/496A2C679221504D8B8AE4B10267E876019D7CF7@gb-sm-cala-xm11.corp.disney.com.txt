SUBJECT: Too Many Open Files
DATE: 7 Oct 2003

Hi,

The index directory that Lucene created has 2,322 files in it.  When I
try to open it I get the dreaded "Too Many Open Files" problem:
    java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\Index\_1lvq.f107 (Too many open
files)

The index has about 50,000 docs in it.  It was created with a merge
factor of 5,000.  Is there a way that I can reduce the number of files
or increase the number of files that windows can open?

Any help is appreciated!
Reece
