Are people having this same issue on Linux or is this just a Windows
issue?

Subject: cant rename segments.new to segment


all,
when i'm trying to run my index writer program at idea (IDE) i got this
error (cant rename segments.new to segments, sometimes the deletable
file got an error), but when im going to run the program in the command
prompt, it looks fine, no error returned.
 
im just making 1 index and no threads
is this a bug?
