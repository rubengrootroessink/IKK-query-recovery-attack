SUBJECT: Exceptions while Updating an Index
DATE: 28 Aug 2003

Hi,

I am getting exceptions because Lucene can't rename files.  Here are a
couple of the exceptions that I'm getting:
 - java.io.IOException: couldn't rename _6lr.tmp to _6lr.del
 - java.io.IOException: couldn't rename segments.new to segments

I am able to index many documents successfully on my Windows machine.
The problem occurs for me during the updating process.  My updating
process goes like this:

  for (each xml file i want to index) {
    // create new document
    parse the xml file
    populate a new Lucene document with the fields from my XML file

    // remove old document from index
    open an index reader
    delete the term from the index   // this successfully deletes the
one document
    close the index reader

    // add new document to index
    open an index writer
    add the document to the index writer
    close the index writer
  }
   
Any ideas on how to stop these exceptions from occuring?  No other
process is reading or writing to the index while this process is
running.

Thanks,
Reece
