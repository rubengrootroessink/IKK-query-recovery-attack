SUBJECT: Combining Lucene and database functionality
DATE: 21 Sep 2004

I'm trying to find out whether Lucene is an option for a project of 
mine. I have texts which also have a date and a list of numbers 
associated with each of them. These numbers are ID values which connect 
the article to certain categories. So a particular article X might 
belong to categories 17, 49 and 112. A search for all articles 
containing "foo bar" and belonging to categories 100 to 140 should 
return X (because it also contains "foo bar"). Is it possible to do this 
with Lucene and if it is, how? I've read about the concept of fields in 
Lucene, but it seems to me that you can only store text in them, not 
integers, let alone list of integers. None of the tutorials I've seen 
deals with more complex queries like that. Basically what I want to 
accomplish could be done nicely with databases with full text search 
capability, if that full text search wasn't so awful.

Regards,
Marco
