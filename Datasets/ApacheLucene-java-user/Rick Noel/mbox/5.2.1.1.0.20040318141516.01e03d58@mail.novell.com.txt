SUBJECT: Getting offset information of hits
DATE: 18 Mar 2004

I'm new to Lucene and am trying to implement excerpts and highlighting.  I am
trying to figure out how I can get offset information from the Hits
class.  TermPositions doesn't appear to get me the offset information that
the Token class provides.  Is there a way of getting this information at 
search time?
