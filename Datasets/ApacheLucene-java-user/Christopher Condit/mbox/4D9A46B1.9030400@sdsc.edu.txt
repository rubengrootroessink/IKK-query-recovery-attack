SUBJECT: Field Aware TokenFilter
DATE: 4 Apr 2011

I need to add synonyms to an index depending on the field being indexed.
I know that TokenFilter is not "field aware", but is there a good way to
get at the field or do I need to add something to allow my Analyzer to
tell the TokenFilter which field is currently being examined?

Thanks,
-Chris
