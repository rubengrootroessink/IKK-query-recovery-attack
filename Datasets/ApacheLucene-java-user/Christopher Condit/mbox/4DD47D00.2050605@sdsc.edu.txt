SUBJECT: Ranking docs with all terms higher
DATE: 19 May 2011

Let's say I have the query
(nacho OR foo OR bar)

and some documents (single field with norms off)
doc a: nacho nacho nacho nacho
doc b: foo bar bar
doc c: nacho foo bar

I'm interested in all of these documents but I would like c to score the
highest since it contains all of the search terms, b to score second
because it has two, and a to score the third because it has one. What's
the best way to get Lucene to do this?

Thanks,
-Chris
