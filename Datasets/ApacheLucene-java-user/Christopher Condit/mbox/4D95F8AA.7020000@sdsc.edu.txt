Using the 3.1 jars from Maven central the following test case shows
different behavior:
http://www.pastie.org/1744131

The output is:
getFieldQuerySlop: foo bar
a:"foo bar" b:"foo bar"
getFieldQueryQuoted: nacho
getFieldQuerySlop: foo bar
getFieldQuerySlop: chip
getFieldQueryQuoted: baz
+(a:nacho b:nacho) +(a:"foo bar" b:"foo bar") +(a:chip b:chip) +(a:baz
b:baz)

So it would seem that all of the quoted phrases are going through the
slop method (with slop of 0). Would it be safe to alter the field in
that method instead?

Thanks,
