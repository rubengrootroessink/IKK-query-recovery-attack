but I can’t search with a wildcard: searching with ‘M*’ returns nothing; ‘M’ returns
“M” alone. I’ve also tried using ANALYSED and NOT_ANALYSED indexing to no avail.

I'm not sure why the WhitespaceAnalyzer isn't working for you (perhaps
someone else knows), but here's one that does:

I just wrapped a WhitespaceTokenizer in a LowerCaseFilter and it has the
desired effect.

Good luck,
