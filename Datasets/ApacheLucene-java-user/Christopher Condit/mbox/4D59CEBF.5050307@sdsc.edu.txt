SUBJECT: Phrase query with boolean matches
DATE: 15 Feb 2011

I'm trying to use the QueryParser in 3.0.2 to make "foo and bar" (with
the quotes) return documents with the exact phrase "foo and bar". When I
run it through the QueryParser (with a StandardAnalyzer) I end up with
"foo ? bar", which doesn't match the documents in the index. I know that
"and" is a stop word, but I'm curious why it's translated into ? instead
of a * during this parsing (or just left along because it's a phrase
query)...
Can I escape boolean keywords somehow?

Here's a runnable example: http://www.pastie.org/1564773

Thanks,
-Chris
