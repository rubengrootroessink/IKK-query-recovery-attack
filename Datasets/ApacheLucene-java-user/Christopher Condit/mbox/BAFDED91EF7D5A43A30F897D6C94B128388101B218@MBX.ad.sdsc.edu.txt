I'm trying to implement an analyzer that will compute a score based on vocabulary terms in
the indexed content (ie a document field with more terms in the vocabulary will score higher).
Although I can see the tokens I can't seem to access the document from the analyzer to set
a new field on it after I compute the value. Is there a way to do this from an Analyzer? Or
is there another preferred way to do this?
Thanks,
-Chris
