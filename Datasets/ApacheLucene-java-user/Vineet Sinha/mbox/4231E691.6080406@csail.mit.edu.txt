SUBJECT: Survey on Understanding Code
DATE: 11 Mar 2005

Hi,
We are running a set of small surveys, in an attempt to understand 
developers problems when attempting to understand code. Results from 
this survey will be used in refining (open-source) tools that we are 
building.

If you have looked at the code of any of the (Java) projects below, we 
would appreciate you taking a few minutes to fill out as many of the 
respective surveys: Ant, Struts, Geronimo, Cocoon, Xerces, Xalan, 
Tomcat, Derby, Lucene, and Batik.

The survey can be found at:

Please contact me if you have any questions, concerns, or comments!


Thanks!!

Regards,

Vineet Sinha
