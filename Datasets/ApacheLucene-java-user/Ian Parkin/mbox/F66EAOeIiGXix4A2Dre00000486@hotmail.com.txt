This appears to be a Solaris thing. I develop under Solaris 9 and then burn 
my application onto a multi-platform CD (Unix/Win/Mac). It is only when I 
run the application under Solaris that the umlauts appear as the '?' 
character. On all other platforms the characters are correctly displayed. 
All platforms are running Java 1.3.1.

Two questions :-

1) Has anyone any experience with such behaviour ? (Apologies for the 
non-lucene content)

2) How to search on text containing umlauts ? At the moment a search on   
"jrgen" returns no hits, but a search on "rgen" will return posts by user 
Jrgen.

Thanks

IAP
