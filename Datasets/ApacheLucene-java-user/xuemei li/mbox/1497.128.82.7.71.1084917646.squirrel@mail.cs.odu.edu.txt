SUBJECT: about search and update one index simultaneously
DATE: 18 May 2004

Hi,all,

Can we do search and update one index simultaneously?Is someone know sth
about it? I had done some experiments.Now the search will be blocked
when the index is being updated.The error in search node is like this:
    caught a class java.io.IOException
    with message:Stale NFS file handle

Thanks

Xuemei Li
