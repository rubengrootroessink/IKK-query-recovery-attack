The analyzer should not do any case-recognition. After I read through 
the mailing list from the last weeks/months (I was busy last weeks), I 
found out that a super simple unique-discrimination algorithm is what 
the most users need. The original algorithm has more possible ways to 
extend it.

I promise I will check the stemmer next days... hm... not before this 
weekend, i have a martial arts challenge at sunday. Mental i'm not 
prepared to _fix_ anything. :)

There is another problem with the Umlaut-conversion that also should be 
checked.
