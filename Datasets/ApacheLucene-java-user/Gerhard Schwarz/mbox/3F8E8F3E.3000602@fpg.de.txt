Lowercasefilter before Stopfilter would be fine. The only reason not to 
do so was a semantic issue. But that issue is not important for the use 
with Lucene. The stemmer was written for an application I use, for the 
use with lucene (for normal fulltext inquiry at all) I can be simpler.

After months of work I now have spare time.
The patch I promised months ago comes by next week. (No promise this 
time, or tomorrow something bad will happen in my office...)

I hope that the updated stemmer will fully work with existing indices.
