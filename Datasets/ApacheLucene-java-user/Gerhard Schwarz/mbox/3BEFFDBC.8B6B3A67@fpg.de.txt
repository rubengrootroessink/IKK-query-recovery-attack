(Sorry for the late comment, I got a job to do)

Thats no good, at least with my german stemmer. Lowercase only
prefix/wildcard terms.
The problem is that nouns are stemmed differently, and if the whole
query becomes lowercased, the non-prefix/wildcard terms will be
stemmed differently.
I don't want to switch to medium stemming, because soft stemming
with seperated noun stemming and lowercase indexing produces best
overall results for german language (uniqueness of discriminators,
rate of noise and processing speed).


Btw., Doug, could I get access to the CVS to commit changes/
improvements to the german stemming classes?


Greets,
