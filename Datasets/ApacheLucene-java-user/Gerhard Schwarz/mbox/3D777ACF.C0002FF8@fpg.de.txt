How are those suffixes related to each other? It makes most sense to
reduce every plural to it's singular form first. After that you can
strip unnecessary suffixes.

If you eleminate the diacritics for indexing and searching
you have the advantage that everyone can search even if he
is not familiar with czech diacritics. Or maybe is not able
to use diacritics (wrong codepage, font, whatever).

You should first look at the classes Analyzer and Filter. You need
an Analyzer that pipes the content of a document trough a suitable
Tokenizer (StandardTokenizer should fit for czech) and then trough
the needed filters. One of those filters is yours that makes the
needed grammatically changes.
