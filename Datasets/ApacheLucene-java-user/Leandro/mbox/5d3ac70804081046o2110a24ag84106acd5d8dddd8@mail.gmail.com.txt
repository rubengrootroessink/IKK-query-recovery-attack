Yes... I can use two words and OR
Suposse I query on this

The Lord of Rings: Return of King
The Lord of Rings: Fellowship
The Lord of Rings: The Two towers
The Lord of Weapons
The Lord of War

Suposse an user search: "The Lord of Rings Return of King"
WHERE
name like '%the lord%' or
name like '%lord of%' or
name like '%of rings%' or
name like '%rings return%' or
name like '%return of%' or
name like '%of king%'


So will show all lines... the question now is which is best 'ranking' ...
However you all help me so much , THANKS SO MUCH!!!
(now I won't say bad about the constructor of SpellChecker)
