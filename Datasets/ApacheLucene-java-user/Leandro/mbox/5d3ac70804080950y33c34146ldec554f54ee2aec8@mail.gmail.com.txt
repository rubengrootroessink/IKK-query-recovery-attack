Thanks.
How can we suggest it (create an normal constructor without param) to the
team?

I guess no, because user will enter : "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of
the King" ... and the system should response with:


Similar:
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

I can't see how can I do that?  (just using the OR statement)
For example:

name like '%the%'
or
name like '%Lord%'
or
name like '%of%'
or
name like '%the%'
or
name like '%Rings%'

will produce so much results besides to be non-performatic...

Perhaps you want to combine one variant with MUST clauses that has a bit
