Perfect explanation... !!!
So use the RAMDirectory is better (perfomatically)

spell= new SpellChecker(FSDirectory.getDirectory("."));
spell= new SpellChecker(RAMDirectory.getDirectory("."));

The second is better (fast) to little amount of data...
Thanks so much, now I can understand ... It may be on real documentation...

Shingle will divide it on "couple" of words... so I can use it with OR ...
(The good one.... I'll try this)


Thanks so much!!!
