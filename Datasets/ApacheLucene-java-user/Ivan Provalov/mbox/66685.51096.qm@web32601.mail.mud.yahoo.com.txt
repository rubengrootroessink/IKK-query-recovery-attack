Great points, Robert!  

I agree, we have a lot of fine tuning ahead of us.  

I think we probably have achieved the baseline with our MAP of 0.14.  We should move on to
stage two and apply some of the suggestions to improve the overall scores.

These are just the first steps.  Both you and Grant brought up good points on the users' information
needs and the precision/recall tuning of the system.

Thanks,

Ivan
