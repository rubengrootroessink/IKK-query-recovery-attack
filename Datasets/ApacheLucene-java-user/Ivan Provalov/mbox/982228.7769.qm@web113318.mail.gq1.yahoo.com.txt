SUBJECT: Lucene 2.4.0 vs 2.9.1 Query Grouping
DATE: 15 Jun 2010

Came across a 2.4.0 bug.  The attached unit test demonstrates that if you have 1000 documents
in the query and use grouping, the query doesn't work as expected (returns 92 results).  The
same query in 2.9.1 (see pom.xml) works as expected.  Is there a documented defect on this
issue?

Thanks,

Ivan Provalov
