SUBJECT: problem with the label
DATE: 27 May 2007

Hello,
   
      When i tried to index a sense with name Sense:(the sense) with label contents: (contents:Sense:sense)
i had a problem in the searching.For example when i had as a query the Sense:sense lucene
didn't return anything and when contents:Sense:sense returned many documents that they didn't
contain the sense that i had in the query.
      Is it normal this?Did i do any mistake or does lucene have a problem?I used the edition
of the book in the case that is a problem of edition.
   
   
  cheers,
   
  Stefanos
