Mr. Codd would normalize the anchor texts as an attribute
of the link from the pointing page to the pointed page.
So a clean way is to store these links in a separate (lucene) db,
putting the anchor text in a stored field so it can be retrieved when
needed.
Since lucene is a free format database, you can store these links
in any lucene db. It depends on the circumstances (ie. what operation
is most time critical) what the best place is.
This also depends on how you want to search your anchor fields: should
they be in the same lucene document as the pointed to page, or could
you just allow searching for anchors in a separate 'links' db?

Have fun,
Ype
