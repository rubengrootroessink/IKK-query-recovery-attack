A Hits object caches some documents for you, but when you need more
control over stored field retrieval you can implement your own
to retrieve them in the way a database does it:
Get all the doc nrs needed, sort them and retrieve the (non cached) stored
fields in that order. Normally, that (almost) minimizes the distance the disk head
needs to travel for the retrieval.

Lucene stores all the document fields for single document close
together, so retrieving all stored fields isn't much more expensive than
retrieving only the primary key.
