Apart from java object overhead once, a limit filter takes one (1) bit per 
document, ie. 125 bytes per 1000 docs, in your case 1.25Mbytes per filter.
You can reuse search filters as long as the document numbers in the index
do not change.
A LRU cache for filters can be worthwhile. Java 1.4 has a LinkedHashMap for 
that.

Have fun,
