Actually, I would like to have the possibility to provide
all terms in an OR query with the same idf weight, eg. some
avarage of their IDF's, to reflect that they have the same
importance in the query. But that is a slightly different subject.

That's what the query norm is for.
The best comparisons are between queries that differ only in term weights.
But the default scoring method is complex enough to lead to surprises
when queries are more different.
