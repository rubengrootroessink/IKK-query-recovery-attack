You'll need the following:
- a design for your lucene documents, ie. which fields are you going to use,
- a program to walk each of the tables, create lucene documents from the rows,
  and add these documents to your lucene db(s). You'll have to choose a lucene
  field to use as primary key in the lucene db(s). There has been quite a bit
  of discussion lately on how to add documents to a lucene db, check the
  archives. Note that lucene itself has no facilities for primary keys.
  Basically you'll have to batch document additions: delete an evt. set
  of documents to be replaced and then add a set of new documents.

>2. Run a query against one or many of the index columns.

You can query each lucene field seperately. Have a look at the query
language, because this might well influence the design of your documents.

Not me, perhaps someone else.

My pleasure,

P.S. I can recommend to use Jython for the importing part.
There is always a bit of experimenting needed, so a scripting language is ideal.
Also most of the time will be spent within the Lucene API, leaving
the scripting overhead negligable.
