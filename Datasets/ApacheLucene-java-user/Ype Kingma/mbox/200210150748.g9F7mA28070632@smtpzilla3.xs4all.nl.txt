This might depend on your analyzer.
For key fields, I prefer to use a lower level API on IndexReader:
construct a Term from the field name and the key value and use the 
IndexReader method that returns an iterator over the docs containing the 
term, termdocs() iirc. Beware of correct case for the key value.
In case you have mutliple key values to check, sorting them before going to 
the  IndexReader helps performance
For pure boolean work, the IndexReader is quite useful.

It should work I think. You might try and print the output of the analyzer, 
ie the actually indexed text, when constructing the document.

Have fun,
