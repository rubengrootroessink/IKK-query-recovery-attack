Fanny,

on how to implement it? Would the sorting affect the performance a lot?

You need to design the fields in your lucene documents first, ie.
what fields do you need, and what should be their name and contents.
This design will be determined by the output you need from
searches on your lucene index (or indices).

You might eg. add a field named 'fieldnames' that contains
the name of each the other fields in each lucene document.
The field should be stored and probably indexed.
This field could be added to your lucene document just before
you pass the document to the index writer.
See the lucene API documentation on how to do this.

Performance will most likely be limited by the retrieval of the stored field
from the lucene index, and not by the speed of counting and sorting.

Have fun,
Ype
