Lucene indexes are quite compact already.
Text (western languages) is normally indexed to about 1/3 it's original size,
I don't know about CJK.
You can have a look at the file formats on the Lucene web site to see how the
compression is done. Among others there are common prefixes for
the sorted terms, variable length integers, and storing differences between
integers instead of the complete numbers when possible.

One place where compression might be useful is in the stored fields, but
there is no API for it in Lucene.

Kind regards,
Ype
