This could happen in case the term weights are determined per index:
the fewer documents that contain a term, the higher the term weight,
(idf: inverse document frequency).
The default scores are not normalized for the idf term weights,
only for the query term weights.

As I'm still using 1.2, I have never tried the new 1.3 features for
searching multiple indexes. I would expect 1.3 to use the total
nr. of docs containing a term in searched all indexes together,
though.

Kind regards,
Ype.
