AFAIK, yes.
You can speed this up by using multiple documents, ie. use
a document set.
Also, you don't need to close the index writer before optimizing.

One variation: you might leave the IndexReader open in case you
need it for searching, but I wouldn't recommend that under Windows
because there an open file cannot be deleted from a directory.
Lucene deletes such files during later optimizations.

Kind regards,
