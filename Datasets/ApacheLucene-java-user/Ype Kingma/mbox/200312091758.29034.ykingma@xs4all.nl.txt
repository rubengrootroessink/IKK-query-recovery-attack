Stefan,

I didn't provide the patch, I just remembered the code from
a recent reading.

I took another look whether there are more such cases
in the Term() method, but I couldn't find anything clear
in the .jj file. The generated .java file didn't help much either.

Could you provide a line number with the exception?
There are some attribute references that might cause
this.
Or perhaps someone else can give a better hint.

Kind regards,
Ype
