Just make sure the file name is indexed as you show it,
ie. the underscore should be in the indexed term.
The best way to do that is to index the filename as keyword.
Check the output of the analyzer, or use luke to see what is in the index
for the filename field.

Could you try this:

+button +filename:[b10181_p355 TO b10181_p702]

?
If this does not work, please narrow your problem down to a java test program
of 10-20 lines, and post the code.
