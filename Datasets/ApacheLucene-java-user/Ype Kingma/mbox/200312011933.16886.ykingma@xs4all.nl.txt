You can use the low level scoring API, which simply enumerates all boolean
hits. It also gives you the score, but you can just ignore that if you want.

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Searcher.html
Use the search() method with a HitCollector, and provide you own HitCollector.

When you do this avoid retrieving documents during the search, retrieve docs
afterwards. Retrieving docs during search would cause unwanted disk head seeks
from the terms index to the stored fields and back.
It is also preferable to retrieve docs in the order that you collect them, ie. independent
of the score.
Even so, retrieving  documents normally takes more time than collecting them.

Kind regards,
Ype
