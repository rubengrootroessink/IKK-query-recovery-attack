This is the URL:

http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-lucene/release/v1.2/lucene-1.2-src.tar.gz

I extracted again, and found my problem:
One of the extracted files is lucene-1.2-src.jar. When unzipping this you
get a directory tree with only the directories mentioned.

However, the first extraction of the downloaded URL above already
has all the source code package directories at first glance....

Sorry about my confusion. Would you know why 
the lucene-1.2-src.jar file is included?
I looked for an explanation, but couldn't find one.

Regards,
Ype
