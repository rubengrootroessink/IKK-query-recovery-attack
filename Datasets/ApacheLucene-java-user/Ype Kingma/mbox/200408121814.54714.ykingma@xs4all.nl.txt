Two ways: org.apache.lucene.queryParser.MultiFieldQueryParser
or querying an extra field that contains all current fields to be searched.

The latter is normally faster, but takes more index space. It's normally
preferred when this type of query occurs frequently.
Also the query results might be ordered somewhat differently in both cases.

Kind regards,
