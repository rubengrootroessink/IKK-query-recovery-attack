The query parser can construct this query for you (assuming search_word
is in the query default field):

+search_word +(book:[100 TO 200])

See also: http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html

One problem you might run into is that Lucene does not support numbers
directly, only strings are indexed. You can index these numbers with sufficient
zero's prefixed and add these prefix zero's in the query.

Erik Hatcher wrote an article on how to do make the query:

You'll need to override the getRangeQuery() method.

Have fun,
