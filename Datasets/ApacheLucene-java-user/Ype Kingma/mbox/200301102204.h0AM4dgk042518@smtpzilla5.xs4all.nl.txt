AFAICS the document number used by the IndexReader does
precisely what you want. An inserted document gets the next available
document number and optimizing an index fills the deletion gaps
while keeping insertion order.

If you use the lower level search API you get the document number and
the score for each query, so you can simply ignore any document
number outside your prefered range. It might faster to use a limiting bit 
vector since this will prevent the score from being computed for documents
that you are not interested in. See the same lower level search API for 
details.

Have fun,
