The query needs to have space before the 2nd + :

+button  +filename:[B10181_P702 TO B01081_P355]

You seem to use a search mechanism that searches all these fields.
I'd recommend to switch this off until a query with explicit fields works,
eg.:

+contents:button  +filename:[B10181_P702 TO B01081_P355]

Btw. You'll need to make sure that a term like B10181_P702 is
not split at the underscore _ by a tokenizer at indexing time.
If your filename is not a keyword field, you might consider
changing it into a keyword field.

You seem to index book pages as Lucene documents, which is ok.
However, you may also need to index larger parts of the books in
order to retrieve books with multiple subjects on different pages.
Is this what your original question is about?

Have fun,
Ype
