Lucene uses two frequencies for a term: the nr. of docs in which it occurs
in an index (basis for IDF), and the nr of times a term occurs in a document.

The easiest way is to use IndexReader. I don't know what you mean by file
(index or document), but you can have both frequencies I mentioned above
from an IndexReader, evt. using skipTo() to go to the document.
The methods are docFreq(Term) and termDocs(Term).
