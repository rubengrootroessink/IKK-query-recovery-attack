But retrieving stored fields can be slow. I suppose you have the dates in
RAM?
The scores are computed from the index (see the low level search API),
avoiding retrieval of stored fields.

When you need to move disk heads during query evaluation, adding doc/date
pairs to a sorted map could use the CPU time in between.
Did you try inserting into a sorted map while lucene is computing
the next document score? Or would that give too many thread switches?

With a bit of luck you might have the sorted result ready very shortly
after the last document was processed.

Ype
