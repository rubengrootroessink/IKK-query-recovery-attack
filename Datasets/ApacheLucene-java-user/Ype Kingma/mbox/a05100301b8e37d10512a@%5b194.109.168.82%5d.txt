You can use the low level search api with a collector that checks for
cancelling and throw an appropriate error when it occurs.
In case the cancel is detected by another thread you could
make it interrupt the thread running the collector.

However, since searching is quite fast I found no need to interrupt search().
I check for user cancel during retrieval of search results
and also just before starting the query in the next database.
