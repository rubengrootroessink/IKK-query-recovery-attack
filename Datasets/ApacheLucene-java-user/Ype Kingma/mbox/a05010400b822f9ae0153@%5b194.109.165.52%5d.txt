You can use organize your index so that it stores a line as
a field of a Document. Then you only need to add a line number field
to each Document when you create the database.
In case you need to store multiple files you can also store the
file name in another field of the Document.

P.S. On unix the grep program can give you the line number of the
match of a regular expression in a file.
