I don't know precisely how the query parser deals with term values.
However, a space normally splits query terms.
The role of the query parser is to find the global structure of the query.
The term values it finds will be passed to the analyzer used in constructing
the query.
Since you constructed the term without an analyzer (you use a non tokenized
field), you might also not want to use an analyzer when constructing a query
for that field.

The BooleanQuery class allows for required and optional terms iirc,
and a term consists of a field name and a field value.

Have fun,
