A range query will provide a range of indexed values, and
I thought you needed to add the record number as an indexed field
in each record.

However, you seem to use the 200 and 400 here as the order number
for each record in the result of the query on the Contents field.
Is that correct?
When so, in which order do you expect the results of your query?

Kind regards,
Ype
