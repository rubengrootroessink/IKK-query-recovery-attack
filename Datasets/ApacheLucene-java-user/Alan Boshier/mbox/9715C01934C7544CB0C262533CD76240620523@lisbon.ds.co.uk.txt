That was my understanding (that they had to be indexed) but
making them stored seems to have fixed the problem we were
seeing, which is odd. 

Not being an expert on how lucene works internally, I'm 
struggling to see how this change could have made any 
difference.

AFIK, the field has to be indexed, but I don't think it has to be stored
(but then again maybe I'm wrong)

Subject: Newbie question: lucene sorting problems and stored fields

Hi

We are seeing intermittent problems with searches that use sorted fields
(in lucene 1.4.3).

If we add the fields to our Documents as 'unstored' then we start to see
results that have been sorted by Document ID.

The problem goes away if we add the fields as 'stored'.

Is it a requirement when creating a field for sorting to make it stored?

Thanks

Alan
