SUBJECT: Newbie question: lucene sorting problems and stored fields
DATE: 14 Sep 2006

Hi

We are seeing intermittent problems with searches that use 
sorted fields (in lucene 1.4.3).

If we add the fields to our Documents as 'unstored' then
we start to see results that have been sorted by Document ID.

The problem goes away if we add the fields as 'stored'.

Is it a requirement when creating a field for sorting to
make it stored?

Thanks

Alan
