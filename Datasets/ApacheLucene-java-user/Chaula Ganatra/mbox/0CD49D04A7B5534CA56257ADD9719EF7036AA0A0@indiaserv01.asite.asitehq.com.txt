SUBJECT: How to restore corrupted index
DATE: 26 Sep 2008

We have an application in which index will be updated frequently.

During development time, found that index files gets corrupted, i.e.
more than one  cfs files,some other extension files e.g. frq, fnm, nrm

Remains there in index directory.

Is there any way that such issue does not occur at all or if it happens
we can recover the index data again?

It would be a great help, if some one can.

 

 

Regards,

Chaula
