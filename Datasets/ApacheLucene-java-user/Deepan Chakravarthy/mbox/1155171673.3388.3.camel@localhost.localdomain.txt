I have Luke. When i inspect the index with luke i find the same result,
i.e the updated documents are not searchable in the new index. 

I guess Index Modifier used Index reader and writer internally. I am
adding more fields to existing documents in index. so some of my
documents will have n fields and other n+m fields after updating. Does
the difference in number of fields affect search in any manner ?
