Idea: Don't drop stopwords from the query - they aren't in the index for 
the respective languages. However, you might get results from other 
languages..

It's the stemming that's difficult. You'd have to stem for each language, 
and then do searches. But since you won't stem at all, this wouldn't be 
much of a problem in your case.

Maybe a language-selector drop-down would be nice?
