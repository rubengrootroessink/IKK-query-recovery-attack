May I ask: What IS a profilenet? I ask since this obviously is something 
that you two hit off on right away, while I haven't heard of..!

I was also instantly thinking "more like this"-like. "Inverted 
searching" - won't that in effect be searching with the entire 
"search-document"'s terms, search-weighted on that document's term 
weights? Which again, due to performance, will involve finding the 
search-documents most relevant words, and then do a search with that, 
again search-weighted on the document's term weights?

Thanks,
Endre.
