Kristian,

I assume all of you comments are with the 0.7.0 version of PDFBox.  There
were some great improvements in that version in terms of speed and
accuracy.

Depending on the set of PDF documents you will notice different results.
I welcome any bug reports(if they don't already exist) on that 33% that
are not working for you.  In particular, PDFBox needs some work on
non-english languages.

Well, at least PDFBox made it as the "fallback.  :)
