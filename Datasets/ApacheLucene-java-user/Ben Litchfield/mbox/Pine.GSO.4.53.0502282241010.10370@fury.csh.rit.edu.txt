SUBJECT: PDF Highlighter Package
DATE: 1 Mar 2005


For those of you that support indexing PDF documents, PDFBox now supports
Adobe's PDF Highlight specification
(http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/pdf/HighlightFileFormat.pdf)

PDFBox is now capable of generating an XML document that describes words
in a PDF document to highlight.

An "in action" example can be seen at

http://pavilion.csh.rit.edu:8080/pdfbox/index.html

You can enter any web accessible PDF and any keywords.  The PDF will open
normally and after a short pause(this is running on an old slow server)
will jump to the first selected keyword.

Source code is available in CVS or in tonight's nightly build.

Any comments/suggestions are welcome.

Special thanks to Stephan Lagraulet, who made this possible with code
contributions.
