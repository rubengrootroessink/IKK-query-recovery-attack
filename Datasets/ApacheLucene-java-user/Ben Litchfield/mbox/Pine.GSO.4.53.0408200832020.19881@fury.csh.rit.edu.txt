In order to search through a PDF document the text must be extracted from
the PDF document.  There are several libraries to do that, including
http://www.pdfbox.org   After you have the text from the PDF document you
just add it to the lucene index like any other text document.  You should
go through the intro tutorial to understand how to index/search text using
lucene.
