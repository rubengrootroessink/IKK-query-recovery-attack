SUBJECT: Re: integration of lucene with pdfbox
DATE: 23 Aug 2004



If you can use lucene on its own then you already know how to add a lucene
Document to the index.  So you need to be able to take a PDF and get a
lucene Document.

org.pdfbox.searchengine.lucene.LucenePDFDocument.getDocument()

does that for you.
