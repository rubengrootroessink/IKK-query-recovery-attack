SUBJECT: Re: Full disk space during indexing process with 120 gb of free disk space
DATE: 4 Dec 2006

PDFBox version 0.6 is quite old and there have been many improvements, 
you should look at moving to the newest version 0.7.3, although from the 
description of your problem it probably would not resolve it.

If there are a large number of temp files with "pdfbox" in the name then 
you are most likely not calling close() on the PDDocument object.  How 
are you adding the documents to the index.  There is a simple helper 
class called org.pdfbox.searchengine.lucene.LucenePDFDocment that you 
may find useful.
