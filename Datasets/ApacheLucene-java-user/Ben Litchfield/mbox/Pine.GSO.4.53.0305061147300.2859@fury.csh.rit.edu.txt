Are you using the org.pdfbox.searchengines.LucenePDFDocument class?  It
looks like you are using the HTMLParser to parse a PDF document which will
not work.  So in your indexer class you need to have something to this
effect

if( PDF Document )
{
    use LucenePDFDocument
}
else if( HTML Document )
{
    use HTMLParser
}

You can see a working example of this in the
org.pdfbox.searchengine.lucene.IndexFiles source file.

It would be nice if lucene had some sort Front class that implemented a
command pattern.  So you could feed it a URL or File it would determine
the mime type and it would call to a parser configured for that mimetype.
It seems silly that everybody has all of these if statements in all of
their indexers to switch on the contentType.  Maybe I will work on that
one of these days if there is some interest.
