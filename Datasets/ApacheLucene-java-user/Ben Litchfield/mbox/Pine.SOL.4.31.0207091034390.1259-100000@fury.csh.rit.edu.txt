SUBJECT: PDF Text Stripper
DATE: 9 Jul 2002

Hi,

I have written a PDF library that can be used to strip text from PDF
documents.  It is released under LGPL so have fun.

There is one class which can be used to easily index PDF documents.
pdfparser.searchengine.lucene.LucenePDFDocument  has a getDocument
method which will take a PDF file and return a Lucene Document which you
can add to an index.

If you would like to see the quality of the text extraction you can run
pdfparser.Main from the command line which will take a PDF document and
write a txt file.

I am looking for any input that you might have.  Please mail me if you
have any bugs or feature requests.

The library can be retrieved from
