Lucene indexes text documents, so you will need to convert your PDF to a
text document.  PDFBox (http://www.pdfbox.org/) can do that, PDFBox
provides a summary of the document, which is just the first x number of
characters.  If you wanted a smarter summary you would need to create that
yourself.

There are tutorials available on the website, and I would recommend
the "Lucene in Action" book.  There is a learning curve for lucene, but it
sounds like your requirements are pretty basic so it shouldn't be that
hard.
