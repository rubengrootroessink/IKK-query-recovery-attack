Text extraction from PDF documents is a fairly complex problem and is a
delicate balance between speed/memory/accuracy/...

How are you measuring your memory usage?

In my opinion your two viable options are PDFBox(directly or via slides
PDFExtractor) and PDFTextStream.  They both integrate with lucene fairly
easily.

I highly suggest you do some tests against your own set of PDF documents.
A new version of PDFBox was released this weekend and does have some
improvements in terms of speed and memory.
