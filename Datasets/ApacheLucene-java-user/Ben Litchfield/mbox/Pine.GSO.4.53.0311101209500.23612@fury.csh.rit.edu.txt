I would try two things.

1)Is PDFBox getting the title from the document?
You can run this example to find out

java org.pdfbox.examples.pdmodel.PrintDocumentMetaData <input-pdf>

2)Is the lucene field getting properly set in the lucene database.  I
would use luke(http://www.getopt.org/luke/) to verify that lucene is
getting the field.

Other than that I would double check your code that gets the "Title" field
correctly.
