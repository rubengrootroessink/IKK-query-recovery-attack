I have created a DLL from the lucene jars for use in the PDFBox project.
It uses IKVM(http://www.ikvm.net) to create a DLL from a jar.

The binary version can be found here
http://www.csh.rit.edu/~ben/projects/pdfbox/nightly-release/PDFBox-.NET-0.7.0-dev.zip

This includes the ant script used to create the DLL files.

This method is by far the easiest way to port it, see previous posts about
advantages and disadvantages.
