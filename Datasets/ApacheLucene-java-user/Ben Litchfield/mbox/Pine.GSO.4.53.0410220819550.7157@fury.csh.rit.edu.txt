Please post any PDFBox issues you notice on the PDFBox sourceforge bug
list, if possible attach/email any problem PDFs that you encounter.

There are some efforts underway to improve the speed of PDFBox, you can
monitor the progress at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1046300&group_id=78314&atid=552832

As for other suggestions, I know some people have utilized xpdf(open
source but non Java) to extract the text.

For other Java solutions
