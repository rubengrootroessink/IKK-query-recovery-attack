SUBJECT: [ANN]PDFBox-0.6.2
DATE: 21 Apr 2003


I am proud to announce the latest version of PDFBox.  This version comes
with some exciting changes to the project.  Bob Dickinson joins PDFBox the
development team and brings 20 years of programming expertise to this
project.  Bob is responsible for all changes in the 0.6.2 release.

PDFBox has also been moved to sourceforge which offers many features that
people have been requesting such as bug tracking and mailing lists.

Version 0.6.2 has fixed many issues with text extraction and it is
recommended that all Lucene users that use PDFBox upgrade to this latest
version.
