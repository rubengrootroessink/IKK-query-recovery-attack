That was my first thought as well, but it looks like APOSTROPHE is
already the one that I want. As you can see, from StandardAnalyzer.jj

-------------------
TOKEN : {					  // token patterns

  // basic word: a sequence of digits & letters
  <ALPHANUM: (<LETTER>|<DIGIT>|<KOREAN>)+ >

  // internal apostrophes: O'Reilly, you're, O'Reilly's
  // use a post-filter to remove possesives
| <APOSTROPHE: <ALPHA> ("'" <ALPHA>)+ >
-------------------

It really looks like it should work for ' rather than `, but it does not.

Thanks for the reply! Hopefully you or someone else can point out
what's going on or where I'm going wrong.
