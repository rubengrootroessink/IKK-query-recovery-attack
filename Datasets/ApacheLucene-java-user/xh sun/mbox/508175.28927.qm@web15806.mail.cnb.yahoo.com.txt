Thanks, John and Marcus.</DIV>
Below is the related code in jsp file, and the stacktrace is null even it failed to open the
index.
       
        try 
        {
          out.print("To open index");        
          reader = IndexReader.open(indexName);  
          out.print("have opened the index");
          indexsize=reader.numDocs();      
          searcher = new IndexSearcher(reader);   
                                                       

        } 
        catch (Exception e) 
        { 
        e.printStackTrace();
        error = true;  
        }
.....
  if (reader != null)
    reader.close();
  if (searcher != null)
    searcher.close();    
    
BR,
Shawn

Hi.

And some exception stacktrace would be nice as well.

Kindly
