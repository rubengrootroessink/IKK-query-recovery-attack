SUBJECT: failed to open an indexer after about 20 queries
DATE: 5 Aug 2008

Hi,
The indexer can't be opened after about 20 queries in linux system, but it is fine if the
index is in windows  system. The indexer is the same in both systems.
          reader = IndexReader.open(indexName);    //failed after about 20 queries
          searcher = new IndexSearcher(reader);  
 
The reader and search have been closed after each query. Is there any special configuration
for the index in linux system? 
Appreicate your help very much.
BR,
Shawn
