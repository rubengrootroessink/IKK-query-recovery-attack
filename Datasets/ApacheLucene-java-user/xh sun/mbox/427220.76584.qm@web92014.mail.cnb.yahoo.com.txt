SUBJECT: the format of tii file
DATE: 14 Mar 2007

Hi all,

I try to analysis a sample tii file(lucene 2.0.0),  IndexTermCount is 2 in the file, but 
I don't know the meaning of these bytes "00 00 FF FF FF FF 0F 00 00 00 14" after the field
SkipInterval. It shall be a <TermInfo, IndexDelta> according to the file format. Who
can help me on this? thanks a lot.

The attached is the tii file.

Best regards,
Shawn
