Eric, 
I'm sure that is entirely true. E.g. in E&P industry we have a bunch of
legacy relational databases that are tremendously complex. 
Therefore the presentation layer for them is never good since
the user is exposed to the data model complexity every time he uses this
database. 

So, giving up on the structured API idea, flattening out the content and
indexing is seems to be not a bad idea at all. Especially if you are
facing the problem of integrating results from several legacy databases
or integrating the flat file store with a database. 

Regards,
     Vasily
