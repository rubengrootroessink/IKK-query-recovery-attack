SUBJECT: RE: [ANN] PDFBox 0.6.0
DATE: 6 Mar 2003

Ben,

I downloaded pdfbox and installed it. And I can use:
 java org.pdfbox.Main <PDF-file> <output-text-file>
to convert .pdf file to string file.

Then I tried to integrate with Lucene. I modified the following codes in 
IndexHTML.java:

else if(file.getPath().endsWith(".pdf")) {
        Document doc =  LucenePDFDocument.getDocument(file);
        System.out.println("adding " + "pdf files");
        writer.addDocument(doc);
        }

It did pass ant compiler (ant wardemo). However, when I tested:
java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index {index-dir} ..

It seems to me it still didnot pick up new IndexHTML.java, still did not index 
.pdf files.


Did I miss something here?

Regards,

George
