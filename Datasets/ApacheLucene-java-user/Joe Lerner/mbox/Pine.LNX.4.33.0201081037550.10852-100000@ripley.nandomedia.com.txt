SUBJECT: One Question -- Successful Deployments
DATE: 8 Jan 2002


All,

I have one question in relation to Lucene.  Can you give me the contact
information of 2+ individuals who have successfully deployed Lucene?

I want to ask them directly:
  How fast is it?
  How reliable is it?

Note: I wrote code and lead small teams of developers for an internet
publishing company in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina.
