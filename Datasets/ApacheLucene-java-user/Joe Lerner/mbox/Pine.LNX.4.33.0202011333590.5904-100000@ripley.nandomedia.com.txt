SUBJECT: Performance Issue
DATE: 1 Feb 2002


We built a Lucene prototype, and compared it to our current Search Engine,
Verity's K2, running on Linux.  Query times are quick, but performance of
the combined time to return hitlist data and transfer it across the network
was slow.

Any tuning suggestions?
