Hi,

We use Verity, a commercial vendor, for our Search, but were in serious trouble
with its performance, and looking for a solid, more economical, open source
alternative, like Lucene.

A prototype we built using Lucene compared favorably with Verity, but then
along came "zones".  Verity tech support helped us re-configure our indices
with "zones", giving us a fivefold increase in performance.  Note, "Zones" are
a separate, non-fielded, word list with addressing maps (each word mapped to an
address/document).

Is anyone familiar with Verity "zones"?  Does Lucene implement "zones" in its
own way?  How?


-Joe
