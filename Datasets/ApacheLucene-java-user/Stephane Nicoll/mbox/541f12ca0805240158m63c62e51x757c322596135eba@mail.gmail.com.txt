It is hard to externalize a unit test since it relies on many factor.
You need to have a significant amount of data (100.000 documents) and
you need to browse all results in the lucene index (15.000 results for
a typicial query in my case). I still don't find any optimized
solution to do this even if I only need one field from the search
result and the index is 5MB. I could put that into memory but that's
not a viable solution mid-term.

I've stopped using lucene. I am using sql like for now and we are
investigating Oracle Text and postigs test extension.

If anyone has an idea, i'm interested. For instance, knowing that the
IDs I got from the database are < 500, would it be reasonable to build
a lucene query like

"my search query  AND (id IN (the list of 500 ids)" <- will this hit
the toomanyclausesexception? How can I build such a query efficently?

Thanks,
StÃ©phane
