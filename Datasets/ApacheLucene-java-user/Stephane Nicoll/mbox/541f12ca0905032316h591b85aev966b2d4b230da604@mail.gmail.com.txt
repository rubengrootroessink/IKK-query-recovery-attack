Hi,

There are many more alternatives available to the JMS bridge. There is also
the abilty to do incremental copy of the index over a shared filesystem for
instance. That being said, 5 seconds seems really short to me.

I read all this in "Hibernate Search In Action" but I suppose the online
material has the reference as well.

HTH,
