SUBJECT: Using lucene with a Geospatial catalog
DATE: 17 Feb 2008

Hi,

I've been browsing the archive and the documentation about Lucene. It
really seems that it could help implementing my use case but I would
like to be sure first.

What I need is to be able to search data in a "catalog" which is
geo-enabled. The data is stored in a database. A record has namely

* name
* keywords
* footprint (that is a geometry that represents the record)
* date range (optional) that defines the "validity of the data"
* Timestamp
* Creation date
* various boolean flag
* custom data

I understand that Lucene is powerful for full-text based search but
what about searching something like "give me all records that contains
the kewords foo, with flag bar true, valid between 20070602 and
20070907 and whose geometry intersect a given box.

I've seen on the list people using tricks by storing the coordinates
in a way we could use range. In my case, the geometry is potentially
very complex. The database handle that for me (Oracle Spatial or
PostGIS for instance) with intersect, contains and such. Is it
possible to combine a lucene search with a DB query? Any best
practices on that topic?

Thanks,
St√©phane
