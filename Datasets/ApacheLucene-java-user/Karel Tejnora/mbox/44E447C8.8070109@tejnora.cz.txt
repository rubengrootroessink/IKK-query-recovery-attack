SUBJECT: Re: Split an existing index into smaller segments without a re-index?
DATE: 17 Aug 2006

Depends.

0) optimize big index

1) on big index delete all documents except those for a part of index
2) use AddIndexes on IndexWriter on destination dir (empty)
3) delete segments.del in big index directory (the segments.del is a 
just serialized BitVector)
4) repeat for another set

do not make optimize or any other action if segments.del lives-  that 
will delete your documents
