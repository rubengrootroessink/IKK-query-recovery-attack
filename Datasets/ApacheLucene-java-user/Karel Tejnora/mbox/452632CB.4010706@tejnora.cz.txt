One think, generally use RDBM for the STORED fields is good idea because 
every segment merging / optimize copies those data once or twice (cfs).

I'm thinking about to put STORED fields in extra file and put pointers 
in cfs. Delete will just mark document as delete. And new operation 
omptimize_full
deletes and corrects pointers.
