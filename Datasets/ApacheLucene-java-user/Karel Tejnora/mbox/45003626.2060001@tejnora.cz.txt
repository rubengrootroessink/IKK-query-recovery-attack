DATE: 7 Sep 2006

Discussed before, it's more relation db task than lucene.

Simple approach is to get a list of terms from your queries and store 
relation document - query - terms.

I have around 1.6e10 query-terms in postgreSQL and with proper index 
select takes around 0.6 ms (clustered vacuumed analyzed), 300 ms after day.
