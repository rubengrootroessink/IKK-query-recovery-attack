Jason is right. I think, even Im not expert on lucene too, your newly 
added document cann't recreate terms for field with analyzer, because 
field text in empty.
There is very hairy solution - hack a IndexReader, FieldInfosWriter and 
use addIndexes.

Lucene is "only" a fulltext search library, not a datastore. I end up 
with the same design as he suggested - At beginning I choose to store 
fields in lucene index,
because lucene has no limit on fields length like DB2.

The Jason's strategy is very useful in all cases - *before adding 
document* to lucene index obtain an unique id from sequence (e. g. db) 
add document with
this synthetic id (e.g. field id and store it within index) and after 
add, save document *with id* (if it has not been saved yet) to xml or 
another storage.

Well, I haven't stored syn. ids with indexed documents and now I'm about 
to reassign them.
