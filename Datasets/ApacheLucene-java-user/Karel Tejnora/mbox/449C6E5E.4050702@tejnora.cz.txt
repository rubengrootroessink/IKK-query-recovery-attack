SUBJECT: Re: Searching multiple indexes
DATE: 23 Jun 2006

Hi,
    there are two ways. The first is to use MultiFieldQueryParser 
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/queryParser/MultiFieldQueryParser.html
or do an extra step in indexing to build a new field as join of those 
(e.g. StringBuffer append f1 append f2 ...)

Benefits of the first is better relevance in case f.e. 
title,summary,fulltext. Minus is "performance" degradation.
+- of the second is better performance but lost of norms relevance.

Depends on requests. The first for us has show pity, if any, perf. deg. 
but better relevance results (title occurences are at top, summary and 
than content) and also smaller index.
Following docs lucene before 1.9 had a problem in inrelevant matches 
where the term occurs in more than one field. 1.9 fixed that.
