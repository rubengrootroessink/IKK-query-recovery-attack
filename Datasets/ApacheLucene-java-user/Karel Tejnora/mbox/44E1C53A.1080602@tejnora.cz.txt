Well, you can have! :-) Even I have not tested, just an idea.

You can get document id after add - numDocs() and insert if DB fails, 
you can delete document from RAMDir.

Or in my case of batches - im adding documents in DB with savepoint, 
than create clear index (create=true) and at the end if everything is 
allright
use addIndexes() if not than rollback to savepoint and send sms.
