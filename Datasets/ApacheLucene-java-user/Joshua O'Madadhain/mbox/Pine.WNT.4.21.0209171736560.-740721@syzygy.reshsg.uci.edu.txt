I *think* that what you think should happen is what indeed should be
happening.  However, I have a few suggestions for sanity checks to make
sure that you're seeing what you think you're seeing:

(1) Call docFreq("Bob") before and after each step.  This will make sure
that (for instance) your supposed "non-Bob" documents are indeed
"non-Bob", which if false would be a subtle sort of "gotcha".

(2) Double-check that you use the same index in all cases.

(3) Are you closing the index before you call optimize()?  (According to
the docs, you shouldn't.)

(4) Are you closing the IndexWriter after you call optimize() and before
you call docFreq()?  (close() does flush changes, although I don't know
whether it should be necessary after optimize().)

Anyway, good luck.
