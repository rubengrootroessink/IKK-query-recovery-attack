Perhaps there is some reason for the conversion to XML that I'm not
understanding (and this isn't really within my area of expertise).  

But if your purpose is to index HTML files and then display them later in
response to a search, why not just use JTidy and then index the HTML
instead (skipping the DOM and XML stages entirely), and then return the
(cleaned-up) HTML later when asked for?  The basis of any 'semantic' tags
that you might be putting in the XML (perhaps to define Lucene fields)
must be there in the HTML anyway, so I'm not sure what the DOM and XML
representations get you.
