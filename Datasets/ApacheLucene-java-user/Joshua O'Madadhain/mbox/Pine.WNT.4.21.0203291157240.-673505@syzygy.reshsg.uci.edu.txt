I've also been doing research in IR using the Lucene API.  Regarding query
expansion, I wrote my own code to do that, based on an algorithm I
developed (which is a type of thesaurus-based expansion).  Basically I ran
the original query terms through the appropriate analyzers, decided what
terms I wanted to add, and constructed my own Query from these terms
(using TermQuery and BooleanQuery).

While I did weight documents based on the terms they used (take a look at
TermQuery.setBoost()), I didn't do relevance feedback per se.  Of course,
how you want to implement relevance feedback will depend on what mechanism
you want to use.

If you'd like to discuss this offline (since we may be getting off the
list topic), feel free to email me.

Regards,

Joshua
