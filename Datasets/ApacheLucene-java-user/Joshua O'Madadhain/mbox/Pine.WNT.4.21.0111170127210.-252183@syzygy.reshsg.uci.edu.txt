What I was trying to build was not the whole thing, but the supplied demo
without the HTML stuff: FileDocument.java, IndexFiles.java, and
SearchFiles.java.  When I tried to compile these three files using javac
(with the classpath properly set to include the Lucene stuff), I got the
error I reported earlier (IndexFiles was unable to find FileDocument).  
Once I removed them from the package org.apache.lucene (by removing the
package declaration at the top), I was able to compile them without a
hitch.  Since those three files are not actually part of Lucene itself,
but just part of the demo, I think that having them in the
org.apache.lucene package in the first place is more confusing than
helpful.

Yes, this would necessitate two sets of instructions: one for building the
source, and one for building the demo.  I don't see this as a problem,
personally.
