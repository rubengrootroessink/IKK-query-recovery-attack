If you have a suggestion for how Lucene could use fewer file descriptors
while still maintaining its performance, I'm sure that the developers
would be interested to hear it. 

However, some programs do require more resources than others.  If--as I
suspect is true in this case--this is a consequence of the complexity of
the task, then there's not much point in complaining about it.
