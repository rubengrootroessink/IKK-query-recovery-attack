SUBJECT: inter-term correlation [was Re: Vector Space Model in Lucene?]
DATE: 14 Nov 2003

Incorporating inter-term correlation into Lucene isn't that hard; I've 
done it.  Nor is it incompatible with the vector-space model.  I'm not 
happy with the specific correlation metric that I picked, which is why 
I'm not eager to generally release the code I wrote, but I think that 
the basic mechanism that I came up with (query expansion via correlated 
terms, where the added terms were boosted according to the strength of 
the correlation) is fairly sound.  And I didn't need any changes to 
Lucene to do this.

You can get some details on the specific mechanism that I used here, if 
you're interested:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jmadden/research/index.html

(and go down to "Fuzzy Term Expansion and Document Reweighting", about 
halfway down.)

If you decide that my ideas are interesting enough that you want to 
have a look at my code, let me know, and perhaps we can work something 
out.

Regards,

Joshua O'Madadhain
