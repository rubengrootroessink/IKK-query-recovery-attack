I could, but I'd prefer to wait until I have had a chance to do some more
testing on it.  Right now it requires a fair amount of time and memory and
it's not clear that the return is worth the cost.  <wry smile> I hope to
do the necessary investigations within a few months; once I've done this
(and hopefully published a paper from it), I'll be more than happy to post
it to the contributions area.

Regards,
