You cannot, in general, structure a Lucene query such that it will yield
the same document rankings that Google would for that (query, document
set).  The reason for this is that Google employs a scoring algorithm that
includes information about the topology of the pages (i.e., how the
pages are linked together).  (An overview of what Google does in this
regard may be found at http://www.google.com/technology/index.html .)
Thus, in order to get Lucene to do "what Google does", you'd have to
rewrite large chunks of it.
