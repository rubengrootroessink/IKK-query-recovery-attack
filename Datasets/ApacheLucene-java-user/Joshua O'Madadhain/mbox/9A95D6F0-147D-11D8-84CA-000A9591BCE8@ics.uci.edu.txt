Depends on the type of clustering algorithm.  Some clustering 
algorithms take the number of clusters as a parameter (in this case the 
algorithm may be run several times with different values, to determine 
the best value).  Other types of algorithms, such as hierarchical 
agglomerative clustering algorithms, work more as you suggest.
