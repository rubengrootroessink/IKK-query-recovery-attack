I think that this is a good idea, which perhaps ought to be combined with
a note on the top level of the documentation which would read something
like "Methods marked in the documentation with 'Expert' should only be
used by experienced users of Lucene; /caveat coder/."

Certainly things like this should be left (package) private.

This seems reasonable enough for most purposes.  I do wonder, though,
whether there's a "gotcha" that can arise as an unexpected side effect of
including a file in a package (for this purpose) that otherwise wouldn't
need to be included.  (I don't use packages much myself; can a piece of
code be part of more than one package?)  If nothing else, such inclusion
might be somewhat mysterious to later maintainers of that code.  This kind
of modification might also make it more difficult for people to get Lucene
contributions from more than one source to work together.
