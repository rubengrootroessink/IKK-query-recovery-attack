Just a brief note on performance measurements and statistical sampling: no
offense, but if these are measurements of a single trial of 1000 documents
for each JVM, they're not so different that I'd be willing to conclude
that one JVM is notably faster for this task than another.  The problem is
compounded by the fact that it can be hard to tell just how much CPU is
being taken up by OS tasks (and this can fluctuate quite a lot).  If you
really want to quote statistics like this, using 5 or 10 trials would give
a more accurate notion of the real performance differences (if any).

Casuistically :),
