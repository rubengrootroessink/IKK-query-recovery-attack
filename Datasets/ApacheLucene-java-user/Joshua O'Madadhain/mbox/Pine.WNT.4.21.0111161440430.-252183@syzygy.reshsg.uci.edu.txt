If what you want to do is to arrange matters so that the Hits object
returned by the search is sorted in some order other than that given by
the built-in score function, I personally don't know how to do this other
than rewriting the HitCollector.  If there *is* a way to do this, I'd also
be interested in knowing what it was.

However, if you're willing to re-sort the search results once you get
them, you should just be able to pull the Documents out of the Hits, copy
them into an array, and sort them according to whatever fields are in the
Document, using your favorite sorting algorithm.  (Or at least I don't see
why you should not be able to do this.)  This method would have the
advantage that you could allow the user the flexibility of being able to
re-sort the results ad hoc after the search returns, rather than forcing
them to choose a single ordering before the search.

Hope this helps...
