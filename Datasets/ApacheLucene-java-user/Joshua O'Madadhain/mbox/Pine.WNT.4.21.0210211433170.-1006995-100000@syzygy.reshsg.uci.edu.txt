A few questions and comments; please pardon me if I am asking questions
answered in previous email:

(1) Are you using an analyzer that is designed to handle (a) HTML, or
(b) plain text?

(2) If (b), that's probably why you've been getting this kind of behavior,
and you may want to look at the HTMLParser sample code in the
distribution.  The StandardAnalyzer, I'm pretty sure, is not designed to
handle HTML.

(3) A quick and dirty solution for indexing HTML if you are running on
some flavor of Unix and don't want to figure out how to do parse HTML
tags: the text web browser "lynx".  lynx can 'dump' the text from a web
page out as follows:

cat foo.html | lynx -dump -nolist  > foo.txt

This effectively strips the HTML tags out of foo.html and writes the text
of the page to the file foo.txt.

Once you've done this, of course, you can use the same analyzers that you
use for any unformatted text file.

Good luck--
