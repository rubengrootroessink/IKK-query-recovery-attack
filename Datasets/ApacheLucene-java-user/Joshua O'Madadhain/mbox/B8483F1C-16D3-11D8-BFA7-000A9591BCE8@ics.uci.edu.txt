Not sure what you mean by "terms can't cross sentence boundaries".  If 
you're only using single-word terms, that's trivially true.  What is it 
that you're trying to achieve, exactly?  (Your comment makes it sound 
as though you simultaneously want and don't want sentence boundaries, 
so I'm confused.)
