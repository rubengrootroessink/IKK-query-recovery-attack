It's not quite as simple as you're making it sound.  Google's PageRank
algorithm is recursive: the "authority" of a page (a factor in determining
its rank) is determined in part by the authority of the pages that link to
it, and by the authority of the pages that link to each of the pages that
link to it, and so on.

On reflection, I think you're right (although I am not certain that some
other aspect of the algorithm might not require more extensive re-writing;
I'd have to check).  On that basis, I retract my prefix.  :)

If the original poster were interested in exactly replicating Google's
results, though, he's probably out of luck, simply because while PageRank
is a published algorithm, there have been revisions to the Google
architecture that I am reasonably sure have not been published.
