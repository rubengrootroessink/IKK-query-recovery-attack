The easiest way--or, at least, the method I used--is to do your own query
parsing: 

(1) take the input from the user as a String

(2) do whatever analysis or modifications on it that you like
(e.g., breaking it down into words using a StringTokenizer and checking
each word, by your favorite method, for misspellings)

(3) optionally let user review your modifications (return to (1)) 

(4) create a Term from each word from the modified query

(5) create a Query from your collection of Terms

That's the basic idea.  The details will depend on what kind of query you
want to do, and whether you want to allow the user to specify Boolean
modifiers, term boosts, etc.

It may be possible to use the standard QueryParser to parse the query and
then hack the Query that is returned, but I've never tried it.

Good luck--
