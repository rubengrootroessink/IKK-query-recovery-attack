There are a number of contractions in English that could be affected if
you're using the apostrophe as a marker, e.g.: isn't, wouldn't, I'd, he's,
hasn't.  (Granted, these are often considered stop words.)  Thus, I think
that your idea of incorporating this change into a French filter, rather
than modifying Standard filter, is a good idea.
