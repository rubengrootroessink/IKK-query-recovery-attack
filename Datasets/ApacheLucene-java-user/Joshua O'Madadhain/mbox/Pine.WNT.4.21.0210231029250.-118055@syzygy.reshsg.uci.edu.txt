Mr. Toaster (or can I just call you "Stray"? ;> ):

Everything Peter (and Otis) said is true.  

A point of clarification that may forestall future confusion: the "+" and
"-" terms correspond to "required" and "prohibited", respectively, in a
BooleanQuery.  (Calling it a BooleanQuery is a slight misnomer to my way
of thinking, since as Peter implied, the semantics of "-" aren't quite the
same as "NOT", since you can't just search for "NOT foo".)

So to summarize:
* "+": documents *without* this term/phrase are *not* returned
* "-": documents *with* this term/phrase are *not* returned
* default (no flag): documents with this term/phrase get a higher score
  (all other things being equal) than documents which lack it.
* terms/phrases cannot be specified to be both required and prohibited.

Personally I'd stick with "+" and "-" rather than using the Boolean terms,
simply because I seem to recall that there are some constructs involving
Boolean connectives that don't behave quite the way that you might expect.
(Anyone know what happens if you search for "jam OR NOT(toast AND
bread)"?)

Good luck--

Joshua
