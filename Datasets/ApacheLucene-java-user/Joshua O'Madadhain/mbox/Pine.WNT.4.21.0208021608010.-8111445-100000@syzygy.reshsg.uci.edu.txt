If you can boost terms as they are indexed (I can't remember if this is
possible, but you can certainly do so on queries) then that might be a
good way of doing it; it's not so much a matter of changing document
scores (on the back end, with respect to a particular query) as it is of
changing the weighting of terms (on the front end).

I've just glanced through the API and I don't see a way to do term
boosting during indexing, but maybe there's something I've missed.  
Anyone?
