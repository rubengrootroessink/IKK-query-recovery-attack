Hey-
 
I currently have an index with user information...one of the fields that I have in a document
is CurrentJob...I was asked to add in past jobs as well....but the rules are that I can configure
the weighting (mainly boosting) for absolute jobs (that this is a current job or a not current
job) as well as configure boosting for a time basis (user was at job from 2002-2005). 
 
If I add a field called OldJobs and a field called JobDates I can add to the index like so:
 
Job1;Job2;Job3
Date1;Date2;Date3
 
My question is that boosting is done at a field level...using the above approach I won't be
able to boost or negate based off location within field...or could I? Perhaps there is a better
way of doing this?
 
Thanks!
-Joe
