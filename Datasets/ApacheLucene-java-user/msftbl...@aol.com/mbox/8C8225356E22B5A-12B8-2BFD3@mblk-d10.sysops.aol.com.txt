It's no secret that Otis' wonderful Simpy is powered by Lucene. 
 
I'm in the process of building a folksonomy-based application that allows collecting scholarly
objects, annotating and tagging them, and it is leveraging Lucene. It is currently in development,
so nothing worth showing at this point, but hopefully in a few months it'll be presentable.
