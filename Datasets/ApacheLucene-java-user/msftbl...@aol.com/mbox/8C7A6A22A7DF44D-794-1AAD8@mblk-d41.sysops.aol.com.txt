SUBJECT: Webfarm and Index Location
DATE: 24 Oct 2005

Hey-
 
I would like to store my index in one location, and then have all my IIS servers on the farm
call that one index. Basically, I am looking for the best approach here...and any ideas anyone
has...
 
Options:
 
1. Store index on SAN and have each server call that location...seems this is an issue because
on the SAN I can not have more than one shared drive per computer calling it...would need
LUN for each.
 
2. Store index on a shared drive (not on a SAN), and then cluster that box that I store the
index on...will this work? What over-head for a shared drive call?
 
3. Make a webservice call
 
4. Make a remoting call
 
Anything else?
 
Regards!
-Joe
