SUBJECT: Clustering with Lucene
DATE: 17 Oct 2005

Hi All-
 
I have seen an example using carrot2 for clustering, but have not really played with it that
much. Does anyone have a good example of using clustering with Lucene...has anyone attempted
to do it with carrot2 or something else?
 
I was initially going to do a facated search...which would be much simpler, but my taxonomies
are not built yet to go that route...clustering would do that dynamically for me.
 
Any ideas/thoughts would be helpful.
 
Thanks!
-Joe
