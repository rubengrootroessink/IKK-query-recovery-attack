SUBJECT: Caching Results
DATE: 29 Nov 2005

I have some queries that are run numerous times a day..is it better to cache results such that
I would run a filter once and then cache it, and with the Term clause run the query? Is it
better for me to instead look into optimizing my code and query?
 
I am trying to get some thoughts on caching in general with Lucene.
 
Thanks!
