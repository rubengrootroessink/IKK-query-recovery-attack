I saw an article from IBM somewhere, talking about how
you go about giving options to the JVM to use all the
non-reserved memory segments (on AIX which has
segmented memory) and this would allow more than a 2GB
heap.  The point of that statement is that it sounds
like IBM's JVM can do it. I'm not sure if they charge
for their JVM or not...
