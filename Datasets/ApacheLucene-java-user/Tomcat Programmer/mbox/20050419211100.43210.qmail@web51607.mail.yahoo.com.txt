SUBJECT: numDocs method of IndexReader
DATE: 19 Apr 2005

Hello Everyone, 

I need to be able to iterate through the entire set of
documents within the index to perform some auditing. I
originally tried the following code snip:

int ndoc = idxReader.numDocs();
for (int i=0; i< ndoc; i++) {
    Document doc = idxReader.document(i);
    . 
    . 
    .
}

This is working with my initial project here, where
the number of Documents are small. I am concerned when
the indexes grow larger. Since this method returns an
int, does this mean that I am limited by the size of
an integer to the number of documents I can have? 

Also, I wanted to search the archives of this list to
see if anyone had previously answered this question,
but I could not find a site that archives this list.
Can any one point me to such a site? 

Many thanks in advance, 

Tom C.
