SUBJECT: Terms not being found in query
DATE: 4 Feb 2006

hi,

i have an index with documents containing n-grams, in fields such as 
"3gram", "4gram", etc.  one 5-gram found in the text is "oswax".  using 
Luke, i can see that a field with this value exists for a particular 
document.  however, searching for "5gram:oswax" produces no results (either 
using a query constructed by the query parser, or manually).  the n-gram 
fields are indexed and stored, but not tokenised.

i have tried setting maxFieldLength to Integer.MAX_VALUE with no change.

why do i receive no results?

k.
