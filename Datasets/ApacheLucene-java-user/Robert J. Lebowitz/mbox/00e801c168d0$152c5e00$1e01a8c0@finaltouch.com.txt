It all depends on the analyzer and filters that you are using to index your
text.  Look at the archive for this list using my last name (lebowitz).  I
posted the source code for a slightly modified analyzer and filter that
should provide you with an example you can use for your own purposes.  It
was for an AlphaNumericAnalyzer, I believe.  You'd have to provide
additional tests for the characters you have in mind; not just standard
digits and characters.
