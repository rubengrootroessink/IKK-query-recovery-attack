SUBJECT: Re: Java Heap Space -Out Of Memory Error
DATE: 19 Sep 2007


HI testn,
              I used to search now 3 folders of total size 1.5.GB.still it
consumes lot of memory for every search.i used to close all the IndexReader
once i finish the search.i optimize the FIles using Luke.when i set the
IndexSearcher  object as application level object,its not possible to see
the updated records.
could you guide me how to resolve this memory problem.
