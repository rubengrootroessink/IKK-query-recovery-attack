The problem in my pplication are as follows:
                 1.I am not able to see the updated records in my index
store because i instantiate 
IndexReader and IndexSearcher class once that is in the first search.further
searches use the same IndexReaders(5 Directories) and IndexSearcher with
different queries.

                2.My search is very very slow First 2 Directories of size 10
GB each which are having old index records and no update in that remaining 3
Diretories are updated every second.

                3.i am Indexing 20 million records per day so the Index
store gets growing and it makes search very very slower.
 
               4.I am using searcherOne class as the global application
helper class ,with the scope as APPLICATION it consists of one IndexReader
and IndexSearcher get set method which will hold the IndexReader and
IndexSearcher object after the First Search.it is used for all other
searches.

              5.I am using Lucene 2.2.0 version, in a WEB Application which
index 15 fields per document and Index 5 Fieds,store 10 Fields.i am not
using any sort in my query.for a single query upto the maximum it fetches
600 records from the index store(5 direcories)
