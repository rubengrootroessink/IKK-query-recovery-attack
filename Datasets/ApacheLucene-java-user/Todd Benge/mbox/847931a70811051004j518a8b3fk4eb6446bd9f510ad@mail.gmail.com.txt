DATE: 5 Nov 2008

I think it's like this:

Sort sort = new Sort("FIELDNAME", true);
TopFieldDocs docs  = searcher.searcher(query, null, n, sort); // n is
the number of documents you want to retrieve

ScoreDoc[] hits = docs.scoreDocs;
for (int i = 0; i<docs.totalHits; i++ ) {
     Document doc = searcher.doc(hits[i].doc);
}

Hope this helps.

Todd
