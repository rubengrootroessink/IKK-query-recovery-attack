SUBJECT: Payload Question
DATE: 15 Dec 2008

Hi,

I've been reading about payloads because I think we may be able to use
them to solve a problem we're having involving sorts.

>From the API, Payloads are set on Token classes.  During indexing,
Fields are added to Documents so I think I'm missing the connection of
how the payloads are set into the index.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Todd
