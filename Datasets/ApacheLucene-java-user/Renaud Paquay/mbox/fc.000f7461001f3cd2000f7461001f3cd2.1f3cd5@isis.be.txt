SUBJECT: French stemmer problem
DATE: 22 Dec 2006

Hello,

Does anyone know about a modified version of the French Stemmer ?
This one has too many bad results.
For example, if I use the word : "ours" (bear)
The stemmer stemm it into "our".....which doesn't exist in French.
If I have some words like "L'insepecteur" the index process using the
stemmer doesn't work correctly

So the problem is that the results is not accurate

Someone could help ?

Thanks,
