SUBJECT: Get the terms and frequency vector of an indexed but unstored field
DATE: 3 Aug 2007


Hi,

I indexed a large number of large documents, but I did not store the
document themselves, just indexed them.
Now I am interested in getting the vector (i.e.: the terms indexed and the
frequency) of that indexed but unstored field.
doc.getField (fieldname) returns null.
How can I get the data? It must be there, since it's a part of the index, or
am I wrong?

Would be grateful for a quick result (need to submit data for a conference
this weekend).
thanks,
Nir.
