SUBJECT: docFreq takes long time to execute in a multiple index environment
DATE: 5 Aug 2007


Hi there,

I have my 25 indexes of 1.8GB each read with MultiReader.
I try to get the document frequency of all the terms in specific documents
and it takes quite a long time - a document with 1000 terms takes around
4:30 minutes to calculate all the document frequencies of its terms - and
there are longer documents than that.

Since I have quite a lot of documents to process (around 12000) - it'll take
forever.
My function of getting the document frequency is listed below (it's for one
single term - but it's called for all the terms in the document term vector.

    public int getdocumentfrequency (String termstr) throws Exception
    {
        Term term=new Term("contents", termstr);
        TermEnum termenum=multireader.terms(term);
        int freq=termenum.docFreq();
        return freq;
    }

Is there a better (i.e. faster) way to get all the document frequencies of a
specific document?

thanks a lot,
Nir.
