SUBJECT: Complex proximity clauses within Lucene QueryParser
DATE: 5 Aug 2007


Hi,

I got stuck with a complex proximity clause - and would be grateful to get
your help.

Does Lucene allow, and if yes: what is the syntax?

* Proximity between two phrases, for instance a within n1 words from b which
is within n2 words from c?
* subclauses - for instance (a or b) within n words from (b* or c)?
* "a b" within n words from "c d"?

that would help immensely. 

best regards from Amsterdam,
Nir.
