SUBJECT: is OpenBitSet / SortedVIntList compressed bit map index?
DATE: 7 Jan 2011

Hi,

is OpenBitSet / SortedVIntList a compressed bit map index? Which one is
better if memory usage is the primary concern ?

Our filters are sparse. So is SortedVIntList better in that case?

Are there any other compressed bitmap index implementations which offer bit
map compression at a decent performance assuming filters are sparse?

I'd appreciate any help on this.Thanks.
