Hello Adrian,

>> I am indexing some text in a java object that is "%772B" with the
>> standard analyser and Lucene 2.
>>
>> Should I be able to search for this with the same text as the query, or
>> do I need to do any escaping of characters?

Besides Luke there are the AnalyzerUtils from the LIA book, (you can
download the source code examples here:
http://www.lucenebook.com/LuceneInAction.zip

You'll just have to customize the test-class and you'll get an output
like this:


Analzying "%772B"
	org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer:
		[772b]


1: [772b:1->5:<ALPHANUM>]

1: [772b]


 Analzying "%772B"
	org.apache.lucene.analysis.KeywordAnalyzer:
		[%772B]


1: [%772B:0->5:word]

1: [%772B]

hth,
martin
