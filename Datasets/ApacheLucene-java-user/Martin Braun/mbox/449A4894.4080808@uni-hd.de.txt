I think there is also the possibility to write a custom search filter
(org.apache.lucene.search.Filter), and to build a bitset with a special
field providing the information from which dir the file comes from.

But I am wondering which is the better solution according to performance?

Perhaps for privacy reasons? that only specific users should be able to
search the whole index.
Is  there a best practice approach to realize this?

thx,
martin
