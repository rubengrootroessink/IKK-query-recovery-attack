SUBJECT: Where to find drill-down examples (source code)
DATE: 21 Jul 2006

Hello all,

I want to realize a drill-down Function aka "narrow search" aka "refine
search".

I want to have something like:

Refine by Date:
* 1990-2000 (30 Docs)
* 2001-2003 (200 Docs)
* 2004-2006 (10 Docs)

But not only DateRanges but also for other Categories.

What I have found in the List-Archives so far is that I have to  use
Filters for my search.

Does anybody knows where to find some Source Code, to get an Idea how to
implement this?
 I think that's a useful property for a search engine, so are there any
contributions for Lucene for that?

thanks,
martin
