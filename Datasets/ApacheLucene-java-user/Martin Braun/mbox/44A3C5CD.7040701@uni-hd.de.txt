How can I use Lucene to index a database?

Connect to the database using JDBC and use an SQL "SELECT" statement to
query the database. Then create one Lucene Document object per row and
add it to the index. You will probably want to store the ID column so
you can later access the matching items. For other (text) columns it
might make more sense to only index (not store) them, as the original
data is still available in your database.
