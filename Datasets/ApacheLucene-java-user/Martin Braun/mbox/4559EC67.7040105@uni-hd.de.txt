Hi Erik,

> SpanFirstQuery is what you're after.

thanks for this hint (@Erick: thanks for the good explanation of my prob),

I read the chapter for the spanfirstquery in LIA, but what I don't
understand is, how do i have to do a "Phrase" SpanFirstQuery?
I found a message with example code (
http://www.nabble.com/Speedup-indexing-process-tf1140025.html#a3034612 ):

here's my jruby snippet:

   SpanFirstQuery = org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanFirstQuery
   SpanTermQuery = org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanTermQuery
   Term = org.apache.lucene.index.Term

   sp = SpanFirstQuery.new(SpanTermQuery.new(Term.new("TI",search)),2)
   hits = searcher.search(sp)
   for i in 0...hits.length
      puts hits.doc(i).getField("kurz")
   end

I get no results for "action and" (there are some docs with beginning
with "action and" in the title) but i get (correct) results for "action",
What am I doing wrong here?

tia,
martin
