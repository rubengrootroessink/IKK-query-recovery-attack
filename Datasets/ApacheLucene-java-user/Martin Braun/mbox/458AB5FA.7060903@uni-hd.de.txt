SUBJECT: spnafirstquery and multiple field instances
DATE: 21 Dec 2006

hello,

with a SpanFirstQuery I want to realize a "starts with" search -
that seems to work fine. But I have the Problem that I have documents
with multiple titles and I thought I can do a sfq-search for each tiltle
   by adding multiple instances for the specific field:

			for (String key : title.getTitel().split("\\n")  ) {			
				titleDocument.add(new Field("TI", key, Field.Store.NO,
					Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
			}

but that didn't work. The query finds only matches for the first token
in that field of a document.

Is there a way to do a SpanFirstQuery for each token?

tia,
martin
