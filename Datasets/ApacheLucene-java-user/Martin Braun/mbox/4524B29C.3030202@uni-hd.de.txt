Hello Rajiv,

perhaps captcha's will solve your problem:

many open-source PHP products are using this like phpmyfaq and phpBB.
So you can take a look at this code.

hth,

Betreff: Spam filter for lucene project
An: java-user@lucene.apache.org

Hello, I'm currently running a site which allows users to post. Lately posts
have been getting out of hand. I was wondering if anyone knows of an open
source spam filter that I can add to my project to scan the posts (which are
just plain text)  for spam?

thanks in advance.
Rajiv
