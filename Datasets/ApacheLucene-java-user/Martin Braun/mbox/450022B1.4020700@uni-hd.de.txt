SUBJECT: best way indexing user queries
DATE: 7 Sep 2006

Hello,

I would like to index the user submitted queries to a given index. As a
result of this I want to provide something like: people who searched for
test searched also with these queries: +title:test +author:somename.

I think the simple approach of just adding the queries as a string in a
document, would cause many redundancies, e.g. thousands of docs with
test in it.

Does anybody have programmed something similar, or is it just not a
reasonable idea?

thanks,
martin
