Yes that is exactly the problem. The problem is even worse when
searching with multiple words, because the corrected query has often no
results.  Another part of the problem are that there are some (many ?)
typos in the search_index.

That's really impressive (though I didn't understand what you mean with
"beams").

Did I unterstand the  license term correctly, that I could use Lingpipe
for free when I am building a Search Engine for a Academic Website (for
free use)?
