Hi Breck,

i have tried your tutorial and built (hopefully) a successful
SpellCheck.model File with
49M.
My Lucene Index directory is 2,4G. When I try to read the Model with the
readmodel function,
i get an "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java
heap space", though I started java with -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m.

How many RAM will I need for the Model (I only have 2 GB of physical
RAM, and lucene's also using some memory).

Is there a "rule of thumb" to calculate the needed amount of memory of
the model?

thanks in advance,

martin
