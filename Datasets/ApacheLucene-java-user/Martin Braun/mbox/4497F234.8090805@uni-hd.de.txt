SUBJECT: Indexing Dash concatenated words vs SynonymAnalyzer
DATE: 20 Jun 2006

Hello all,


german words are often dash-concatenated, e.g. West-Berlin or something
like "C*-algebras and W*-algebras".

I tend to write my own analyzer like the SynonymAnalyzer from the
LIA-Book. I want to Index these words like this:

West-Berlin => Westberlin | West | Berlin | "West Berlin"
C*-algebras => c| algebra | calgebra

The difference to the SynonymAnalyzer will be that one word will be
separated in to two words. So that it is not a Synonym like  quick <=>
fast, but something like quick <=> "lightning fast".

Is it possible to get two words as a synonym at the same increment
position during indexing? What will happen with a phrase search?

Does anybody know existing approaches for this?

thanks in advance,

Martin
