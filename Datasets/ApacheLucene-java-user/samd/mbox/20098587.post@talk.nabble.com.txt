SUBJECT: Re: QueryParser returning TermQuery instead of PhraseQuery?
DATE: 21 Oct 2008


I'm using Hibernate Search and now looking I think it is more related to
this. Hibernate Search indexing and parsing is based on Lucene but it is
tied to the entities unless you use projections.

I guess I'll need to go down this road for now.

Thanks
