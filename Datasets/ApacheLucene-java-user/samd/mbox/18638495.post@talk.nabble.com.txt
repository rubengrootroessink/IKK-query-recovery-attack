SUBJECT: Re: Luke shows in top terms but no search results??
DATE: 24 Jul 2008


Indexing is done via Hibernate Search, the search I'm doing I have done in
Luke and it returns nothing. I select the field from the drop down. I type
the text which matches the top term value. No results.

Now, this isn't all fields only some fields.
