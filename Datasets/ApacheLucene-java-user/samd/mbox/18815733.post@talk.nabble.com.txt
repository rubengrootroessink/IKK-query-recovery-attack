SUBJECT: Range search between two different fields.
DATE: 4 Aug 2008


I have a search which needs to find dates which are specified in two
different fields. 

For an example:

I have a Java object with a date field that starts the time something
started and another that specifies the time that something ended.

I need to do a date search that the range is specified between the start and
the end.

Thanks
