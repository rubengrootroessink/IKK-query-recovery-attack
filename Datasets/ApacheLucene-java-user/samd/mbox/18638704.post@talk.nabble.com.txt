Yes that did it and thanks. The examples I have seen have shown cases where
you can specify values which aren't tokenized but yet do a search against
it. Such cases were for something where the name was unique as it is in this
case.

Now as I said before some fields have found matches which were not tokenized
and some did not. I guess I really need to understand more about Lucene but
for the time being I can work with this.

Thank you for your help.
