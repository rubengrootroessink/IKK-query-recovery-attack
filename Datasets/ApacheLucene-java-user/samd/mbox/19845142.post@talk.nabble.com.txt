SUBJECT: Field names with : in it.
DATE: 6 Oct 2008


It appears if a search field value entered contains a ':' causes some issues
since if I have a field named

a.b.c and the user enters a value of foo the constructed query through the
api generates something like
+a.b.c:foo

If they enter in a value of foo:bar

I get +foo:bar where foo is substituted for the correct fieldname.

What is the best way to deal with this?

Thanks.
