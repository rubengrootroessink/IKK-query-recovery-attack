SUBJECT: Alphanumeric Search Problem
DATE: 13 May 2009


Hi,

I'm encountering an issue where expected search results are not being found
as in the following example

I have two values
name-test-1234
name-1234-test

When a search for 'name' is done only the first result is found.
If I had a wildcard to the search i.e. name* both will be found.

I would suspect that I should not have to enter the wildcard in this case.

In addition if a field contains a single alphanumeric term such as abc123
then search for abc does not find a match without the wildcard as well.

Thanks
