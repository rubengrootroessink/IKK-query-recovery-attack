SUBJECT: QueryParser returning TermQuery instead of PhraseQuery?
DATE: 21 Oct 2008


I have field for example say "foo" I need to match exactly foo but there is
also another field for exampled called "foo1"

What I want is a PhraseQuery so I surround foo with quotes before it gets
passed to the QueryParser.parse method. However I get back a TermQuery and
the values that match foo1 end up being returned in the results but I need
an exact match on foo.

Why am I getting back a Term instead of Phrase query? I'm using the English
SnowballAnalyzer. 

What can I do to get the PhraseQuery? I'm relying on the parse method to
return the appropriate query. And I'm doing the string manipulation prior to
the parse call.

I don't want to have to have a special case for PhraseQuery where I need to
bypass the parse method and manually construct this. Besides I'm not even
sure if that will work.

Thanks.
