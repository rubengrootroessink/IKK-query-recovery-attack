SUBJECT: Getting values with low scores
DATE: 27 Apr 2009


I have 2500 documents and need to have a matches with the very lowest rank
returned
How can I get this? It is very important.

When I look at the index in look I see the fields with my values but they
all have low rank.
When I search they don't show in the results.
