Hi everyone,

I am doing a project using Lucene where i need to index HTML files. I am
using Tika to parse HTML files. But i need to index files according to their
tags which means that every text present in different HTML tag (like <p>
<a>) should be stored in different fields. Can i do that. If yes how? Also
can i assign different weightage to the tokens present in different fields.
If yes how?
