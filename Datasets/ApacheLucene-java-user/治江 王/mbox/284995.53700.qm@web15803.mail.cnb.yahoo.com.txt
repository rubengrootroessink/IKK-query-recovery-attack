SUBJECT: the efficiency of creating indexes
DATE: 16 Feb 2009

As i know, the time effciency of creating index is non-linearity with the size of documents.
For example, if the size of indexes is 1G, the time cost is 2 hours, If the size of indexes
is 10G, the time cost may be 30 hours. Who can tell me what is the reason? Any tips will be
appreciated.
