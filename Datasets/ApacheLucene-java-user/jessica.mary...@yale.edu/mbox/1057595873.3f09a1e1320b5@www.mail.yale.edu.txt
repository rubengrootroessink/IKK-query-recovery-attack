SUBJECT: Postgres and lucene
DATE: 7 Jul 2003

Hi, 
  I'm new to lucene and I have had a lot of trouble finding 
information 
on how exactly to use lucene to search a postgres database. I've 
searched the archives for this list, but found nothing specific enough 
to help me. Has anyone used Lucene to search a postgres database who 
could help? 

Thanks, 
   Jessica
