I'm having some trouble getting lucene working for anything other than
the included demo. Both demos worked just fine, but when I try to do
anything new (or if I change the name of one of the demo files
[IndexFiles.java to IndexFile.java] I get a Exception in thread "main"
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/lucene/demo/IndexFile) I
assume I'm missing something small but quite fundamental about how
lucene works; can anyone tell em what it is?
 Thanks,
   Jessica
