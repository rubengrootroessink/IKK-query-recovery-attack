Jian,

I disagree that the Google Mini is useless.  $5000 is quite inexpensive
for a commercial search engine.  I know of search engines where the cost
is practically 20 cents per document.  Heck, a decent server capable of
running a heavily loaded search engine costs $3000.  Also, don't forget
you get two years of hardware replacements in case of failure and
software updates for that $5000.

Lucene is a great concept, a great effort, and a great indexer.  But it
doesn't have a built-in spider; you need to provide that or use add-on
code or a system like Nutch which, according to
http://www.nutch.org/docs/en/developers.html, only parses HTML.  You
can't process PDFs, MS Office-type docs, and others without still more
code.  At this point, for a small company, probably with an over-worked
IT staff, Lucene would be just too time consuming to use.

The other thing to consider is the use of the search engine.  Is it for
a company's public website?  Is it to index every document that the
company produces?  Will it index databases?  Email?  Lotus Notes apps?
For a simple website search engine, Google Mini and other appliances are
hard to beat.  The 50,000 document limit:  50,000 documents is a lot for
a small company website.

Cheers,

bill

Overall, even if google mini gives a lot of cool features compared to a
bare-born lucene project, what is good with the 50,000 documents limit.
It is useless with that limit. That is just their way of trying to turn
it into another cash cow.
