The expected behavior is to sometimes treat a character as indicating a new
token and other times to ignore the same character?

This sounds like behavior that should be much better documented than it
currently is.

Why would this be the default? What cases is it meant for?

That's StandardAnalyzer's expeceted behaviour.  If you want
tokenization to occur only on white spaces, use WhitespaceAnalyzer.  If
you want custom behaviour, you should write an Analyzer (there should
be a FAQ entry with an example).
