SUBJECT: Performance of DbDirectory
DATE: 13 Jun 2007

I recently had a thought to do with DbDirectory - specifically would it 
be possible to use something like Oracle's inbuilt replication to have 
mutiple Reader machine being able to read the index with automatic 
partitioning, redundancy and failover?

Also, what is performance like for DbDirectory compared to FSDirectory?

And would using DbDirectory and Oracle's backup tools allow for 
snapshots of the index to be taken without having to close the 
IndexWriter and take a physical copy of the index or will that still 
leave unmerged segment files around which will be in an inconsistent 
state at restart (unless Oracle takes an instantaneous snapshot of the 
whole index I suppose).

Is this a completely loopy idea or mildly sensible?

Thanks,
Simon
