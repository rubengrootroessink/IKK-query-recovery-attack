This is currently what I'm doing using a list of previous performed 
queries in combination with something similar to Aviran's suggestion of 
partitioning by date and only opening when the index changes.

At the moment search is sufficently speedy that this works but in the 
future I think the definition of 'immediate' may well get relaxed. 

Thanks for all the suggestions - it's nice to know I wasn't completely 
off track and/or missing something obvious.

Simon
