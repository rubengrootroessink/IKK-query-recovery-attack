Yup.

I vaguely remember seeing something about that going past. 

Is there any documentation on custom deletion policies? Or example code 
for such a beast? At the moment at any given point we have to have disk 
space to allow for 3x Index size - index, backup we've just taken and 
previous backup we're just about to delete. Since our indexes are large 
even 2x is quite an issue.

I've read through JIRA LUCENE-710 but a more point-and-drool explanation 
would be useful to someone who hasn't been up all night :)

Simon
