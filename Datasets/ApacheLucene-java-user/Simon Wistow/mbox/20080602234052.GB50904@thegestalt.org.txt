SUBJECT: Typical Indexing performance
DATE: 2 Jun 2008

I know this is one of those "How long is a piece of string?" questions 
but I'm curious as to the order of magnitude of indexing performance.

http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/benchmarks.html

seems to indicate about 100-120 docs/s is pretty good for average sized 
documents (say, an email or something) or is that ludicrously out of 
date for 2.3.x ?

Simon
