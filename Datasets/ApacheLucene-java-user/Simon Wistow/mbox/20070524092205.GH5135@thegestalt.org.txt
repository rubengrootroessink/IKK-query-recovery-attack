SUBJECT: Searching on a Rapidly changing Index
DATE: 24 May 2007

I've built a Lucene system that gets rapidly updated - documents are 
supposed to be searchable immeidately after they've been indexed.

As such I have a Writer that puts new index, update and delete tasks 
into a queue and then has a thread which consumes them and applies them 
to the index using one instance of an IndexModifier. So far so good.

However every new Search opens up a new IndexSearcher in order to make 
sure that it gets new documents. The docs indicate is a big 
performance penalty. 

Are there any tips or tricks I can use to mitigate this?

thanks,

Simon
