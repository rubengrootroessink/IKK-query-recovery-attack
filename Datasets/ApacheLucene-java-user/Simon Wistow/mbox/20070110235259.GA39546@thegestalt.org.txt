I've been reading through the spelling correction API and I'm confused. 
It looks like you tell it the directory to hold the spelling correction 
DB and then give it an IndexReader and a field to retrieve spelling 
suggestions from.

But then I'd have to redo that operation everytime a new document was 
indexed. There didn't seem to be any apparent way to incrementally add 
new documents without creating my own dictionary by splitting up words 
from the incoming document.

Is that the only way?

Simon
