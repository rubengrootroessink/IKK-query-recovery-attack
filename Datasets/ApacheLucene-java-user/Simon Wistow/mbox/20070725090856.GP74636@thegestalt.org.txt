SUBJECT: Recovering from a Crash
DATE: 25 Jul 2007

We were affected by the great SF outage yesterday and apparently the 
indexing machine crashed without being shutdown properly.

I've taken a backup of the indexes which has the usual smattering of 
write.lock segments.gen, .cfs, .fdt, .fnm and .fdx etc files and looks 
to be about the right size.

However, if I start up my indexer with that directory it shrinks to a 
fraction of its size (500 times smaller) and (obviously) contains 
virtually no documents.

The data appears to be there - please tell me that I'm doing something 
stupid and I can recover from this.

Simon
