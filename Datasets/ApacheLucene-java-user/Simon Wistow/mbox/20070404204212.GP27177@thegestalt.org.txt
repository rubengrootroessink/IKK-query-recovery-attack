SUBJECT: Better parsing of Queries
DATE: 4 Apr 2007

I'm looking for some advice on dealing with malformed queries.

If a user searches for "yow!" then I get an exception from the query 
parser. I can get round this by using QueryParser.escape(query) first 
but then that prevents them from searching using other bits of the the 
query syntax such as "author:alice".

Is there an easy way to get a query such as 

    "yow! author:alice"

and get back

    "yow\! author:alice"

i.e only escape the special characters when they don't make sense?

Simon
