I'm also building a large scale (billions of documents) Lucene index. 

Prelimary experimentation with a RemoteSearch/ParallelMultiSearcher 
combination found that there were issues with the RMI causing 
significant blocking. 

I'm currently playing around with trying alternative messaging 
approaches so that I can also load balance requests.

One of the things I haven't decided on is the optimum size for the sub 
indexes. Does anybody have any data on the overhead of file handle opens 
to index searching size or have anecodatal evidence of similar 
experiences?

Simon
