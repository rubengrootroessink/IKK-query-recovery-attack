SUBJECT: FSDirectory source code mistake!
DATE: 10 Jul 2011

Greeting,
There's a mistake in writing the type of the class FSDirectory in the core
of Lucene 3.3. This class is defined as an abstract one while No abstract
method is found inside. Also it yields some other problems like not being
able to create an instance of FSDirectory in the code.
Please answer me as soon as possible !!

regards
