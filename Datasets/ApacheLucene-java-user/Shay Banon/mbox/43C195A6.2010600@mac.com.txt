SUBJECT: Compass Framework 0.8 + Jdbc Lucene Directory
DATE: 8 Jan 2006

We are pleased to announce the 0.8.0 release of Compass Framework - A 
Java Search Engine Framework based on Lucene.

Major feature of this release is the ability to store Lucene index 
within a database. The feature has two parts: A complete Lucene Jdbc 
Directory implementation which is separated from any Compass related 
code (currently part of the compass-core module and jar), allowing using 
it in pure Lucene implementations. The Lucene Jdbc Directory comes with 
documentation as an Appendix in Compass documentation 
(http://static.compassframework.org/docs/latest/jdbcdirectory.html). The 
second part is the integration of Jdbc Directory with Compass Framework, 
allowing existing compass code to work as is, requiring changes to 
configuration settings only. The integration includes several Data 
Source Providers (Dbcp, c3p0, Jndi, and more), and special automatic 
performance improvements.


Cheers,
Shay
