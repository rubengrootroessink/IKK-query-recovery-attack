Hi,

   Just wanted to announce the release of a new open source project called
ElasticSearch (http://www.elasticsearch.com/). Its an open source (Apache
2), distributed, search engine built on top of Lucene. There are many
features for ElasticSearch, you can find them here:
http://www.elasticsearch.com/products/elasticsearch/.

   Thanks to all of keep investing in Lucene, and to all Lucene users. I
hope some will find it useful.

Cheers,
Shay
