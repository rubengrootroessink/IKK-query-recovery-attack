SUBJECT: Compass 0.5 Released
DATE: 4 Aug 2005

We are please to announce the 0.5 major feature release of Compass 
Object/Search Engine Mapping (OSEM) framework. This release makes 
integrating search capability with existing development frameworks (like 
Hibernate and Spring) even simpler. Compass uses declarative mapping 
technology, which means you: Write less code, find data faster.
 
Changes includes: GPS (extendable datasource integration) device 
technology for Hibernate 2/3, JDO, OJB and JDBC. Improved integration 
with Spring framework for configuration, MVC and ORM support.
 
Compass core changes includes, improved performance of reader/searcher 
and Optimizers, support for binary data indexing, cyclic references and 
extending the mapping capabilities. Plus many more features. It will 
change the way you search application data.

We consider Lucene developers and users as the prime source for 
information and feedback. So have a look at Compass, which provides a 
lot of enhancements on top of Lucene, and give us some feedback, so we 
can do better.
