SUBJECT: Re: JDBC proxy implementing Lucene?
DATE: 9 Aug 2005

Hi,

    That is exactly the path I took with Compass and Hibernate. Compass 
integrates with Hibernate events (update/delete/create) and syncs the 
search engine using it. I had problems with Hibernate 2 interceptors 
(external id is null, and other stuff) so it currently works only with 
Hibernate events. The nice thing about Compass, is that once the 
application works on the Object level for the search as well (OSEM), 
than it becomes very simple to do it. Compass simply registers with 
Hibernate events, and persist to the search engine any changes made to 
objects that have both ORM (obviously) and OSEM definitions.

    One can than extend the notion of intercepting and actually define a 
generic Aspect (AOP) for search engine syncs. Which can be applied to 
any application, as long as it has OSEM - Object to Search Engine 
mappings (or any other type of mappings), since you must have some kind 
of knowledge how to combine the two.
