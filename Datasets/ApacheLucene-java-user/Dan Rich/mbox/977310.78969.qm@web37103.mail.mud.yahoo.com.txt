SUBJECT: Scorer skipTo() expectations?
DATE: 4 Oct 2007

Hi, 

I have a custom Query class that provides a long list of lucene docIds (not for filtering
purposes), which is one clause in a standard BooleanQuery (which also contains TermQuery instances).

I have a custom Scorer that goes along with the custom Query class. 

What (if any) document ordering requirements does the Scorer class have for its skipTo(int
docId) method?

In particular, currently I'm sorting/returning the docIds in ascending order from my custom
Query class. That can be expensive for large docId lists; is sorting necessary? It looks like
skipTo() might expect the documents it gets to be in ascending order to behave correctly as
part of a BooleanQuery, but I can't tell for sure from the doc.

If the document list from my custom Scorer class does not have its document list in ascending
order (e.g. 10, 80, 40, 60, 50) will whatever uses skipTo() potentially lose hits? If not,
is there any performance concern with having the docIds unordered?
