SUBJECT: Text storing design and performance question
DATE: 10 Jan 2007


I'm running into a little dilemma with Lucene highlighting and indexing.  I
currently index anything and everything that gets inserted into a database. 
This database includes all the content that is searched.  Now I'll have lots
and lots of content, thinking of the range of 50GB+, all stored in the DB. 
Using Lucene, I index all of this.  But since I'm using highlighting
features, I'll also need to store the content into the index.  Not sure what
the performance implications are during a search but I know that indexing
performance should be slower as well as the index size being enormous. 
Because I have duplicated data, one in the index and the other in the db,
are there other ways of handling this situation in a more efficient and
performant way?  Thanks in advance.
