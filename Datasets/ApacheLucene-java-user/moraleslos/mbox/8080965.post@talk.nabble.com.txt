SUBJECT: newbie lucene indexing/search question
DATE: 28 Dec 2006


I currently have a book containing content that is stored in the database by
paragraph. For example, a book contains content with 5 paragraphs. Therefore
each paragraph is stored as a distinct record in a database. In the object
domain, I have a Book object which holds a java.util.List of Paragraph
objects. In the relational world, this would be a One-to-Many for
book-paragraph.

Now, if I search for specific words against the Book's contents, will it
retrieve all of the paragraphs, combine them and then do the search, or will
it only search on a paragraph? For example, a "Guitar" book contains two
paragraphs like this:

paragraph 1: This is the first paragraph for learn
paragraph 2: guitar and other musical instruments.

Therefore there will be a record in the Book table linked with two records
in the Paragraph table. Now say I index the book and paragraph fields as is
and then have a lucene query that looks like this: [book:Guitar
paragraph:"learn guitar"]. Will this query return a hit?

Thanks in advance!
