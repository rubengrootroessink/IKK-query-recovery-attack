SUBJECT: Highlighting issues
DATE: 27 Feb 2007


In my search query I have two fields to search, a metadata field and the
actual contents. The metadata field is just an enum containing FIRST and
LAST. Here is an example search query:

Content:"Barry Bonds" and Metadata:FIRST


I have Lucene highlight the hits like this:

...
getBestFragment(standardAnalyzer, "Content", content);
...


Now I would only expect the highlighted text to show the key words Barry
Bonds but instead some of the highlighted text I get back actually
highlights the enum FIRST. For example, one highlighted result is this:
********************************************
...attempting to slide into <p>first</p> base...
********************************************

The above result is not what I had in mind. Any ideas on why the highlighter
is highlighting my enum field and not only my keywords from the content
field? Thanks in advance!
