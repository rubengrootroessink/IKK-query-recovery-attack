SUBJECT: Re: sorting issue with un-tokenized field
DATE: 17 Jan 2007


Oops, accidently pressed the ENTER key before doing anything  ;-)

I have a field called "bookTitle" that I specified as UN_TOKENIZED and
STORED in the index (i.e. keyword).  However, when I do a sort on this field
during a search I get this error:

Exception occurred during search: java.lang.RuntimeException: there are more
terms than documents in field "bookTitles", but it's impossible to sort on
tokenized fields 

My gut feeling on this is that some of my "bookTitles" are long, e.g. > 10
words, although I'm not sure if this is the cause.  Again I don't tokenized
this when storing in the index.  Any suggestions on how to sort this field
(which is just a String field) w/o running into this RuntimeException? 
Thanks in advance!
