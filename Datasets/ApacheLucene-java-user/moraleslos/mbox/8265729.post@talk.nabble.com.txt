SUBJECT: sort on a searchable field
DATE: 10 Jan 2007


>From what I understand about Lucene, one can only sort on a field that is
indexed but not tokenized (and hence not searchable).  I have content that
can be searched by keyword and also a date string, e.g. text:Lucene AND
date:[2007-01-01 TO 2007-01-10]

Since my date is searchable, I need to index + tokenize it.  I would like to
somehow return the hits sorted by date.  Is there a workaround for this
using Lucene?  Thanks in advance!
