Hi Grant!

Thanks for the reply.  I'll look into the links you suggested.  Just curious
though, what did you do to implement this--if you can spill some of the
beans  ;-)  You think what you did was better than the FuzzyQuery approach? 
Was it a custom algorithm or did you utilize some framework for this?  I
basically don't want to reinvent the wheel when doing this name matching
issue.  Thanks in advance!
