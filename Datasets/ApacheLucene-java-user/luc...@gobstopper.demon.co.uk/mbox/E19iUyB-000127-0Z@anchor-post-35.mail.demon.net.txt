SUBJECT: RE: NLucene up to date ?
DATE: 1 Aug 2003

No additional classes have been created.
The functionality was simply implemented via new properties and method overloading, so original
signatures remain intact.

As far as supporting future versions, I cannot say as I will no longer be using it at work.
 Keeping the c# version in line with java would have to be done in my own time, so no guarantees.

Taking the 1.2b2 source I only brought in the fixes, enhancements, etc that affected how I
was using Lucene.  I keep up with the nightly builds on a regular basis and update the c#
source where appropriate, so any bugs should have been rectified.
