SUBJECT: RE: NLucene up to date ? Lucene.Net is up to date.
DATE: 4 Aug 2003

Excellent news.

Will you be keeping the source up to date with the java developments ?
Can't wait to get my hands on the source, yes that damn bit shift operator (unsigned ?) always
worried me =)

Just by the way, would the .NET version have a similar style sandbox area where users can
submit small add-on type functionality ?
For example, field sorting.
Would love to share the code for use and comment as this seems to be a common request.

Big thanks Pasha,
Brendon
