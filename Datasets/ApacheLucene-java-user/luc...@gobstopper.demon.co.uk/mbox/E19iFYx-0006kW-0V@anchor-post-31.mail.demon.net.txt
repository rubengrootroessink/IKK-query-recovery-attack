Yes and no, explanation will help me explain.

The field ordering functionality required additional files to be created at index time if
the Document.Field property indicates so.
At search time, the entire contents of the 'field sorting' files are read in.  As the IndexReader
is shared for all client calls (for a pre-defined period of time as the index has been implemented
'incremental' style) this cost is only incurred once.

Code-wise, the technique follows the pattern for the Normalisation byte writing and reading,
the difference being an Int being written.  Yes, there is a memory usage hit, but the performance
and functionality offered offsets this.

All other file formats remain identical.
I have coded LuceNET (!) so that it gracefully continues if the index segments do not have
these additional 'sorting' files (naming convention like the normalisation files).

Performance wise, queries typically run in hundreths of seconds.
Including term position in the scoring impacted the timings as expected.

Indexing takes time, but then this wasn't really part of the design goals.

As far as comparing to the java implementation in terms in performance, I haven't tried as
this workplace is a MS shop.

Java vs c# all over ?  Just kidding =)
