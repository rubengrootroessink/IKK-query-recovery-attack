SUBJECT: RE: how Boolean query work internally  in lucene
DATE: 1 Jul 2006

Hi All,

I just want to know how the lucene processes the Boolean query internally??

As per my knowledge:

   if I search for "java apache".
   Note: let consider i want documents that contents both words and i
constructed boolean query for that (i.e. +java +apache).

   Please let me clear if i wrong how lucene process this query?
   First it search for all document for java then for apache and after that
it take the intersection of these to sets. is it?
   if so where i want to know where lucene take the intersection and how
process the query??


 I would appreciate any response.

  Thanks in advance.

Thanks and Regards,
Amit
