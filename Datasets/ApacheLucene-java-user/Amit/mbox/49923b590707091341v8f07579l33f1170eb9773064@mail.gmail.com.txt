SUBJECT: Cannot get Field.Text to work
DATE: 9 Jul 2007

Hi

I am new to Lucene and trying out the example code. But when I try to insert
values using Field.Text the compiler does not recognize the Text as a method
of Field. The code looks like this

contactDocument.add(Field.Text("name", contact.getName()));

I wanted to know if the version 2.2 does not have this method anymore, or do
I have to access it in another way.
Any help appreciated.


Regards,

Amit
