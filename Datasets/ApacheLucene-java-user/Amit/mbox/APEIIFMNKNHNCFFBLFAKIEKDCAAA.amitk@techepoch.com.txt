This is a PhraseQuery internally in Lucene.

It's a mix of determining the documents per term and merging.
It works in the order of the internal document number, (which is the order
of addition to the index, ) for both sets of documents.
To determine the next matching document each set of documents
advances to the document number at or after the current document of the
other set, until both sets have the same document number.

The intersection is taken in ConjunctionScorer and the sets are
represented by a TermScorer, both viewable in this package:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/se
arch/
Advancing to a document number at or after a given document number
is done in the skipTo() methods.
