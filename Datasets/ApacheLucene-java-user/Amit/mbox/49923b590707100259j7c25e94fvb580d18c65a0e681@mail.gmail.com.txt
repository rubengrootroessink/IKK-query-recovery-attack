Hi Otis,

Thanks for the reply. I didn't know that as all the examples on Lucene still
use the old approach.
I had a look at the API  and it does not seem to provide any new methods as
a substitute for Field.Text.
Can you give a small example just how to add name-value pair to the
document.
Thanks

Amit
