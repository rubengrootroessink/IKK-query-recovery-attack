DATE: 25 Oct 2007


hi,

Can anyone of you guide me, how to index into an already indexed folder.
Right now, I am deleting the indexed info and running the indexer again. I
dont want to do that. I want a method, how to append into the same folder
when new files are indexed. 

Is it possible? I couldn't find any solution for it.
