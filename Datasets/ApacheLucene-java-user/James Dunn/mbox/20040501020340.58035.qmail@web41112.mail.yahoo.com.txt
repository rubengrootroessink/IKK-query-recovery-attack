SUBJECT: Re: Preventing duplicate document insertion during optimize
DATE: 1 May 2004

Kevin,

I have a similar issue.  The only solution I have been
able to come up with is, after the merge, to open an
IndexReader against the merge index, iterate over all
the docs and delete duplicate docs based on my
"primary key" field.
