Which version of lucene are you using?  In 1.2, I
believe the lock file was located in the index
directory itself.  In 1.3, it's in your system's tmp
folder.  

Perhaps it's a permission problem on either one of
those folders.  Maybe your process doesn't have write
access to the correct folder and is thus unable to
create the lock file?  

You can also pass lucene a system property to increase
the lock timeout interval, like so:

-Dorg.apache.lucene.commitLockTimeout=60000

or 

-Dorg.apache.lucene.writeLockTimeout=60000

The above sets the timeout to one minute.

Hope this helps,

Jim
