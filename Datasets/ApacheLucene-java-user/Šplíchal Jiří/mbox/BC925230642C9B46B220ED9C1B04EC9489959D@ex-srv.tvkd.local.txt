SUBJECT: Constant score queries
DATE: 6 Aug 2010

Hello,

 

I am working with ConstantScoreQuery and ConstantScoreRangeQuery. Both shoud according to
the description

return the value of their boost as score for all matching documents.

However I always get the score 1.0 and also in the TestConstantScoreRangeQuery. testBoost()
method,

the boost is set to 100, but the test checks that the score is 1.0f.

 

So how should the constant score queries work in real? 

Thank you
