Hello,

just one more question in order to understand how the score is computed:
Boost factor of queries is applied only for sub-queries? So if I change the 
boost factor of any TopLevel query, the score will remain unchanged?

The score will be 1.0 even if the boost isn't, when you use
ConstantScore*Query as the sole top-level query.

The boost only impacts how much weight is associated with this query's
matches when it's a sub-query mixed in with other sub-queries.

EG if you make a BooleanQuery, and add ConstantScoreQuery as a SHOULD
clause, and then add something else, eg TermQuery, then if you change
the boost of the ConstantScoreQuery you should see that impact which
docs/scores are returned.
