Hello,

I'm a newbie to Lucene and before starting playing with it I would like 
to know whether it fits to my application.

I have a collection of XML documented demarcated with respect to a 
stable XML schema (WSDL definitions).

I wonder whether Lucene:

(1) provides full-text search over content of XML elements ?

(2) provides substring search over values of attributes of XML elements ?

(3) scores relevance of matching XML documents ?

(4) allows to identify (in matching document) XML elements with matched 
query terms and than navigate to parental/children nodes in XML 
?structure ?

(5) provides a way to give more weight to some XML element types during 
relevance scoring ?


Best regards,
Maciej Gawinecki
