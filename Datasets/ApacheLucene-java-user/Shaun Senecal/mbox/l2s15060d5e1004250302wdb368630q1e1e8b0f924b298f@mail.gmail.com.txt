SUBJECT: merge results from physically separate hosts
DATE: 25 Apr 2010

Is there currently a way to take a query, run it on multiple hosts
containing different indexes, then merge the results from each host to
present to the user?  It looks like Solr can handle multiple hosts
supporting the same index, but my case requires each index to be
different.
