DATE: 24 May 2010

When a field is lazy loaded, the actual value is not retrieved from
the server until it is rendered by the UI.  This is the same behaviour
as the LiveView that ExtGWT currently supports.  The difference is
that once a value has been retrieved once, LazyLoad will not fetch
that value from the server again.  LiveView will request the same
values over and over again as the user scrolls up and down.
