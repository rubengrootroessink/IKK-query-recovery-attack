Hi all,
Sorry for bothering again,

I am referring Lucene Documentation at
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html 
that suggests 
>> If you are programmatically generating a query string and then
parsing it with the query parser then you >>should seriously consider
building your queries directly with the query API. In other words, the
query parser >>is designed for human-entered text, not for
program-generated text.

Is there any sample implementation of Lucene Implementation of
BooleanQuery using API instead of QueryParser?



Cheers
Aamir Yaseen

Hi,

I am new to Lucene, so asking some basic question.

Is there any example/reference implementation available of Lucene Usage
using BooleanQuery using API instead of QueryParser?

 

 

 

Cheers
