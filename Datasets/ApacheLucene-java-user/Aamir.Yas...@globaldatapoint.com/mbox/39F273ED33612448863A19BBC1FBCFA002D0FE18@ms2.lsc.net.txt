SUBJECT: Updating Lucene Index Dynamically
DATE: 9 May 2008

Hi,

I am using Lucene 2.1.0 at the moment and I have huge data which is
being indexed.

I am re indexing my data on daily basis. Now I would like to index my
data dynamically at any point in time. 

I cannot afford to re index whole data due to its huge size and time it
requires.

 

How can I update my index dynamically? Any suggessions?
