Hi All,

I need to implememnt Accent Insensitive Searchin my application.

 

Simple example is Krak√≥w search should also bring Krakow also in search results.

 

I have seen many threads discussing sloution with SOLR, But I dont want to use SOLR in my
application for only this feature.

 

Any suggessionas?
