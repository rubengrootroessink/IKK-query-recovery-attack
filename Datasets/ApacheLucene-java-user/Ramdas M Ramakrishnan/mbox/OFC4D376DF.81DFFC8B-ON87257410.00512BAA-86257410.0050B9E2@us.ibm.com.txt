SUBJECT: Question with Hits Interface
DATE: 18 Mar 2008


Hi

I am using a MultiFieldQueryParser to parse and search the index. Once I
have the Hits and iterate thru it, I need to know the following?

For every hit document I need to know under which indexed field was this
Hit originating from? Say I have indexed 2 Fields how will I know from the
Hit which Field the Hit came from?

Thanks in advance.
