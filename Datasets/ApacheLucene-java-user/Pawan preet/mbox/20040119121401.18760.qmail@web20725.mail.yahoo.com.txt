DATE: 19 Jan 2004



I am using Lucene final.if i want to delete the documents from the index with IndexReader.delete(i)
where i is doc. number in index.There will some problem occer during obtaining of lock as
file could not create  in obtain() method of FSDirectory.java

and following error occur: "Lock obtain timed out" in Lock.java's  obtain(long lockWaitTimeout)
method.So if locked variable comes false (no file creation during obtain() method call)

Please tell me if somebody have some solution that what should be done for deleting a document
from index and again reindex same document.

 

Here documen is an html file.

 

With thanks.
