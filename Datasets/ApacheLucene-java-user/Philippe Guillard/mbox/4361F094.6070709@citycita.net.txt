Hello here,

I'd like to do some geographical searches. Can somebody can tell me 
where to go ?

At the moment i put the longitude and latitude in the index as i would 
put some text. Then i did some range queries like this :
queryString=foo AND country:United States AND 
coordinates@lon:[-74.04047986086957 TO -73.95352333913044] AND 
coordinates@lat:[40.70662093913044 TO 40.793577460869564]
It worked well with positive coordinates in Europe, not in the US so i 
planned to put N/S before latitude, E/O before longitudes to replace 
negative values.
But something tells me this is not the way to do things with Lucene and 
not use the range query:-)
So i red :
- http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/GeoPosition
- and this from the Boss :-) 
http://www.opensubscriber.com/message/lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org/184558.html 

- http://photospace.sourceforge.net/codecon/codecon-2005.html
, but all this seems complicated to me!

Regards,

Phil
