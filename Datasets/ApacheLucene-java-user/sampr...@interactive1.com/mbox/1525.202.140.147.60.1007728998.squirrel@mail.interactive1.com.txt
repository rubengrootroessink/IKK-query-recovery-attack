SUBJECT: RE: Wild-card search - *bas*
DATE: 7 Dec 2001

Hello,

I was experimenting for the wild cards when I found that the
org.apache.lucene.search.PrefixQuery class uses reader.terms(prefix) to get
a set of terms, in the getQuery() method. These terms are later filtered to
get to the terms required by it. reader.terms() does not seem to return any
terms (infact, it is supposed to return all the terms in an index). How can
I get all the terms in an index within the PrefixQuery class?

Also, any kind of information on the working of QueryParserTokenManager
class will be helpful :-)

Thanks in advance,

Sampreet.
