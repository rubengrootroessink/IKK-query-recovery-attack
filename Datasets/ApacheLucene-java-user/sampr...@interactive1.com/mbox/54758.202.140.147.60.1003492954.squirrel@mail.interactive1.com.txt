SUBJECT: Summary containing the search term.
DATE: 19 Oct 2001

Hello All,

We have started using lucene recently and would like to know if lucene
supports context-sensitive summaries for the search hits? Is it possible to
store the context-sensitive summary for each term (say 200 characters
containing the search word), at the time of indexing, along with the term
and its frequency? The summary can be taken as about 100 characters before
the word and about 100 characters after the word. If the word is the first
word in the document, then 200 words after it, or if it is the last word in
the document then 200 words before it. How can it be supported for
different types of queries say phrase query, prefix query etc. Which
classes need to be edited or extended and in what manner?

An early response will be highly appreciated.
Thanks in advance for the help.
