Tomi thanks for your thoughts. I'm new to Lucene, so coming from an Oracle
background my mind is set that everything goes inside the database. Now that
I know some of the loses I can have a better picture.

Regards,

Néstor Boscán

Funny, I felt the same way about file-based storage: you simply pack
it up using any of the numerous file transfer tools available and you
don't have to worry about any of the database issues (possible
uncompressed large dump over the network, is the database server
running etc.).
On the other hand, if your application utilizes a database anyway, it
might be doable, assuming the app can take the performance penalty.
I'd be hard pressed to come up with a scenario where the gains
(simpler backup) would outweigh the losses (having to learn to store
the index into the database, performance, database bloat), though.
Still, it might only be my lack of imagination, that's the problem. :)
