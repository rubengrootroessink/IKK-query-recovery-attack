DATE: 24 Jan 2009

Hello , I have recently started downloaded lucene. This is the first time i
am using lucene.My project is to add LSI(Latent Semantic Indexing) to the
indexing method of the lucene, to improve the indexing of documents.
            I first want to index some webpages and see how does search work
in lucene.The problem I am facing is that whenver i run lucene jar file
through command prompt, i get error as "failed to load main-class manifest
attribute from lucene-core-2.4.0.jar .I m using java 1.6.0_05. Please help
me with this.

Thanking You
Nitin
