DATE: 25 Jan 2009

Hello Sir, i downloaded lucene, then i went into the directory of jar file
lucene-core-2.4.0.jar . I typed the command java -jar lucene-core-2.4.0.jar
to run the jar file from command prompt. then the following error came
"failed to load main-class manifest attribute from lucene-core-2.4.0.jar" .
I want to index a web document and see the result after searching.

Regards
Nitin
