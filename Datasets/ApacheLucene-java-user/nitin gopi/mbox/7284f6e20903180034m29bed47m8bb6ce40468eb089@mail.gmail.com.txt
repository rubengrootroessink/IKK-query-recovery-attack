SUBJECT: Re: lsi as indexing algorithm with lucene
DATE: 18 Mar 2009

hi Paul, I am new to this field of search engine. My aim is to develop
a semantic search engine. Initially  I was trying to develop that by
using LSI. But since it is patented that is why there are no many
implementation attempts. I want  to ask is it possible to create a
search engine using lucene and semantic vector which is semantically
better than lucene?
