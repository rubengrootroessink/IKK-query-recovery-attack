SUBJECT: semantic vectors
DATE: 1 Apr 2009

hi all,
        I want to know everything about semantic vectors. I want to know how
does it indexes the documents such that the results produced are
semantically better than normal search. I also want to know how it is
different from semantic web, which uses the concept of ontologies and
metadata. It would be very helpful if somebody mail me all the study
material related to it?

Thanking You
Nitin
