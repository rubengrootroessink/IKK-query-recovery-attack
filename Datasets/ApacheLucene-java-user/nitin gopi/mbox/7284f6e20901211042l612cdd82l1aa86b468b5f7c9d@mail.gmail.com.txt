SUBJECT: first time using lucene
DATE: 21 Jan 2009

Hello , I have recently started downloaded lucene. My project is to add
LSI(Latent Semantic Indexing) to the indexing method of the lucene, to
improve the indexing of documents. I am totally new into this field. Please
help me in this matter and guide me how to proceed in the right direction. I
first want to input some documents and see the indexed document. Please
guide me step by step how to do that.

Thanking You
Nitin
