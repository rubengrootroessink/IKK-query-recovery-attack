SUBJECT: problem with indexing
DATE: 23 Feb 2009

hi all, I want to modify the indexing process lucene to suit my application.
I partially read the book LUCENE IN ACTION but it contains no information to
extract the term document matrix. I want to apply LSI to the indexed
document. Please somebody help me out.

regards
nitin
