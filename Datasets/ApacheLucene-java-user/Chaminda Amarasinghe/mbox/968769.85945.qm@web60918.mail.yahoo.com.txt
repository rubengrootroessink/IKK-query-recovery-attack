Apologies for your 2 hour delay earlier this morning. The Lucene 24 hour helpdesk was temporarily
closed while we had a weekend/life/sleep.
If you file an official complaint you will be entitled to an immediate and full refund of
your support fee.


As for your problem - I suspect you want to look at the Highlighter package in the "contrib"
section of the lucene distribution.
The Junit test rig gives some example uses.
