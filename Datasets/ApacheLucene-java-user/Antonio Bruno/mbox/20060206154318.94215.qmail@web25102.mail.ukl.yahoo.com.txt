SUBJECT: time of search for an index with the file .FDT much large
DATE: 6 Feb 2006

Hi,
  I have an index with 2,5 million documents. 
A document is formed in this way: 
- 15 fields index 
- 1 field stored but not indexed, whose value is one string of 500 byte. 
A search in average gives back the 3000 document. As 3000 id of documents is given back a
lot fastly, the 3000 documents instead demands at least 20sec. for being given back!!! 
  I have tried with a string of 5 byte instead that of 500, and the 3000 documents are given
back in only 1sec!
  The question seems had to the size of the file .fdt
  How I can make in order to reduce the time in the first case?
