To use but directly the docId would render efficient and fastest the searches much. Thoughts
to the possibility of being able to apply a first CachingWrapperFilter F1 on an index and
a second CachingWrapperFilter F2 on an other index and after to make (F1 AND F2) and to even
extract the info of interest only from an index. It would be most powerfulâ€¦ 
Could be made the moment one what of this type?
