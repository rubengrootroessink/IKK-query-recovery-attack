I'm not too familiar with the source of Lucene. But I'm pondering
your suggested solution. Wouldn't wait/notify semantics be a better
solution? Have a writer specify the max amount of time it will wait
before failing. When a writer relases a lock it should call notify();
rather than notifyAll(); in order to minimize the amount of actively
competing processes and polling.

Alternatively, you could use your routine in your bean.

Morten
