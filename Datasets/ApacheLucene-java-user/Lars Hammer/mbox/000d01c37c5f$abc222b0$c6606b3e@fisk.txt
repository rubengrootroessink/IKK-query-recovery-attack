SUBJECT: Re: IndexReader.delete( term ) bug?
DATE: 16 Sep 2003

Sorry I should have posted som more code the first time around, here is the
whole method that i Use. I make a search for the term first to check if any
documents exists :

private void deleteModelTree( String modelTreeFileID, pathToIndex )
    {
        try
        {
            IndexReader ir = IndexReader.open( pathToIndex );

            Term term = new Term( "modelTreeFileID", modelTreeFileID );

            TermQuery query = new TermQuery( term );
            Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher( pathToIndex );
            Hits hits = searcher.search( query );

            if( hits.length() != 0 )
            {
                ir.delete( term );
            }

            ir.close();
        }
        catch( Exception e )
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
         }
    }

I catch all Execptions to see if anything goes wrong and so far no
excpetions are thrown ....

-thanks in advance!
