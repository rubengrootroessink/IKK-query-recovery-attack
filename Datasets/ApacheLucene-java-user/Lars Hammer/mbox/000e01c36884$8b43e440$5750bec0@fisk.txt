SUBJECT: Hits not serializable?
DATE: 22 Aug 2003

Has anyone experimented with using EJB's for carrying out searches? I'm thinking of using an
EJB for carrying out the searches and return the hits to a JSP page, which handles displaying
of the results. 
But Hits isn't serializable, so it cannot be used for sending across the network from for
example JBoss to Tomcat.

Does anyone has any experience with using Lucene through EJB's ....

Thanks in advance
