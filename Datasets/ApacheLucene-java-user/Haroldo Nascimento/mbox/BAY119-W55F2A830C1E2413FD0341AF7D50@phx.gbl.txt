SUBJECT: Search on tokenized field
DATE: 17 Jan 2009


Hi,
 
I have a problem to do searches in fields tokenized. 
Initially I had associated with an advertisement 10 terms and for each term corresponded to
one field in my index and the query had operations OR for the 10 fields. 
  Now, the advertisements have more than 2,000 terms and the current solution (to create 2,000
fields) not works. 
  I think in create only field, that contens all terms tokenized with ";" for example. How
I can do search in a field that contains tokenized fields or exists another solution for this
problem?
 
  Example:
  advertise_id = "00001"
  terms[2000]: 
1- "home work" 
2- "house"
3- "yellow green ball sell"
4-  "star sports"
5- "tennis ball new"
...
2000- "xyz"
   My unique field contains: "home work; house; yellow green ball sell; star sports; tennis
ball new; ... ; xyz;"
  If my query is:
  query= "house" -> result = 1
  query= "yellow ball" -> result = 1
  query= "yellow sell" -> result = 1
  query= "ball star" -> result = 0 (no has result)
  query= "home xyz" -> result = 0 (no has result)
 
  Haroldo
