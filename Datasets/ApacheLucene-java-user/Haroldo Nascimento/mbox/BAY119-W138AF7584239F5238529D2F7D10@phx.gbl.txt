SUBJECT: Jdbc persitence Index
DATE: 21 Jan 2009


Hi,
 
I need to replicate my index in many nodes, but also I need to do the indexation process only
one time. I thought in the solution of the to persiste the index in DB and later load the
index from in DB to the all nodes. 
  This is a good solution? 
  I searched and I discovered that compass allows the persistence in BD. Another API exists
that do it. 
  In relation the performance in the indexation process, exists much difference in persisting
in BD and File System ? 
 
  thanks
