Are you saying that there is no out-of-the-box way of doing this...?
Can I not check the content length somehow? As in, mention that the length
of the value (to be matched) must match the length of the field value...

One (ugly) way might be to insert artificial begin/end markers at both index
and search time.

Hi,

I have a small query here.

 

How do I do an exact match on the value of a field and also assert that the
value must match the entire content of that field?

For E.g., I want that only the documents with 'Product Lifecycle' as the
value of a given field must be selected and even documents with 'Product
Lifecycle Management' as the field value must not be selected.

 

Thanks in Advance.

 

Shivani
