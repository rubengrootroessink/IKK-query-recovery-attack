Ok...

I'll explain the problem that I am facing with an example...

I have several fields for the documents that I index; one of the fields is
'title'. Now I have provided the user with a screen to search for documents
with a particular title. Let's assume that the value inputted by the user is
'Project Lifecycle', now I want only the documents with 'Project Lifecycle'
as the 'title' field value to be selected and not the documents with title
as 'Project Lifecycle Management', etc. 
I have used exact match but then exact match for 'Project Lifecycle' in the
'title' field will also allow documents with 'Project Lifecycle Management'
as the field value to be short-listed, which I want to avoid.

How do I accomplish this?

Well, there are lots of techniques for all sorts of tricks with  
Lucene.  What you're basically asking for is an untokenized, indexed  
field and a TermQuery to find a document with an exact match for a  
field.  Will that work for your situation?  If not, give us some more  
details of why that doesn't work and we'll work from there.
