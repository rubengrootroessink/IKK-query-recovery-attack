DATE: 10 Apr 2007


I understand what you are trying to say about the problem of sorting a
tokenized field. 

The reason why i try to sort a tokenized field is that I need to have a 
field to be both sortable and searchable in different time. Searchable field
requires tokenized field while sortable field requires un-tokenized field. 

The worse solution is to have another duplicated field which is un-tokenized
but it is not scalable when we have lots of fields need to be searchable.

And that's why I was asking for a good solution other than a quick fix.
