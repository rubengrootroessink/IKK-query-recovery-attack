SUBJECT: How to sort on a tokenised field?
DATE: 10 Apr 2007


My task is to index lots of documents with different fields. Some of the
fields are tokenized and are going to be sorted later on when a list of
result set is need to particular field. Unfortunately, Lucene complains
about sort on a tokenized field.

So is there any way to get around of it?

Thanks in advance!!
