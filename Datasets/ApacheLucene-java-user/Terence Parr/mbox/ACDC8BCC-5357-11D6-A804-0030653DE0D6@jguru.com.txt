Hi Otis,

I have an HTML parser built for ANTLR, but it's pretty strict in what it 
accepts.  Not sure how useful it will be for you, but here it is:

http://www.antlr.org/grammars/HTML

I am not sure what your goal is, but I personally have to scarf all 
sorts of HTML from various websites to such them into the jGuru search 
engine.  I use a simple stripHTML() method I wrote to handle it.  Works 
great.  Kills everything but the text.  is that the kind of thing you 
are looking for or do you really want to parse not filter?
