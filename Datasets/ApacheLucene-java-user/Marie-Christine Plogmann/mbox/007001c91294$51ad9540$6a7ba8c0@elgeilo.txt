Hi all,
I am currently using a (slightly modified) version of the IndexFiles demo class of Lucene
to index a corpus. As I understand it, the index lists for each term the documents it occurs
in.
My question is now, if this is in terms of frequency counts (the term occurs x times within
the document) or just in terms of binary features (occurs/ occurs not)?

Thank you in advance!

Marie
