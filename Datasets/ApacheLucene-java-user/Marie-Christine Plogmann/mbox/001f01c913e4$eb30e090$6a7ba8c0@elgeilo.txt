SUBJECT: Problems when changing stoplist file
DATE: 11 Sep 2008

Hi,

I am currently using the demo class IndexFiles to index some corpus. I have replaced the Standard
by a GermanAnalyzer. Here, indexing works fine.
But if i specify a different stopword list that should be used, the tokenization doesn't seem
to work properly. Mostly some letters are missing at the end. Has somebody encountered a similar
problem? What could be the problem?

Thanks!
Marie
