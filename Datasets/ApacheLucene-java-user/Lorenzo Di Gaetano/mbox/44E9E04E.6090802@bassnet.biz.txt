SUBJECT: Searching a untokenized field using SnowballAnalyzer
DATE: 21 Aug 2006

Hi all,

I have the following problem. I use SnowballAnalyzer to index Documents 
containing tokenized and untokenized fields. But when I try to search a 
document using one of the untokenized fields (usually keywords and 
unique identifiers) it doesn't find anything...

Simple exampe of code:

doc.add(new Field("car","ferrari",Field.Store.NO,Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED);

when I try to search it using the following search strings:

car:ferrari

or

car:"ferrari"

it finds nothing.

If I use StandardAnalyzer instead of SnowballAnalyzer it finds the 
Document correctly!!! Even the field name and the field value are 
lowercases, it seems that there is a problem on querying untokenized 
fields using SnowballAnalyzer... The only way I have to find my "car" 
field is using TermQueries...  But  I absolutely need  to make complex 
queries on multiple field values at once.

Please help me! Thank you in advance.

Lorenzo
