SUBJECT: Indexing with SnowballAnalyzer and multiple languages in a single index
DATE: 20 Apr 2006

Hi all,

I'm working at the search api of a multi language CMS, and I'm using the 
latest Lucene release. I'm using the SnowballAnalyzer in order to have 
stemmers for various languages. I know that I must use the same analyzer 
for indexing and searching, in order to obtain correct hits, but can I 
index contents for various languages (passing the name of the language 
to the SnowballAnalyzer's constructor) into the same index and then 
searching specifiyng the language to the SnowballAnalyzer's constructor?

Or it's better to have one single index per language (in different 
directories)?

Thank you in advance.

Lorenzo
