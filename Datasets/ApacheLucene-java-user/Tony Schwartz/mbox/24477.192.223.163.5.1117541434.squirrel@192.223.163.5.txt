DATE: 31 May 2005

Only way I see to do this is to get a TermEnum for that field, and grab the first.  Then
iterate until you find the last one.  This is similar behavior to the TermEnum.skipTo
method.  A better solution would be to record the minimum and maximum dates in the index
as you index them.  Each time you insert a new date, update the min/max if needed.  This
data would reside outside the index of course.
