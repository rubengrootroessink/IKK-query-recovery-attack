I have two ideas:
1.  wildcard query on the path field, but this only works if you have a
small number of elements in any path hierarchy.
2.  store each path component as a separate "term"
	a.  for instance:  /people/tony/property yields the following terms:
path:/people and path:/people/tony and text:property
	b.  now when someone wants to search for property in /people/tony,
you use the terms:  text:property and path:/people/tony

Subject: How to filter search based on file path

Hi 
 
I've indexed my website from the application root. When I run a query, it
beasically searches all content below the application root folder.
 
I would like to create feature that would allow users to search specific
folder/paths of this website. (i.e I would like to limit my query search to
specific folders)
 
Could you please give me some tips as to do this?
 
Thanks
K
