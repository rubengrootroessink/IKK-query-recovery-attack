hi Erik,

thanks for the reply. I did not do a new index. I just used the sample index
downloaded from nutch site.  it would be great if you have some working
query strings to show me. thanks.

To be honest, I'm way out of the loop of the demo and needs to be
re-written.  It is on my to-do list!

But, date range and proximity searches most definitely work.  Can you
be more specific about what you index and how you searched?  Perhaps
even a working test case?

Erik
