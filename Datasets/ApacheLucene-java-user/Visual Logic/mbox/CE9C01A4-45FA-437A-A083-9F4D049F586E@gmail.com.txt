SUBJECT: Using JSON for index input and search output
DATE: 30 May 2010

Lucene,

JSON is the format used for all the configuration and property files in the RIA application
we are developing. Is Lucene able to create a document from a given JSON file and index it?
Is Lucene able to provide a JSON output response from a query made to an index? Does the Tika
package provide this?

Local indexing and searching is needed on the local client so Solr is not a solution even
though it does provide a search response in JSON format.
