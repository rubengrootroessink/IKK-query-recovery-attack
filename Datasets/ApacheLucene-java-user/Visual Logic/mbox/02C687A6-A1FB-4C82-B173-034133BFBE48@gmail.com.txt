SUBJECT: Re: Using JSON for index input and search output
DATE: 30 May 2010

Thanks for this helpful information.

Solr is embeddable but does that not just mean that SolrJ only provides the ability to call
Solr running on some server? As far as I know embedding Solr is not really embedding it at
all, only using it remotely where a internet connection needs to be maintained in order to
do so. If Solr were truly embeddable how large of a memory footprint would that add to my
app?

For some of my use cases using Solr on a remote server would work fine. For other cases it
will not be quick enough, plus I want the user and other tool aspects of the local client
to be able to utilize Lucene search for a lot more than only accessing resources on a remote
server.

Sorry to hear there is no out of the box support for JSON input/output in Lucene but that
can be overcome with a bit of local code.

Is Lucene able to provide a JSON output response from a query made to an index? Does the Tika
package provide this?
