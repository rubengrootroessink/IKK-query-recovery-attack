Doron,

Sorry for the late reply.
I got the inspiration for this question from book Programming Collective
Intelligence by Toby Segaran (you can check
here<http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/programming_col.html>for
some O'Reilly's comments on the book). You can find a chapter
Searching
and Ranking in this book , namely on the page 74 there is one idea that one
can use neural network to learn and capture contribution of individual user
query words to selected  (clicked) document. Once the net is trained well
then it can be used to reorder hits.

The book does not elaborate the scenario where the index is changed often;
however, my impression was that this technique is common for customized
search and that Lucene/Nutch community is aware of it.

After reading the chapter again this technique can be used not just for
customized search but rather as an overall improvement to search capability
of search engine (that is the case where interactions of all users with
search engine are stored in shared neural network which is a good example of
capturing collective intelligence). This technique tends to capture
*association* between query words and individual document.

The nice thing about this approach is that the network can give you
reasonable results even for words which haven't been used before (as least
that is what the book seems to claim).

Regards,
Lukas
