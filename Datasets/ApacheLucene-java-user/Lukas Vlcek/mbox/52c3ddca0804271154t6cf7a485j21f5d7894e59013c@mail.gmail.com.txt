Nutch ca do this for you. It uses plug-ins for parsing various content. PDF
should be no problem. As for MS falimy documents it uses POI I think. THis
means that it is not 100% reliable but I guess you can write your own
plug-in and utilize commercial third-party utility for Word processing.

I think you will need to look closer at Nutch tools. As far as I know Nutch
can drop all pages containing specific words. I am not sure if there is any
tool to do the opposite.

Can you be more specific? I think you need to implement this yourself. (May
be carrot could be helpful)

If I am not mistaken then Nutch can cache documents for you but they are
converted into plain text. But I am really not sure in this point.
