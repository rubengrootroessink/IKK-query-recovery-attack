Hi,

I am using Compass with Spring and JPA. It works pretty nice. I don't store
index into database, I use traditional file system based Lucene index.
Updates work very well but you have to be careful about proper mapping of
your objects into search engine (specially parent-child mappings).

Regards,
Lukas
