Hi,

I am not sure if I can help you a lot but you can check how Nutch does this
(although it does not do exactly what you want). See

*org.apache.nutch.summary.basic.BasicSummarizer
*

or

*org.apache.nutch.summary.lucene.LuceneSummarizer*

You should also check Highliter API (
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/highlight/Highlighter.html#getBestFragment(org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenStream,%20java.lang.String)<http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/highlight/Highlighter.html#getBestFragment%28org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenStream,%20java.lang.String%29>
)

Regards,
Lukas
