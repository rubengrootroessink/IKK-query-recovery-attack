SUBJECT: Nutch - Microsoft Search Server integration
DATE: 15 Jan 2008

Hi,

Is it possible to integrate Nutch into MS Search Server via OpenSearch API?
(MS Search Server support Open Search:
http://www.microsoft.com/enterprisesearch/serverproducts/searchserver/features.aspx
)

I think it should be possible to pass user query from MS server to Nutch and
integrate Nutch search result into MS server search result but I didn't have
a chance to try this out yet. Does anybody have any experience which can be
shared?

Thanks,
Lukas
