SUBJECT: Re: Can POI provide reliable text extraction results for production search engine for Word, Excel and PowerPoint formats?
DATE: 13 May 2008

Does it make sense to consider using OpenOffice to convert from MS formats
to PDF or HTML before indexing. Would this yield me a lower fail rate as
opposed to pure POI approach? I don't care about formating now I care about
content in the first place. Formating would be important only in the case
that Nutch or other piece of software would be able to accommodate this
information into Lucene index (such that words in headline would yield
higher boost for example).

Couple of words about my motivation:

We released SharePoint 2007 in our company. We are not very satisfied with
its search capabilities so I started to looking for some alternatives. The
first thing I was looking at is Google Search Appliance as they claim it can
crawl, index and search SharePoint portals.

I realized that their integration with outer world is done via connector
manager which is itself an open source project written in Java and
Sharepoint connector implementation is as well released as a open source in
Java. This makes me think that I should be able to test Sharepoint connector
replacing GSA black box with Lucene,Nutch,Solr or whatever and test how well
this connector thing works. This would be a perfect test before we invest
more in GSA. On the other hand if I would be able to run the Sharepoint
connector without GSA (replaced by Lucene based product) then text
extraction from MS family formats can be the main impenetrable barrier.
