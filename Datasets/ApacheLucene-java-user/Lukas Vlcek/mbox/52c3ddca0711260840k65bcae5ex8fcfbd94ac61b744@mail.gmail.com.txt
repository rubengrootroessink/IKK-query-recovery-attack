SUBJECT: ApacheCon 2008 Europe - Lucene stuff
DATE: 26 Nov 2007

Hi,

Is anybody going to present anything about Lucene (and related technologies
- Solr, Hadoop, ...) at ApacheCon 2008 Europe? Any training sessions,
invited talks and/or specific track?
The conference pages (http://www.eu.apachecon.com/) does not contain any
details yet.

Regards,
Lukas
