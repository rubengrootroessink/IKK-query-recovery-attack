SUBJECT: Customized search with Lucene?
DATE: 13 Oct 2007

Hi,

I am looking for an easy (~preferred) way of implementing customized search
with Lucene. What I mean by this is changing order of returned hits
according to user profile. In simple words I would like to be able to tweak
order of documents in Hits collection before it is presented to the client.

Example: if user A issues a query "lucene" then he/she tends to click the
third returned link (document #123). I would like to "boost" document #123
for this user so the next time he/she issues the query "lucene" again the
hit for the document #123 will be in the first or second position (providing
that the index hasn't been modified).

Looking at the Searchable<http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/org/apache/lucene/search/Searchable.html>interface
it does not seem it supports this kind of flexibility. I don't
want to use filter<http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/org/apache/lucene/search/Filter.html>of
sort<http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/org/apache/lucene/search/Sort.html>(they
are not appropriate for my goal).

Custom scoring<http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/org/apache/lucene/search/package-summary.html#scoring>seems
to be the only option left. At the first glance it seems quite
complex; moreover, I am not sure it really allows me to achieve my goal, but
if there is no other way then I have to try it...
Any suggestions?

Regards,
Lukas
