Hi,

I noticed that Wikia search goes live today (see
http://www.devxnews.com/article.php/3719906).
Does anybody know where I could find more technical information about their
solution? Are they going to contribute their enhancements back to
Lucene/Nutch/Hadoop code? My understanding is that as long as they claim
they want to build their solution on top of open source technology they
should be contributing back.

http://re.search.wikia.com/search#+wikia%20+lucene%20+nutch%20+hadoop does
not return anything :-)

Regards,
Lukas
