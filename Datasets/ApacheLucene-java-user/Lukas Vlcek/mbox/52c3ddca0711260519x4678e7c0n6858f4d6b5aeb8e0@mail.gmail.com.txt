AFAIK no.
Lucene is revelance based query engine not relation based engine like SQL
database.
However, if you really want to use SQL on top of Lucene index then there can
be a way. You need to store index into database (see
here<http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#head-e55d8e6971f9f01daaf3e14ce1d2f34485adba6e>)
and then you can monkey around...
