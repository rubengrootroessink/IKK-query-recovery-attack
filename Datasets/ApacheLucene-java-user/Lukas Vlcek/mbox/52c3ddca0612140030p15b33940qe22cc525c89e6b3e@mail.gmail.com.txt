Hi,

May be you can consider using Compass (http://www.opensymphony.com/compass/)
which could help you in your situation. They claim that some actions (like
updating the index very often) are treated in a very efficient way (due to
caching which is not a native part of Lucene library).

Regards,
Lukas
