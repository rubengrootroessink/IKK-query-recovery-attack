This would be great!

I am particularly interested how they are going about customized search (if
they have a plan to do it). I mean if they can reorder raw search results
based on some kind of collective knowledge (which is probably kept outside
of Lucene index - at least that is what I can see from Nutch score
explanations).

Regards,
Lukas
