SUBJECT: Restrict number of hits
DATE: 10 May 2002

Is there any way to restrict the number of hits returned by a query? 
I would like to have the functionality of getting only the X last 
documents which respect to a given query condition. I've seen 
something on making an HitCollector class, but if there is a plenty 
more than X documents which respect the condition, that doesn't mean 
that they would all be processed? How can I avoid that?

Thanks in advance,
   Hlder Ribeiro
