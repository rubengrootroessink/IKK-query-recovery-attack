Hi,

I am confused using IndexReader.docFreq...

I am using lucene 1.9 ....my code snippet is,


int noofdoc = mreader.docFreq(new Term("TITLE","friends"));

where mreader is MultiReader...

few doc from index which has TITLE likes...

friends in usa
girl friends
boy friends

but "noofdoc" is showing zero.......

Any pointer....
