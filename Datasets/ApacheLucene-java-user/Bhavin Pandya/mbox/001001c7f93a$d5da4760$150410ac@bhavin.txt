SUBJECT: How to tokenize with comma in standard tokenizer
DATE: 17 Sep 2007

Hi,

Standard tokenizer works pretty well for me... but i found one problem with my usage...

I want to tokenize..."TheRing6,Proposal6,GuyandGirl6" as a three saparate tokens.. while standard
analyzer considering it as a one word because it has one digit in token.

Expected three tokens:
1. thering6
2. proposal6
3. guyandgirl6

i want to change this behaviour of standard tokenizer for this purpose.... But i dont know
where to change....
Do i need to comment some rule in StandardTokenizer.jj file ???  I am confused with this file....

Any pointer...
