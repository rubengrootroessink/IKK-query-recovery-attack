I think your above solution is very near to what i am looking for ,
But little bit different way...
here is what i am planning to do...

Suppose my index has four fields "product-title" , "product-desc" , 
"category" and "FLAG"    ( Fieldname FLAG has value "true" for each n every 
doc in index ...just added for iteration purpose )

At search time.. .
query =  +(product-title:nokia) +(product-desc:nokia)
Hits hits = searcher.search(query);
I want to fetch unique "category" from above hits object...

But i dont want to iterate through Hits object....

Now As per your suggestions,  I can do something like this...
TermEnum  enum = termDocs(new Term("FLAG","true")
But it will return enumeration of all the document which is in index...But i 
want enumeration of all the document which is relevant to "nokia"...
How to . . ?

Thanks
