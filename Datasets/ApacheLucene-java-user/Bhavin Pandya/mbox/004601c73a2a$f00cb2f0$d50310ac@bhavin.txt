Hi Otis,

Thanks for your prompt reply...

But its happening for all search strings...not only for friends...
If i fire "friend" or "boy" then also its not showing any results while it 
has...

Is it something like that docFreq is checking for only Exact match...

Random guess:

You are using an analyzer that stored "friend" (or some other stem), and not 
"friends", so term "friends" doesn't really exist in your inex - it's 
frequency is zero.

Hi,

I am confused using IndexReader.docFreq...

I am using lucene 1.9 ....my code snippet is,


int noofdoc = mreader.docFreq(new Term("TITLE","friends"));

where mreader is MultiReader...

few doc from index which has TITLE likes...

friends in usa
girl friends
boy friends

but "noofdoc" is showing zero.......

Any pointer....
