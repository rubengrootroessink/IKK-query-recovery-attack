Mailing List! ehehe! :)

this morning i changed some settings for the PATH variabile, but I'm
still experiencing the same trouble. I tried to extract lucene
following the hints given in the appendix of "lucene in action" (I've
that book) but without success... I downloaded lucene-1.4-final.zip,
extracted to C:\lucene-1.4-final\ and updated the classpath of
windows. Somebody told me to set the JVM classpath by typing:

java -cp lucene-1.4-final.jar; -jar lucene-demos-1.4-final.jar

but I got the following message:
Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from lucene-demos-1.4-final.jar

While when i Try to set the classpath as suggested in the appendix
(java -cp lucene-1.4-final.jar; lucene-demos-1.4-final.jar) i got the
"usual" Exception in thread "main"...

Does anybody know the solution to my problem please? :)

Thanks again! Bye
