Hello!
I'm new in the ML and in the Lucene world in general... :)
I re-installed JDK after a very long period in order to start using
Lucene but I had problems after few minutes I finished installing Java
and Lucene.

I installed:
JDK 1.5.0_06
Lucene 1.4.3

I've set the environment variables as follows:
PATH: C:\Sun\AppServer\bin; C:\Programmi\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin;
CLASSPATH: .; C:\Programmi\QuickTime\QTSystem\QTJava.zip;
C:\Programmi\lucene-1.4.3\lucene-1.4.3.jar;
C:\Programmi\lucene-1.4.3\lucene-demos-1.4.3.jar;

I then tried to follow the instructions found at
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/demo.html
so I opened a command prompt and typed: "java
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles C:\Programmi\lucene-1.4.3\src" and I
got the error "xception in thread "main" ... NoClassDefFound
org/apache/lucene/demo/IndexFiles" which means that it didn't find the
class definition.... But where is my mistake?

Can anybody help me pleeeeeeeease?? :)

Thanks a lot for your attention and, I hope, your help! :)
Bye, Federico
