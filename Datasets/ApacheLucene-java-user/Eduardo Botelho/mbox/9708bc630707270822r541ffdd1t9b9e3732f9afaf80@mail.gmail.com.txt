SUBJECT: Size of field?
DATE: 27 Jul 2007

Hi guys,

I would like to know if exist some limit of size for the fields of a
document.

I'm with the following problem:
When a term is after a certain amount of characters (approximately 87300) in
a field, the search does not find de occurrency.
If I divide my field in pages, the terms are found normally.
This problem occours when I make an exact query (query between quotes)

What can be happening?

I'm using BrazilianAnalyzer and StandardAnalyzer(for tests only) for both,
search and indexation.

thanks...

Sorry for my poor english...
