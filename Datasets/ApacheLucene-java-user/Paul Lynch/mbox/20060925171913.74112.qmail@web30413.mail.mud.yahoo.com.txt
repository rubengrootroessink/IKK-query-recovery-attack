SUBJECT: Advice on Custom Sorting
DATE: 25 Sep 2006

Hi All,

I have an index containing documents which all have a
field called SubId which holds the ID of the
Subscriber that submitted the data. This field is
STORED and UN_TOKENIZED

When I am querying the index, the user can cloose a
number of different ways to sort the Hits. The problem
is that I have a list of SubIds that should appear at
the top of the results list regardless of how the
index is sorted. In other words, lets suppose the Hits
should be sorted by DateAdded, I require the Hits to
be sorted by DateAdded for the SubIds in my list and
then by DateAdded for the SubIds not in my list.

>From reading previous discussions on the mailing list,
I believe I could achieve what I need by writing
custom filters i.e. Run the query first with a custom
filter for the SubIds in my list and then a second
time with a custom filter for the SubIds not in my
list and then "merge" the results.

I suppose my question is simple: Is there a better way
to achieve this?

Couple of bits of info which I would influence best
design:

- Index contains roughly 5M documents
- There can be up to 10K different unique SubIds
- My "Preferred SubId List" could contain any
combination of the 10K SubIds including all or none of
them
- My "Preferred SubId List" gets updated about 10
times and hour so I could cache the custom filters

Thanks in advance,
Paul
