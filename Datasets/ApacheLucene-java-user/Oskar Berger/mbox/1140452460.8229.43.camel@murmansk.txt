Hello,

Not yet an expert in the field, but as I've understood the thing the
terms are indexed as you specify them (through the filters) but the
contents are stored depending on whether you want it or not
(Filed.UnStored(), which happens to be on its way to get deprecated).

So maybe you search the lower cased but indeed get the cased as the
result in this very CASE.
