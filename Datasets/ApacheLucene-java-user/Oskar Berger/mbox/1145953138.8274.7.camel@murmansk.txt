SUBJECT: Accessing fields during search
DATE: 25 Apr 2006

Hello masters,

What is the most efficient approach to access field values during a
search?

I am only interested in accessing a couple of fields for counting, and
am thus not in need of storing the values as if sorting on the fields.

Where to look?

Regards,
/oskar
