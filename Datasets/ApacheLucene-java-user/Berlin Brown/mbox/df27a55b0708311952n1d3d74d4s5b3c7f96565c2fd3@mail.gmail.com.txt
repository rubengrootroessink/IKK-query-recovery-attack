DATE: 1 Sep 2007

So I am assuming that is not just a matter of "indexing" to that same
directory as you "indexed" before.

So, based on what you are saying, you would have to reload the
previous index (eg, INDEX_DIR_OLD) and then index the new content.
When I mean "index", I am talking about actually invoking lucene to
merge the content.

For example, it isnt just a matter of indexing to index_dir_old and
then to index_dir_new and then copying the lucene index files into
another directory index_dir_cur.
