I believe there isn't. I don't think any of the existing QueryParsers 
implements "search empty field" expression.

The way you might solve this requirement is to use a special "empty term" 
for such fields. For instance, I use single underscore "_" as a value for 
all empty fields in the document. I also use Keyword field to store this 
value verbatim (avoid Analyser that might not want to index a single 
underscore).

Searching for "empty term" can then be performed programmaticaly with a 
TermQuery:
indexSearcher.Search(new TermQuery(new Term("author", "_")));

General guide for the "empty term" value would be to choose a term that does 
not occur in any text you put into your index.
