This would not be hard to add to Lucene.  I would like to add it as soon as
we get the 1.2 release finalized.

I also prefer the second style of interface, however the method should
probably be on Field not on Document.  Something like
  Field.setBoost(float);
Perhaps we could also add a Document.setBoost(float) method which would
provide a default boost for all fields added to that document.
