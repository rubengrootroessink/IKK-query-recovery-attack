Because it was not designed to be subclassed.

When I wrote Lucene I only made classes non-final that I expected end users
to need to subclass.  In the case of Document, this is perhaps overkill, but
I prefer to have folks try to first use Lucene the way it is intended.  This
results in fewer spurious bug reports.

Why do you need to subclass Document?
