When we do full rebuilds we build into a new Directory.  When it is
ready we create a commit lock on the active directory to block new
searches, sleep for a half-second to let exisitng searches finish, and
then copy the newly built directory over the old one.  This seemed to
avoid file system lock issues on windows and unix and ongoing searches
just wait for the commit lock to be released.

-Lars

To create the commit lock:

FSDirectory activeDirectory;
Lock searchLock;
try {
    searchLock = activeDirectory.makeLock(IndexWriter.COMMIT_LOCK_NAME);
    ... do the copy
} finally {
    searchLock.release();
}
