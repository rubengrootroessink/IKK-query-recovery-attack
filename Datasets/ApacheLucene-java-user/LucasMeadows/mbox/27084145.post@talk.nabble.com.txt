SUBJECT: Indexing pages and chapters of a book
DATE: 9 Jan 2010


I have a large number of text files (books) that I am trying to make
searchable with Lucene 2.3.2.

I would like search results to display the page and chapter in which a match
with the search term occurred.

My question is whether it is possible to add structural data (xml perhaps)
to the files so that they can be indexed in a way that captures the
relationship of the terms to the pages and chapters that contain them.

Many thanks in advance!
