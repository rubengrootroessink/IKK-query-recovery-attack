SUBJECT: Merging two tokenized fields
DATE: 26 Feb 2009

  Hi,

I have two indexes, each has a tokenized field and I would like to combine
them both into one field in a new index.
How can it be done?
(Is it a good approach or is it better to hold them as untokenized text and
only when I create the new index, then to tokenize it?)

Many thanks,
Liat
