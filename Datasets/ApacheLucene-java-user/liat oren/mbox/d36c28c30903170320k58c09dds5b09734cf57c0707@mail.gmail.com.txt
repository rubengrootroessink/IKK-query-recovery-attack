SUBJECT: Luke - Build a jar that uses my own jar
DATE: 17 Mar 2009

Hi,

I edited Luke's code so it also uses my classes (I added the jar to the
class-path and put it in the lib folder).
When I run from java it works good.

Now I try to build it and invoke Luke's jar outside java and get the
following error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: - on my classes.

What do I do wrong?
Thanks,
Liat
