SUBJECT: Indexing becomes slow with time
DATE: 30 Apr 2009

Hi,

I noticed that when I start to index, it indexes 7 documents a second. After
30 minutes it goes down to 3 documents a second.
After two hours it becomes very slow (I stopped it when it arrived to 320MB
and did 1 document in almost a minute)

As you can see, it happens only after 2000, 3000 documnet.
Should I split them into more indexes?


Thanks,
Liat
