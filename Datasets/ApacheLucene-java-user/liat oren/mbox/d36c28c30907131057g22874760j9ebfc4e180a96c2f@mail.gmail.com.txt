SUBJECT: Re: Use of Synonyms
DATE: 13 Jul 2009

I have my own synonyms, which are differnt from the ones in wordNet.
For every word, I have synonyms and the score - for how close the synonym to
its word.
I would like to 'elaborate' the query, to expand it so it will include also
the synonyms of the words given in the query.

Thanks
