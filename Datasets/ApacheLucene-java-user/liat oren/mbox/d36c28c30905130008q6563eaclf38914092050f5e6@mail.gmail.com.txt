SUBJECT: IndexWriter stopped before commit
DATE: 13 May 2009

Hi all,

I ran a code that joins a list of indexes to one index.
The commit and close of the writer is done when we finish looping on the
list of the original paths.
An error occured before it arrived to the commit part.
The index size is big, so it looks like the data is there, but when I check
the number of documents, it shows 0.
I unlocked the index, and I also tried to commit it, but it still shows 0.
Is there a way to "save" the data instaed of re-running the join code?

Thanks,
Liat
