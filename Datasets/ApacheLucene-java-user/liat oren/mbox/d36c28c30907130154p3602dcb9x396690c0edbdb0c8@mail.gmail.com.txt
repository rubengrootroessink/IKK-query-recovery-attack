SUBJECT: Use of Synonyms
DATE: 13 Jul 2009

Hi all,

I have a list of synonyms for every word.
Is there a good way to use these synonyms?

Currently I use a boost query so if 'a' is the queried word, and 'b' (0.5)
and 'c' (0.2) are its synonyms, I query for:
a^1 + b^0.5 + c^0.2.
Is there a better way of doing it?

Thanks,
Liat
