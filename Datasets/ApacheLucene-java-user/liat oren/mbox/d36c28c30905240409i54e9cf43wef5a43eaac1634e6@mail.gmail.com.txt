SUBJECT: BoostingBooleanQuery search time is very long
DATE: 24 May 2009

Hi,
I have an index of 3 million documents.
I perform a regular search, using an analyzer and get the results within 1-2
minutes.
When I create a boostingBooleanQuery, and search within the index using a
similiarity that the scorePayload return the boosting value, the search
takes about 10 minutes.
This is done by parsing a text - each word appears once, but its boosting
value is affected by the frequencies.

Is it because I have to index the documnets using a differnt analyzer?
How can it be done?

Thanks  a lot,
Liat
