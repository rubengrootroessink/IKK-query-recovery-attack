SUBJECT: Search in multiple indexes which have differnt field name
DATE: 14 Feb 2011

Hey All,

I try to construct a boolean query that has to run on 3 different set of
indexes:
in two of them, it should query a field name "contents" and in one of them,
it should query a field named "text".
How can I use MultiSearcher to support this structure?

Thanks a lot,
Liat
