SUBJECT: changing term freq in indexing time
DATE: 19 Apr 2009

Hi,

I would like to be able to set the term freq to differnt values at index
time, or at search time.

So if a document has the following text: 1 2, the freq of 1 will get 100 and
the freq of 2 will get 200. I want to avoid expanding it by writing 1 100
times.

I looked at Similarity class and wanted to override it, but the tf function
gets only freq, so I don't know for which term this freq relates to, thus I
can't change the value.

Thanks,
Liat
