SUBJECT: Re: changing term freq in indexing time
DATE: 21 Apr 2009

Ok, I will explain the full 'problem' and then explain how I approach it:

Lets divide it into three steps:

1. I have a 'dictionary' of words - for every word, I have a list of worlds,
which are ids of text documents that the word appears in.
So, for example, for the word 'dog', I have '1 1600 36000' in the "worlds"
field (which are tokenized whin indexed) - which means that the word dog
appears in worlds 1, 1600 and 36000.

2. This index is used to choose synonyms for the word dog - using the
"worlds" field - I do a search on this index, giving the query "'1 1600
36000" as in input and thus get the words that are close to the word "dog".
I take the 10 closest words.

3. These 10 synonyms are then used to expand the query.

Basically, I have 2 problems in this process:

a. In the process of finding the synonyms, I would like that the frequency
of the word in each of the worlds will be taken into account. so that if
'dog' appeared 3 times in world 1, 10 times in world 1600 and 4 times in
world 36000, then it will be taken into account.
I wanted to avoid "expanding" the field to be "1 1 1 1600 1600 1600 1600
1600 1600 1600 1600 1600 1600 36000 36000 36000 36000". Accordingly I wanted
to be able to set the freq by myself.

b. In the process of using the synonyms, I wanted to be able to set a
'penalty' factor to the synonyms, together with giving differnt weight to
differnt synonyms, according to theur score. I looked at an old thread -
Search for synonyms - implemenetation for review :

I don;t know if its part of lucene now. I didn't quite understand how to use
it.
Is there a better way to approach it?

I hope I explained it well.
Thanks,
Liat
