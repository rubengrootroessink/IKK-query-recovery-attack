SUBJECT: Re: Scores between words. Boosting?
DATE: 19 Mar 2009

I am looking for a quick solution to expand queries so they will look for
synonms as well.
The same way WordNet is doing - it will looks for other words that mean the
same as written in the query.

So Synonyms and WordNet are better categories to describe what I need.

Any idea?

Currently what I do, is expending the query in my own code - for every word
in the query I also add the 10 most close words to that one and parse it to
the query parser.

It takes a bit time and I wondered whether I am missing something and it can
be done in a better way.

Thanks again,
Liat
