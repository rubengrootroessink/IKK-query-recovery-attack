SUBJECT: MultiSegmentReader problems - current is null
DATE: 28 Jun 2009

Hi,

I have an index that is a multi-segment index (how come it is created this
way?)

When I try to get the freq of a term at the following way:
   TermDocs tDocs = this.indexReader.termDocs(term);
   tf = tDocs.freq();
the greq method :
  public int freq()
  {
   return current.freq();
  }
is in MultiSegmentReader.

The current is null, so I get an exception.

Should I initialize current?
How can I avoid this problem?
How can I avoid having a multi-segment index?

Many thanks,
Liat
