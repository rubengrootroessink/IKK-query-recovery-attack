SUBJECT: Re: Vector Space Model: New Similarity Implementation Issues
DATE: 29 Feb 2008

Compare with classical VSM, lucene just ignore the denominator (|Q|*|D|) of
similarity formula,
but it add norm(t,d) and coord(q,d) to calculate the fraction of terms in
Query and Doc,
so it's a modified implementation of VSM in practice.
 Do you just want to verify which implementation of VSM in "ieee-sw-rank" is
more precise in practice by lucene?
If so, it's an useful experiment.
