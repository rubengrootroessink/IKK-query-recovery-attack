Hi all. I'm very new to lucene. All I have done is read some docs about how
it works, which brings to the question:

How easy is to add new fields to the documents in the index?
Suppose that today I can search for book title and decide that including the
author in the search would be a good idea. How easy is to do that with
lucene?
