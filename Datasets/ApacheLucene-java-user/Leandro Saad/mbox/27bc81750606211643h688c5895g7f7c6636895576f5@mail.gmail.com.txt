SUBJECT: Creating initial index using FSDirectory
DATE: 21 Jun 2006

Hi all. I'm writing a avalon component that wrapps lucene. My problem is
that I can't start the component using FSDirectory unless the index files
are already in place (segment, etc) , or I set the rewrite flag to true.

I my case, I'd like to create the index file structure only the first time I
initialize the component, then reuse the same index for each application
run.

Any help?
