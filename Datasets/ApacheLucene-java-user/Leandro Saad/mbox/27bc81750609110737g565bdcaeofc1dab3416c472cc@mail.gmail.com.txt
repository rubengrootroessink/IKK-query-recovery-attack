Hi all,

I have a field called "location" on my index. For example, this string:  "A
B" "A C" D was stored on my index
When I search for "location: ", these are the results that I'd like to
retrieve:
1) location: D -- 1 hit
2) location: A -- no hits
3) location: "A B" -- 1 hit
4) location: "A C" -- 1 hit

Is there any way I can make this work?
