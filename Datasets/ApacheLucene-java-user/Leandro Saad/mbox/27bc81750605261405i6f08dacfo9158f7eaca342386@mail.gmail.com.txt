SUBJECT: Joining searches on multiple indexes
DATE: 26 May 2006

My second question is: can I join the results os multiple indexes using a
common field?
If I have user info in 2 different sources (index)and want to search for
fields on both, but the search should
join the resulting records using a common field (user id for example). Is
this possible?
