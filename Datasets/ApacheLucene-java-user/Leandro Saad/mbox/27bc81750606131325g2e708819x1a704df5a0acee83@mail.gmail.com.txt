SUBJECT: Lucene usage
DATE: 13 Jun 2006

Hi all.

I'm writting a wrapper component around Lucene (using Avalon) and I'd like
to know the common api usage.

How should I bootstrap the index? Should I create the IndexSearcher when I
initialize the component?
For how long should I let the IndexWriter open? For one document: should I
create the writer, add the document and close it?
