LUCENE-1044 is only marked as fixed in v2.4
I assumed that the possible corruption on hard shutdown existed in 
v2.2.0 (and earlier), so we are no worse off by upgrading to v2.3.2.
Is that the case?

Thanks, I read those. Good job on providing a very useful change summary.
However, I guess I was also interested in any reports "from the field". 
Sometimes there can be unexpected consequences.
eg, I read somewhere of one user having multi-threaded issues because of 
a change from Vector to ArrayList in some implementation.

Cheers,
Mark.
