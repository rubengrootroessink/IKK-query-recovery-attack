DATE: 4 Mar 2004

Hi!

Consider the query "+michael +jackson" not to return any hits because there's 
no "michael" in index, but there is "jackson" (e.g. janet...). Is there any 
reasonable approach how to determine whether one or multiple terms of a query 
- and which - do let the query fail?

Kind Regards
Timo
