Well, the sense of tiers and (BTW: language-independant) patterns is to 
modularize software and make things exchangable. This way
neither the presentation tier nor the search engine is exchangable.

The problem actually is that VLH is designed to have a static list of VOs. VLH 
needs to evolve to support something like a data provider that dynamically 
may add data. The problems here so far is that an Iterator must throw an 
ConcurrentModificationException if the backing data is modified but as data 
in a VLH is actually never removed but only added this should be something 
possible to implement.
