SUBJECT: built index doesn't contain a segments file
DATE: 8 Apr 2007

Hi!

I feel somewhat stupid for asking this but...I let two thread build an index 
and the merge it into one on disk via addIndexes(), optimize() and close(). 
This is what it looks like on disk:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 25608841 Apr  8 18:37 _4.cfs
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       20 Apr  8 18:37 segments.gen
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       41 Apr  8 18:37 segments_4

However if I try to IndexReader.open() the index lucene complains about a 
missing segments file.

Well, right, it's not there. But why not?
