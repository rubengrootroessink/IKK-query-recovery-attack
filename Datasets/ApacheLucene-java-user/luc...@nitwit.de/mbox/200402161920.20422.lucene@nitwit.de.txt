SUBJECT: Word not in index
DATE: 16 Feb 2004

Hi!

I do build a list of all unique words in all my docs from 
WhitespaceAnalyzer.tokenStream(). I also do index all my docs using a 
GermanAnalyzer in another index. There are plenty of word in the word list 
that don't return any hits when searching the doc index built using the 
GermanAnalyzer - and these are no stop words.

Why is this?

Thanks a lot!
Timo
