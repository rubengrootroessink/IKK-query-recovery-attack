Only the user knows ;-) Well, no, I very likely only need one or a few but 
nevertheless I have to pull all hit results to the presentation tier...

That's just the problem. Using a VLH I have to fetch all hits from the Hits 
instance and put them into the VLH - ordinarily you would lazily only fetch 
the hits you actually need them - at the time you need them.

That's just my question :-)

So, to repeat, my idea was to use a wrapper for the VOs in order to fetch only 
some hits at a time...

It's actually a VLH pattern drawback. Maybe I should ask the blueprint 
people ;-)
