Hi!

There was some third-party SQLDirectory for lucene 1.2 which was abandoned for 
a matter of performance. Well, why not loading the index into RAM? Is there 
some ("official") SQLDirectory for 1.3?

searcher = new IndexSearcher(IndexReader.open(new RAMDirectory(new 
SQLDirectory()));

I'd really like to have the index where I do have all the data - in the 
database.
