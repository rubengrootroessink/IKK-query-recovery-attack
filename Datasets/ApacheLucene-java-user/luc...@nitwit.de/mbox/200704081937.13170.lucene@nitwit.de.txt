That's what I do.

Well, at the end of run() I explicitly close the index and I wait for all 
threads to finished (join()) before I merge. So, I'm pretty sure, yes.

But if it's absolutely mandatory to close the indices addIndexes() should 
throw some exception in case they haven't closed.

I actually build the index with 2.1.0 but open it with 2.0.0....oh, it comes 
to my mind that there have been some changes in the index format, I cannot 
open an index built with 2.1.0 using 2.0.0, right?

Oops, my fault :) Sorry...
