I think the best would be if Lucene would simply have a 
setCaseSensitive(boolean).

IMHO it's in any case a bad idea to make searches case-sensitive (per 
default).

I forgot that I did lower-case it. I fact I even output it in it's original 
state but lower-case it just before I pass it to lucene. That lower-casing is 
what I would call a hack and hence it's no surprise that I forgot it :-)
