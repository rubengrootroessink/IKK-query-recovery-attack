SUBJECT: Storing numbers
DATE: 5 Mar 2004

Hi!

I want to store numbers (id) in my index:

	long id = 1069421083284;
	doc.add(Field.UnStored("in", String.valueOf(id)));	

But searching for "id:1069421083284" doesn't return any hits.

Well, did I misunderstand something? UnStored is the number is stored but not 
index (analyzed), isn't it? Anyway, Field.Text doesn't work either.

TIA
Timo
