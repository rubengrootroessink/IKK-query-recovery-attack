SUBJECT: ValueListHandler pattern with Lucene
DATE: 9 Apr 2004

Hi!

I implemented a VLH pattern Lucene's search hits but noticed that hits.doc() 
is quite slow (3000+ hits took about 500ms).

So, I want to ask people here for a solution. I tought about something like a 
wrapper for the VO (value/transfer object), i.e. that the VO does not 
actually contain the value but a reference to lucene's Hits instance. But 
this somewhat a hack...

Any ideas?

Timo
