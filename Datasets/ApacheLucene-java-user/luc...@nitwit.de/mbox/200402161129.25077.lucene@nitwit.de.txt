So you mean adding the new documents to a temporary index first, running all 
queries against it and then write the temp index to the final index?

RAMDirectory ram = new RAMDirectory();
for (docs...)
	ram.addDocument(doc);

IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(ram),
for (queries...)
	if (searcher.search(query) != null)
		notify();

finalIndex.addIndexes(ram);
finalIndex.optimize();

?
