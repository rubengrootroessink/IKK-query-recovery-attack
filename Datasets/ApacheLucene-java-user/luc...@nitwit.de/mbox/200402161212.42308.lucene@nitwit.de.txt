deprecated:

String description = doc.getField("contents").stringValue();
final java.io.Reader r = new StringReader(description);
final TokenStream in = analyzer.tokenStream(r);
for (Token token; (token = in.next()) != null; )
{
	System.out.println(token.termText());
}

But the result is the same, the words are actually truncated (instead of 
"has", "had", "have", etc. only "ha") :-(
