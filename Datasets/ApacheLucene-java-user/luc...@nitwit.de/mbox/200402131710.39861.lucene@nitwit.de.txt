SUBJECT: Incrementally updating and monitoring the index
DATE: 13 Feb 2004

Hi!

Can Lucene incrementally update its index (i.e. balancing will a list of docs 
and removing those that are no more found)?

I'd like to monitor the index for certain queries/terms, i.e. I want to be 
notified if there are (new) hits for a list of terms each time after I add a 
document to the index - continously. 

Is this possibe? The index will contain several hundrets of thousands of 
documents and will be frequently accessed concurrently.

TIA
Timo
