SUBJECT: storing index in database
DATE: 3 Oct 2003

Hi!

Somebody wrote a SQLDirectory for lucene 1.2 (only) but discontinued it for a 
matter of performance issues.

Well, I really would like to store that index at the same place as the data 
ifself - in the database and not somewhere in the filesystem. I don't quite 
understand the performance problem at all but in any event if a index sizes 
only some MBytes why not selecting all the index once out of the DB and 
keeping it in memory?

So, I'd like to ask people here whether there is a way to and which one is the 
best to store the index reasonably in db.

Timo
