Yes, we are looking to serve all of our documents from the
apache server at port 80. The _only_ reason we have Tomcat
is to support Lucene and the only reason for that is to provide
a search index for the site.

If there is an another/easier way...

One of the other admins at my site installed the connector, I can
provide the modified or diffs of the modified files.

I'm now looking at, what workers file ? JKMount commands ? We are
currently at the limits of the expertise at our site.

						thanks,
