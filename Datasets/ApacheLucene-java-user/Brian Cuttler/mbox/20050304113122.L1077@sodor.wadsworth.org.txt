My understanding is that our webmaster is hoping to have very simple
files created by the data-suppliers, ie, depatmental people that generate
web pages. Then use server-side-includes to include site or departement
comment headers/footers/backgrounds, so that ultimately it will be
the .shtml with the interesting data.

Is this something that in your experience works well or is there some
other methology I can recommend to her ?

						thank you,
