DATE: 5 Jun 2003

I am using Lucene in an application. 

IF i searh a key word first ,thenI rebuilt the index
, an Exception occurs

ERROR: Failed to create a new index writer.
java.io.IOException: couldn't delete _1x.fdt
at
com.lucene.store.FSDirectory.<init>(FSDirectory.java:55)
at
com.lucene.store.FSDirectory.<init>(FSDirectory.java:40)
at
com.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:63)

It seems that after the search operation, some process
is still uesing "_1x.fdt",
Any know which process is using it and how to release?
