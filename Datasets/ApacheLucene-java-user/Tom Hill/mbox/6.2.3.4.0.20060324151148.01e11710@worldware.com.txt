If by "the same time" you mean "in one session", or something like 
that, then yes, IndexModifier will help.

But if you mean from multiple threads, you'll have to do a fair 
amount more work to keep them synchronized. IndexModifier won't work 
in multithreaded scenario, at least as far as I can tell.
