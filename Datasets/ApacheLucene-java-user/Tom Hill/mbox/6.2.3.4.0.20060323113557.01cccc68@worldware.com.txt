SUBJECT: Joins between index and database

Hi -

I have an application where I'm using Lucene to index the contents of 
a database. That's working fine.

But I have a problem where I'd like to retrieve a subset of the 
documents that match a search, based on a join table in the database.

How do people typically handle combining the results of a Lucene 
based search with the results of a database search?

Thanks,

Tom
