SUBJECT: Getting count of documents matching a query?
DATE: 6 Apr 2006

Hi -

Is there a fast way (not easy, but speedy) of getting the count of 
documents that match a query?

I need the count, and don't need the docs at this point. If I had a 
simple query, (e.g. "book") I can use docFreq(), and it's lightning 
fast. If I just run it as a query it's much slower. I'm just 
wondering if I did a custom scorer / similarity / hitcollector, how 
much faster than a query could I get it? Or is there a better way?

And I'm not entirely sure how to implement the above idea, pointers 
or samples or hints would be wonderful.

Thanks,
