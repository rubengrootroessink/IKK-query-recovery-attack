SUBJECT: Re: two questions about NumberTools
DATE: 29 Jul 2007

Hi
I create my index files and encode all numbers using solr's NumberUtils but
searching not works!!! I created a custom query parser and override the
getRangeQuery and getFieldQuery but no result will return.
do I have to implement a custom analyzer too? currently I am using
whitespace analayzer and I don't think it needs to be customized.
