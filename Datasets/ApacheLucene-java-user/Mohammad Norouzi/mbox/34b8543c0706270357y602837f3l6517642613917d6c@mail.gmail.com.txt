SUBJECT: Re: Lucene as primary object storage
DATE: 27 Jun 2007

Hi karl,
we did something like hibernate to map an object (Entity) with lucene by
defining a bunch of annotations just like the Limax project (as far as I
know it is led by you),
the only problem we had was how to make relationship between two or more
separate indexes. I managed to resolve it but I don't think it's very good
idea. if only the Lucene had some feature to facilitate this :)
We use these indexes for generating some dynamic reports and we are going to
create a database crawler to surf the DB and find new or deleted records to
update its index files.
our application uses only index files to persist the information comming
from DB and also uses that index as a resource

I am welcome if you want to know how to make relationship between two or
more indexes.

Good Luck

Mohammad
