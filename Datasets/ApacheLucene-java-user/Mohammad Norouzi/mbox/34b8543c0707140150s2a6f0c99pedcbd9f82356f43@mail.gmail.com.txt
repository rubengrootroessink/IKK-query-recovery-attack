SUBJECT: search through all fields
DATE: 14 Jul 2007

Hello all
is there any way to search through all the fields without using
MultiFieldQueryParser? currently I am using this parser but it requires to
pass all fields as an array to its parse method and QueryParser will search
through the default field if no field name is specified

lots of thanks
