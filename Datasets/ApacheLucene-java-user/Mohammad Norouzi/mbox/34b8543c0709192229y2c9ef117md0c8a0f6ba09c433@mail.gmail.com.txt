SUBJECT: Re: a query for a special AND?
DATE: 20 Sep 2007

Sorry Paul I just hurried in replying ;)
I read the documents of Lucene about query syntax and I figured out the what
is the difference
but my problem is different, this is preoccupied my mind and I am under
pressure to solve this problem, after analyzing the results I get, now I
think we need a "group by" in our query.

let me tell you an example: we need a list of patients that have been
examined by certain services specified by the user , say service one and
service two.

in this case here is the correct result:
patient-id              service_name               patient_result
1                             s1                                12
1                             s2                                13
2                             s1                                  41
2                             s2                                22

but for example, following is incorrect because patient 1 has no service
with name service2:
patient-id              service_name               patient_result
1                             s1                                12
1                             s3                                13
