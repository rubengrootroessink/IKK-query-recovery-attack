Hi all

consider following index

field1           field2                              field3
text1           text1 text2                      text3 text4
text4           text2                              text2 text3 text5

I want to get all terms in filed3
if I use Reader.terms() it will returns: (however i have to put an if
statement to filter result of the field3 only)
text3
text4
text2
text5

but I need following result:
"text3 text4"
"text2 text3 text5"


is this possible? if yes, how? and if no, is there any tricky way to get
this result?

thank you so much.
