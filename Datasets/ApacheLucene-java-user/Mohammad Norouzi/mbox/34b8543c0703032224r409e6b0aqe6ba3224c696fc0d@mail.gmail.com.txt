SUBJECT: searching a date range
DATE: 4 Mar 2007

Hi
I want to search through lucene's index from a start date to end date.
when I pass this query it works, say, admitDate:1978/05/05
however, when I use a range syntax it return no records:
admitDate:[1978/05/05 TO 2005/05/05]

I even tried this: admitDate:["1978/05/05" TO "2005/05/05"]
but still not works

is there any way to make it possible searching by range?
