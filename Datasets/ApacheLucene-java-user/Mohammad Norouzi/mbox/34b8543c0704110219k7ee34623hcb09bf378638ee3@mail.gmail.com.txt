SUBJECT: question about field equality in query
DATE: 11 Apr 2007

Hi
is it possible (or a trickery way)  to search with a given query in which we
can set an equality for two fields
for example:

Document:
field1             field2                field3          field4

Query:
  field1:"test phrase" AND field2:"test" AND field3:field4

in this query we said that do search where field3 is equal to field4 ...
(and rest of the query)

if it is not possible, can we ask it as a new feature from Lucene
developers?

Thank you so much in advance.
