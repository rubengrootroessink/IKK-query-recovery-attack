SUBJECT: Re: question about field equality in query
DATE: 15 Apr 2007

Thanks Karl,
sorry I was on business vacation and could not reply soon.

Ok, I want to index my database and search through the indexes, and the
tables in database are more than 50 and it's hard to joining them and then
indexing. so I was thinking of indexing each table in a document but in one
index file and then make relations between them

I know that Lucene is not a relational database but it really helps us to
improve accessing our information and even generating reports.

Even if this feature decline the performance, still it is better than
generating reports from SQL statements and the speed up accessing
information. now our users are very satisfied by this. but we need to create
some relationship between documents.
