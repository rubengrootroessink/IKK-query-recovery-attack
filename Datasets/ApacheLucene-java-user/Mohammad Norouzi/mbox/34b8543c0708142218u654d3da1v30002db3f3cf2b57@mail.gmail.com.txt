SUBJECT: query question
DATE: 15 Aug 2007

Hi

I am using WhitespaceAnalyzer and the query is " icdCode:H* " but there is
no result however I know that there are many documents with this field value
such as H20, H20.5 etc.     this field is tokenized and indexed what is
wrong with this?
when I test this query with Luke it will return no result as well.  I am not
sure whether the query parser change the word into lowercase internally or
not. but I have extended my own query parser and I am sure no change on
input query will be made.

any help would be appreciated
