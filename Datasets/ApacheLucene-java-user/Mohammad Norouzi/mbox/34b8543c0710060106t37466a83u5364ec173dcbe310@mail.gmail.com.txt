SUBJECT: lucene optimal configuration
DATE: 6 Oct 2007

Hi everybody,
I always used lucene with its default configuration values.now I want to
know if there is any document in which initial values for configuring a
Lucene project is specified (values for Lucene, App Server and JDK).

if anyone had such experience on achieving best performance  of Lucene, we
are appreciate to hear about any settings they made on their application. I
know the applications are different but your experiences are, of course,
useful

thanks

Mohammad
