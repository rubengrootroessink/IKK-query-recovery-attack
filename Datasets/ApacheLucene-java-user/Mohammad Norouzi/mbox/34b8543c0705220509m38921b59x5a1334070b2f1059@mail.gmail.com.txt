Grant, thanks, in my case, getTermFreqVector returns null, I dont know why
it accepts a docnumber as parameter, what is it? is that the same doc id?
if yes it restrict the result for just one document, am I right?

Walter, thank you so much, may I ask you a question:
if I am using an analyzer, say, XYAnalyzer while indexing, is it affect on
how to search?
another thing that buffled me is that by using IndexReader.terms() no
Analyzer specified so how it possible to do that?

thank you again
