SUBJECT: how to index a large database
DATE: 31 Mar 2007

Hi all
I am going to index our database. one approach is to join them and then
index the fields. but the information are very large say more than 3
millions. so the Sql Server fails to select them.

I want to know if anyone has such this experience to indexing huge
information of database using lucene.

can anyone give me some advice?
