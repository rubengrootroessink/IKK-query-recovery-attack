SUBJECT: how to search over another search
DATE: 26 Mar 2007

hi
I have two separated index but there are some fields that are common between
them. now I want to search from one index and then apply the result to the
second one. what solution do you suggest?
what happens on fields? I mean the first document has some fields that are
not present in the second one so I need the final document has all the
fields of both indexes.

thanks
