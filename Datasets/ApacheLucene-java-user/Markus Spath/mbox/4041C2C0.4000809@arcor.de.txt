hmm, wouldn't it be easier to index only one term for a list of synomys instead 
of indexing each synonym for one term?

quick, fast, speedy -> quick (both when building the index and building the query)

this also would solve your problems with the (somehow counterintuative but 
probably well reasoned) behaviour of lucene to add Fields with the same name at 
the beginning instead of appending them.
