its because the GermanAnalyzer applies the GermanStemmer (via the 
GermanStemFilter) which substitutes umlauts with their non-umlaut conterparts

from org.apache.lucene.analysis.de.GermanStemmer :

     /**
      * Do some substitutions for the term to reduce overstemming:
      *
      * - Substitute Umlauts with their corresponding vowel: äöü -> aou,
      *   "ß" is substituted by "ss"
      * - Substitute a second char of an pair of equal characters with
      *   an asterisk: ?? -> ?*
      * - Substitute some common character combinations with a token:
      *   sch/ch/ei/ie/ig/st -> $/§/%/&/#/!
      *
      * @return  The term with all needed substitutions.
      */
     private StringBuffer substitute( StringBuffer buffer ) {
     ...

if you want your Analyzer to produce Tokens like 'huehnerstall' probably the 
easiest option is to start with the GermanAnalyzer and add a UmlautFilter 
before the GermanStemFilter is applied.
