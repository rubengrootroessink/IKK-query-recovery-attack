Hi All,


 I need help on retrieving results based on relevance + freshness. As of
now, i get based on either of the fields, either on relevance or freshness.

 how can i achieve this. Lucene retrieves results on relevance but also
fetches old results too. i need more relevant results with freshness too.



Regards,
Destin~ed
