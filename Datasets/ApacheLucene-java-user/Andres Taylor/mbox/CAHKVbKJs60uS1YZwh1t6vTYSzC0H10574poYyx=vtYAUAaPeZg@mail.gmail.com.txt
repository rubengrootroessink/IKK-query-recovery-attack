Hi there,

A work with Neo4j <http://neo4j.org/>, a NoSQL graph
database tightly coupled with Lucene. I am now working on an optimizing
execution engine. To do this well, I would like to know more about the
existing Lucene indices. Ideally, I'd like to be able to ask a Lucene index
how many hits a query might give me, before I actually run the query. The
answer will probably just be an estimation, but that's fine.

Is this possible today?

Best regards,

Andr√©s
