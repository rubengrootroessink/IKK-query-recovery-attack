SUBJECT: OutofMemory in large index
DATE: 13 Nov 2009

Hi all,
I got OutOfMemoryError at
org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:183)
My index is 43G bytes.  Is that too big for Lucene ?
Luke can see the index has over 1800M docs, but the search is also out
of memory.
I use -Xmx1024M to specify 1G java heap space.

One abnormal thing is that I broke a running optimize of this index.
Is that can be a problem ?
If so, how can I fix an index after optimize process is broken.

Thanks.
