SUBJECT: How to limit fields being loaded into the FieldCache ?
DATE: 15 Nov 2009

Hi all,
In 'Lucene in Action', I read "Limit how many fields you directly load
into the FieldCache" to reduce RAM usage during searching.
But I can't find how.  In javadoc, I can't find any note about how
FieldCache is used in IndexReader or IndexSearcher.
Can somebody teach me that ?
Thanks .
