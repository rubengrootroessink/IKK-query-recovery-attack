SUBJECT: Re: What's 'java -server' option ?
DATE: 17 Nov 2009

Sorry guys, AGAIN I used wrong search word, please ignore this thread
I found a doc here
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/performance/hotspot.html

I used 'java -server', google gives no useful info
Just now I use 'java server vm', then I found the doc
It's really an ironic to who is studying lucene.
Sorry about bring useless thread here.
