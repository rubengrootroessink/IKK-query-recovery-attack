SUBJECT: Can Lucene unite multiple instances run as one ?
DATE: 16 Nov 2009

Hi, all
I'm facing a large index, on a x86 win platform which may not have big
enough jvm heap space to hold the entire index.
So, I think it's possible to split the index into several smaller
indexes, run them in different jvm instances on different machine.
Then for each query, I can concurrently run it one every indexes and
merge the result together.
This can be a workaround of OutOfMemory issue.
But before I start to do this, I want to ask if Lucene already have a
solution for things like this.
Thanks.
