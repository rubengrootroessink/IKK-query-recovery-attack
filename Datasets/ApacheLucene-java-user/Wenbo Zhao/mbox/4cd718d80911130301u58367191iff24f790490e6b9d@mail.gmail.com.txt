Thank you all...  I think I need to read more docs

A little question : how to add more memory over 1G ?
When I specify more than -Xmx1450M, jvm gives error:
>java -Xmx1450m asdf
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: asdf

>java -Xmx1451m asdf
Error occurred during initialization of VM
Could not reserve enough space for object heap
Could not create the Java virtual machine.
