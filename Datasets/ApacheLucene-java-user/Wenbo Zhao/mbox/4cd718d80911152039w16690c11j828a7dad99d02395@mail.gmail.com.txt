SUBJECT: Re: Can Lucene unite multiple instances run as one ?
DATE: 16 Nov 2009

My data is categorized by date.  About 14M+ docs per month, 37M+ terms.
When I use 1G heap size to do search of 10 month index, I got OOM.
The problem is I can't increase heap size in an easy way.
I have several machines, all 32bit windows, 4G ram.
And my goal is to index 10 year's data, plus more data every day !
If I put all of them together, I will need 8G+ ram to run search.
Maybe another 8G+ ram to run indexwriter.

I think to split large index into smaller indexes and use a group of
machines to work as one is more flexible and faster compare to one
huge ram machine.
Any suggestions ?  beside more rams.
