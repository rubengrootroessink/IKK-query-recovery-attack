SUBJECT: Re: How to limit fields being loaded into the FieldCache ?
DATE: 16 Nov 2009

Sorry, all folks, please ignore this thread.
I found the section in doc, just start to read that.
I just used wrong term to search before :-)
I searched for 'FieldCache' but in the book it's 'Field cache'
Anyway just ignore this.
