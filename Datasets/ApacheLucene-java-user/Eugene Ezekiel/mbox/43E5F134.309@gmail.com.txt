SUBJECT: Reducing Inflated Similarity Scores
DATE: 5 Feb 2006

Hi All,

I'm currently using the Default Similarity with the Boolean Query add 
function to append clauses. The problem I face is this, given a query 
<t1> <t2> <t3> .... <tn>, where <ti> = a term
it returns me a document which that has just ONE term in it say <t1> and 
nothing else. Surprisingly, the hits score for this is 1.0.

Ok, I'm quite new to lucene so I don't really know how the Default 
Similarity works but from what I gather it is a variation of the 
cos-similarity. And the cos-measure penalizes extraneous terms 
therefore, how can the score be 1.0?

Can anyone tell what I can tweak to bring it more to the cos-measure?

Thanks.

Regards,
Eugene
