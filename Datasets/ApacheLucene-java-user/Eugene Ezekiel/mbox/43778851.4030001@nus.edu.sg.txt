SUBJECT: Question on queryparser code from Lucene
DATE: 13 Nov 2005

I got this nagging problem that I can't figure out in the source code of 
Lucene.

In the file org/apache/lucene/queryParser/QueryParser.java,
there's a method called parse that returns a Query (see below):

   public Query parse(String query) throws ParseException {
     ReInit(new FastCharStream(new StringReader(query)));
     try {
       return Query(field);
     }

I don't understand the return statement,
(i) how do we return without instantiation?
(ii) the Query class doesn't have a constructor that is Query(String)?


Thanks. Appreciate any pointers you can give.

Eugene
