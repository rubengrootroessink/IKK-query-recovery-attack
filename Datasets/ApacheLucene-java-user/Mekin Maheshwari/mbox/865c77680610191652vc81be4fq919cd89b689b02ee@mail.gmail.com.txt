Well I am planning on doing exactly that, given that we have seen some
amount of user queries which need to match across fields.

eg. "rowling goblet of fire" - need to match rowling in 1 field &
"goblet of fire in another
"hilary duff most wanted" - need to match "hilary duff" in 1 field &
"most wanted" in another

I need the ability to boost matches in certain fields higher than others.
So both the above approaches do not work for me.

Not all fields have the same analyzer, so thats another reason for not
using 1 catch-all field.

I am trying out DisjunctionMaxQueries  and will soon move to it.
I first want a phrase match to be done & if that fails then a non-phrase match.
My problem is that I cant easily decide which phrases to build given a
4+word query from the user.

Thanks Erik for the response,
Hope I have done a better job of explaining my problem,
