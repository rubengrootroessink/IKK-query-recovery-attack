Thanks, Chris. I have a couple follow-on questions:

1) Thanks for the pointer to DBSight.net. It seems that DBSight has 
built some integration support for MySQL. Do you know if there are any 
plans to build integration support for Derby, the Apache open source 
database (http://db.apache.org/derby/)?

2) I'm afraid I don't understand the reference to Compass. Can you point 
me at an URL?

3) Thanks for clarifying what JDBCDirectory does. Is this a dead 
technology? All of my attempts to access the JDBCDirectory url timeout.

Regards,
-Rick
