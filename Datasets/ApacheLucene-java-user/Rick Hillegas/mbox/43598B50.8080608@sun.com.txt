SUBJECT: queries and filters
DATE: 22 Oct 2005

I have another newbie question based on a quick glance at some classes 
in* org.apache.lucene.search.Query* and at the email thread 
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/BrowseList?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&by=thread&from=943115.

It appears that Searchers first compute query results and then filter 
those results. Can you request  the reverse composition: First 
restricting the search to a small set of documents, then running the query?

Thanks,
-Rick
