Hi All.

Firstly I am new to using Lucene and all its API's.

I am trying to evaluate if Lucene can solve the following problem for me.

1. I need to temporarilly index sets of documents on the Fly say 100 at a
Time.
    This seems simple enough - I create a Index either on the File System or
in Memory - (This I can do.)
    with the following Fields for each Document: external_id (Fixed Length
String : 255 chars), contents (contents of HTML file)

2. I need to run a Fixed set of Queries against the Index I created on the
"contents" field.
    The Queries are in the form "123456789 OR 4323456 OR House OR Flat" or
more complicated
    like "((flat AND bed) OR (cat AND dog))"


My problem is that for these queries I need to know which Documents hit. I
also need to know which terms hit and if possible
the location of the hits for each term in the hit Document.

I can create queries using the Query Parser and get the Document that Hit.
This I assume is refered to as the Hits API ?

What I could really use is a brief decription of the steps I would need to
perform to solve the above, a point in the right direction
so to say.

Would I need to write my own Query Parser, Searcher, dig real deep into the
bowls of Lucene ect.

Suggestions would be realy appreciated.
