Correct I will throw them away!

Okay based on your answer and a little testing just to see what it gives me
- I assume
Lucene only stores the Term Offset (which is Analyser Dependent) and not the
Actual Offset as retrieved from the Plain Text Stream for the Term.

if you have complex boolean queries and you need to know which individual

Score/Relavence is not Important. I need the Yes/No logic with the what
caused the Match Info. Could you mayby explain the intersect/union the
bitsets and the interogating to know
what matched?

some people don't like Filters because of how much space they take up for

Nope will never have any really large Indexes here 100 to 200 docs at the
most.
