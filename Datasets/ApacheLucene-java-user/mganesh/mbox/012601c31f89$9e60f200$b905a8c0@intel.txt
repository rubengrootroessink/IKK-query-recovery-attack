DATE: 21 May 2003

Hello,
  I have to search on Indexed documents using Multipe Search Criteria.
  
 My search condition is 
       contents:Query1 AND query2
But Im not getting any results from the above query.

But  contents:Query1 AND contents:Query2  works fine for me.

I want to know whether the condition1 will work or not??

regards
ganesh
