I am looking into storing indices into DB.  I saw some discussion with
DBDirectory and SQLDirectory on the mailing list.  I also came across
somebody having a code in a thread titled DBDirectory.

Any pointers on this one would be great.   There were some remarks about
performance as well.  Any data on those will be helpful.   We are using
SQLServer.

 

Thank you and thanks for your earlier help on wild card search.
