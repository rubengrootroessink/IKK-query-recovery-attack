SUBJECT: Usage of Lucene/Hibernate Search for Duplicate Contacts Detection
DATE: 12 Oct 2009


Hi all,

I am supposed to add a feature in which my app will detect the duplicate
contacts of a user on the basis of their name, email, mobile number
etc.(i.e. Contacts Duplicate Killer kind of feature). The simplest algo i
can think of is find all the contacts on the basis of their name, email and
mobile and then run the loop to determine which all contacts have similar
entries. But i think this algo will have worst performance.

I am currently using Hibernate. I got to know about Hibernate Search/Lucene.
Can I use these solutions for this task. I am asking this on the basis that
Lucene already implements algos such as Levenshtein_distance. May be I can
harness the Lucene power to make this task efficient.

If anyone has done this or something similar with Lucene or some other also,
then please give me pointers for the same.

regards
nitin
