SUBJECT: FW: Eliminating duplicate documents when indexing
DATE: 4 Oct 2007

Duplicate Documents In An Index

The updateDocument method of Index Writer indicates that a delete term
occurs before the update

document takes place (i.e. the document is replaced in the index, but
not duplicated).    Has anyone

been able to get this process to work?  The term that I am using has a
unique key that comes directly

from the primary key of a database table.   But, my updated documents
are still consistently duplicated

in my index when the writer is eventually flushed.   I am tried using
Lucene 2.2 and nightly build

Lucene-2007-10-02_02-29-37 (which correctly includes the
setRamBufferSizeMB() method for Index Writer).

 

 

Optimizing An Index

Also, in the nightly build lucene-2007-10-02_02-29-37, the optimize()
method of Index Writer appears to

have been broken.  My existing code, which worked with Lucene 2.2,
consistently throws an illegal argument

exception when this method is executed.
