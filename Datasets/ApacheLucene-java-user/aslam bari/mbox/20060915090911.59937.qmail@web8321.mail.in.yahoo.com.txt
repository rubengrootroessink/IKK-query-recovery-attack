SUBJECT: Big Ducument Indexing Limit?
DATE: 15 Sep 2006

Dear all,
  I am trying to index a Xml file which has 6MB size. Does lucene support the big document
size. What is the limit of lucene Max file size to index. 
  Because when i check and trying to search in the indexed file. I am not able to get all
the results. It gives me some results but not others. I think Lucene has done partially indexed
and left the remaining part which it could not processed. IS IT RIGHT?. If not , then what
will be the problem.
  Thanks...
