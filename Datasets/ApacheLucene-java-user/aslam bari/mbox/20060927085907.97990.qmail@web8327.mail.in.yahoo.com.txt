SUBJECT: Can Lucene Index 50MB xml file
DATE: 27 Sep 2006

Dear all,
  I want to confirm that can Lucene index 50MB xml file. Or i have to change in source code
to make it work. Because i think there is some limits of tokens in Lucene. So it is not doing
indexing of whole document. Any Views? Where should i change in code.
