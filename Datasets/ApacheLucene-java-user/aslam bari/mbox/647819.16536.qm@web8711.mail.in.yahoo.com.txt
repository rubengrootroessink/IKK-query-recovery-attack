Subject: indexing rss feeds in multiple languages


Hi,



I saw that there are many post on the mailing list about indexing in multiple language, so
I will try to not post duplicate question. In my case, I want to index rss feeds, so one feed
contains several items in different languages, and some common data for all the items (date,
source..).  After reading the different posts, I think I will create a document per item,
index them in the same index using each time a language specific analyzer, and store lang
field for specific search. But I'm wondering how I should handle the common fields, it seems
I have two options:

1 : store the common data in each item. What happen if duplicate information are entered,
are they duplicate in the index ?



2 : create a separate document for the common data. In this case I will need to link these
data to all underlying items storing some ids. The issue is that I would need to search the
index twice if the search is done only per date, because I would need to retrieve the items
contents. 



Thank in advance for your help.



MÃ©lanie
