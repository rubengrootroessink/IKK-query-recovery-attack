SUBJECT: TextContentIndexer Problem
DATE: 18 Aug 2006

Dear All,
  I have used TextContentIndexer to Index my docs.It uses the TextContainsExpression Class
for searching. When i am using DASL search for a single word like:-
  "<D:where>" +
  "<D:contains>ques</D:contains>"+
  
  
  "</D:where>" +
   
  It gives the result successfully. But if i want to give complex query it gives the exception
like:-
  "<D:where>" +
  "<D:and>"+
  "<D:contains>ques</D:contains>"+
  "<D:contains>ques</D:contains>"+
  "</D:and>"+
  
  
  "</D:where>" +
   
  What is the problem.
  Thanks...
