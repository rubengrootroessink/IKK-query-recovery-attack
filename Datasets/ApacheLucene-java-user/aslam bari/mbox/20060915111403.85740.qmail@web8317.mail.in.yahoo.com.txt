SUBJECT: Re: Big Ducument Indexing Limit?
DATE: 15 Sep 2006

Dear Mititelu,
  Thanks for reply. Can you help me on some samll issue related to it.
  1) I am new to Lucene. Can you tell me where is this DEFAULT_MAX_FIELD_LENGTH variable available
and how to set it and for my purpose like 6-10MB file, how much i should set.
  2) how can i index all the words of XML file as Case Insensitive means either in lowercase
or in Uppercase. So that i can search case insensitive.
  3) I am using XmlContentExtractor. Actually it extract only Content of the xml tag. If i
want every thing (including XmlTag or contents or properties - attributes ) of xml file to
be indexed, where should i do change the code.

  Thanks...

  Yes. The default max limit for indexing tokens is 10,000. 
Look here http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#DEFAULT_MAX_FIELD_LENGTH

I am trying to index a Xml file which has 6MB size. Does lucene support the big document size.
What is the limit of lucene Max file size to index. 
Because when i check and trying to search in the indexed file. I am not able to get all the
results. It gives me some results but not others. I think Lucene has done partially indexed
and left the remaining part which it could not processed. IS IT RIGHT?. If not , then what
will be the problem.
Thanks...
