SUBJECT: NewBie:- Which Analyzer is best for Text and Number Indexing
DATE: 29 Dec 2006

Hello All,
 I m new to Lucene and want to know which anayzer to use for indexing the Text and Numbers
as well. But here is a problem.
I have a xml file which has text and numbers in values. I want to index some(special) nodes
value with [text and Numbers] but don't need all of the nodes to come in Number indexing,
they should go with default text indexing.

<City>
    <Garden>
        <Plot name="Rjmahal 765 Nodia" place="raghu 8988 ami">
        <Joy name="Hum 700 fdfd">
    </Garden>
</City>

In this Example , i need to index only Plot\name value "Rjmahal 765 Nodia" with text indexing
as well as number indexing. All other values should go text indexing. Because i need to search
only on Plot\names number like 765. I don't need to search on 8988 and 700 etc.

Any help will be appreciatable.

Thanks...
