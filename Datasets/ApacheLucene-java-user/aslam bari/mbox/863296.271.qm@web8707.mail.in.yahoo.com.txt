SUBJECT: Common Words ignoring problem
DATE: 19 Mar 2007

Hello All,
I am using StandarAnalyzer for indexing documents. Then i make a query to search some words
with And query. 
For example I need to search for a document which contains followings all words 
" this is garden".

I think when lucene index the document , it ignores some common words like "this, is , are
, am etc".  But when i say lucene to search all words including "this" AND "is" AND "garden"
, then it could not found that. Am i right? If yes , how to solve this problem.

Thanks...
