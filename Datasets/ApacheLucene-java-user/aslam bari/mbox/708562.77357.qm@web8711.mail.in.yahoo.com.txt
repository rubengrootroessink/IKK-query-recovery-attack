SUBJECT: Big size xml file indexing
DATE: 22 Jan 2007

Dear all,
I m using lucene to index xml files. For parsing i m using JDOM to get XPATH nodes and do
some manipulation on them and indexed them. All things work well but when the file size is
very big about 35 - 50 MB. Then it goes out of memory or take a lot of time. How can i set
some parameters to speed up and took less memory to parse the file. The problem is that i
cannot increase much high Heap Size. So i have to limit to use heap size of 300 - 500 MB.
Has anybody some solution for this.

Thanks...
