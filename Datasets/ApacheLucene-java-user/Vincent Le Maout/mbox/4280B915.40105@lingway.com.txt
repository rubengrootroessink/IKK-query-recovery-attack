SUBJECT: term boosting has no effect with span queries ?
DATE: 10 May 2005

Hi,

I'm trying to boost the score of documents containing some specific 
terms using the setBoost()
method of the class SpanTermQuery (actually inherited from the class 
Query) but this seems
to have no effect on the hits scores. Checking the way the scores are 
computed (by calling the
explain method or even digging in the source code), I found no reference 
to any boost value.
Is boosting a SpanTermQuery simply not possible ? Does it make sense to 
do so or did I
misunderstand the use of the SpanQuery ?

Thanks.

Vince
