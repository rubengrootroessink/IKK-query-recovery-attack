SUBJECT: Re: Boosting SpanQueries
DATE: 7 Jul 2005

Hi,

I met this problem a few months ago : trying to boost some words in 
SpanQuery seems
to have no effect, which was confirmed by looking at the source code (no 
reference to
boost in the scoring methods, at least as far as lucene 1.4.3 is 
concerned, correct me if
I am wrong). So my first question was, is that a bug or a feature ? if 
it is a feature is there
a way to implement something  as boosting allowing to enhance the score 
of documents
containing a particular word of a span query ?

Thanks.
Regards.

Vince
