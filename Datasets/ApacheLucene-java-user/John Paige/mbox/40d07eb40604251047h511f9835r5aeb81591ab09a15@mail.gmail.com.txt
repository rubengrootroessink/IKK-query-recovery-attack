SUBJECT: Clucene document parsers
DATE: 25 Apr 2006

Hello,
       Can somebody tell me what document parsers are available that can be
used with CLucene? I know for lucene, XML->Text, pdf->Text, doc->Text,
html->Text and RTF->Text all parsers are avilable. Have all of these been
ported to CLucene?

Thanks,
John
