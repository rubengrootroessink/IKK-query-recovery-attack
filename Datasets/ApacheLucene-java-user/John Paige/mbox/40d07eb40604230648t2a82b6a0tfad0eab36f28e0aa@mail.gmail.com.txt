SUBJECT: Segments creation
DATE: 23 Apr 2006

Hello all,
   In my application it is required to build an index for each user. We need
to add documents to the existing index frequently.
We cannot use RAMDirectory to create a RAM index and merge it with the
FSDirectory index later on based on the mergefactor. We need to add each
document in the FSDirectory based index.
We are afraid of getting into the "out of file descriptors" issue , so my
question is, does lucene create a segment for each document that gets added
to the FS based index i.e. will adding 10 documents to the existing index
create 10 segments?

Thanks,
John
