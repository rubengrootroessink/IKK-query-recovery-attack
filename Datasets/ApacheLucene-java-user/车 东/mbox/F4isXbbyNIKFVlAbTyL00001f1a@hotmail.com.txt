SUBJECT: Some articles Cutting wrote which I download from www.lucene.com
DATE: 30 Dec 2002

Hi Cutting:
Today, I found some articles Cutting wrote on search engine when clean up 
my documents. These articles I downloaded from www.lucene.com almost 1 and 
half years ago. 

I think these article are still very useful for today's search engine 
developers for reference. Hope some articles at 
http://lucene.sourceforge.net/publications.html can still be linked from 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/

I should say thanks to Cutting and all other lucene developers, I really 
learned a lot from this project.
 
Happy new year

Che, Dong
