SUBJECT: Optimize and Out Of Memory Errors
DATE: 22 Dec 2008

Recently, our lucene index version was upgraded to 2.3.1 and the index had to be rebuilt for
several weeks which made the entire index a total of 20 GB or so. 

After the the rebuild, a weekly sunday task was executed for optimization.

During that time, the optimization failed several times complaining about OOM errors but then
after a couple of tries, it completes.

So the entire index is now 1 segment that is 20 GB.

The problem is that any subsequent searches on that index fails with OOM errors at Lucene's
reading of bytes.

Our environment:
jvm Xmx1600 (This is the max we could set the box since it's windows)
8G Memory available on box
4G CPU (8 core) but only 12.5% is used. (Not sure if this would impact it)
Harddisk available is 120GB

mergeFactor, and other lucene config is set at default.

We
 checked this 20GB using luke and it has 400,000,000 documents in it. It was able to count
the docs however when we do the search in Luke it fails giving us OOM errors.

We also did the check index and the tool fails at the 20GB segment but succeeds on the others.

We've managed to rollback to a previously unoptimized index copy (about 20GB or so) and the
searches were find now. This unoptimized index is made up of several 8GB segments and a few
smaller segments.

However there is a big possibility that the optimization error could happen again... 

Does anybody have insights on why this is happening?
