Doug,
first of all thanks for all of your work!

If I write some code which is donatable (does this word really exist? 
;-)) I will do so. But I heard today that the project I was trying to 
extend with Lucene has been stopped. No more work for the next time on 
fulltext and Lucene. But maybe I'll find some sparetime and finish the 
work I was starting now.

Michael
