SUBJECT: Problem with search results
DATE: 2 Mar 2004

Hello,
I have now partly integrated my Oracle based web-application with Lucene 
but there is one search result I do not understand.

I'm using the Standardanalyzer for Document.add and for the 
QueryParser.parse methods.

One field in one document1 added as Field.Text contains "Sysh1"
One field in another document2 added as Field.Text contains "Sysh1-1"

If I search for Term("name", "sysh1") the result is correct: document1
If I search for Term("name", "sysh1-1") the result is not correct. It is 
also document1.

Has anyone an idea how this can happen?

Thanks
Michael
