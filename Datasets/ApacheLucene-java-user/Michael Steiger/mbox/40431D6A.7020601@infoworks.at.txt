SUBJECT: Best Practices for indexing in Web application
DATE: 1 Mar 2004

Hello Lucene Users,
I have a web application using Oracle as the database and I want to add 
fulltext query capablities. My idea was to extend the existing insert, 
update and delete methods of my backend classes to add, delete/add and 
delete respectively.

I'm new to Lucene and after a bit of googling and reading I found a few 
issues which I do not know how to resolve in the moment.

1. Concurrency of IndexWriter and IndexReader
It seems that it is not allowed to open an IndexWriter and an 
IndexReader at the same time. But if one user is changing records in the 
database (and therefore changing documents in the Lucene index) and 
another user is querying the index, I would need to open them both.

2. Optimizing the index
This is maybe related to my first issue.
I assume that while optimizing the index no queries are allowed. How 
often should the index be optimized?

Thanks in advance
Michael
