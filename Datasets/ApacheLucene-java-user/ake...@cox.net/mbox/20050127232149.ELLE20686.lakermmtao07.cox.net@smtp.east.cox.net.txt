SUBJECT: LuceneReader.delete (term t) Failure ?
DATE: 27 Jan 2005

Hi,

I am trying to delete a document from Lucene index using:

     Term aTerm = new Term( "uid", path );
     aReader.delete( aTerm );
     aReader.close();

If the variable path="xxx/foo.txt" then I am able to delete the document.  

However, if path variable has "-" in the string, the delete method does not work

  e.g. path="xxx-yyy/foo.txt"  // Does Not work!!


Can I get around this problem.  I cannot subsitute minus character with '.' as 
it has other implications.  

is this a bug ? I am using Lucene 1.4-final version.

Thanks for the help
Atul
