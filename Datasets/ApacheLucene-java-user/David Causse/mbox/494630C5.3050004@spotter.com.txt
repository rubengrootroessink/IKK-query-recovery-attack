Hi,

After adding fields, those fields are analyzed and this is the step you 
are looking for.
The payloads are stored on each Token, so you need your own Analyzer to 
do so.
just use reusableToken.setPayload(myPayLoad) somewhere, look at already 
existing analyzers.
In our case we use TokenStream and TokenFilters cause we have 
pre-analyzed Tokens.
It's very simple to use, the old api is self-explanatory, but this API 
seems in big move and methods are now deprecated and I couldn't 
understand the new API.

David.
