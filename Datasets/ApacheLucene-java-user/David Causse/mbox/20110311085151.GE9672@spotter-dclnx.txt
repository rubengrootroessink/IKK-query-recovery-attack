Hi,

We've made the same statement, so we switched to SerialMergeScheduler,
in our case lucene run in a managed container with lot of indexes and 
lot of of updates.
In some cases we noticed the creation of too much short lived thread,
(mostly due to a not so smart IW usage, the new NRT Reader helps in this
way).
A good idea would be MergeScheduler implementation that accept an
application controlled thread pool, some sort of
ExecutorServiceMergeScheduler.

Regards.
