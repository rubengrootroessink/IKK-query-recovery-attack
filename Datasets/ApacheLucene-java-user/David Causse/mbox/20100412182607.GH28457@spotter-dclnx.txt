Hi,

you are walking from indexReader.terms() then on indexReader.termDocs(Term t) 
for each term and then match your docID on the termsDocs enum? So you walk
the whole index?

You need a forward index and lucene is inverted but you have IMHO 2
solutions with lucene (sadly, they both require re-indexing):
 - Store the text you indexed, when you have to walk terms inside a doc,
   just, load that field and analyze it again.
 - Use a TermVector, when you create your content field use the
   constructor which accept the TermVector enum. You can then walk on it
   at search time : indexReader.getTermFreqVector(ID, fieldName)

Hope it helps.

tokens and their frequencies and the problem is that these stay in the heap as I move from
document to document.
