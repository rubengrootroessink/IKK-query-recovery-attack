Hi Karl,

The reset() problem is not very problematic I can adapt our TokenStreams.
For the Serialization : as we need to share very small indexes (200 docs 
max) in a cluster we need to serialize something.
I was planning to use the Java Serialization with maybe some compression 
on the resulting byte[] and as InstantiatedIndex is Serializable I was 
hoping to use the perf gain of your implementation in our context.
I will fix my working copy as you suggested.

Thank you.

David.
