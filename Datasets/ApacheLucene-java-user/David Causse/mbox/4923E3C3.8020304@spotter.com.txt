Hi,

Here are some differences I noticed between InstanciatedIndex and 
RAMDirectory :

- RAMDirectory seems to do a reset on tokenStreams the first time, this 
permits to initialise some objects before starting streaming, 
InstanciatedIndex does not.
- I can Serialize a RAMDirectory but I cannot on a InstantiatedIndex 
because of : java.io.NotSerializableException: 
org.apache.lucene.index.TermVectorOffsetInfo

Do you consider this as problems or normal features?

Thank you.

David.
