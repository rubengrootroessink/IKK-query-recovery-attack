Hi thanks for the suggestion. I am relatively new to Lucene, so I have a few
more questions on this implementation. I looked at the source code for
Lucene and found the TopDocCollector class. It appears this class derives
from the HitCollector class, so I should be able to simply extend
TopDocCollector and override the Collect method to simply check to see if I
have a document with the base URL already in collected and inserted. Here is
my psuedo code changes to the Collect method: 

            if (score > 0.0f) 
            { 

                // Do something here to get the document base URL
(doc.BaseURL) 

                if ((hq.Size() < numHits || score >= minScore)  &&
collectedBaseURLArray.Contains(doc.BaseURL)) 
                { 
                    collectedBaseURLArray.Add(doc.BaseURL); 
                    totalHits++; 
                    hq.Insert(new ScoreDoc(doc, score)); 
                    minScore = ((ScoreDoc) hq.Top()).score; // maintain
minScore 
                } 
            } 

Does this make sense? 

How could I tell the search to use my extended version of the
TopDocCollector class? Also, how would I pull the URL from the document
inside of the loop above? I didn't see any good documentation anywhere on
how to do that. There seems to be little information out there on how to
build your own custom collector. 

Thanks again, 
Mike
