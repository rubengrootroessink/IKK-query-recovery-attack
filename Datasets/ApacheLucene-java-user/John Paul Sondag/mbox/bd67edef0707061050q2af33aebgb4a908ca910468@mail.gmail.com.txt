SUBJECT: Re: Retrieve nearest token based off location in original Text
DATE: 6 Jul 2007

I thought that went to the "index" of the token.  I may not understand it
completely but this is how I currently view the TokenStream

For example if my text was the following:

This is an Example

This is index of 1, is has index 2, an has index 3 Example has index 4.
What I have is the actual "character position" in the original text.  "This"
is characters 0-3, "is" is characters 5-6, "an" is characters 8-9, and
"Example" is characters 11-17.  I know that given Token 4 (Example) I can
get the startOffset and endOffset (11, and 17).  What I'm wondering is given
character offset can I get a tokenIndex.  (I.E.  given character offset 12,
it would return 3, because Example is the closest token that starts at
character 12).
