SUBJECT: Re: Retrieve nearest token based off location in original Text
DATE: 5 Jul 2007

Hi,

I never got a response to this and thought maybe I was too wordy.

I'm wondering if there's a way where given a position in the original text
you can retrieve the token index that is nearest to that position using the
StandardToken/StandardTokenizer classes?
