SUBJECT: Re: Does Index have a Tokenizer Built into it
DATE: 13 Jul 2007

Ard,

I do have access to the URL's of the documents, but because I will be making
short snippets for many pages (suppose it had about 20 hits per page and I
need to make Snippets for each of them) I was worried it would be
inefficient to open each "hit" tokenize it and then make the Snippet, of
course the price of this may be worth the price of the increased Index
size.  I have been looking into storing "Field Vectors with positions" in
the index.  It seems that by doing this I will have access to everything
that the Tokenizer is giving me correct?   Will I need to store "term text"
in order to be able to access the actual term instead of stemmed words?

Thanks for all your help,

--JP
