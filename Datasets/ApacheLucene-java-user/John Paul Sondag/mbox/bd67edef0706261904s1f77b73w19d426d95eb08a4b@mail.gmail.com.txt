That solves getting the actual text but Token.  My other problem is that
Token also has "startOffset" and "endOffset" fields.    Standard Token has
"startColumn/Line" and "endColumn/Line" but I was not exactly sure how to
use these.  Could you possibly give me a small example of using these?  I
think I would be able to if I a line is always the same length
(startLine-1(line_length) + startColumn)

Thanks!
