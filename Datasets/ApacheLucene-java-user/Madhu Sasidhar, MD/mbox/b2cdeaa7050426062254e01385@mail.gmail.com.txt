SUBJECT: multi word synonym
DATE: 26 Apr 2005

I have found the previous discussions on multi word synonyms as as well as 
the section on synonym injection in Hatcher's book, but have not been able 
to come up with a satisfactory solution. I am indexing text that has several 
multi word synonyms. Some of the synonyms may have single words as one of 
the synonym. These words should only match for the appropriate multi word 
phrase searches - in other words, "chest pain", should only match a query 
for "chest pain" and not for "chest" or "pain". In addition, it will match 
angina (synonym). So, in this sentence:
Lab results for alpha 1 antitrypsin level....
I would like to index 'alpha-1-antitrypsin', 'antitrypsin', 'antitrypsin, 
alpha 1', 'A1AT' as synonyms for the phrase alpha-1-antitrypsin in the 
sentence. Thanks in advance...
