SUBJECT: Lucene write locks
DATE: 23 Jul 2008


Hi all..
I had a question related to the write locks created by Lucene.
I use Lucene 2.3.2. Will this newwer version create locks while indexing as
older ones?
or is there any other way that lucene handles its operations?

And my another doubt is that i use JMS for lucene indexing.
My App server will not do indexing but will pass the needed data for
indexing to the JMS server.
will there be any problem in indexing as its asynchronous?
plz help me..

thanks and regards,
Sand.
