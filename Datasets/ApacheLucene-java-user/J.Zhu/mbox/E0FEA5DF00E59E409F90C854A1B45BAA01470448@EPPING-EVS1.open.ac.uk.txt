SUBJECT: Implementation of BM25 in Lucene
DATE: 11 Aug 2006

Hi,
 
I have seen previous discussions on the implementation of BM25 in
Lucene, and still do not know the current progress on this. Could
anybody give me some guidance on this? Such as some work has been done
or where to start working on this. Thanks!
