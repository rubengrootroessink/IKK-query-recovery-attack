Hi, Chris,

Thanks. Does this page provides the right equation for span query based
similarity?

: The equation for similarity is given on this web page:
:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similari
: ty.html
:
: I would like to know what are the equations for similarity if the
query
: is a span or boolean query.

That equation does cover BooleanQueries -- the "coord" factor is a
BooleanQuery concept -- strictly speaking that equation describes the
basics of a boolean query containing multiple term queries.

beyond that, the calculations can get a little hard to discribe in
generic equations -- the best way to understand the score calculations
for any of the other query types (including the Span queries) is to look
at the "Explanation.toString()" output for a query on a matching
document -- and consult the code for the corisponding Scorer class to
see if there are any special cases you might not be noticing becuase of
the particular query/doc explanation you are looking at (ie: query
boosts, the coord factor on a boolean query, etc...)
