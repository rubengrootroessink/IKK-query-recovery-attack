SUBJECT: lucene and web services?
DATE: 5 Nov 2006

Has anyone successfully implemented a web services front end to remotely
search a Lucene index? I've tried to do it with the Xfire stuff in
MyEclipse, but their default Aegis xml mapping stuff doesn't support the
Lucene Hits object. I'd like to avoid searching a remote index via RMI, but
for now it works. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Thanks!

Bob
