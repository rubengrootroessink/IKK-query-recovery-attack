SUBJECT: Re: 2.0 and Tokenized versus UN_TOKENIZED
DATE: 5 Nov 2006

Thanks. That helps, but I've tried a lot of combinations and I forget now.
I'm using StandardAnalyzer for the index and query.I can't say for sure if
I've tried other cases. The specific combination is lastname:rhodes AND
city:"EAGLE RIVER" AND state:AK, Before TOKENIZED no match after TOKENIZED
match. Is there something special I need to do to ensure that EAGLE RIVER is
kept in the same field? I'm a newbie, admittedly, but I've learned a lot
since Friday. Thanks for the help.
