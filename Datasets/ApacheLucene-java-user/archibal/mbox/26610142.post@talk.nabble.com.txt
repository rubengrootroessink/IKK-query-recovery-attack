Hello all,

I'm actually looking for a software who can search in a computer (and on
windows network drive) all files and the contents of files based on indexing
method.

I have few questions about lucene :

- Lucene engine does index only the contents ? or is it possible to index
the name of folders, name of files and their contents ?
-Lucene is an API ? 
-optionnally i want to have a central server which index all data (name of
files, folders and file content) on network and i would like to connect via
a browser on the central server ? are there project who does this or
something like ?

Thanks in advance
Best Regards

Patrick
