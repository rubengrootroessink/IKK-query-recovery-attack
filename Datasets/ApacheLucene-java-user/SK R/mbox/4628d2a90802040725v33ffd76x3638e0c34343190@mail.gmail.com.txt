SUBJECT: outof memory error
DATE: 4 Feb 2008

Hi,
   I got outof memory exception while  indexing  huge documents (~1GB) in
one thread and optimizing some other (2 to 3) indexes in different threads.
Max JVM heap size is 512MB. I'm using lucene2.3.0.

   Please suggest a way to avoid this exception.

Regards
  RSK
