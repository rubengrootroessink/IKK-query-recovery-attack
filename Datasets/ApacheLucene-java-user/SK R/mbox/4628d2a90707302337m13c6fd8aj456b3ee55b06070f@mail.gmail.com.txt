SUBJECT: How to get FastAnalyzer?
DATE: 31 Jul 2007

Hi,
    During my search on alternative for StandardAnalyzer , I got some useful
information about JFlex based FastAnalyzer in this user-group. I tried to
get corresponding files from
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-966  . But they are in txt
format and how can i get and test that improved analyzer?(please provide the
steps)
    Also is there any known issues for usage of that analyzer?


Thanks & Regards
RSK
