SUBJECT: Does Lucene search over memory too?
DATE: 28 May 2007

Hi,
    Does Lucene search FSDirectory as well as buffered in-memory docs while
we are calling searcher.search(query)?
    Why I'm asking this is, I've indexed my doc with mergeFactor &
Max.Buff.Docs = 50 and I've optimized and closed it at mid-night
only.Beforeoptimization, my search gives partial matches and it does
not give matches
which is in memory.

    To get all matches (inclusive of matches in memory),what i have to do?
    Shall I use writer.flush() to resolve this?

Thanks in Advance
             RSK
