Hi,
    How to get term frequency of multi terms in particular document? Any API
method other than using TermVector may help?
    Also How to calculate termfreq. of time range. i.e : If my index have a
field "TIME" with values in millis  (like 1176281188000).,  and I want to
calculate term freq. of 1176281188000 to 1176281196838. Does it possible
with Lucene?

    Please help me to give your valuable suggestion.

Thanks
