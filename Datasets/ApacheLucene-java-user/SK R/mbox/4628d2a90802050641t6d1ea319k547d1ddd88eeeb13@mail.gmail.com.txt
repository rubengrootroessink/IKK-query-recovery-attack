DATE: 5 Feb 2008

Hi,
   Thanks for your help Erick.

   I changed my code to flush writer before document add which helps to
reduce memory usage.
   Also reducing mergefactor and max buffered docs to some level help me to
avoid this OOM error (eventhough index size is ~1GB).

But please clarify below doubts

Make sure you flush your IndexWriter before attempting to index this
document.

 - Is it good to call writer.flush() before adding every document into
writer? Doesn't it affect performance of indexing or search? Whether it's
also similar to setting MaxBufferDocs=1?

    Also guide me which one is relatively good (take less time & memory)
among this
        (i) create 4 indexes each of 250MB and merge them to single index
file by using writer.addIndexes(..)
        (ii) create a 1GB index & optimize it?

Thanks & Regards
RSK
