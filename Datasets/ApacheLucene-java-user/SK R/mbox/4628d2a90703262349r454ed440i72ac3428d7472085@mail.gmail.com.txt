SUBJECT: what's the use of proximity data?
DATE: 27 Mar 2007

Hi,
    Please clarify my doubts.
    What's the use of storing proximity data internally while indexing? Is
it only for score calculation or any other additional purpose?
    How lucene  handles phrase query? Whether it's depend on proximity data
of phrase terms or any other?

Thanks & Regards
RSK
