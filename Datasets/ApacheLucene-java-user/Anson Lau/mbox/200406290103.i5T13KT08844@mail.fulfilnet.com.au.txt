SUBJECT: best ways of using IndexSearcher
DATE: 29 Jun 2004

Hi Guys,

What's the recommended way of using IndexSearcher? Should IndexSearcher be a
singleton or pooled?  Would pooling provide a more scalable solution by
allowing you to decide how many IndexSearcher to use based on say how many
CPU u have on ur server?

Thanks,

Anson
