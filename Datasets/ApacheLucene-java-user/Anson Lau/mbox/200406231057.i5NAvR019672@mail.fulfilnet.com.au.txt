Hi guys,

It seems like to really customise the scoring in lucene, one will have to go
into the lucene source.

I spend a fair bit of time looking into this and it seems to me not the full
scoring api is exported.  The formula documented on the Similarity class
seems to explain how a term is scored, but not, for example, how the final
score on a Boolean query is computed from each individual component. (Please
correct me if I'm wrong).  Normalisation is another part where the API is
not exported.

Hello Anson,

I would look at IndexSearcher's explain method:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/IndexSear
cher.html#explain(org.apache.lucene.search.Query,%20int)

This should give you insight into what's contributing to the high/low
scores, thus telling you what you can tweak.  Perhaps it's just the
boost, perhaps some other similarity factors.

Using explain should provide you information such as this, for example:
http://www.mozdex.com/explain.jsp?idx=2&id=2067257&query=goober

I hope this helps.  Somebody else will probably be able to give more
information, but this should get you started while you wait.
