SUBJECT: number of fields, size of fields
DATE: 17 Feb 2004

Hi All,

I'm a beginner with Lucene.  I would like to know if there are general
guidelines on:

1. the number of field a document can have
2. size of unindexed fields
3. size of a stored text field

I just want to get a feel for what are the good practices.

Thanks,

Anson Lau
