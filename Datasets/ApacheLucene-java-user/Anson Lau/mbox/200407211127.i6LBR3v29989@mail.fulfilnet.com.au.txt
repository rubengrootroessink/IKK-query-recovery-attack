Depending on what MySQL Full-text search support you probably will lose some
of the advance things you get for free from Lucene, such as proximity
search, wildcard search, search term and search field boosting, scoring of
the documents, etc.

Afterall it depends on what you need to do.  In our dev team we are actually
currently having a mini debate over whether to use lucene for our project or
write something from scratch that's based on a DB.

We need really good performance. I feel lucene can do our job very well,
some of our guys feel using a DB based search can give us greater
performance on the type of search we do.

I'd say that MySQL full text is much slower if you have a lot of
data... that is one of the reasons we started using lucene (We had a
mysql db to do the search), it's way faster!
