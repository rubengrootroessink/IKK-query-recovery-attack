Has anyone tried splitting up an index into smaller chunks, without putting
the different indicies on a different physical disk/box?  What sort of
performance gain do you get from it?

In general, yes.
By splitting up a large index into smaller indicies, you are
linearizing the search time.
Furthermore, that allows you to make your search distributable.
