SUBJECT: a list of matching search term
DATE: 1 Jun 2004

Hi All,

Eg. Lets say someone do a search on the terms 'apple orange banana'.

In the search results, is it possible to find out for each hit, which of
those terms did match?

Ie. The document with the highest score has all three words so the matching
terms are all of those words.

A lesser document may only have 'apple' and 'orange' inside it.  So the
matching terms will be 'apple' and 'orange'.


Thanks,

Anson
