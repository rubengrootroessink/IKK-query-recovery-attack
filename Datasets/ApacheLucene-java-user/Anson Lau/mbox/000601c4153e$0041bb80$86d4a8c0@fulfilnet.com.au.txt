Esmond,

Thanks a lot for your email.  Will certainly consider that - do you know
another 1-2 person who also knows Lucene very well, who you can work
with in case we need another person?  No point having 1 developer in
Sydney and one in Melbourne.

To give you a bit more background - we'll be indexing and searching a
database of approx 1.5 million records.  Do you have experience with
this sort of scale?  I don't and I am specifically looking for people
with that.

Thanks,

Anson

I have very strong Lucene experience, covering 1.2, 1.3, and the current
1.4-almost-an-RC, having built search engines for several web sites with
it.

I'm located in Melbourne & not very able to change that, but if you
don't
get other bites maybe we can talk about telecommuting & the occasional
day
trip?
