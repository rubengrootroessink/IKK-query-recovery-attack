RBP,

I'm implementing a search engine for a project at work.  It's going to
index approx 1.5 rows in a database.

I am trying to get a feel of what my options are when scalability
becomes an issue.  I also want to know if those options require me to
implement my app in a different way right from the start.

More details about what you are attempting would be helpful.
