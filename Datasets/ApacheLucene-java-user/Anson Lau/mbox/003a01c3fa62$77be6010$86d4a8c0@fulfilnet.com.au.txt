I'm trying to see what are some common ways to scale lucene onto
multiple boxes.  Is RMI based search and using a MultiSearcher the
general approach?

There doesn't seem to be many articles on the web on how to implement a
lucene search cluster.  If anyone knows a good article can you please
post it here?

Thanks,

Anson

I assume you are referring to RMI based search? It works well as does
MultiSearcher.
