DATE: 21 Jul 2004

Hello guys,

What are some general techniques to make lucene search faster?

I'm thinking about splitting up the index.  My current index has approx 1.8
million documents (small documents) and index size is about 550MB.  Am I
likely to get much gain out of splitting it up and use a
multiparallelsearcher?

Most of my search queries search queries search on 5-10 fields.

Are there other things I should look at?

Thanks to all,
Anson
