DATE: 8 Jun 2011

Hi all,

I am getting confused in this thing,

Let say I make a lucene index using a document having a key field (which I
am storing as well as indexing)
and rest of my fields I am just indexing.

When I make some query what would be my result?
Will it be the field which I am storing or it can be anything?
