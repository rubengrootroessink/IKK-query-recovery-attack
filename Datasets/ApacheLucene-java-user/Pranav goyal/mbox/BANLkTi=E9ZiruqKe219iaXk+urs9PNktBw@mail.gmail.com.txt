SUBJECT: Lucene Searching
DATE: 22 Jun 2011

Hi all,

I am in a fix regarding lucene search. I know a little bit about lucene and
have successfully created index and searched a lot of queries on that.
My main worry is that whenever I search for let say "000" it doesn't give me
any result while if I seach for "00000341" it'll give me a hit. Even if I
search for 341 it doesn't give me anything.

I have checked through luke also and luke is also showing no results.

Do I have to use some different analyzer? Currently I am using Keyword
Analyzer.

Thanks
Pranav
