Hi Danny,

I have explained it above.

It has many fields out of which DocId is the field which I am storing as
well as indexing. While other fields I am just storing.
And Each document has unique DocId.

d=new Document();
File indexDir = new File("./index-dir");
StandardAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_31);
IndexWriterConfig conf = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_31, analyzer);
try {
      writer = new IndexWriter(FSDirectory.open(indexDir),conf);
} catch (IOException e1) {
     e1.printStackTrace();
}
String q1 = contract.getDocId();    // Here I am getting my DocId
Term term = new Term("DocID",contract.getDocId());


Rest I have stated above.
