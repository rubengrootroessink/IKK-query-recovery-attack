IndexHTML.java is located in the demo jarfile which is named differently
depending on whether you built it yourself with Ant or just downloaded it
ready-jarred.

What do you mean by "default URL"? The location of the document-set to
index, the location of the document-set to search (presumably through
index.jsp in the samples), or the URL of the lucene application as seen
through Tomcat?

Not sure if this is the right address, to request this
kind of help, so if it isn't please point me else
where.

Basically I think I have an understanding of how
Lucene works, in general.

I believe I'm at a point where I need to change the
"default" url, so I was planning to make the change in
the IndexHTML.java file. However I don't know where
that file is located. I've already done the simple, a
seacrh of my HD, and renaming the files etc... Hasn't
helped. Any pointers would be appreciated.
Thanks, B
