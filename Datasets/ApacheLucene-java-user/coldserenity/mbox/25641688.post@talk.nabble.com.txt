Hello Eric, 

  Thank you for help. We did use Luke and all the examples I've provided are
from there.
  The issue has been unexpectedly solved :)

  As I've already mentioned, we use Lucene with Compass and following
configuration was used to specify the field as "untokenized" 
         <property name="path" managed-id-index="not_analyzed">
            <meta-data>rootKey</meta-data>
            <meta-data>path</meta-data>
        </property>
  Changing it to the following prevented Lucene from seeing the "rootKey" as
a set of tokens split by '/' character.
        <property name="path">
            <meta-data index="not_analyzed">rootKey</meta-data> <!--
not_analyzed: tell compass that the field is untokenized -->
        </property>
  So the problem was in how we configured Compass. 
  
  To conclude, our solution to this problem is: "Set field as 'untokenized'
and use StandardAnalyzer".

  Again, thanks for your help!

Regards,
  Roman
