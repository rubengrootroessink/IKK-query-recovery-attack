SUBJECT: Search with wild-cards by words with forward-slash ("/")

Hello,
  
    I've been searching the forum and found several more or less relevant
topic listed below.

    However they did not help me much and that's why I've decided to start a
separate topic.

    Basically what I need to do, is to be able to search '/' (forward slash)
symbol much the same as any alpha-numeric symbol AND with using wildcards.
E.g. if I have following records in my index
      1 |  /cat1
      2 |  /cat1/test
      3 |  /cat1/tea
      4 |  /cat2/test
    Search by
      /cat1* - will return records 1, 2, 3
      /cat1/test - will return record 2
      /cat1/t* - will return records 2, 3
      /cat1/t - will return no records

    I use Lucene with Compass. The searched property is indexed as
"untokenized".
    I have tried using StandardAnalyzer and KeywordAnalyzer but got the
following in the 

    Results from testing
org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer
        Search string:             rootKey:/cat1/te*
        Rewritten search string:   rootKey:/cat1/te*
        Found results          :   0

        Search string:             rootKey:/cat1/test
        Rewritten search string:   rootKey:"cat1 test"
        Found results          :   1

        Search string:             rootKey:/cat1/te
        Rewritten search string:   rootKey:"cat1 te"
        Found results          :   0

    Results from testing org.apache.lucene.analysis.KeywordAnalyzer
        Search string:             rootKey:/cat1/te
        Rewritten search string:   rootKey:/cat1/te
        Found results          :   0

        Search string:             rootKey:/cat1/te*
        Rewritten search string:   rootKey:/cat1/te*
        Found results          :   0

    So it looks like Lucene internally replaces the '/' with whitespace when
searching however I did not find any "replace symbol" code in the source
code of StandardAnalyzer, neither I had much luck in finding that place
during debugging the Lucene sources.
    
    With that all said, I would appreciate any hint on how this task could
be accomplished.
    
Regards,
  Roman
