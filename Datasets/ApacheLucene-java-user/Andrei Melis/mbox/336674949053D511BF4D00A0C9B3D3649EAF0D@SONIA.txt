SUBJECT: Wildcard workaround
DATE: 28 May 2003

Hello all,
 
As far as I have understood, lucene does not allow search queries starting
with wildcards.
I have a file database indexed by content and also by filename. It would be
nice if the user could perform a usual search like "*.ext".
 
Anybody tried a workaround for this issue ? ( this is needed only for the
name of the file, for the rest of the terms the rules are fine with me)
 
I assume that this will produce a decrease of search speed... is this
correct ?
 
 
10q,
Andrei
