Hi Pete,

For pdf try PageMark - http://www.etymon.com ( I'm not sure if it's free,
but there is some downloadable source code)
For Excel try JexcelApi - http://www.andykhan.com or Jakarta POI -
http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/

Hi all,

I have a rather nice html parser that I got from SourceForge.  Does anyone
know of any good parsers for pdf and Microsoft Office Suite (.doc, .ppt,
.xls, etc), any help would be much appreciated.
