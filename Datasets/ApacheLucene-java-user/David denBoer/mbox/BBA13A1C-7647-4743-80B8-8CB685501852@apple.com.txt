Hi all,

We are havign a small problem searching for text with accents in the  
query. Our index has a word like 'agréé', and when we search for it,  
we get no results.

The query parses (using Snowball) to :
'name:"agr\213 \213"'

Using the ISOLatin filter, we get :
'name:agra'

neither gets any results.

When I perform the search using Luke, I get the expected results.

Is there something I am not doing right? I swear this worked with  
Lucene 1.4.3 and is not working anymore, but it has been a while...

Thanks,
David.
