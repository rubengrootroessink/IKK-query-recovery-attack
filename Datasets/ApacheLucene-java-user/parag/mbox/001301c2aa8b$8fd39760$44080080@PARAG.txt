SUBJECT: Searching on title...
DATE: 23 Dec 2002

Hi all,

This may be very trivial question for the Gurus.

But can I use Field.Text() for indexing the title of the document so that when user hits on
any word for the searching 
then result would yield the title which contains the word that user has queried.

So I can write as,

Field.Text("fileUniqeId",title);
where title is String which holds the actual title for the document.

Am I right in conclusion??

Hope to get some help....


Regards
Parag
