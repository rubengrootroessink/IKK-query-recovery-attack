Ok, Lucene 1.4.1 has been uploaded to Debian. Hopefully it will have
enough time to percolate before the sarge release.

Now that that is taken care of, I'm curious about the status of gcj
compilation. Packaging Lucene as a native library might be useful for
projects such as PyLucene, and it is also advantageous for license
reasons i.e. avoiding the non-free JVM dependency. What's the current
gcj compilation recipe? The best I could find on Google (below) seems
a little bit stale.
