I have packaged Lucene such that 'ant javacc' is called at package
build time. I now see the problem - 'import java.io.*;' has been
removed from StandardTokenizer.jj in Lucene 1.4.1.  When I put that
line back in, things build fine.

Now that I know what the problem is, I'll go ahead and patch the Debian 
package. Please make sure the Lucene codebase gets fixed as well.

Cheers,
Jeff
