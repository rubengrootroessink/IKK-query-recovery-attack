Hi Otis,

Thanks for the reply but I have one question to ask here. You said big no no
for opening opening multiple IndexWriters. I want to clarify :-
1) Do you mean multiple IndexWriters at the same time? I am not doing this.
At a time there is only one Indexwriter opened.
or
1) Do you mean I cant open another IndexWriter again after closing the prior
one. In my writing thread, for every file I index, I open a new IndexWriter
and close it and as soon as I have second file available for indexing. I
open the IndexWriter again and close it and directory object is the same
across all the threads as well as while reopening IndexWriters.

If the latter is NO too, then how would a developer make sure that this
index is closed when the Program is killed. Suppose a program is killed in
between and Index is not closed, then next time when I run the program there
will be a write.lock in Index and it won't allow us to open another index.

Please let me know if I am wrong in what I said.

Thanks
-Nikhil
