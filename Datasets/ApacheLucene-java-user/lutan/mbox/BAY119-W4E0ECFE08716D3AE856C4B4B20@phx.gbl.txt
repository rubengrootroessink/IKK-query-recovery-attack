Yes ,I have test again with same entironment but to use singleton IndexSearcher.the  performance

has increased. there 100 concurrent user request use different keyword ,and get 60 TPS(2 TPS
before).
and now the bottleneck  seem to be CPU,and the CPU using approach 100%.and both RAM(using
70MB average),
HD using as normal.

Could I consider that as long as I have a larger capacity RAM ,and I 
will get a good performance.

How much RAM is available for disk-cache, when the machine is running?> 
 
 
I don't understand  " for disk-cache" meaning  very  clear.Could you please
explain it again.Thanks a lot!(does't cache on RAM?)
 does warm-up  ==  cache?
 how many docs do lucene will be cached default?and could I control the cache size?
 
I am new to lucene ,maybe my questions  looks  not professional.
forgive me.
