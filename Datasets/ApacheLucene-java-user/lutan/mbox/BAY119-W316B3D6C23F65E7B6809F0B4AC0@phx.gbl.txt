The performance increase dependents on your suggestion.
Today I hava another tesing,and using  RemoteSearchable(code like 
the example of <lucene in action> supply).
app runing setps:
1,A customer request a keyword to web(JBoss:192.168.0.1). 
2,JBoss call RMIServer(192.168.0.2)(the index file on it).
other tesing entironment as same as before.
 
the result:
loadrunner: 300 concurrent user(I find one user ,one TCP/IP 
connection  form WebServer  to  RMIServer),
and  the TPS got 180+,web response time is
 about 2 second average. both WebServer and RMIServer
 has being using as normal of 
cpu(50%),ram(not full).
 
the performance almost  achieve thrice !
 It's amazing to me:)
I consider the method of RMI would hava low performance(
because of expensively net using),
but the  result is really puzzled me  :(

I have understand it by your reply,thanks a lot.
