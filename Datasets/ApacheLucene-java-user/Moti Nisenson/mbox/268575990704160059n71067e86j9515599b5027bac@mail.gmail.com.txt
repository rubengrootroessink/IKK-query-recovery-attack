SUBJECT: Merging Indeces
DATE: 16 Apr 2007

Hi,

I was wondering if the addIndexes() method in IndexWriter can be used for
updating documents.

Specifically, I'd like to leave my primary index alone during the update
process. Instead, I want to use a separate index (on a RAMDirectory), and to
make the updateDocument() calls on it and finally to merge the changes to
the primary index. This leads to several questions:

1) If I make an updateDocument call and the document isn't present in the
separate index, will it fail?
2) After I merge the indeces, will the documents in the primary index be
updated (i.e. deleted and then added if existing, otherwise just added)?
3) If the merge does update the primary index, does it all occur in a single
transaction?

Thanks for the help!

Moti
