Does Snowball (English) support "filenames?"

ex. Authenicate.dll does not return a "hit" if the keyword  
"authenticate" (without ".dll") is used.

("authenticate*" or authenticate.dll works though)

Is there anyway to get around this?  How come the Snowball demo  
(http://snowball.tartarus.org/demo.php) seems to work?

ex.
I entered the following in the textbox:

authenticate.dll
authenticate
authentication

and I got back:

authenticate -> authent
dll -> dll
authenticate -> authent
authentication -> authent

Thanks in advance.
