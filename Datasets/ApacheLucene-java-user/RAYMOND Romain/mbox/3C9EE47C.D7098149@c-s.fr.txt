SUBJECT: Field search matching exact and partial occurence AND GETTING BACK OCCURENCES from index ?
DATE: 25 Mar 2002

Hello,
I use PrefixQuery to match occurence of a word, and now I would like to
get back the occurences matiching within the index ...

Is there a way to do it using Lucene without getting back the indexed
content to find occurences inside it ?


Thanks.
