SUBJECT: Problem searching number ?????
DATE: 25 Mar 2002


Queries using operator (AND, ...) are good on my applications but when I
have to realize treatments
on numbers (sometimes I index as Field.text values as "OM13001", ...)
and when I try to do a query
(I use simpleAnalyser for my queries ...) using those values (numbers
mixed with letters) I cant
understand the results given ????

Any ideas ????

thanks.
