Hello Scott!

I think your index is just not large really. My Sharehound's indexes of my
corporate LAN is about 10G/10mlns of (really small) documents now, and queries
get really little time, less than a second for non-sorted queries and some more
for sorted. The machine is some P4 with 1G RAM. I use just FSDir.

Best regards,
Artem.

SS> Anyone have any thoughts about this?
