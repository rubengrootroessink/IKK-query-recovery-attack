Hello Xia,

XD> what's the difference from dotLucene?

Why dotLucene? dotLucene is the .Net port of Lucene, so your question
is pretty much the same as 'what's the difference from Lucene?'
dotLucene as Lucene itself is not a search application, it's a
library, so that's the difference :).

Some of the differences from other free LAN search applications I saw:
- information about deleted files is indexed
- RSS subscription to search results (so you can track files in a
  subdirectories of a given directory for instance optionally
  filtering them by some words)
- it uses Lucene and written in Java, so it's portable, has clean
  and powerfull query syntax and good performance characteristics.
