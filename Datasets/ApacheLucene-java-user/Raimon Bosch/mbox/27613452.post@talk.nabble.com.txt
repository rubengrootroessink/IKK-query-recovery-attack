Hi,

Which is the exactly objective of compareBottom and setBottom functions. I
am using a higher numHits to create TopScoreDocCollectors and
TopFieldCollectors because I don't understand properly this function.

I think that is a filter to send less documents to sort in comparators, but
I don't get a way to maximize this amount of documents without forcing
numHits. If we use a simple comparation the sorter is always sorting our
most relevant document, so maybe we need a pseudo-random function? We are
interested in sort a big amount of documents.

Thanks in advance,
Raimon Bosch.
