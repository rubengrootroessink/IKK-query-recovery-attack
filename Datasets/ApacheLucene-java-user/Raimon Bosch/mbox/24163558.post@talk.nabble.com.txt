Hi!

We are doing a migration from ScoreDocComparator to FieldComparator in order
to get better performance and try its new features. I was wondering how we
can acces to ScoreDoc's of a document inside FieldComparator. Can we use 
FieldComparator as ScoreDocComparator?

Thanks in advance,
Raimon Bosch.
