Thank you for the reply Aditya,

Continuing to what Matt said, answer to your question: there is no direct
<br />library to give this.
<br />Also try sandbox based "highlight" related code base.
<br />

<br />Well, when you get the Document object, you have access to the fields in 
<br />that document, including the text that was searched against.
<br />
<br />You could simply retrieve this string, and then use simple java String 
<br />manipulation to get what you want.
