DATE: 30 Apr 2009

Hi,
I am new to Lucene and I want to get the similarity between two vectors of strings,is there
a method, who do that?
for example if i have the vectors:
Vector1 :<"term1","term2","term3">
Vector2:<"term4","term5","term5">
is there a method to get the similarity between them in lucene,or is there any other way to
do it?
for esample: MethodName(Vector1,Vector2).
Thanks in advance.
kamal.
