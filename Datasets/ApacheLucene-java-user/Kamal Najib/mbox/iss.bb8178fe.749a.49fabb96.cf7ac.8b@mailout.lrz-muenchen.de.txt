Thanks Anshum Gupta for the reply,
"As per my knowledge, you'd have to index one of the docs  and then run a
query (second doc) to get the similarity score."

which docs do you mean?  do you mean i have to create a doc for each Vector, do you mean somthing
like this:
Vector1 =<"term1","term2","term3"> --->doc1.add("id",new Field ("term1"+"term2"+"term3",Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
Vector2 =<"term4","term5","term6"> --->doc1.add("id",new Field ("term4"+"term5"+"term6",Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
or 
Vector1 =<"term1","term2","term3"> --->
doc1.add("id",new Field("term1",Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
doc1.add("id",new Field("term2",Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
doc1.add("id",new Field("term3",Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED));

Vector2 =<"term4","term5","term6"> --->
doc1.add("id",new Field ("term4",Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
doc1.add("id",new Field ("term5",Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
doc1.add("id",new Field ("term6",Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED));

and then get the similarity score between the two docs?
please help.
thanks in advance.

<br />Also, the default similarity would take into account more factors than the

<br />You may write code that on the fly creates a volatile index, runs a query,
<br />returns the similarity and clears the index (which would happen implicitly
