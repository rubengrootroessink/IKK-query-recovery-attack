Hi, 
A am new in Lucene and I want to get the similarity between two vectors of strings,is there
a method, who do that? 
for example assume the vectors: 
Vector1 :<"term1","term2","term3"> 
Vector2:<"term4","term5","term5"> 
is there a method to get the similarity between them in lucene,or is there any other way to
do it? 
for esample: getTheSymilarity(Vector1,Vector2). 
Thanks in advance. 
kamal.
