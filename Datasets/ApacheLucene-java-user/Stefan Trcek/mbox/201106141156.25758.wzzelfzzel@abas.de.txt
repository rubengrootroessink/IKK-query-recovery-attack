For database (enterprise resource planning) applications we are in 
progress of replacing native database queries to lucene queries, 
because lucene offers an efficient combination of fulltext and 
structured (including facets) queries. Til now clients expect that if 
they change something it will be immediately reflected in their "lists" 
aka queries.

If lucene reopen() won't be sufficient in performance (I didn't measure) 
we would solve it by an additional short lived index for new objects, 
which complicates the architecture, or by modifying the merge strategy.

Absolutely, if you build an internet search engine. For our closed world 
with numbered clients search speed doesn't have that impact. It must 
scale for one client on one cpu core - and buy as many cores as 
necessary.
