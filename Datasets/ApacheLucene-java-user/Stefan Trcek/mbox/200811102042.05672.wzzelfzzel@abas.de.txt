Doooh - new api, but it's facet counting sounds good.

Any starting points for moving from plain lucene to Solr in a smooth 
way? I doubt whether it is possible to integrate the facet counting 
part of Solr into my plain lucene application?

For searching: Do I have to have a Solr server (servlet engine) running 
or will EmbeddedSolrServer and SolrQuery do the job?

For indexing: Can I use a ready to use lucene index in Solr?
