I don't do drop in but recompile anyway, so it doesn't matter for me.
It is only important that the documentation is clear about what has to 
be done.

Nevertheless I prefer B because the deprecation changes per release will 
be smaller and maybe even grouped by topic. I prefer advancing step by 
step. A bunch of deprecated API parts even hinders reading and 
understanding the API. So, the sooner they are gone, the better.
