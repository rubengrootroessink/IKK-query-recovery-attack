SUBJECT: Get info wheter a field is multivalued
DATE: 17 Mar 2010

Hello

Is there an api that indicates whether a field is multivalued, just like 
IndexReader.getFieldNames(IndexReader.FieldOption fldOption) does it 
for fields beeing indexed/stored/termvector?

Of course I could track it at index time.

Stefan
