Can this paragraph go to the docs?
May be I missed it, but I stumpled upon "out of order" and "in order" 
several times and wasn't sure what will be the consequence of the 
decision. Not even sure what will be the "don't care" case.

I like "don't care" options like "Version.LUCENE_CURRENT" very much.
It allows the library to do the best if I don't care.
