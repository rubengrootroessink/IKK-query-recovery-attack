I'd do, but was not successful to get the svn repo some months ago. I 
have to claim the sys admin for any svn repo to open a door through the 
firewall. Gave up due to

$ nmap -p3690 svn.apache.org
    PORT     STATE    SERVICE
    3690/tcp filtered unknown

But I got the git repo at http://git.apache.org/lucene.git/
That works out of the box. So the remaining hurdle is to create the 
patches. If there is no way to accept git patches (see attachment, they 
are somewhat different) I'd try to setup the git-svn bridge locally, 
just to create the patches.
