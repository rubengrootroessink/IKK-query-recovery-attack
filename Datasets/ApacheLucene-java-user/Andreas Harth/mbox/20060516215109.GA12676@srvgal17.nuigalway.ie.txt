Hello,

I'd like to learn a bit more about the index organization of
Lucene (ideally without sifting through source code).

Are there any publications that explain the Lucene indexing
structure in detail?  Or is it possible to say in a few sentences
how Lucene works and I can look up the details in a text book
(e.g. Baeza-Yates/Ribeiro-Neto)?

Many thanks in advance!

Regards,
Andreas.
