Bad mail-quoting, sorry. I am not interested by document deletion, I 
just index Wikipedia once, and want to get a co-occurrence-based 
similarity distance between words called NGD (normalized google 
distance). No documents get deleted. I wanted to do it the cheap way by 
indexing everything and than counting hits but it's not fast enough (I 
want to calculate all distances between all the words, that is approx 
10,000 x 10,000 comparisons).

This similarity measure is based on co-occurence within a text window. 
If I'm not mistaken, bigrams require the words to be exactly next to 
each other. But thanks for pointing out that analyzer, I may be 
interested in some n-grams processing later.
