AFAIK, you cannot share one instance of TermPositions, but each of your 
thread may have its own dedicated instance, so each will start with a 
different call to skipTo or seek before consuming

Anyway the I/O will be a problem: you can have a 16 way server, but if 
your index is on one harddrive, that will be your bottleneck
