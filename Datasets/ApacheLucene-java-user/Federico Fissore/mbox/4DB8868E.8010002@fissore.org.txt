You don't need synchronization if you just read from an openbitset. And 
if you need to modify it, you can achieve thread safeness even with 
thread confinement.

BTW (shameless plug) if you are going to operate on large sets of 
bitsets, you should probably take a look at
https://github.com/ffissore/Parallel-Bitset-Operations
we are integrating it into some of our searchers
