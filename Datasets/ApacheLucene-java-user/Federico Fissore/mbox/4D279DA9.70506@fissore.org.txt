SortedVIntList is compressed, OpenBitSet is not

Yes

I'm too looking for alternative implementations of compressed bitsets, 
so I'm too really interested in everybody experience: my primary concern 
at the moment is serializing bitsets to recover searcher warmup time

I've tried some and roughly tested them: my conclusion was that we 
(lucene users) already stand on the rolls royce of bitset implementations.
