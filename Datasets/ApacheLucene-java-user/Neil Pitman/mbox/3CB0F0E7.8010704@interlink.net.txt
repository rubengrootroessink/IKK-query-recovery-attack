Hi Sheldon,

It was my understanding that you should parse the input text yourself 
(since you understand the deeper semantics).  When you see "MEM12345" 
you can add {"MEM12345", "MEM" and "12345"} into the words to index. 
This is similar to converting the words to lowercase or stripping 
accents when analyzing a text.


If you wanted to get even more fancy you could create one or more 
separate fields for the product codes or fragments of product code. 
Your GUI could use them to search on.

Does this make sense?
