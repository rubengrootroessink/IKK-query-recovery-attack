I am not sure why you don't want to use SortField for your purpose. It's not
as bad option as you describe above. See, lucene already sorts the documents
on SCORE. Now for your problem what you additionally want is do sorting by
date if SCORE is same - for very large index (say of size N) you are just
adding O(N) complexity to the whole process... which is linear in nature.
Because you would be doing sorting within similar score buckets (say average
size is k) - this would take k * lg k. For very large index there would be
lots of such buckets (say B), we can safely assume B >>> k. So total
additional complexity is B k lg k. For B >>> k, k lg k would be equivalent
to 1. Hence additional complexity is only B or N (a better proxy).

I hope I am clear.

Feel free to comment.

P.S: In our application we are already using SortField based mechanism...
it's not adding lots of extra CPU cycles to the whole process of search.
