It's very simple... when you are talking about cache here you are talking
about "In Memory Cache" and not "Persistent" cache. IndexReader is something
which closely resembles in-memory snapshot of indices, while directory()
refers to persisted indices. With this analogy the caching solution fits
best at IndexReader level.

Over that, same directory can be opened by multiple processes (not threads)
- to complicate the situation these processes can be running on distributed
machines. It would require lot of IPCs and very complicated solution to
provide caching at directory level.
