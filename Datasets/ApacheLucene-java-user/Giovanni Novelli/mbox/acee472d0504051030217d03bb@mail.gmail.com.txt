DATE: 5 Apr 2005

As Lucene native language is Java it should be more natural to access its 
functionalities through JSP; anyway the idea of accessing Lucene 
functionalities seems interesting as PHP is perhaps most widely deployed 
server side scripting language. 
I think that the way to provide access to Lucene API in PHP development 
should be more general and clean as possible, so in my opinion the natural 
way should be based on a single layer that interoperates with Lucene API: an 
Apache module. Then should be needed a PHP API to call such module from PHP. 

Having an Apache module for Lucene as a component of Lucene project should 
allow the spread of Lucene not only in PHP development arena.
