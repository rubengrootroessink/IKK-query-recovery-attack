taking your example (text by John Bear, old.), the NGramAnalyzerWrapper
creates the following tokens:
text
text by
by
by John
John
John Bear,
Bear,
Bear, old.

I have managed to get rid of the error, but now it just doesn't add anything
to the index :s
I'm attaching the NGramAnalyzerWrapper and NGramFilter which I am referring
to, as well as my own NamedEntityAnalyzer/TokenFilter, which may help you
understand better.
