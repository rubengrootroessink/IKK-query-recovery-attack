SUBJECT: Retrieve number of terms
DATE: 10 Jan 2008


I'm sure this has been asked a few times before, but i searched and searched
and found no answer (apart from using luke), but I would like to know if
there's a way of retrieving the number of terms in an index.
I tried cycling through a TermEnum, but i doesn't do anything :|
