SUBJECT: Controlling what is indexed /  normalizing our index
DATE: 15 Feb 2010


We have a list of keywords with aliases (Example:  keyword = "ms access"
aliases = "microsoft access", "msaccess", "m.s. access"  )

We would like to intercept the aliases prior to them being indexed, and have
the keyword indexed instead.  We can do this with a CustomFilter for single
word aliases.  (Example: in filter token = "access", we change value to
"msaccess").  Our problem is when the token equals microsoft, we need to
find out if the next token is access or not, that is, does it match one of
our aliases.

Has anyone had an issue like?  Any and all help is appreciated.  Thanx.
