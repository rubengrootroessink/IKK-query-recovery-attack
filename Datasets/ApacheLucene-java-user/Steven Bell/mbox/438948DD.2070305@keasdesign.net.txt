Hi,

I am stumped. I can't seem to get word docs indexed. I have tried both 
POI and textmining libraries to little or no real affect.
I dump the doc files into a text file with the same variable I use in 
the Lucene doc.add(Field.UnStored("content", textStr));| and they look 
fine in the file. However searches return nothing.

Is there a good, solid tutorial on how to best accomplish the indexing 
and searching of word documents?

Thanks.
Steve
