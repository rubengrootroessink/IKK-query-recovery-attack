I think, here is my problem...I have found this in the FileDocument.java:

doc.add(new Field("contents", new FileReader(f)));

Field.Store.YES is missing, but when I try to put this argument, i become an
error message. I'll try to found a solution for the problem, but if you have
any tips for me - please let me know :)

thanks in advance,
sirakov
