SUBJECT: Virtual Index
DATE: 6 Mar 2002

We have a relatively large (300,000+ documents) set of XML files to
index. The files themselves are articles broken up by journal and decade
so that users can restrict their search to specific journals and year
ranges. Under our old search engine this was done by creating a seperate
index for each journal/decade and then creating a "virtual index" which
would search the smaller indexes and put the results together (with
scoring preserved).

In Lucene it looks like I would have to build one large index and do
something like this:

title:test && (journal:myjournal && (year:1990 || year:1991 || year:1992
|| year:1993 || year:1994 || year:1995 || year:1996 || year:1997 ||
year:1998 || year:1999))

Is there a better way to do this?
