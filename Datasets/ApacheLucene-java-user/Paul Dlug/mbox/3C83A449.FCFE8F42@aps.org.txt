SUBJECT: IndexWriter thread safety
DATE: 4 Mar 2002

Is IndexWriter.addDocument() thread safe? I'm indexing a large number of
XML files and I have multiple threads parsing the files to create
Documents which are then added to the index writer. I took a quick look
at the source code and it looks like addDocument() is thread safe
(synchronized when adding the segment). I just wanted to make sure that
I am approaching this correctly. Is there a better approach for high
performance indexing of XML files?

Any feedback greatly appreciated.
