SUBJECT: Opening and index as ready only
DATE: 3 Jun 2002

Is there anyway to open an index as read-only? I get an IOException with
Permission Denied when I change the index to a set of read-only file
permissions. I have a cluster of search servers with the index on an NFS
mount. I'd like to be able to have them all open and search the index at
the same time. A single IndexWriter would be used to add new documents.
Is there any way to do this?

Thanks,
Paul
