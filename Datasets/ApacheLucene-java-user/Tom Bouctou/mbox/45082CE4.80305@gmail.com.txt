Miles,

I understand you are trying to solve your problem by changing the index 
contents (removing documents). Would it be possible to workaround it and 
to achieve this during search, by only returning the relevant documents 
and ignore the rests?

Just my 2 cents...

Tom

interested in removing terms from a lucene index.  In particular, I'd 
like to be able to delete all terms that appear in fewer than x 
documents (say x=3).  This is in efforts to reduce the feature set for 
some research I'm doing.
