SUBJECT: index and access to lines of a CSV file
DATE: 13 Dec 2007

Hello,

I got a quick question.  I am handling hughe CSV files. They start with 
a key in the first column and are followed by data.
I need to retrieve randomly this data based on the key.  So it is kind 
of a search where I give a unique key and ideally access to the right line.
The file contains about 200.000 lines or more.  I am not sure if Lucene 
can handle things like that and I did not really find a hint on this  
topic.  So I hope to find help here.

Thank you,

Tobias
