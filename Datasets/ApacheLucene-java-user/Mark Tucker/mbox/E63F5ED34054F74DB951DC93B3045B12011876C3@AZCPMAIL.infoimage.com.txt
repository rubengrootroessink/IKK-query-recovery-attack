SUBJECT: Lucene FAQ Corrections - How do I help?
DATE: 22 Feb 2002


Is tal@zapta.com still responsible for the Lucene FAQ?  I have found errors in the FAQ (typos,
grammar, etc.) and would enjoy cleaning them up a bit.  What is the process to make corrections?
 I have sent an e-mail to tal@zapta.com, but haven't received a response yet.

Thanks,

Mark Tucker
