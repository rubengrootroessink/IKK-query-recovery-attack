SUBJECT: Moving Index from Crawl/Build Server to Search Server
DATE: 31 Jan 2002

I am working on a browser-based search application that crawls web and file documents.  I would
like to do my crawling and index building on one server and my searching on one or more other
servers.  I want maximum up time and performance on my search servers.  What is the best way
to move the index from the build server to the search servers and then change which index
a user is searching against?  I am concerned about switching the index while a user is paging
through search results.  Ideally new users will access the new index while current users will
access the old index.  How will I know when all current users are no longer accessing the
old index so that it can be deleted?

Thanks,

Mark Tucker
