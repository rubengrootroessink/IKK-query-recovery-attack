Hi Cam,

Thanks!  It has not been easy, probably has taken 3 years or so to get
this far.  At first I thought the new reopen code would be the
solution.  I used it, but then needed to modify it to do a clone
instead of reference the old deleted docs.  Then as I iterated,
realized that just using reopen on a ramdirectory would not be quite
fast enough because of the merging.  Then started using
InstantiatedIndex which provides an in memory version of the document,
without the overhead of merging during the transaction.  There are
other complexities as well.  The basic code works if you are
interested in trying it out.

Take care,
Jason
