SUBJECT: RAMDirectory IndexInput and IndexOutput
DATE: 19 Jun 2008

Seeing strange behavior with RAMDirectory.  Is a file designed to supported
IndexOutput being open concurrently with IndexInput?  I open an IndexInput
with IndexOutput open, with data written to the file previously, and the
IndexInput is reporting a filelength of 0, while Directory.fileLength()
reports 110.  Also seeing other strange behavior.
