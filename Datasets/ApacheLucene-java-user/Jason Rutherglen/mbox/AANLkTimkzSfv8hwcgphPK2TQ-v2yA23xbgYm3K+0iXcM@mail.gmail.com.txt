SUBJECT: Storing an ID alongside a document
DATE: 2 Feb 2011

I'm curious if there's a new way (using flex or term states) to store
IDs alongside a document and retrieve the IDs of the top N results?
The goal would be to minimize HD seeks, and not use field caches
(because they consume too much heap space) or the doc stores (which
require two seeks).  One possible way using the pre-flex system is to
place the IDs into a payload posting that would match all documents,
and then [somehow] retrieve the payload only when needed.
