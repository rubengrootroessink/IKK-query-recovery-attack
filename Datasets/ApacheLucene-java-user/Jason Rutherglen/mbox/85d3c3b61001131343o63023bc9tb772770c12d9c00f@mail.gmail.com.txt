SUBJECT: Re: Max Segmentation Size when Optimizing Index
DATE: 13 Jan 2010

Hi Trin,

There was recently a discussion about this, the max size is
for the before merge segments, rather than the resultant merged
segment (if that makes sense). It'd be great if we had a merge
policy that limited the resultant merged segment, though that'd
by a rough approximation at best.
