SUBJECT: Last/max term in Lucene 4.x
DATE: 19 Feb 2011

This could be a rhetorical question.  The way to find the last/max
term that is a unique per document is to use TermsEnum to seek to the
first term of a field, then call seek to the docFreq-1 for the last
ord, then get the term, or is there a better/faster way?
