SUBJECT: Is ConcurrentMergeScheduler useful for multiple running IndexWriter's?
DATE: 4 Mar 2011

ConcurrentMergeScheduler is tied to a specific IndexWriter, however if
we're running in an environment (such as Solr's multiple cores, and
other similar scenarios) then we'd have a CMS per IW.  I think this
effectively disables CMS's max thread merge throttling feature?
