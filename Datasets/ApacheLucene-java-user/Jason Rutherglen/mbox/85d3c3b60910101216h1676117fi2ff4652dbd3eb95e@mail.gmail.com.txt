John,

Actually everyone is entitled to their technical opinion and
none of the comments were misleading. Jake and yourself
validated that they are true in your comments. I'm simply trying
to create better technology as is everyone on here. The process
takes time and coordination between many parties of many
backgrounds around the globe. Sometimes there are differences of
opinion, however those are easily ironed out over time (and quite
frankly in this case benchmarks).

However I am very concerned about your ignorant disregard of some of the
most basic human rights in existence.
