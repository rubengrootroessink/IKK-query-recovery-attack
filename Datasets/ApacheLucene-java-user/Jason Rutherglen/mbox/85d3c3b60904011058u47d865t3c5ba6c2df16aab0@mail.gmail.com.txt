John,

We looked at implementing delete by doc id for LUCENE-1516, however it
seemed to be something that if enough people wanted we could implement it at
as a later patch.

The implementation involves maintaining a genealogy of SegmentReaders within
IndexWriter so that deletes to a reader that has been merged away will be
imported by later readers.
