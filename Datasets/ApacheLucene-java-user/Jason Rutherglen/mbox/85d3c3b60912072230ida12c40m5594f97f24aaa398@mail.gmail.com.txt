RB,

That's expected behavior, each .cfs corresponds to all of a
segment's files. You could write your own directory
implementation that underneath writes to a single file. It's
usually good to present what you're trying to accomplish (i.e.
the why).

I am not sure whether this is an expected behavior or I need to merge each time after IndexWriter
commits. In between the writer's commit, I reopen the IndexReader but still .cfs files keep
on increasing. I would like to have one .cfs file which can be reopened frequently by reader
and at the same time progressive commit by writer. Is it possible?
