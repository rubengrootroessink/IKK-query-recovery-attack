That is an interesting problem.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1292 will build a tag index
that uses a ParallelReader to allow tag fields to be searchable.  The tag
index does not use the usual IndexWriter but uses a specialized realtime
updateable index built for tags.  Depending on the requirements, the Tag
Index could be implemented in a variety of ways.  It depends on how many
tags, documents, and in this case users.
