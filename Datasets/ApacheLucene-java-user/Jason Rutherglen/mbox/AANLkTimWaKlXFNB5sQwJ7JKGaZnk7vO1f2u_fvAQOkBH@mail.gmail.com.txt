SUBJECT: Monitoring low level IO
DATE: 3 Jun 2010

This is more of a unix related question than Lucene specific
however because Lucene is being used, I'm asking here as perhaps
other people have run into a similar issue.

On an Amazon EC2 merge, read, and write operations are possibly
blocking due to underlying IO. Is there a tool that you have
used to monitor this type of thing?
