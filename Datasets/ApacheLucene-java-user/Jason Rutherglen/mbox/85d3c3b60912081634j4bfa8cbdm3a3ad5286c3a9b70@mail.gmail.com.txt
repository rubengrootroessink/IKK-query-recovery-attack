SUBJECT: NearSpansUnordered payloads not returning all the time
DATE: 9 Dec 2009

Howdy,

I am wondering if anyone has seen
NearSpansUnordered.getPayload() not return payloads that are
verifiably accessible via IR.termPositions? It's a bit confusing
because most of the time they're returned properly.

I suspect the payload logic gets tripped up in
NearSpansUnordered. I'll put together a test case, however the
difficulty is that we're only seeing the issue with largish 800
MB indexes, which could make the test case a little crazy.

Jason
