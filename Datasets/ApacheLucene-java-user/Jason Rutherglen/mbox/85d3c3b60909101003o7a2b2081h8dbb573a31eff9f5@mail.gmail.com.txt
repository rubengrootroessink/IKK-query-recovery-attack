SUBJECT: Re: Extending Sort/FieldCache
DATE: 10 Sep 2009

I think CSF hasn't been implemented because it's only marginally
useful yet requires fairly significant rewrites of core code
(i.e. SegmentMerger) so no one's picked it up including myself.
An interim solution that fulfills the same function (quickly
loading field cache values) using what works reliably today
(i.e. payloads) is a good simple forward moving step.

Shai, feel free to open an issue and post your code. I'd will
check it out and help where possible.
