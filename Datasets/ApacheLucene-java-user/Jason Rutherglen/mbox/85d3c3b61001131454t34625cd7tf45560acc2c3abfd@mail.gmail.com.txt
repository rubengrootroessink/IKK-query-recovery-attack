SUBJECT: Re: Max Segmentation Size when Optimizing Index
DATE: 13 Jan 2010

Yes... You could hack LogMergePolicy to do something else.

I use optimise(numsegments:5) regularly on 80GB indexes, that if
optimized to 1 segment, would thrash the IO excessively.  This works
fine because 15-20GB indexes are plenty large and fast.
