DATE: 20 Apr 2008


Hi Karl,

Thanks for the response. i have looked at the Highlighter. Unfortunately, when i feed it with
a PhraseQuery, it seems to break up the query into it's individual terms first, so does not
yield the result that i would like. i have not looked at Searcher.explain yert though.

It's like this. Two types of searches are required: single term with wildcard, and phrase
query with non-zero slop. But either could return large number of results, some of which are
not what is wanted. So there needs to be an intermediate filter screen like this:
apples and oranges 25 hits found
oranges and apples 70 hits found
and apples oranges 5 hits found
...

so that we can choose to not to display results which correspond to the found phrases that
we are not interested in, and when we get to the display screen, it's just the results we
want.



Thanks,
Edwin

to find out, for each of the Hit returned, what is the actual term from the document that
was found. How can i do that?
