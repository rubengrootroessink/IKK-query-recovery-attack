Hi Karl,

Thanks for the suggestions, i would be glad to contribute back to the project.

i'm not too familiar with the inner workings of Lucene though; how does such a functionality
feature in a Query implementation?

My naive interpretation, when i first got hold of Lucene, is that Query is what you want to
search, then the Searcher would do the work, against the Directory which contains the indexed
materials, producing Hits which contains search results. So my initial (also naive) thought
was that Hit would contain what i wanted (the found term).



Regards,
Edwin
