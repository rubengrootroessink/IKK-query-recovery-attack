SUBJECT: Disk space needed for indexing???
DATE: 16 Dec 2004



Hi, everyone,

Does anyone have any idea how much disk space will be needed for
generating the final index with ~1.5G size, for example?

I have ~3.5G disk space and is able to generate index with 1G size.
However, after I add more records, it will run out of disk space. Does
Lucene suppose to take so much disk space for indexing? Is there any way
that I can improve the code to let it take less space?


Thanks,
Ying
