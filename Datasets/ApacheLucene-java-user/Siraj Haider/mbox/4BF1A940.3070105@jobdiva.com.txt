Hello there,
In oracle text search there is a feature to reverse search using 
ctxrule.  What it does is, you create an index (ctxrule) on a column 
having your search criteria(s) and then throw a document on it and it 
tells you which criteria(s) it satisfies.  Is there something in Lucene 
that does that or there are any plans to do that?

thanks
