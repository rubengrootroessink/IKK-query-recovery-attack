SUBJECT: Lucene on Multi-Processor/Core machines
DATE: 25 Jan 2011

Hello there,
I was looking for best practices for indexing/searching on a 
multi-processor/core machine but could not find any specific material on 
that.  Do you think it is a good idea to create a guide/how-to for that 
purpose?  It would be very helpful for many people in todays world, 
where almost all the machines come with multi cores and optionally 
multi-processors.

regards
-siraj
