SUBJECT: ChainedFilter in Lucene 3.1.0
DATE: 7 Apr 2011

We have been using org.apache.lucene.search.ChaniedFilter in our 
application that uses lucene 3.0.3.  Today we downloaded version 3.1.0, 
but the code wont compile.  It says that it could not find 
ChainedFilter.  Did this class got moved to some other package?

thanks
