SUBJECT: WhitespaceAnalyzer and version
DATE: 12 Apr 2010

We are in the process of removing the deprecated api from our code to 
move to version.  One of the deprecation is, the queryparser now expects 
a version parameter in the constructor.  I also have read somewhere that 
we should pass the same version to analyzer when indexing as wel as when 
searching.  We use WhitespaceAnalyzer and I am unable to find a 
constructor with a version in it.

Another thing is, do we need to re-index if we want to supply 
Version.LUCENE_CURRENT as the version? what are other implications?

thanks
