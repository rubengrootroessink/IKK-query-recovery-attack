SUBJECT: Using Numeric Field
DATE: 9 Oct 2009

Hi,
I have a Date field in my Lucene index that is currently stored as a 
String field with format: YYYYMMDDHHMISS.  I perform RangeFilter on it 
when searching and also sort the results specifying it as a String 
field.  My question is, will converting it to a Numeric field and start 
using NumericRangeFilter and sorting based on numeric field will give me 
some performance gain? or will it be insignificant?

thanks
