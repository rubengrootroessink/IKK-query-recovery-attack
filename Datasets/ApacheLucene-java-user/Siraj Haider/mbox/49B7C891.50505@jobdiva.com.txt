SUBJECT: search problem when indexed using Field.setOmitTf()
DATE: 11 Mar 2009

We are having a problem running searches on an index after upgrading to 
2.4 and using the new Field.setOmitTf() function.  The index size has 
been dramatically reduces and even the search performace is better.  But 
searches do not return any results if searching for something that has a 
space in it.

Thats how I am running the search:

    Sort sort = new Sort(new SortField("DATECREATED", SortField.STRING, 
true));
        QueryParser queryParser = new QueryParser("", new 
WhitespaceAnalyzer());
        Query query = queryParser.parse("SQL SERVER");
        TopFieldDocs tfd = indexSearcher.search(query, null, 9999999, sort);

this query does not return results if query string has an space, i.e. 
"SQL SERVER".  This behaviour changes if we dont use 
Field.setOmitTf(true) while indexing and search returns right results.  
Please advice how to acheive reduced index size bby using 
Field.setOmitTf() as well as searching strings with space between words?

thanks
