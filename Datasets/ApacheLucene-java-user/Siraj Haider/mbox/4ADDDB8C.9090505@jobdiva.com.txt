SUBJECT: Using NumericField
DATE: 20 Oct 2009

We have an index with a number field indexed as String field.  We do 
range searches as well as sorting on this field.  Now we want to take 
advantage of the NumericField.  The question is, will I have to re-index 
all the documents or just adding a new document with NumericField will 
be enough to convert the field type?  If a re-index is needed, is there 
a way to re-index just one field in a document instead of re-indexing 
the whole document?

thanks
