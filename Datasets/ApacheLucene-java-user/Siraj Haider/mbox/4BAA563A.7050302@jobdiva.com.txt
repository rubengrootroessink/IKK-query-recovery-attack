SUBJECT: Garbage Collection performance on 2.9.2
DATE: 24 Mar 2010

We upgraded to 2.9.2 from 2.3.2 and the garbage collection performance 
deteriorated drastically.  The system is going to Full GC cycles with 
long pauses very frequently.  Did something got changed that we need to 
account for?

thanks in advance
