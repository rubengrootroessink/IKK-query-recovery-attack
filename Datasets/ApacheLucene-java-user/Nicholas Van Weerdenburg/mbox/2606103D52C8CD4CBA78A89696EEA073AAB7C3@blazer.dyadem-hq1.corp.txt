SUBJECT: Integrating a J2EE Application into "Generic" Enterprise Search
DATE: 25 May 2006

Hi,

 

I am planning to integrate Lucene into our application. However, I also
want to support the general enterprise search market and what our
customers have installed.

 

Ideally, we would develop:

 

1.	generic search support services

	a.	index records into logical "document-centric" records
with urls for access.
	b.	Triggers to generated updated records in real time.
	c.	Batch indexer for generation of intial data for search
engine.

2.	specific search enginer support - e.g. lucene, retrievalware,
etc.

 

Are there any enterprise search intergration standards (e.g. xml
schema)?

 

Any recommendations for best approaching this?

 

Thanks,

Nick
