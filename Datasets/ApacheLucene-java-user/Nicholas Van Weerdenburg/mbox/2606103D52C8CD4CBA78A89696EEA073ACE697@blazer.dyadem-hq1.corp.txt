Both sound interesting, but what I want is to be able to generate the intermediate xml that
most enterprise search servers could use to quickly integrate with them.

e.g. 
customer 1 uses retrievalware for enterprise search
customer 2 uses Solr
customer 3 uses yyy.

How do I build our my functionality to support RetrievalWare, Solr, and YYY?

One thought is to build a directory view that invites crawlers in to auto-index.

DBSight sounds interesting but it does't help me with other enterprise search tools from the
sounds of it. I'm also thinking that our database schema is resistant to sql-oriented queries.

Thanks,
Nick

Solr is nice when you can change the existing enterprise applications,
extract content and post xml content to the server. But definately
still a lot of coding.

I would say DBSight is another alternative here. It has similar
architecture as Solr, but it crawls databases by configurable SQLs.
Only need to plug into any existing databases by JDBC, and it can fit
any schema. No xml, xslt efforts. Usually in 15 minutes you can have a
google-like search.
