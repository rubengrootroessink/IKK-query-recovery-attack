SUBJECT: Upgrade of Lucene from 1.9.1 to 2.2.0 in JIRA
DATE: 20 Jul 2007

Hi,

We're about to upgrade Lucene from version 1.9.1 to version 2.2.0 in 
JIRA <http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>. We've already switched 
from DateFields to DateTools (which will require a complete re-index for 
all of our customers). 

Are there any problems we should be aware of that could cause problems 
with this upgrade? (which wont be fixed by a full re-index)

Cheers,
  Andreas
