SUBJECT: Performance improvements using writer.delete vs reader.delete
DATE: 3 Aug 2007

Hi,

We're considering to use the new IndexWriter.deleteDocuments call rather 
than the IndexReader.delete call.  Are there any performance 
improvements that this may provide, other than the benefit of not having 
to switch between readers/writers?

We've looked at LUCENE-565, but there's no clear view of performance 
enhancements over the old IndexReader call.

Cheers,
 Andreas
