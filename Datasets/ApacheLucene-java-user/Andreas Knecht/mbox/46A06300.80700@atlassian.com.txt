SUBJECT: Re: Upgrade of Lucene from 1.9.1 to 2.2.0 in JIRA
DATE: 20 Jul 2007

Hi Dmitry,

The full re-index is necessary, because DateTools stores dates in a 
different (human-readable) format in the index.  This means that 
JIRA/lucene wont be able to read dates from the current indexes which 
use dates stored in the old format.

Cheers,
  Andreas
