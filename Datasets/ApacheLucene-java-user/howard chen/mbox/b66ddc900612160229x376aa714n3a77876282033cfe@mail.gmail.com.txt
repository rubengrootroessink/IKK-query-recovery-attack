SUBJECT: [Interesting Question] How to implement Indexes Grouping?
DATE: 16 Dec 2006

Consider the following interesting situation,

A library has around 100K book, and want to be indexed by Lucene, this
seems to be straight forward, but....

The target is:

0. You can search all books in the whole library [easy, just index it]

1. users in this system can own a numbers of books in their personal
bookshelf, the users might only want to search book in their bookshelf
ONLY.

2. if each users own a copy of the index of their personal bookshelf,
this seems to be waste of storage space as books are shared by many
users.

3. If no matter users own what book, the whole indexes is to be
searched, this seems to be waste of computation power if he just own a
few books only.


In this situation, how would you design a indexing + search system?

Any idea can share?

:)

Thanks.
