Hello all.  I'm having a problem with escaping Lucene characters, and I
was wondering if anyone here could help.

I've set up a Keyword field for my documents named "host".  "host" can
contain names like "ocrlprod" or "ny-dns-2".  I'm pretty sure that I
want it to be a Keyword (rather than Text), so that it isn't tokenized.

The problem is when I need to search against that field.  For example:

search string I construct: (host:orclprod)
query as reported by toString(): +host:orclprod

returns the results I expect.  Great so far.

search string I construct: (host:ny-dns-2)
query as reported by toString(): +(host:ny -dns -2)

does not return any results.  After reading about needing to escape
special characters, I'm not surprised, and move on to...

search string I construct: (host:ny\-dns\-2)
query as reported by toString():  +host:"ny dns 2"

does not return any results.  What happened to my hyphens?!?!  Is there
any way to get them to show up, as I expect I need them to?

Thanks for any help.
