SUBJECT: Size of Indices vs. Data?
DATE: 28 Jul 2002


Is there any information available about how big indices are likely to
get, given a certain amount of data?

Can you expect, for example, that your index will require, say, 10% of
the disk space that your data takes up?

Anyone have any personal experience they'd like to share here?

Thanks.
