DATE: 23 Jun 2005

In my indexes where the available fields vary by document, I maintain an 
additional field that lists out what fields are in used per document.  
That way, I can query for all documents that contain field "foo", or all 
documents that contain a field "foo", and don't contain "bar"... etc.
