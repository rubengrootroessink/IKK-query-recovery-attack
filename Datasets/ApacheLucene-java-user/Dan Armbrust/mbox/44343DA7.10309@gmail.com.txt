Yep.  This code was written when I had to index tons of stuff on linux, 
and was constantly running into file handle issues (even with low merge 
factors).  I ended up writing a wrapper for lucene that handled it all 
for me, and I've just been reusing it.  Then today, I ran into this 
issue.  It may be time to rework some of the wrapper to take advantage 
of the lucene updates :)
