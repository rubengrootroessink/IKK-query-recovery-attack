I would give the IBM or blackdown JVM a try on linux - I've seen pretty 
wide variance in their speed on different operations.

Sometimes better than Sun, sometimes worse - it depended on the task (I 
did some adhoc tests at one point that showed sun was faster for 
indexing, but IBM was faster for querying - but that was quite a while ago.
