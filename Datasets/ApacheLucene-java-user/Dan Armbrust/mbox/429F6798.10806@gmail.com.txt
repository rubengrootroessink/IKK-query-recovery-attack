You should be careful, however, not to end up with two VM instances each 
trying to open an index writer at the same time - one of them is going 
to fail.

Aka, if someone using your web interface tries to add a new document to 
the index while you have the optimizer running standalone, the web 
interface is not going to be able to get a lock on the index to add the 
documents.
