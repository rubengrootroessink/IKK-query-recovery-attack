Personally, I would still avoid the applets.  Webstart is a much better 
solution if you want to run on the client rather than the server.

You will may have to sign your jar files for webstart to get permission 
to use the file system - but self-signing works if you don't have a 
certificate - the users just get an annoying dialog box they have to say 
"yes" to.  You could put the entire lucene index into a jar file (that 
will get downloaded by webstart along with your application)

When your app starts up, it would extract the lucene index from the jar 
file to the users temp folder, and then run.

This has a bandwidth advantage over the applet - your entire application 
  and the index would be cached on the client machine by webstart - it 
would only download a new image of your app or of the index when it changes.

Actually, you may even be able to get away with not signing the code if 
you figured out a way to extract a lucene index from a jar file, and put 
it directly into a RAM directory, instead of the local file system.  I'm 
pretty sure Lucene doesn't support anything like this right now, but it 
may not be that difficult to implement.
