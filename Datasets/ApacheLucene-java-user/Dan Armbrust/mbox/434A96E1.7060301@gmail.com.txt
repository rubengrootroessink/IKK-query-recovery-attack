One way of doing this would be to set up Apache Tomcat on your web 
server.  Build yourself a jsp webpage which interfaces with Lucene to do 
the search and display the results.  Lucene can be run natively inside 
of Tomcat.


Another (more hackish/quick and dirty/probably full of peril) way of 
doing this if you don't want to have to learn tomcat/jsp and/or support 
Tomcat (or any other web server / application server that is capable of 
serving java/jsp applications) would be to write the necessary code to 
make perl talk to java - We have done this before (for a different 
purpose) by just having them send messages back and forth over a socket. 
  You web app written in perl could send a message to a running java vm 
on the web server (on a socket that the java vm is listening to) with 
the desired search.  The java wrapper picks up the message, performs the 
lucene search on the index, and then returns the results back over the 
socket to the perl code.
