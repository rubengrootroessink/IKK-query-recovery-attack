Thanks guys.... as always... lucene (and especially the people behind
it) are top notch.

Less than 6 hours from the time I figured out that the bug was in
Lucene (and not my code, which is usually the case) - and its already
fixed (I'm going to assume - I'll test it tomorrow when I get to work)

Amazing.

Thanks again,

Dan
