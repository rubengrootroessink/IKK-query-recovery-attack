SUBJECT: Search Timeout - abort a search
DATE: 7 Jul 2005

Has anyone ever written code to make it possible to return from a 
search, after a given amount of time, returning the results that have 
been collected so far (but not necessarily all of them)?

The only thing that I can see to do through the public Lucene API's 
would be to do the search using a HitCollector - and just stop recording 
the hits after X amount of time has passed - but this would only 
partially solve the problem... lucene would still continue to call the 
HitCollector collect method until it finished.

Is there something else I'm missing?

Thanks,

Dan
