SUBJECT: wildcards in quoted phrases?
DATE: 25 Sep 2006

I have someone wanting to do a query like this - "top sta*", but from 
what I have been able to gather, lucene doesn't have any built in 
support for wildcards inside of phrases?

Well, at least not complete support.  I was led to the MultiPhraseQuery 
class - but looking at that leaves me wondering - has anyone written (or 
modified) a QueryParser that can automatically use this?

Or do I have to manually create the query whenever I encounter a quoted 
phrase with a wildcard?  My hunch is that its not real easy, otherwise 
it would already have been done...

Thanks,

Dan
