SUBJECT: Analyzer question
DATE: 8 Aug 2005

It is my understanding that the StandardAnalyzer will remove underscores 
- so "some_word" be indexed as 'some' and 'word'.

I want to keep the underscores, so I was thinking of changing over to an 
Analyzer that uses the WhiteSpaceTokenizer, LowerCaseFilter, and StopFilter.

What other tokenizing magic will I lose by changing away from the 
StandardAnalyzer?

Thanks,

Dan
