SUBJECT: Search for documents where field does not exist?
DATE: 17 Jun 2005

I'm pretty sure the answer is no.. but I'll check with the guru's anyway...

In my collection of documents, I have a non-tokenized field that only 
occurs 0 or 1 time per document.

It is possible to create a query so that a documents would be returned if

(field == "some value" OR field does not exist)

documents would not be returned if
(field == "some other value")


Thanks,

Dan
