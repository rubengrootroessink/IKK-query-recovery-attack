SUBJECT: weight score based on a fields value
DATE: 22 Jun 2005

Is there a straightforward way that I could change the scoring algorithm 
such that it would break ties based on looking at the value of a field?  
I'm not actually searching for the value in the field, so its not part 
of the query - I just want documents that have a particular field set to 
a particular value to score higher than documents that don't have that 
field set to that value - in cases where otherwise, they both would have 
scored the same.

Thanks,

Dan
