A few more google searches will probably turn up some reasonable lists 
of abbreviation rules or lists for common names - I found this right away:

http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:dh7HGiQ-G4wJ:immigrants.byu.edu/Downloads/BritishNames.pdf+common+name+abbreviations&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=5

With a table such as this, you could write a tokenizer that would inject 
the abbreviated form of common names into your index in addition to the 
default form.

Or, you could index them in as an alternate field, then you would have 
more control at query time whether or not you wanted to match on 
abbreviations.
