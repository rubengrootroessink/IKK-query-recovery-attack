SUBJECT: Lucene score algorithm details?
DATE: 8 Aug 2005

I know there used to be a webpage that gave the algorithm used by Lucene 
for scoring, along with some info on what each variable controlled, to 
some extent... I was looking to brush up on what the idf controls (and 
what will happen if I override it) but I can't seem to find that page 
any longer...

Can someone point me to it?

Thanks,

Dan
