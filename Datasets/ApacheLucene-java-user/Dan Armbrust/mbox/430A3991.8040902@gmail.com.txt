Cool - is there a daily build somewhere, or do I have to roll my own?  I 
couldn't find a daily build or a 1.9 alpha, beta, etc. on the site.

Any idea when 1.9 might be released, even as an alpha?  The dates in the 
Lucene2Whiteboard on the wiki no longer look realistic (unless the 1.9 
release is going to happen at the same time as the 2.0 release - which I 
could understand, if the 2.0 will only differ by removing all of the 
depreciated methods.

Thanks,


Dan
