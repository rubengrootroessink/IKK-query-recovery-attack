If you are only talking about ordering the number of items that you are 
going to show to the user, that seems to imply that the number will be 
small.  Why don't you just re-sort the items that you are going to 
display to the user somewhere in your code after you get the documents 
back from lucene?  It may not be quite as clean, but I doubt that there 
will be any performance impact.
