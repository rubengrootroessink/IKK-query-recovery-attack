Thanks for checking Yonik.  I'm fairly certain that this is a lucene bug 
then - I will try to come up with a reproduceable test case.

My load code is pretty simple... whenever I create a new document, I put 
in a field that contains a counter of the load order.

When I look at the individual indexes, things are fine - but after it 
merges them, I get a significant percentage of documents which have been 
reordered.

One other thing I can look into - I've been building these indexes on a 
64 bit linux machine, using a 64 bit JVM.  I need to see if the same 
error happens on 32 bit windows....
