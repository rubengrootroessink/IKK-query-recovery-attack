The MySQL drivers are horrible at dealing with large result sets - that 
article gives you the workaround to tell it to bring the results back as 
they are needed (like it should in the first place) but I have found 
that it isn't reliable - it tends to drop out at random points during 
the query - so you will get a different number of rows each time you 
rerun the query.  In MySQL - the only reliable way I have found to get 
all of the results from a large table is to use their "limit" keyword in 
the query, and only ask it for X (I usually use 10,000, but use whatever 
works best with your system) number of rows as a time, and then keep 
rerunning the query, incrementing up the start position of the "limit" 
keyword.  This issue also varies a lot from version to version of the 
driver - some versions have been completely broken, and others are only 
slightly broken.  To bad we can't get lucene quality code everywhere :)



 >> Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Access is denied

To me, that really seems like you have an issue with the location that 
you are writing the index to.  I would make sure you have full write 
permissions to the location, and make sure there aren't some old / 
invalid files sitting in there.
