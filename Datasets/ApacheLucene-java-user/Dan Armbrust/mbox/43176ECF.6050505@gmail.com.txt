 As far as I know, 'nice' only controls CPU usage, not disk IO usage.  
Since lucene doesn't do a lot of CPU intensive work, renicing a lucene 
process does little to allow other processes to get access to your disks.

 On Windows, things are similar.  A single process, even with the 
priority forced down, can still kill the performance of the entire 
machine if it is doing large amounts of disk io (on the system disk).
