SUBJECT: When do files in 'deleteable' get deleted?
DATE: 13 Feb 2006

If I am using lucene (daily build from ~ a month ago or so) on windows - 
and when I merge two indexes together, I get a number of .cfs files 
noted in my 'deleteable' file - but they never seem to actually be 
deleted by lucene.

When does lucene try to delete these files - does it ever work on 
windows?  As far as I can tell, nothing should be holding a lock on 
those files.  Yet, even when I shut down the only jvm that is using 
these indexes, and then open a new one, and perform a search, they don't 
go away.

Thanks,

Dan
