SUBJECT: Searching partial names using Lucene
DATE: 24 Mar 2011

Hi,

I  would like to build a search system where a search for "Dan" would also search for "Daniel"
and a search for "Will", "William" . Any ideas on how to go about implementing that? I can
think of writing a custom Analyzer that would map these partial tokens to their full firstname
or lastnames. But is there an Analyzer in lucene contrib modules or elsewhere that does a
similar job for me?

Thanks,
Deepak Konidena.
