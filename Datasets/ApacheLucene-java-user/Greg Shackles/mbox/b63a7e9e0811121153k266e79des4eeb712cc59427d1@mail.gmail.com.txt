I agree that it will be the tricky part but I think as long as I'm careful
with counting as I iterate through it should be ok (I probably just doomed
myself by saying that...)

In my case I actually need all of the results, no matter how many there
are.  I imagine my use case is somewhat different than what Lucene is
typically used for, but if performance is good for payloads then I would
suspect this method would prove to be pretty quick overall (especially
compared to the old way I was doing it).  I think this is the route I'm
going to go, so I will report back with progress as it goes.
