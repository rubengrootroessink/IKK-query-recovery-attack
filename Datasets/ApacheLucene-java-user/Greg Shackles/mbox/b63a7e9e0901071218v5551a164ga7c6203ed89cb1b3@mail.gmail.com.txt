SUBJECT: Re: Determining index term count
DATE: 7 Jan 2009

I'm not sure offhand how to write the code to do it, but I know when you
open an index in Luke, that is one of the numbers it gives you.  If you want
to just get the number once that would be an easy way to do it.  If you want
the code for it, Luke is open source so you could see how they do it.  (I
used Luke as a starting point at one point for seeing how to get a list of
high frequency terms).
