Just wanted to post a little follow-up here now that I've gotten through
implementing the system using payloads.  Execution times are phenomenal!
Things that took over a minute to run in my old system take fractions of a
second to run now.  I would also like to thank Mark for being very
responsive in fixing/patching some bugs I encountered along the way.
