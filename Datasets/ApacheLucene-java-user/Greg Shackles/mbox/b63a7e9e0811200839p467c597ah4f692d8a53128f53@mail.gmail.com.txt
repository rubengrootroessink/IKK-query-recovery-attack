Just a follow-up on my post now that I was able to see what the real data
looks like when it comes back from PayloadSpanUtil.  The order of payload
terms in the collection doesn't seem useful, as I suspect it is somehow
related to the order they are stored in the index itself.  Because of that,
grouping them is going to be difficult as I suspected, but this seems like
something Lucene should be able to do for me.  Is that not correct?  I'd
like to keep as much of the logic as possible out of my own implementation
for the sake of performance so if there is some way to do this, I would love
to know.  Thanks!

By the way, the Payloads feature is really cool! Definitely way better than
how I was doing things originally.  : )
