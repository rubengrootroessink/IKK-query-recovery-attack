SUBJECT: Query grouping
DATE: 3 Jan 2003

I am using lucene release 1.2. I am using StandardAnalyzer. Have anybody 
faced this problem?

I get same results when I run following queries

1. (+SEARCH_NAME:jhon  +SEARCH_NAME:joy)  AND -SEARCH_NAME:chan
2. (+SEARCH_NAME:jhon  AND +SEARCH_NAME: joy)  AND -SEARCH_NAME:chan
3. (+SEARCH_NAME:jhon  OR +SEARCH_NAME: joy)  AND -SEARCH_NAME:chan

But when I regroup the query by putting brackets around the last term like 
mentioned below I dont get any results

1. (+SEARCH_NAME:jhon +SEARCH_NAME: joy)  AND (-SEARCH_NAME:chan)
2. (+SEARCH_NAME:jhon AND +SEARCH_NAME: joy)  AND (-SEARCH_NAME:chan)
3. (+SEARCH_NAME:jhon OR +SEARCH_NAME: joy)  AND (-SEARCH_NAME:chan)

This is just an example. I need to do grouping on various fields. Am I 
missing something?  Is there any document other than 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html? Can somebody 
throw some light on this?

Thanks,
Abhay
