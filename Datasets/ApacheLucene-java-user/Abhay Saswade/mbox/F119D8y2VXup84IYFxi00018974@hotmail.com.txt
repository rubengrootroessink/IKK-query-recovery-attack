Hi all,

I could able to build my test search application with lucene. Working fine, 
thanks to all contributors. I noticed lucene is not working well on numeric 
search. I have question. How do I search on numeric values and alphanumeric 
words? (e.g. 12345 and abc123, abc123xyz etc). I saw mailing archives and 
didnt get any simple way to do this. Ill appreciate suggestions on how to 
get around this problem?

Thanks in advance,
Abhay
