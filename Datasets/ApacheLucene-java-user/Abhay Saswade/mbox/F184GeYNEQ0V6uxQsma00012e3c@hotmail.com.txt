SUBJECT: Re: Query grouping
DATE: 4 Jan 2003

Otis,

You are right. In the example, I mentioned in my mail it doesnt make sense. 
The point I wanted to mention was, I am getting different results just by 
putting brackets around the last term. That was bit confusing for me.

Among the few things, what I want to do with lucene API is to search a 
particular text on multiple fields of the document and to exclude particular 
text from same fields. I have written generic logic, which constructs search 
query by getting search text from HTTP request. I am getting expected 
results without grouping in case of search on single field. However, when I 
construct search query on multiple fields using grouping then I dont get 
expected results. Apart from examples I have mentioned whether those makes 
sense or not, what I would really like to know is expected behavior of a 
query when we group it.

Here is another example
I get expected results on both of these queries
1. +SEARCH_NAME:dvd +SEARCH_NAME:cd -SEARCH_NAME:player
2. +DEF_DOC_FIELD:dvd +DEF_DOC_FIELD:cd -DEF_DOC_F
IELD:player

However, when I try to do this in a single query by grouping I get no result
((+SEARCH_NAME:dvd +SEARCH_NAME:cd ) OR (+DEF_DOC_FIELD:dvd 
+DEF_DOC_FIELD:cd )) AND ((-SEARCH_NAME:player) OR (-DEF_DOC_F
IELD:player))

I dont get any results on a single term query like this (and this explains 
why I am not getting any results in above query)
-SEARCH_NAME:player
Is this a known issue?

Is there any way of dealing with above-mentioned problem other than 
rearranging query like this?
(+SEARCH_NAME:dvd +SEARCH_NAME:cd -SEARCH_NAME:player) OR 
(+DEF_DOC_FIELD:dvd +DEF_DOC_FIELD:cd -DEF_DOC_FIELD:player)

Thanks
Abhay
