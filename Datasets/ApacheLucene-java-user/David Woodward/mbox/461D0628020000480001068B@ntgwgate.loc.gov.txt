Hi.

I have encountered a problem searching in my application because of inconsistant unicode normalization
forms in the corpus (and the queries). I would like to normalize to form NFKD in an analyzer
(I think). I was thinking about creating a filter similar to the lowercasefilter that would
do the unicode normalization. Then I will add that filter to my existing snowball analyzer.
I am about to embark on creating said analyzer/filter using the ICU (http://icu-project.org/)
icu4j jar.

Is this already accounted for in standard lucene somewhere and I'm just missing it?

Anything similar out there?

Any other advice?

Thanks,
