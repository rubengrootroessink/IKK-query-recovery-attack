SUBJECT: Lucene search performance on Sun UltraSparc T2 (T5120) servers
DATE: 18 Feb 2009

Hi,

I have had a bad experience when migrating my application from Intel 
Xeon based servers to Sun UltraSparc T2 T5120 servers. Lucene fuzzy 
search just does not perform. A search which took approximately 500 ms 
takes more than 6 seconds to execute.

The index has about 100,000,000 records. So, I tried to split it into 10 
indices and used the ParallelSearcher on it, but still got similar results.

I am guessing that this is because the distance implementation used by 
Lucene requires higher clock speed and can't be parallelized much.

Please advice
