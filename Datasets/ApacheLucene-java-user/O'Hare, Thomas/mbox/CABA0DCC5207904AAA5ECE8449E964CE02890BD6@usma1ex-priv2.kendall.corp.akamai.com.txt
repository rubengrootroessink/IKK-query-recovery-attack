Thank you for the suggestion. I implemented what you recommended and now
having it working. I'm sorting on the first word in the title. 
 
Does Lucene have a "beginning of line" query syntax, like the regular
expression ^ symbol? For example,
 
title:^A*
 
What is the best way to sort by a date? I currently have a date field
that is used for searching in the format YYYYMMDD as a Field.Keyword. 
 
Thanks,
Tom

You can only sort on fields which are not tokenized I think. So add an
extra
field with the title, but untokenized, just for sorting. Also, "A*"
might
slow down the query execution so you might want to add another field
which
just contains the first letter so there's no need for the asterisk.

 Daniel
