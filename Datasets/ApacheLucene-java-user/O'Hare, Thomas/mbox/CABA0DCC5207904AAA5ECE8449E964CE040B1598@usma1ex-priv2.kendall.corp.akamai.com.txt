Does anyone know why Amazon.com lists the list price for Lucene in
Action as $60.95? Bookpool.com has the list price as $44.95, which is
the price that Manning is charging. After discounting, bookpool.com has
it on sale for $27.50.

Looking forward to getting my copy.

It's news to me that Amazon is shipping it in the U.S. even.... but I
just checked and you're right!  They *just* got it in stock though, so
I'm sure it takes a bit more time for the U.K. to get it.

It's been shipping from Manning's site for a couple of weeks now though,
and as noted, it includes the e-book along with it.
