If run `cat/index_dir/segements` on an optimized index there is only 
only string in there. It matches up with prefix of files in the index
directory.

If i run the same on an un-optimized index dir then i get back several
strings.

There are more files in the optimized index dir than just the ones with
the prefix listed in the segments file.
Have i corrupted my indexes?
Can I safely delete those files which do not have the prefix listed in
the segments file?

Thanks,
jt
