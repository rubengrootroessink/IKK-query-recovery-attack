SUBJECT: Wildcard search fails
DATE: 13 Aug 2009

Hello,

 

We're experiencing a problem using Lucene 2.4.1 and Compass 2.1.4 using
wildcard search.

Attribute values containing slashes can be searched using the full word,
but not using wildcards. We already tried different analyzers with the
same result.

Slash isn't mentioned as a stop word only backslash also.

 

Example : Searching < RZ/G/17 > and also < RZ/G/22 > succeed, but <
RZ/G/* > , < RZ/G* > or < RZ/G/ ?? > don't.

 

Any ideas why wildcard search doesn't work?

 

Thanks,

Ueli Kistler
