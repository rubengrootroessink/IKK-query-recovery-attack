SUBJECT: Reverse stemmer?
DATE: 6 Oct 2009


Hello,

I've been using Lucene in a very basic way for some time now, and I'm  
starting to take advantage of some of the linguistic capabilities only  
now.

I am making use of the snowball analyzer for stemming, and it works  
very well.


Question: is there any such thing as a "reverse stemmer"? In other  
words, given the stem of a word, is there any algorithm to find the  
original word? Or is this just fantasy? ;-)

Now, I understand that there is a 1:n mapping of stems:words. I can  
deal with that.


Thanks!
=David
