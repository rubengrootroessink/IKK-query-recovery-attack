SUBJECT: problem Indexing path of files
DATE: 4 Apr 2006

I trying to index the paths of a tree like structure in lucene

My docs have info like this

Node1
   name:a
   path:/a

Node2
   name:b
   path:/a/b

Node3
  name:c
  path:/a/b/c

 when search  for path:/a  the 3 Nodes match

I indexing this info using the StandardAnalyzer

any ideas to solve this trouble?
