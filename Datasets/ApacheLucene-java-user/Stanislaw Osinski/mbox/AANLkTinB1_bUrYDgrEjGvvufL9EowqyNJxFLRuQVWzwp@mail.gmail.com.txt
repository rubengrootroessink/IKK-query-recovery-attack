The clustering component is based on the Carrot2 project (
project.carrot2.org). Carrot2 has been around for many years and is a mature
piece of software. However, the scope of the clustering component is
currently limited to post-retrieval clustering, ie. clustering of search
results, not the whole index. If you're looking for large-scale clustering,
Mahout would be the way to go.
