SUBJECT: [release announcement] Carrot2 version 2.1 released
DATE: 13 Aug 2007

Hi All,

A bit of self-promotion again :) I hope you don't find it out of topic,
after all, some folks are using Carrot2 with Lucene and Solr, and Nutch has
a Carrot2-based clustering plugin.

Carrot2 Search Results Clustering Engine version 2.1 released

Version 2.1 of the Java-based Open Source Search Results Clustering Engine
called Carrot2 has been released. Carrot2 can fetch search results from a
variety of sources and automatically organize (cluster) them into thematic
categories using one of its specialized search results clustering
algorithms.

The 2.1 release comes with the Document Clustering Server that exposes
Carrot2 clustering as an XML-RPC or REST service with convenient XML or JSON
data formats enabling e.g. quick PHP, .NET or Ruby integration. The new
release also adds new search results sources and many other improvements (
http://project.carrot2.org/release-2.1-notes.html).

At the same time Carrot Search, the Carrot2 spin-off company, released
version 1.2 of Lingo3G -- a high-performance document clustering engine
offering hierarchical clustering, synonyms, label filtering and advanced
tuning capabilities.
