JavaCC is slow indeed. We used it for a while for Carrot2, but then (3 years
ago :) switched to JFlex, which for roughly the same grammar would sometimes
be up to 10x (!) faster. You can have a look at our JFlex specification at:

http://carrot2.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/carrot2/trunk/carrot2/components/carrot2-util-tokenizer/src/org/carrot2/util/tokenizer/parser/jflex/JFlexWordBasedParserImpl.jflex?view=markup

This one seems more complex than the StandardAnalyzer's but it's much faster
anyway.

If anyone is interested, I could prepare a JFlex based Analyzer equivalent
(to the extent possible) to current StandardAnalyzer, which might offer nice
indexing and highlighting speed-ups.

Best,

Staszek
