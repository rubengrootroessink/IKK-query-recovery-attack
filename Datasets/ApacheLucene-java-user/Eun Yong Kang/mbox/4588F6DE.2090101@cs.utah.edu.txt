SUBJECT: giving different boost to different terms in a same document
DATE: 20 Dec 2006

Hi,

I am trying to figure out how to give different weights to different 
terms in a same document.
Anybody knows how to do this?

For example,

doc A   contains  field1 : term1  (weight C)   field1 : term2 (weight F)

If I use setBoost(float)  function in the Field Object, I cannot give 
different weight to
term1 and term2.

Thanks,

Eun
