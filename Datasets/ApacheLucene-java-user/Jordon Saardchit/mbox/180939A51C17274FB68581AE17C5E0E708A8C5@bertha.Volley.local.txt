SUBJECT: Lucene on NFS/iSCSI
DATE: 1 Jun 2009


So I've read a lot about nightmares with lucene over shared indices using NFS, and was curious
if anyone had any experience running Lucene over iSCSI?  Specifically if the same sort of
lock failure issues occur as does with NFS.  I'm specifically looking into multple machines
mounted to a SAN via iSCSI with accelerated hardware initiator.

Looking to just get a general idea before investing in the possible solution.

Thanks,
Jordon
