Great!!! It works perfect after I setup -Xms and -Xmx JVM command-line 
parameters with:
java -Xms128m -Xmx128m

It turns out that my JVM is running out of memory. And Otis is right on
my 
reader closing too.
reader.close() will close the reader and release any system resources 
associated with it.

I really appreciate everyone's help!
