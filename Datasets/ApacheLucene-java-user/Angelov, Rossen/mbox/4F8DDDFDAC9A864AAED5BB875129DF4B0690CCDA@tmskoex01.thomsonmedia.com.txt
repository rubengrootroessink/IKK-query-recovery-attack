Probably your Unix system has a different default encoding than your Windows
machine.
You have to make sure you give the IndexWriter a string that has the correct
encoding.

Do you specifically set the encoding in you code before you index it with
Lucene?

Hi,

I haven't got no utf-8 index when I use Lucene with Solaris while my 
characters are OK under windows. My indexing program is the same and it 
uses lucene 1.4.3.

Is someone have an Idea to help me?

Regards,

Arnaud.
