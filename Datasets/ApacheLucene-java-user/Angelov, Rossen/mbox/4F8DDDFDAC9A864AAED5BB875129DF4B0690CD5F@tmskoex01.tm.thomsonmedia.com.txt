SUBJECT: proximity search not working when extending the QueryParser
DATE: 27 Jun 2005

When I'm using the QueryParser directly, the proximity search works fine and
getPhraseSlop() returns the correct slop int.

The problem is when I extend QueryParser. When extending it, getPhraseSlop
always returns the default value - 0. It's like setPhraseSlop is never
called.

Does anybody know if I have to parse the query, get the slop number and
explicitly call setPhraseSlop to have the proximity working or there is a
completely different way of doing it when extending the QueryParser?

Thanks,
Ross
