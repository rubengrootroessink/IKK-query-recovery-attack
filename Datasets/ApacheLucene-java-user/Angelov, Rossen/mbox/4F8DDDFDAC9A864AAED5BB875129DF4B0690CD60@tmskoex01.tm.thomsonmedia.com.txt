Thanks for the response Erik.

I just realized that in my MultiFieldQueryParser that extends the
QueryParser I'm overwriting only getFieldQuery(String, String) and not
getFieldQuery(String, String, int). That will explain why getPhraseSlop
always returs 0.

May be I asked my question prematurely, so let me change the code, test it
and if there is still a problem I'll get back to the list for help.

Ross - could you please show us a bit of your code so we can see  
explicitly what you're doing and how it's not working as expected?   
set/getPhraseSlop are quite straightforward, so unless you're mixing  
up the static versus instance parse methods with QueryParser then I  
don't know what could be wrong at this point.
