Yes, the headline is represented by regular words separated with spaces. I
guess, this can be considered tokenized.
I even didn't think this may cause problems. I'll check the API
documentation.

Is there any workaround for sorting on tokenized fields?

The headlines are probably tokenized, right? Sorting then won't work, I 
think the API documentation contains some details about this.
