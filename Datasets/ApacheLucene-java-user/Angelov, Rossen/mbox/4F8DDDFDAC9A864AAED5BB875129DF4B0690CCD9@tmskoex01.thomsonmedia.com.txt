SUBJECT: how long should optimizing take
DATE: 27 May 2005

Hi,

I'm having problems with the Lucene optimization. Two of the indexes are
about 2BG big and every day about 30 documents are added to each of these
indexes. At the end of the indexing the IndexWriter optimize() method is
executed and it takes about 30 minutes to finish the optimization for each
index.

The indexing happens through a web service. A servlet takes an http request
and executes methods to index the new documents and optimize the indexes.

The problem is that the request takes too long to finish because of the
optimization and the web server doesn't return a response. The browser will
keep waiting forever.

Has anybody else experienced similar behavior with the optimization process?

Thanks,
Ross
