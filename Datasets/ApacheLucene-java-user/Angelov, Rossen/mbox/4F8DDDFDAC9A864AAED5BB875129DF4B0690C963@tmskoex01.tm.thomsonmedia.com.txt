SUBJECT: BooleanQuery - TooManyClauses
DATE: 25 Oct 2004

Hi,

Why there is a limit on the number of clauses? and is there any harm in
setting MaxClauseCount to Integer.MAX_VALUE?

I'm using a Range Query on a field that represents dates and getting
BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses exception.
This is the query -  +/article/createddateiso8601:[20030101000000 TO
20031231999999]
There are currently over 51,000 documents indexed and every day 30 to 50 new
documents are being indexed.
Lucene 1.4.2

Thanks,
Ross
