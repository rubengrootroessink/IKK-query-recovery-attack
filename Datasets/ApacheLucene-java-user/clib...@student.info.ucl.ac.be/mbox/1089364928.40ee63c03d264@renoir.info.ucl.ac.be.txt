SUBJECT: How to acces informations from a part of the index
DATE: 9 Jul 2004

Hello,
for my thesis I have to use Lucene index for a Text categorization program.
For that I need to split the index in two. So i have a learning set and a 
validation set. The problem is that I don't know how to ask lucene to give 
me,for exemple, the number of documents IN ONLY ONE of these subsets 
containing a specific term.
For example, I would to get number of document containing term "hello" in a 
subset of document. This subset is a set of the document number({5,3} and the 
complete index would contains document {0,1,2,3,4,5})
How can I do this in an efficient way?
I tried to get all document containing the term and then verify which document 
belong to my subset. However, it appears that it's very slow to do this.
Thanks in advance
Claude Libois
