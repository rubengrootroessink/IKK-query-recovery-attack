SUBJECT: How to get all the values of a field in all the index
DATE: 11 Jul 2004



Hello,
I have indexed a database which contains a field category.
I would like to get an enumeration of all the category of the index.
So for that i need to get all possible different value of this field inside 
the index. For the moment I use  the terms() method,check if for each term if 
it's a category term and if so get the value of this term.
However it's rather inefficient. Do you have any solution for that?
