SUBJECT: Filtering accents
DATE: 30 Dec 2008

Dear all,

I'd like my lucene searches to be insensitive to (French) accents. For example, considering
a indexed term "métal", I want to get it when searching for "metal" or "métal" . I use lucene-2.3.2
and the searches are performed with: IndexSearcher.search(query,filter,sorter), Another filter
is already used together with a "Sort" object. Futrhermore, I cannot use the FrenchAnalyzer
as my index does not only contain French words.

Can anybody help ?
Thanks in advance,
Tom
