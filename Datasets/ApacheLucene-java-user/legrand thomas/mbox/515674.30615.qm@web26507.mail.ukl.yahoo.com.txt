SUBJECT: advanced WildcardQuery
DATE: 16 Jul 2008


Dear all,

I'd like to search on long titles (tokenized and stored) using the WildcardQuery. Considering
the following example:

title="pretty car for sale" 

If I search for "pretty*", I get the document having this title. But it's not the case if
I build a WilcardQuery with the term "pretty*car". I also want to get this document when searching
for "pretty*sale*". How should I do ? Is it really possible ?

I use lucene 2.3.1.

Thanks in advance,

Thomas Legrand
