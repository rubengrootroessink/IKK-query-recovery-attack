Do you mean how do you generate a URL that when the person clicks on it
they'll get the Excel document and they'll have their word highlighted?

If so, you're better off asking in an Excel newsgroup as this is outside
of what Lucene does.  You'll want to ask if you can pass an argument to
Excel that tells it where to go in the document.  Good luck!
