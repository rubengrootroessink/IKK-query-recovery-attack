Hi Nader,

I was wondering if you'd mind me asking you a couple of questions about your
implementation?

The main thing I'm interested in is how you handle updates to Lucene's
index. I'd imagine you have a fairly high turnover of CVs and jobs, so index
updates must place a reasonable load on the CPU/disk. Do you keep CVs and
jobs in the same index or two different ones? And what is the process you
use to update the index(es) - do you batch-process updates or do you handle
them in real-time as changes are made?

Any insight you can offer would be much appreciated as I'm about to
implement something similar and am a little unsure of the best approach to
take. We need to be able to handle indexing about 60,000 documents/day,
while allowing (many) searches to continue operating alongside.

Thanks!
Chris
