Hmm, good point with the cost of copying indicies in a distributed
environment, although that is unlikely to affect us in the foreseeable

Do you have any rough statistics on how many documents you index/day, or how
many every 20 minutes?

This discussion is fantastic by the way, lots of great experience and
comments coming out here. Thanks, it's really appreciated.
