Reading through the mailing list i see how exact matching can be done, a
la STFW to myself...

So the ShortVersion now stands:

For my query "abcd efgh ijkl"
Why does a (perfect looking) MultiPhraseQuery with
	termArrays[0] = { list_entry_shingles:abcd
			  list_entry_shingles:abcd efgh
			  list_entry_shingles:abcd efgh ijkl 
			}
	termArrays[1] = { list_entry_shingles:efgh
			  list_entry_shingles:efgh ijkl 
			}
	termArrays[2] = { list_entry_shingles:ijkl }

return only "abcd efgh ijkl" !?

(when the field is indexed as TextField this is the only hit i get)
(when the field is indexed as StrField i get zero hits!)

When the index contains 9 entries:
 "abcd efgh ijkl", "abcd efgh", "efgh ijkl", "abcd", "efgh", "ijkl", "ijkl efgh", "efgh abcd",
and "ijkl efgh abcd".

Does this MultiPhraseQuery actually require a match against *every* item
in each termArray on any document?
