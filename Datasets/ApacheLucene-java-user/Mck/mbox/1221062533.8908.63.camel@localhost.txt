Yes. It does not work.
It returns just the unigrams, again the same behaviour as mentioned
earlier.

Debugging ShingleFilter in this case it shows that no shingles are ever
constructed. There are 3 separate tokens in the query and that's all.

The ShingleFilter appears to only work, at least for me, on phrases.
I would think this correct as each shingle is in fact a sub-phrase to
the larger original phrase. Is that presumption correct?
