SUBJECT: Re : lucene doc id's
DATE: 27 Jan 2007

Hai ,
      I was trying to store to document id's external.

      I have found that lucene generates document id's linearly starting
from 0 and are not changed until any document is deleted.
       but it did work for me.

     How could I store document id's externally.
