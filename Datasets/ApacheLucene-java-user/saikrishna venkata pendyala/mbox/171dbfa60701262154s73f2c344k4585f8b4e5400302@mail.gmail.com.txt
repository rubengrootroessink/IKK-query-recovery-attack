SUBJECT: Re : lucene document id's
DATE: 27 Jan 2007

Hai ,
      I was trying to store to document id's external.

      I have found that lucene generates document id's linearly starting
from 0 and are not changed until any document is deleted.
       but it did work for me.

      Was the above one correct ? if not who could I store document id's
externally.

      Also who to retrieve document knowing it's id.
