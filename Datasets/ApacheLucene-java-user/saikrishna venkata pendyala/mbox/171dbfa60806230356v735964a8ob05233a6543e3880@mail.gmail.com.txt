Hi Aditi,

As Rohit said, the best way to solve this problem is to have two fields for
indexing an email-id, one for the username and another for domain name.

Having two fields and using a Boolean Query with MUST condition should solve
your problem. You can also perform restricted search with the above
architecture, like search for user "x" with in the domain "gmail.com"
