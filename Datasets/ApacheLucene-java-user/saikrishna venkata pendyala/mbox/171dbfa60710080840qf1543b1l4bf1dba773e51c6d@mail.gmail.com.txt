Hai,

     Thank you for responding.

 I have abt 17,00,000 documents in 1000 files. I need to index the titles of
those documents with out storing the titles and storing the file name.

When ever I issue a query I need to get the name of the file in which that
document exists.

thanks,
Saikrishna.
