I really don't know why os x could have induced those kinds of  
filesystem issues.  i assumed that since i had switched over to the  
intel architecture that perhaps something was going on with the  
JVM...everything involved in the process was mac; local filesystem, etc.

but i'm fairly sure that the trunk code has fixed the problem.  i ran  
two 'offending' bits of code and checked their results.  not only did  
they finish (quite a feat today), but they did so correctly.
