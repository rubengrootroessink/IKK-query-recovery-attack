i seem to be having a problem analogous to this one (no answer that i  
see):

	http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/32268? 
search_string=cannot%20overwrite;#32268

trouble is, i just put lucene on my new macbook pro and am having the  
problem that if i build a large index, i get an I/O error due to  
something like

	java.io.IOException: Cannot overwrite: /data/reuters/indexes/reuters/ 
deleteable.new

same code worked fine on my previous machine (still running on a G4  
powerbook and a linux machine).  sometimes it has trouble writing the  
segments file instead...

has anyone seen and solved this problem?  thoughts on what might be  
behind it?

thanks,
-Miles
