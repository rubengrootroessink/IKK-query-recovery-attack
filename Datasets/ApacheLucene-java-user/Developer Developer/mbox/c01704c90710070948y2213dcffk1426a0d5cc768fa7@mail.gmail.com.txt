DATE: 7 Oct 2007

Hi Eric,

Thanks for the quick reply.    My index does not return any hits when i
search for certain phrases . I am very sure that the indexed documents does
have those phrases in them.

Therefore i want to just list all the terms and their postions for given
document just to make sure that the indexed document does have those terms
indexed in the correct order.

I did check with luke and came up with the following code that does not seem
to be working !!. positions.next()) returns flase !.  Do you see anything
wrong in this code?

Directory dir = FSDirectory.getDirectory(args[0]);
IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(dir);
TermPositions positions = reader.termPositions();

 while(positions.next())
  {
     positions.nextPosition();

     positions.nextPosition();
     byte b[] = positions.getPayload(null, 0);
     System.out.println(b);
  }
