Roger,

Why can;t you have one document  for every combination of dimension, level
? Add cube name , id and description too as a field to all documents , all
it would be reduntant information, but you can live with it i suppose?

I think you are developing an application to search a cube ?

what do you mean by observations of a dimension ? is there an example?
