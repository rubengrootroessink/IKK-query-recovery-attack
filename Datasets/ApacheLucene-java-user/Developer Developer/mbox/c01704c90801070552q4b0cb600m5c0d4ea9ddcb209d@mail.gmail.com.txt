here is another approach.

StandardAnalyzer st = new StandardAnalyzer();
StringReader reader= new StringReader("text to index...");
                TokenStream stream = st.tokenStream("content", reader);


Then use the Field constructor such as
*Field<http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html#Field%28java.lang.String,%20org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenStream%29>
*(String<http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true>
name,
TokenStream<http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/org/apache/lucene/analysis/TokenStream.html>
 tokenStream)

to add a filed to a Document and then add the Document to the index.
