SUBJECT: How does lucene handle content-type
DATE: 5 Apr 2007

I am using WGET to download content from the www with ---save-header option.
The save-header option saves the hppt header to the downloaded files.
Does Lucene make use of content type  while indexing  or  I have to parse
the header , determine the content-type and determine the right set of
actions to do ?

Thanks !
