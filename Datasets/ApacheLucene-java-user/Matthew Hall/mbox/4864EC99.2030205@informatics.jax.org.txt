DATE: 27 Jun 2008

Also, please note that I thought about it and realized that I mispoke 
when I sent out my original suggestion.  You don't want an untokenized 
field in your case, you want an unstemmed one instead.

This will allow you to get the functionality you are looking for.. at 
least I believe so ^^

Anyhow, best of luck!
