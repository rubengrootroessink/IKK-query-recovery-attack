You can simply change your input string to lowercase before passing it 
to the analyzers, which will give you the effect of escaping the boolean 
operators.  (I.E you will now search on and or and not)  Remember 
however that these are extremely common words, and chances are high that 
you are removing them via your stop words list in your analyzer.  This 
is also assuming you are using an analyzer that does lowercasing as part 
of its normal processing, which many do.
