SUBJECT: Looking for an example of Using Position Increment Gap
DATE: 4 Mar 2008

Fellows,

I'm working on a project here where we are trying to use our lucene 
indexes to return concrete objects.  One of the things we want to be 
able to match by is by vocabulary terms annotated to that object, as 
well as all of the child vocabulary terms of that annotated term.

So, what I was thinking about doing is extending my index that returns 
objects of that type to include a new field say "sub_term".  In this 
field I would put all of the text of these vocabulary sub terms 
together, and introduce phrase boundries using some of the techniques 
that are described in the Javadoc in the analysis section.  (Basically 
writing a custom analyzer that introduces a position increment gap 
between phrases)  I am however curious if an example of a usage like 
that exists somewhere that I could use as a basis for the analyzer that 
I'm going to have to write to handle this case.

Does anyone know of a good example?

Matt
