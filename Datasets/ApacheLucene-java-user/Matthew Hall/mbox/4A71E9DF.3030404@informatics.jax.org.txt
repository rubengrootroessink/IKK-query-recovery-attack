DATE: 30 Jul 2009

Place a delimiter between the email addresses that doesn't get removed 
in your analyzer.  (preferably something you know will never be searched on)

That way you can ensure that each email matches independently of each other.

So something like

foo@bar.com DELIM123 bar@foo.com DELIM123 com@bar.foo
