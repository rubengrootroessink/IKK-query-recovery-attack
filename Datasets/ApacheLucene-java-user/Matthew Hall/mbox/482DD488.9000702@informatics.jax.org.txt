Very very interesting.

I went ahead and turned on the AllowLeadingWildcard toggle and 
everything works just as expected now, which is odd in a way.

I'm still not certain why a search for '\*ache*' would be considered to 
have a  leading wildcard.  I'm searching for the literal * character 
here which I would have assumed would be a completely fine thing to do 
in a search, but somehow its triggering the leading wildcard checking 
logic. 

Well, anyhow thanks much for the suggestion, things are working properly 
now.
