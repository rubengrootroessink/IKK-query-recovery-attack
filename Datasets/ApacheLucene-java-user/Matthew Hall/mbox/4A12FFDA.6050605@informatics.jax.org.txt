SUBJECT: NE Lucene User's Interest Group
DATE: 19 May 2009

Since everyone else seems to be trying to start these up I figured I 
would poll the community and see if there is any interest in the greater 
new england ares for a Lucene users group.  Searching over on Google 
leads me to believe that such a group doesn't currently exist, and I 
think it would certainly be something interesting to attempt.

Sadly. I'm betting that for any such group to succeed it would likely 
have to be Boston based, but perhaps there is a secret pocket of Lucene 
user's in Maine that I am not aware of.

So, would anyone be interested in a such a thing, with location/topics 
of discussion TBD based on interest?  Assuming there is enough interest 
in such a thing I would be willing to help organize/plan it, and I think 
I could convince my group to discuss our practical application of Lucene 
when searching Genomic information.

-Matt
