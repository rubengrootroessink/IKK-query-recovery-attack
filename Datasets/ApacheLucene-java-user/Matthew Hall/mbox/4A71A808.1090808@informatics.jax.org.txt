SUBJECT: Re: How to index IP addresses?
DATE: 30 Jul 2009

I'm a little unclear on how you could be getting both "aa.bb.cc.dd" as a 
term, and then also the octets.

Are you adding the "contents" field into the index multiple times, 
possibly with separate analyzers?

Could you possibly try a test, very simple case?

Just create an index with a single lucene document, with that documents 
contents being "aa.bb.cc.dd" and then take a look at the index via Luke 
again.

When you look at the terms section (Its what comes up by default) you 
SHOULD see only "aa", "bb", "cc", and "dd" as the top (and thusly ONLY 
terms in the index).  This could vary depending on your analyzer, as 
some will show an index containing only a single term "aa.bb.cc.dd".  
What I would not expect is an index that would contain both.

Furthermore by making the field not analyzed you will now have a 
trickier time searching for it.  As you will need to use a keyword 
analyzer or something similar to search, which if I'm understanding the 
spirit of your problem isn't really something that you want to do.

So, if you could run that test scenario that I've outlined for you I 
think you should be able to have a nice test bed to see what the results 
of swapping to different analyzers will have on the data that you are 
trying to index.  Then, after you have played with that a bit you should 
be able to re-expand your corpus again, and see if the analyzer you have 
chosen continues to stand up. 

I.. had thought that StandardAnalyzer already kept IP addresses together 
as a single token, but maybe its doing something... special and 
interesting and thusly you are seeing the behavior that you are describing.
