SUBJECT: Term Frequency for more complex terms
DATE: 3 Jul 2008

I have a quick question, could someone point me towards where in the API 
I'll have to investigate in order to figure out the term frequencies of 
more complex terms?

For example I want to know the tf of "kit ligand" treated as a phrase.  
I see that luke has access to this information in its explain method, 
but the api call is currently eluding me.

Thanks,

Matt
