I suspect you are using a different analyzer to highlight than you are 
using to search.

A couple of things you can check:

Immediately after your query simply print out hits.length, this should 
conclusively tell you that you query is in fact working, after that 
ensure that you are using the same analyzer for your highlighter that 
you are for your query parser.

If you are not, its entirely possible that the text you are trying to 
highlight with is being transformed differently than how it was in the 
query, and as a result isn't matching against your fields anymore.

Hope that helps,

Matt
