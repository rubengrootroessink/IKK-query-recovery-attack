Things that could help us immensely here.

Can you post your indexReader/Searcher initialization code from your 
standalone app, as well as your webapp.

Could you further post your Analyzer Setup/Query Building code from both 
apps.

Could you further post the document creation code used at indexing time? 
(Which analyzer, and which fields are indexed/stored)

Give us this, and I'm pretty darn sure we can nail down your issue.
