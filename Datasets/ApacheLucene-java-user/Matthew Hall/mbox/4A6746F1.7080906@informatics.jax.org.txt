If you did this, wouldn't you be binding the processing of the results 
of all queries to that of the slowest performing one within the collection?

I'm guessing you are trying for some sort of performance benefit by 
batch processing, but I question whether or not you will actually get 
more performance by performing your queries in a threaded type 
environment, and then processing their results as they come in.

Could you give a bit more description about what you are actually trying 
to accomplish, I'm sure this list could help better if we had more 
information.
