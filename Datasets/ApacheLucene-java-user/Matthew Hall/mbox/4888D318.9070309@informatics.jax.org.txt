Erm.. if its not tokenized that's your problem.

You are setting up an Analyzer when indexing.. but then not actually 
USING it.

Whereas when you are searching you are running your query through the 
analyzer, which transforms your text in such a way that it no longer 
matches against your untokenized form.

So, rerun your index, changing untokenized to tokenized, and I think you 
will see the results you are looking for.
