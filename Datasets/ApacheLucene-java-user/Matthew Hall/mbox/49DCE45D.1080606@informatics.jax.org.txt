You can define your own STOP_LIST and pass it in as a constructor to 
most analyzers.

For example from the Lucene Javadocs:


      StandardAnalyzer

public *StandardAnalyzer*(String <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html>[]
stopWords)

Builds an analyzer with the given stop words.

The only thing that you need to be careful of is to make sure that the 
analyzer isn't doing some sort of conversion of the tokens before the 
stoplist is checked, but otherwise that should work out just fine.
