DATE: 17 Jul 2009

I'd think extending WhiteSpaceTokenizer would be a good place to start.

Then create a new Analyzer that exactly mirrors your current Analyzer, 
with the exception that it uses your new tokenizer instead of 
WhiteSpaceTokenizer (Well.. there is of course my assumption that you 
are using an Analyzer that already uses WhiteSpaceTokenizer... but you 
likely are)
