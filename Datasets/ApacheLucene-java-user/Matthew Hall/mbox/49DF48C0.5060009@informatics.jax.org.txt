I think I would tackle this in a slightly different manner.

When you are creating this index, make sure that that field has a
default value. Make sure this value is something that could never appear
in the index otherwise. Then, when you goto place this field into the
index, either write out your actual value, or the default one.

Then when you get the document back, you can look at that field, and
solve your question. You can also craft queries that specifically avoid
entries that don't have a value in this field with a not clause.

Hope this helps,

Matt
