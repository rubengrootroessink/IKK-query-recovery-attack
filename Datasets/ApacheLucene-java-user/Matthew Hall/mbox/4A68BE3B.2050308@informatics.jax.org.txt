Looking at what you wrote:

I am doing a weighting system where I rank documents that have Term 1 AND
Term 2 AND Term 3 more highly than documents that have just Term 1 AND Term
2, and more highly than documents that just have Term 1 OR Term 2 but not
both.

Couldn't you maybe get the same effect using some clever term boosting?

I.. think something like

"Term 1" OR "Term 2" OR "Term 3" ^ .25

would return in almost the exact order that you are asking for here, 
with the only real difference being that you would have some matches for 
only Term 3 way way at the bottom of your list score wise.

It might be worth investigating something like this, where you cut off 
displaying documents that don't match a certain score thresh hold.  Thus 
cutting out the matches that you don't want (The term3 only ones)
