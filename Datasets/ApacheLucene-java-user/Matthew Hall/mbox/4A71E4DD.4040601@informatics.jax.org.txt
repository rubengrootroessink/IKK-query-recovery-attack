SUBJECT: Re: indexing multiple email addresses in one field
DATE: 30 Jul 2009

1. Sure, just have an analyzer that splits on all non letter characters.
2. Phrase queries keep the order intact.  (And yes, the positional 
information for the terms is kept, which is what allows span queries to 
work)

So searching on the following "foo bar com" will match foo@bar.com but 
not bar@foo.com
