Also, ensure that you didn't inadvertently add an older version of your 
Jar file somewhere in your classpath.  Eclipse will take the first it 
comes to, and skip any others found later on in the path.

Right Click on your Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path and ensure 
you don't have an older version in there.
