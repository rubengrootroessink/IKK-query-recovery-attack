SUBJECT: Re: Query which gives high score proportional to 'distinct term matches'
DATE: 30 Jun 2009

Well, we have a very similar requirement here, but for us its for every 
single field that we wanted this kind of behavior.

We got this in by eliminating the TF (Term Frequency) contribution to 
score via a custom Similarity. (Which is very easy to do.)

I... think in the newer versions of lucene you can omit TF more 
programatically at query time, but I don't recall if you could do it on 
a per field basis.  Anyone else want to speak on this a bit better?
