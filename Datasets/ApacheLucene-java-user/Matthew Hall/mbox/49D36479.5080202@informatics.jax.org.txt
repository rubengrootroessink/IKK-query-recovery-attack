Which analyzer are you using here?  Depending on your choice the comma 
separated values might be being kept together in your index, rather than 
tokenized as you expected.

Secondly, you should get Luke, and take a look into your index, this 
should give you a much better idea of what's going on in your index.

Anyhow, closely examine your analyzer choice, and then your query type 
choice and see if that's where the problem lies.
