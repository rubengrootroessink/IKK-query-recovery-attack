SUBJECT: Re: Using Lucene to index a DataBase
DATE: 29 Nov 2001


Yes, that is exactly the approach we have taken with the current project I
am working on using Lucene.

Write some code to retrieve desired rows from the database, then add each
database field as a Lucene field in a new Lucene document, then index,
search etc.

Works very well in our case.

I've used Verity in Cold Fusion to index Databases.  Is this possible with
Lucene?  From recent posts, it looks like I would have to write a custom
parser to convert each row into a text document.  Am I correct in thinking
this?
