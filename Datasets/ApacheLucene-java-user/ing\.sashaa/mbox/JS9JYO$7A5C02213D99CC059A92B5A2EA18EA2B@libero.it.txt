SUBJECT: Error with lucene-core-2.2.0.jar
DATE: 29 Nov 2007

Hi all,
I'm using a program that use the Lucene Library. I've downloaded lucene-core-2.2.0.jar file
and I'm trying it, but I get this error while trying to index my documents:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 
org.apache.lucene.document.Document.add(Lorg/apache/lucene/document/Field;)V

I've searched among old threads and I think that the error is caused by a wrong version of
library. So, which one must I use?

Thanks.
Ale
