Great....thanks! Do you feel as though, managing an index made up of numerous smaller indices
is an effective use of the MultiReader and MultiSearcher? Ignoring for a moment the potential
of causing a "Too many open files" error, I feel as though it may be decent/reasonable way
in which one could ensure overall index integrity by managing smaller parts.

As a side note, regarding the "Too many open files" issue, has anyone noticed that this could
be related to the JVM? For instance, I have a coworker who tried to run a number of "optimized"
indexes in a JVM instance and a received the "Too many open files" error. With the same number
of available file descriptors (on linux ulimit = ulimited), he split the number of indicies
over too JVM instances his problem disappeared.  He also tested the problem by increasing
the available memory to the JVM instance, via the -Xmx parameter, with all indicies running
in one JVM instance and again the problem disappeared. I think the issue deserves more testing
to pin-point the exact problem, but I was just wondering if anyone has already experienced
anything similar or if this information could be of use to anyone, in which case we should
probably start a new thread dedicated to this issue.

Rasik
