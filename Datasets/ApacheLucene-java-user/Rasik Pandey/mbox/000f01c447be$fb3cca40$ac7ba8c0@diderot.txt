Tomcat 5++ uses a relative and sometimes uncreated java.io.tmpdir. A number of people, including
myself ran into this problem with the the 1.4rc3 and so there was a patch added to Lucene
(FSDirectory) last week or the week before to handle such cases. You may want to use the code
in the Lucene HEAD......
