I should have checked Bugzilla before I started my research. Anyway, I basically discovered
the same things about two weeks ago, but haven't had the opportunity to code those changes.


The lack of response to Doug's question could be partly due to the fact that all the files
aren't attached properly. In response to Doug's question (without having the files to examine),
it seems like, with the proposed Lucene API changes (setters) that Class.newInstance could
be used to create new objects in an attempt to address the concurrency issues?

Regard,
RBP

P.S. -  My apologies for the EriC instead of EriK in previous exchanges.
