Hi James,

Have a look in Bugzilla at issue #34563. I contributed some code last
night that may be helpful to you. Have a look at the
patchTestSort.txt, which is a diff of my changes to test the classes I
created. This may help you understand how to use the classes, but I
assume based upon the value you are storing in the index you may only
need the LongSortComparator.java which I attached to that Bugzilla
issue.

Regards,
Rus
