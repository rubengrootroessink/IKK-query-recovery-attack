A fairly quick way is to implement your own HitCollector to count,
and then use the appropriate methods of IndexSearcher.

If you really need maximum performance, this bit of code
avoids computing the score values and invoking the
HitCollector (untested):

// s is the IndexSearcher, query the Query
org.apache.lucene.search.Scorer scorer =
   query.weight(s).scorer(s.getIndexReader());
int count = 0;
while (scorer.next()) count++;
