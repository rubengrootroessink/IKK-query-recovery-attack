SUBJECT: Hits length with no sorting or scoring

Hello,

I have an application in which we only need to know the total number of
documents matching a query.  In this case we do not need any sorting or
scoring or to store any reference to the matching documents.  Can you
tell me how to execute such a query with maximum performance?

Thanks

Laurie
