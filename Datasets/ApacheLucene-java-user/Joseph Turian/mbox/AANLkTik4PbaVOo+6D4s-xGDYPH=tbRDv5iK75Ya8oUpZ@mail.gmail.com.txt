SUBJECT: Re: MemoryIndex or RAMDirectory, but score using term statistics from a corpus given during preprocessing?
DATE: 1 Nov 2010

Does this question make sense?

What I want is to compute term statistics over a corpus, and then use these
statistics when doing scoring + retrieval using a MemoryIndex or
RAMDirectory.

How can I do that?

Thanks,
    Joseph
