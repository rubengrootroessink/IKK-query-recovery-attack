You shouldn't have to. It depends on the type of index  you are using.
Typically indexes are stored on the file system. They can however be RAM
based that you would need to serialize to persist, or I believe you could
use other storage mediums such as CD rom.

However typically, it is persisted on the file system, and you only have to
give the IndexWriter, Searcher, etc... the path to the index to use it the
next time you start Lucene.
