SUBJECT: many analyzers, same index.
DATE: 19 Oct 2001

Is there anything wrong with using multiple analyzers on the same index, (given of course that
I am keeping the set of documents for each mutually exclusive)?

I am hoping to use a single Lucene index in my application, but some documents need to be
analyzed differently.

Advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,
