Aruna,

That sounds like duplicated work. Check out the ISOGEN XML-indexing package
on the Lucene Contributions page. It's been in the contributions area for
several months.

In a nutshell, it builds a DOM to index XML in a way that preserves many of
the structural relationships in a searchable form. It's definitely worth a
look, imho.

Regards,
