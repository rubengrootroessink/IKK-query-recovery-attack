The issue is that the set of features for queries on different types of
contextual units (used to define Lucene documents) will be different.

An example is that our XML and text documents need fuzzy-matching and porter
stemming capabilities and on others (created and maintained from metadata on
objects) we definitely don't want that.

We want to keep everything in one index so I believe that we need to
add/maintain/query document sets using separate IndexWriters, Readers, and
searching with disparate analyzers all on the same index.

Thanks again for the advice.
