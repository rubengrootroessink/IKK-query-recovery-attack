Samir,

I think its more likely that the more recently indexed articles had a higher
'score' and thus were displayed first in results. Hits are ranked based on
an algorithm (see FAQ). You should printout the 'score' for each document
hit and see that the first results displayed actually had a higher score
than the older ones. I don't think FIFO/LIFO have anything to do with it...
Look at the scoring algorithm; then try searching for things that should
have a higher score in the older documents and see if they come up higher in
your results.

Hope that helps,

-Brandon

long as we need to get the latest documents. (articles on WSJ published
today were indexed today, nad hence are more recent and more relevant). But
I also have to index the older articles.  So, I have 2 questions...
