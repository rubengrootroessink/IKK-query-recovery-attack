Vanita,

If you check out the contributions page for Lucene you'll see several
options. If you are wanting to search based on the structure of the XML
file, I would recommend looking at the W. Eliot Kimber submission to see an
example of how to do this.

Also, if you search through the mail archive on this topic, you'll find
plenty of related discussion.
