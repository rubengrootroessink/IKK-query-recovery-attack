DATE: 18 Apr 2002

Hey Peter,

One possible rational is:

Most any english document will contain lowercase 'and's and 'or's it its
text content. Granted they may be poor choices for search query strings and
may be frequently filtered out at index-time, however they shouldn't
necessarily be forcefully denied as search text content. Uppercase 'AND' and
'OR' are much less likely to occur and are therefore much better candidates
for boolean operators.

(Sorry for the delayed response...perhaps better late than never...)
