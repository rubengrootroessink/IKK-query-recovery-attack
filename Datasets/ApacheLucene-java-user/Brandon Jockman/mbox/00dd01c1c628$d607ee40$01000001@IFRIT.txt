You should read the Lucene FAQ
 http://www.lucene.com/cgi-bin/faq/faqmanager.cgi ). Most of your questions
(over the past few days) are already answered there.

Hi again!

I should really reword my question as follows:

On which criteria are relevant documents chosen given a particular query

and

once retrieved, how are these documents ranked?

The techniques by which this is done will then determine what type of IR
model Lucene implements.

Thanks again!

Melissa
