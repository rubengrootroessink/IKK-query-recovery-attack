SUBJECT: Re: Indexing multiple equiv fieldnames (revisited)
DATE: 29 May 2002

If you look on the contributions page, W. Eliot Kimber submitted a solution
months ago that does exactly what you are recommending to do. It is a good
example of what you need to do to properly index XML documents with Lucene
in order to preserve document structure. If you use that solution, you will
want to limit the elements that get indexed to be specific to your
application needs 'ie. only index customer elements'. This will keep
performance manageable.

I recommend checking out that XML indexing solution and searching the mail
archive for related emails.

Many XML indexing issues have already been addressed.
