Hi, I was wondering if I could get some help with using IndexWriter and IndexReader.  I'm pretty
new to Lucene, and I've already written an application that indexes a directory of files...
but now I'm trying to make the index be able to be maintained through incremental changes.
 
the case i'm trying to solve right now is when there already is a doc in the index with the
same UID and the contents are different... I need to remove the old doc, and add the new doc.
 
 
However, when I try to do this with IndexReader, I get this "lock obtained timed out" IOexception.
I'm not exactly sure where this is coming from... can anyone help?
