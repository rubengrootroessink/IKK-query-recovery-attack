SUBJECT: RE: UTF8 accents & umlauts filter?
DATE: 14 Sep 2006

We use ICU4J to do the filtering based on Unicode blocks. See
http://icu.sourceforge.net/userguide/Transform.html for a sense of what
you can do. It's worth it for us because we need to normalize cyrillic
as well as roman text; it might be overkill for other situations. But it
does good work. The first example on the page linked above shows
accent-stripping: you normalize to NFD (decomposed unicode, where
accents are represented as non-spacing characters), then delete all the
non-spacing characters, and finally normalize back to composed unicode.

Thanks Yonik & Ken for both answers; I think the explanations went a
little over my head, but I think you understood what I was talking
about! Basically, a better filter to remove all possible accents (&
umlauts as a bonus, for completeness sake; I personally would have no
use for it).

I think it's way more work and way more complicated than I initially
thought it would be. Anyone feels able to do this?
