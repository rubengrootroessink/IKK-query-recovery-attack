SUBJECT: Lucene for Indian Languages
DATE: 23 Aug 2004

Hi all,

 Is Lucene API implemented for Indian contexts? I know
that Lucene stemmers and filters for German and
Russian Languages. I would like to know, whether there
are stemmers and filters available/being developed for
Indian Languages.

Thanks,
Rahavan.
