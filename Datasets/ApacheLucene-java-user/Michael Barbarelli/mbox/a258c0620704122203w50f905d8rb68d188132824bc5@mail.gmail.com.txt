SUBJECT: custom stop word list for standard analyzer
DATE: 13 Apr 2007

I know this is a relatively fundamental thing to arrange, but I'm having
trouble.

Can I instantiate a standard analyzer with an argument containing my own
stop words?  If so, how?  Will they be appended to or override the built-in
stop words?

Or, do I have to modify the analyzer class itself and recompile?

Thanks.
