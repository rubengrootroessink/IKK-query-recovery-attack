SUBJECT: multiple field search
DATE: 2 Aug 2004


Hi all,

 

            I want to sort my search results according to rankings - I've no
idea how this kind of thing is handled in lucene so I'll outline what I
need:

 

            I need to be able to support a situation like this - an index of
books, with a primaryAuthor field and secondaryAuthors field.  What I'd like
to do is have a document be ranked higher if the search term appears in the
primaryAuthor field, than it would be if it only appeared in
secondaryAuthor.

 

            That said, I still haven't worked out how to search using
multiple fields yet so any help would be greatly appreciated.

 

cheers,

Toby
