SUBJECT: Adding to an existing document
DATE: 1 Jul 2004


Hi all,

      I have an index which contains information from a forum database

 

- one document per thread, containing all messages in a big text field.  If
I wanted to add a new message string to and existing thread, is there some
way I can append it to the document?

 

cheers,

Toby
