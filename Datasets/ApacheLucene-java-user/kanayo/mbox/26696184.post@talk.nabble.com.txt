SUBJECT: Problem searching field with % as value
DATE: 8 Dec 2009


Hi,

I am a newbie to lucene. I am using Standard Analyzer in my lucene project. 
I am indexing some fields which may contain only "%" as a field value and it
indexes fine and i can view the value against the field in the index using
Luke.

However when i try to retrieve the same field using indexsearcher and
passing "%" as a query parameter nothing is retrieved. It is simply being
ignored. I have also tried to escape the "%" while searching but still no
results.

Is there anything am not doing right?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.
