SUBJECT: Re: Problem searching field with % as value
DATE: 10 Dec 2009


Hi,

Thanks Ian for your reply. What i did was to put a check in my indexing such
that when the stirng to index is just % it stores it un_analyzed else then
analyze and i then use the TermQuery to search for it and it is now working.

Thanks a lot for your tip.

Cheers.
