Sorry, I mean sorting the documents in an order other than the order they
are added.  The my search could just return docs in index order.  For the
most common sorting I could collect only the first x docs and then
short-circuit the search like we previously discussed.

I was wondering if it is possible to apply a sort at merge time?

Cheers,

John
