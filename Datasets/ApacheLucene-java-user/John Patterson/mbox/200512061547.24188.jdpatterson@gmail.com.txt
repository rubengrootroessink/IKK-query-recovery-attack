Hi,

I was wondering if there is a standard way to retrive documents WITHOUT 
scoring and sorting them.  I need a list of documents that contain certain 
terms but I do not need them sorted or scored.

Looking at the source it appears that I can use the TermDocs directly and 
write a method similar to ConjunctionScorer.next()

Does such a Class already exist?

Thanks,

John.
