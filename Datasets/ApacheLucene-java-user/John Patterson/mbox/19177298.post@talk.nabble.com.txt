SUBJECT: Index types
DATE: 27 Aug 2008


Hi, I know that Lucene uses an inverted index which makes range queries and
great-than/less-than type queries very slow for continuous data types like
times, latitude, etc.  Last time I looked they were converted into huge OR
queries and so had a maximum clause limit.  

I was wondering if any work had been done on integrating other index
implementations?

Thanks,

John
