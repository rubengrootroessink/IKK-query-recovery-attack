But I can have many terms in the query.  With over 10 million documents and
many concurrent searches, creating a filter for every search would create a
lot of garbage, use a lot of ram and surely cripple the performance.

Also, I use the boolean AND and OR type functionality when filtering out
results.

And logically, it does not need to be done.  I am just looking for the
standard way that people use fields to narrow done results.  Every product
catalogue / shopping site does it.

Thanks for the suggestions.  Is there truly no non-hack way to accomplish
this?
