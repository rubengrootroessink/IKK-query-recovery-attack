SUBJECT: Mixing non scored an scored queries
DATE: 15 Jul 2008


Hi,

I have a number of fields that are used to filter documents from a search.
They should not contribute to the score of the document but merely decide
which documents are valid.  i.e. it doesn't matter how rare they are in the
index.  I also have a single "combined" field that is used for free text
searching and it should be scored as normal.

How can I turn off scoring of these "filter" fields?

Thanks,

John
