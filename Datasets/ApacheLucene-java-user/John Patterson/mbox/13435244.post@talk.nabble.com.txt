SUBJECT: Cache BitSet or doc number?
DATE: 26 Oct 2007


Hi,

I am thinking about caching search results for common queries and just want
to check that for small numbers of results it would be better to store the
doc number as ints or shorts than to store a Filter with a BitSet.  I guess
if you results contain less than 1/32 or 1/16 of the number of documents
then it would take less memory.

Is there anything else to consider?

Thanks,

John
