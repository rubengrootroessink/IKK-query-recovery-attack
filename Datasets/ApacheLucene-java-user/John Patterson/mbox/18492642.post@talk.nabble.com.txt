A couple of years ago I created a "ConjuctionSearcher" that did pretty much
the same job as ConjuctionScorer but did no scoring at all.  Admittedly I
did no optimisation on it - just used standard collections etc - and found
it performed about 10% faster.  That was less than I hoped for so I didn't
bother taking it any further.  But I guess for some people a 10% saving
could be significant.
