I used the MySQL full text search to index about 70K business directory
records.  It became impossibly slow and I ended up creating my own text
search engine similar in concept to Lucene but database driven.  It worked
much faster than the native MySQL full text search.

Other limitations of MySQL MATCH syntax:
- only 4 letter words and over are indexed (if you change this it searches
VERY slowly)
- the MATCH value figure returned is next to useless (it ranges wildly and
is not normalized like Lucene values are)
- cannot weight certain fields as more important than others.

Really it is very limited.

John.

I also question whether it could handle extreme volume with such good query
speed.

Has anyone done numbers with  1+ million documents?

Stemming is still on the MySQL TODO list:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Fulltext_TODO.html

Also, for most people it's easier to extend Lucene than MySQL (as MySQL is
written in C(++?)) and there are more powerful queries in Lucene, e.g.
fuzzy phrase search.
