SUBJECT: Hit 2 has score less than Hit 3
DATE: 14 Dec 2004

I have come across a scenario where the hits returned are not sorted. Or
maybe they are sorted but the explanation is not correct.

Take a look at
http://cofferdam.cs.utexas.edu:8080/search.jsp?query=space+odyssey&hitsPerPage=10&hitsPerSite=0

Look at the top 3 results.

Score of Hit 1 is 1.0188559
Score of Hit 2 is 0.9934416
Score of Hit 3 is 1.0188559

I can't explain how score of hit 2 can be < hit 3. I thought the hits that
were returned were sorted.

An explanation is that the explanation of hit 2 is not correctly computed.
Has anyone encountered this before?

FYI, the docs corresponding to hits 1,2 and 3 have exactly the same
scoring fields(By scoring fields, I mean the fields used in the query).

Thanks for your time.
