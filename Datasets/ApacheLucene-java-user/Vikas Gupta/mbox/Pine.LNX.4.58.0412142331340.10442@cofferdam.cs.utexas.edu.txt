SUBJECT: Re: A question about scoring function in Lucene
DATE: 15 Dec 2004

Lucene uses the vector space model. To understand that:

-Read section 2.1 of "Space optimizations for Total Ranking" paper (Linked
here http://lucene.sourceforge.net/publications.html)
-Read section 6 to 6.4 of
http://www.csee.umbc.edu/cadip/readings/IR.report.120600.book.pdf
-Read section 1 of
