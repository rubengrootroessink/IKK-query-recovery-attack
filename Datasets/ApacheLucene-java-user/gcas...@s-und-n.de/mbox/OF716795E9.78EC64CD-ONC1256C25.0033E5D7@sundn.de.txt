Hi all,

I use Lucene 1.2 integrated with Cocoon, which works very well. However I
experienced the following behaviour which I kindly ask you for comment
wether this is expected.

Entering
Jakarta-Lucene

gives the same result as
Jakarta -Lucene

while I would expect it to be the same as
"Jakarta-Lucene"

which is how Google interprets it.

Thanks for any comment
Guido
