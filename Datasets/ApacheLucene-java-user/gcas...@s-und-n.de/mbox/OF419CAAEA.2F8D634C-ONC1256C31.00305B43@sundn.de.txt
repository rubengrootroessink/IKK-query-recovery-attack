I came across the same. Quite an essential issue for some european sites
(as you surely know :-)

I'm not very familiar with JavaCC, but I changed QueryParser.jj in the
following way:

I changed
| <MINUS:     "-" >
to
| <MINUS:     " -" >

and removed "-" from the list of
| <#_ESCAPED_CHAR:
and
| <#_TERM_START_CHAR:

This actually changes the behaviour to that of google and I didn't
experience any negative side effects (yet).
