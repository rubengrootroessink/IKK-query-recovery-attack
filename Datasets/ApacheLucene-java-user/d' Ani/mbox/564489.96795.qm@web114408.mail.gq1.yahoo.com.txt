thanks DC for the boosting info.. can i plz have some code pointers to the same.

As far as i understand the boosting is done during harvesting of the documents. 
Thats is fine but how do i achieve dynamic boosting...For example I wish to 
boost documents that have been opened more in the past (i already have means to 
track docs opened which is dynamic )  .. is it possible to sort Hits based on 
this list

Both Solr or Lucene allow extensive customization of relevance
calculations. Examples include boosting matched in title field vs.
Body, or boosting recent documents more than older documents.
