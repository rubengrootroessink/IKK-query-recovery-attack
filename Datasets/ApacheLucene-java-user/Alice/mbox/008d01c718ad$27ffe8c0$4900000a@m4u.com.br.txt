It does not work.

Even with the synonyms indexed it is not found.

That's why my guess was to remove the "" but I dont know how.

That might be the correct representation of a MultiPhraseQuery. So does 
your query work anyway? It's just that you cannot use QueryParser again to 
parse this output (similar to some other queries like SpanQueries whose 
toString() representation also cannot be parsed again).
