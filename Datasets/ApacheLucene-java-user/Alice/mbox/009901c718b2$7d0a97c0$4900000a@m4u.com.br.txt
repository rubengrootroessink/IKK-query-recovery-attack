No.. I am not indexing and searching with the same analyzer.

The reason I do this is because I want to index exactly the contents I have
in my database.

This is used to find some products the company sells, and the users dont
write their names correctly, so if they type something that is contained in
any producted I assume that keyword as a synonym.

Like: keyword.indexOf(myProduct) != -1 --> its a synonym.

So, when I search I use the SynonymAnalyzer.

But my intention as the analyzer returns by example the tokens 'wind' and
'window' was to have a query that would do:
Contents:wind contents:window

Just took a quick peak at the MultiPhraseQuery toString() and it does 
indeed wrap the query in quotes (it also puts in the parenthesis). You 
are generating a MultiPhraseQuery. Is that not your intent?. The 
QueryParser will generate a MultiPhraseQuery when more than one token 
with different positions are emmited from the analyzer and at least one 
of the positions has multiple tokens associated with it. I believe this 
should be a pretty common phenomenon with a synonym analyzer.

I would look into your Analyzer...my guess is that it has not been 
perfected. You are indexing and searching with the same analyzer, correct?
