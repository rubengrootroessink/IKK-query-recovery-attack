SUBJECT: Query without Analyzer
DATE: 10 Sep 2007

Hi folks!

 

I'm using Lucene to provide search on my application.

 

The final query is a BooleanQuery with many fields, there are fields where
I'll look for the entered keyword and some others to restrict the search, as
the id of a category.

 

I read, and seems to be true, that when using TermQuery, it uses the same
analyzer used when indexing.

 

As, there are some fields (like category Id) that I don't want to use the
analyzer, the result is not what I expect because the term was analyzed.

 

My question is: is there any way to search for fields without using an
analyzer?

 

Thank you!
