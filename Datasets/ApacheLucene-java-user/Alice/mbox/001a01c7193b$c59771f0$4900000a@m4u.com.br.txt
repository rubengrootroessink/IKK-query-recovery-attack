I'm using it.

But the fact is that when my analyzer returns synonyms to the BooleanQuery I
get not hit.

But, when the analyzer returns no synonyms I get a hit.

If I enter: "window". I get a TermQuery: contents:window and I get a hit.
But If I enter: "wind". I get a BooleanQuery: contents:wind contents:window
and no hit...

I often find that using Luke (google "luke lucene") gives me the info  
I need to figure out why I am not getting hits.  So, if you haven't  
tried using it yet, I would suggest it.
