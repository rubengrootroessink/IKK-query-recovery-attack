I'm sorry, I'm not sure about what you're asking me to post, anyway here is
my junit test:


protected void setUp() throws Exception
    {
        super.setUp();
        
        access = ServiceLocator.getAccess();
    }

public void testSearch() throws Exception
    {
        String keyword = "wind";
        
        Collection<ProductDTO> products =
access.getProductsByKeyword(keyword);
        
        System.out.println(products.size() + " products found:");
        for(ProductDTO product : products)
        {
            System.out.println(product.getName() + " " +
product.getModel());
        }
    }

As stated before, a *self contained* test case would help people diagnose
your problem ... just cutting and pasting a few snippets of your code is
not enough for people to reproduce your problem.


: And the return is: contents:"(wind window)"

a MultiPhraseQuery that looks like that should be functionally equivilent
to a BooleanQuery .. as a matter of fact, it will rewrite to a
BooleanQuery ... does a straight search on either "wind" or "window"
return any results for you?
