Hello!

I am totally new to Lucene and I'm trying to use it with my web application.

 

What I'm doing is reading a table from my database line by line and indexing
the columns.

I read the users data such as First Name, Last Name, Email and so on.

 

I hava a field by column, such as: firstName="Frederich" lastName="Brown"

My intetion is to make users find other users using name, lastName or email.

What is the best way to do it?

If the user enter "Fred Brown", as I use queryParser, this string is broken
to "Fred" "Brown" and I search those tokens in every field.

 

As "Brown" was indexed, the user's registry is found.

But if the user enters "Fred", no user is found.

Why is that? I thought it would return the user "Frederich Brown" either.

Can someone help?

 

Thanks!
