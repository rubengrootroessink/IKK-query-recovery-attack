Unfortunately I can't use multiple machines.

And I cannot start lots of threads because the server crashes.

Can you use multiple threads/machines to index the data into separate
indexes, and then combine them?

Hello!

 

I have to index 37million documents retrieved from the database.

 

I was trying to do by loading intervals of 10000 records but it is too slow.

 

Anybody could sugest a better way to get all the data indexed in a
reasonable time?

 

Thanks
