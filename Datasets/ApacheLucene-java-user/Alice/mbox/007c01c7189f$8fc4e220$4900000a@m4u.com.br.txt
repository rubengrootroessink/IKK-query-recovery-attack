Hello!

 

I wrote a custom analyzer that has synonyms of some words to help on search.

 

I use the analyzer when searching the user's entered keyword.

 

What is happening that I don't understand why is that when tokens are
returned from the synonyms set, the query parser returns the query with ""
surrounding the text.

 

Example:

If the user enters: wind

 

I search my synonyms set and if I find something I return the token like:

 

return new Token(synonyms[i], token.startOffset(), token.endOffset(),
token.type());

 

And when it gets do the query I see:

content:"wind window"

 

But I do not want to be returned surrounded by "".

 

Can somebody help?

 

Thanks!
