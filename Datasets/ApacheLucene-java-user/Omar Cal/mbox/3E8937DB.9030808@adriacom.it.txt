SUBJECT: Problems on massive indexing
DATE: 1 Apr 2003

Hello, i'm a newby of Lucene.

I've the following scenario:
-450.000 xml files and text files
-5 indexes, two stored and three unstored
-lucene library 1.2 (tested also 1.3RC)

When i try to index the material i've an IndexOutOfBoundException in the 
call to the index.optimize() after two hours of indexing.I know there is 
the bug 14355 and i think it could be the responsable for that exception.

I've tried also to index the whole material in subsequent runs but the 
problem seems to depend on the number of the documents.

I've tried to set the maxFieldLength at its maximum but nothing appened.

If i split the material in "trunks" of about 20.000 - 30.000 documents 
in each directory, the problem doesn't appear. Obviously i've to repeat 
the searches for each "trunk" (directory).

Anyone out there with a similar scenario? Other solutions?

Thanks, Omar
