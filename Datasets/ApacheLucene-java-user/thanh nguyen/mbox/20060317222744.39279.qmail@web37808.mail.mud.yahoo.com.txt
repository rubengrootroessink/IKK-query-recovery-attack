SUBJECT: Extract important terms by programming??
DATE: 17 Mar 2006

Hello, 

Suppose that I have indexed a document with Lucene. How can I extract the most important terms
in this documents by using a programming language? Does Lucene provide an API to do that?
(For example, if this document is indexed by TFIDF, the most important temrs are the terms
with biggest weighted).

Any help would be appreciated.
Thanh.
