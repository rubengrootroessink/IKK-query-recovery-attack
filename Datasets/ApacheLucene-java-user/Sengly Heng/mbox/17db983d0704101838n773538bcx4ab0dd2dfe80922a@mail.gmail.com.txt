Yes, I just want those values as they are. No second calculation is to be
performed.

We expect to get those values sorted as fast as possible. Currently for 100
documents, the process is about 1~1.5 minutes. I believe this is because of
the loop.

Yes, we limit to only the top 100 documents.

Thank you.
