SUBJECT: Seeking suggestion on results re-ranking methodology
DATE: 13 Jun 2008

Dear all,

I would like to seek your suggestion on re-ranking methodology. My
problem is that I have a set of resulting documents to a query and
each one of them with a matching score and also a list of relatedness
score between each two of them. I would like to re-rank my resulting
documents by downgrading the score of those near duplicate results. I would
like to
know whether there exists any standard approach to do so?

Any suggestions or pointers would be highly appreciated.

Best regards,
Sengly
