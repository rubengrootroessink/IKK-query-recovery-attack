Hello,

Thanks for your interest. Actually, it's a normal unstructured text. In the
text, they might describe the number of animal or enumerate the kind of
animal one by one, etc. To me, it's very difficult to resolve this. I don't
have a clue until now.

All comments are VERY welcome.

Thanks.

Regards,

Sengly
