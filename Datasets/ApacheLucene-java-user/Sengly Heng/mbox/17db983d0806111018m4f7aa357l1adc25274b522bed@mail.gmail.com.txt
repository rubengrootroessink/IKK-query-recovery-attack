SUBJECT: Keyword expansion
DATE: 11 Jun 2008

Dear all,

To improve the search, I will have to do keyword expansion. I am looking for
a library that would help me to get the list of synonym of a term with some
similarity score. Is there any lib package that can handle this? It would be
great if it is in Python. I have searched the web and found one project but
it is written in Perl (http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/senserelate.html)

I doubt if there are other similar projects.

I appreciate any pointer.

Thank you in advance.

Regards,

Sengly
