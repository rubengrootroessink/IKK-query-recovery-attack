SUBJECT: Get the total term frequency vector of a specific field from the hit results
DATE: 10 Apr 2007

Hello all,

I would like to extract the term freq vector from the hit results as a total
vector not by document.

I have searched the mailing and I found many have talked about this issue
but I still could not find the right solution to this matter. Everyone just
suggested to look at getTermFreqVector and TermEnum.

I wonder if there someone has already done this before and what was your
solution? Would you please share?

Also how to get a list of top n keywords from that hit results. I have also
looked at HighFreqTerms (in the contribution repositories as well as the
one implemented by Luke) but still this class is rather for the usage when
we want to get the top n keywords from an index and not from the hit
results.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Sengly
