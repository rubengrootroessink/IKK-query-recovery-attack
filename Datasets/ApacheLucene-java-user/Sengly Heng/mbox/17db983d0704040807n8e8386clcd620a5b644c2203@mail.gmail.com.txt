SUBJECT: Re: Indexing multiple instances of the same field and counting their frequency afterward
DATE: 4 Apr 2007

Thanks so much for your explaination. But there is one thing that I want to
make sure is that in case that i add the same token to the same field,
internally is it redundancy?

And in case, that I have many fields. What is the best way to list up the
frequency of all the tokens from different fields without knowing in advance
what are the tokens that we have.

Once again, thank you very much for your reply.

Best regards,

Sengly
