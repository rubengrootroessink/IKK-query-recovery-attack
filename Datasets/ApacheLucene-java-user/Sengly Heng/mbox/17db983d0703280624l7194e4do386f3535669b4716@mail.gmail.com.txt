SUBJECT: Re: TF-IDF API
DATE: 28 Mar 2007

Thank you but I still have have no clue of how to do that by using Weka
after taking a look at its API. Let me reformulate my problem :

I have a collection of vector of terms (actually each vector of terms
represents the list of tokens extracted from a file) and I do not have the
original files. I would like to calculate TF as well as TFIDF of each term
and sorted them by these value respectively. As suggested by Grant
Ingersoll, I could index those vectors of terms again using Lucene and then
use its API to measure TF and TFIDF. However I guess there should be a
simpler way or API just fit-in this case.

Thanks once again everyone.

Best regards,

Sengly
