It seems like you could do it in Lucene:

 - the first table (Human/Man/Dutch) would be considered
   Terms in Lucene (each record would correspond to a Term)
 - the second table would be turned into a Document for each
   unique id in the table (for example, one document would be the
   relationship id 1 example you give).
