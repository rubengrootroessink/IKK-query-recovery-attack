SUBJECT: Highlighting + phrase queries
DATE: 9 Jan 2008

Dear all,

Let's assume I have a phrase query and a document which contain the 
phrase but also it contains separate
occurrences of each query term. How does the highlighter know that 
should only display fragments which
contain phrases and not fragments which contain only the query words 
(not as a phrase)?

Thank you in advance!

Marjan.
