Mark, thanks for your patience! I have one final (conceptual, 
high-level) question concerning the usage of the MemoryIndex index over 
the TokenStream. Is it a good idea to
store the procomputed MemoryIndex (conceptually speaking) as a field 
into each document at indexing time and then just load this precomputed 
index from
disk (as you do with TermVector) such that you save extra computation 
for the highlighting?

Marjan.
