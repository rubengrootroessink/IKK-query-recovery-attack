SUBJECT: Error tolerant text search with Lucene?
DATE: 3 Apr 2008

Hi everyone,

I know that there are packages that support the "Did you mean ... ?" 
search features with lucene which tries to find the most suited 
correct-word query.. however, so far I haven't encountered the opposite 
search feature: given a correct query, find all documents which contain 
misspellings of the query.. are you guys aware of anything like this 
with lucene?

Thanks!
