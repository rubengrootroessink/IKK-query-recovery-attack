Dear all,

I am a new Lucene user and I would like to know the following. How does 
Lucene bring together fuzzy queries and highlighting?

Let's say for the query algorithm, the word algorith is also a match, 
how do the highlighter know that it should also highlight
occurrences of the word algorith? (I am not sure it does this anyway)

Thank you!

Marjan.
