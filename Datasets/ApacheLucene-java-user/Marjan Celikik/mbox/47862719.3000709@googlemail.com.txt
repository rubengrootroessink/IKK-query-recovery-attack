Hm, I need the source code. How do I download the files from 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-794 (all I see are some 
.patch files)?

What I really need is a how the highlighter works in a nutshell... I am 
working on a publication and I want to have a reference to Lucene and 
its highlighting...

Thanks again.

Marjan.
