SUBJECT: Query processing with Lucene
DATE: 6 Jan 2008

Dear all,

Maybe this topic is already discussed (then can I get a reference 
please?)... I would like to know how does Lucene actually process the 
query. For example, take a 2-word query "x y". Does Lucene fetch the 
lists of "x" and "y" and intersect them, or do they do something more 
fancy, for example, top-k techniques that try to avoid a full scan of 
the index lists for "x" and "y" ?

Marjan.
