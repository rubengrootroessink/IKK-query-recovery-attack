SUBJECT: Boosting not working?
DATE: 14 Apr 2005


I have a bunch of documents in my index, some of which have values for a
certain field while others don't. I'd like the ones that do have a value
to always show up before the ones who don't when sorting by relevance.

I tried to accomplish this by check whether there are values for the
field, and if so boosting the document by 5000. However, it doesn't seem
to have the desired effect.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Martin
