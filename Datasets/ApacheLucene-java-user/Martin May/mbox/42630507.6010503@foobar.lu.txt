Gabe,

Thanks for the tip. That's more or less how I am doing things now, but 
it doesn't seem to boost anything. I guess that if you could do a range 
query with a preferred value, the scoring could give things that have 
values closer to that preferred value more weight. However, it seems 
that this is not currently possible in Lucene (and please, correct me if 
I'm wrong).

Thanks,
Martin
