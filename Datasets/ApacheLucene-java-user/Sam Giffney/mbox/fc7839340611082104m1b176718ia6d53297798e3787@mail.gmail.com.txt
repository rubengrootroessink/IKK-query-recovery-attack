SUBJECT: Google Coop - Lucene style
DATE: 9 Nov 2006

Most of you have probably heard of the
Google Coop Custom Search Engine
http://www.google.com/coop/cse/overview
A user defined vertical search of the Google index

The obvious and simple way to implement a Google Coop style facility
in Lucene would be to add a unique id to each document in the index
for each website selected in each users custom engine.
That's a lot of 'eaches', and it doesn't seem scalable.

Does anyone have any idea (even on a theoretical level) how Google
would be doing this and whether this kind of thing would be possible
in Lucene?

Sam
