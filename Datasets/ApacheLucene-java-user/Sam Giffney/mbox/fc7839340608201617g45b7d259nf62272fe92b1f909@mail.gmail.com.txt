SUBJECT: Apostrophe S ('s)
DATE: 20 Aug 2006

Using the Standard Analyzer the string
McDonald's
is indexed with the term
mcdonald

so it will be found by a (QueryParser parsed) query for
McDonald
or
McDonald's
but not
McDonalds

Wikipedia (who uses lucene) says on
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Searching

An apostrophe is identical to a single quote, therefore Mu'ammar can
be found searching for exactly that (and not otherwise). A word with
apostrophe s is an exception in that it can be found also searching
for the word without the apostrophe and the s.

Is this a custom parser?
How can one achieve this same exception most easily?

Sam
