SUBJECT: Jason format exception for stats component facet results | stddev value of NaN
DATE: 16 Nov 2010

Hi,

I am getting a mal-formatted json response when using the
stats component with a facet that returns a stddev value of NaN ,e.g

                  "facet-1":{

                     "min":0.0604898,

                     "max":0.0604898,

                     "sum":1.209796,

                     "count":20,

                     "missing":0,

                     "sumOfSquares":0.0731803180808,

                     "mean":0.0604898,

                     "stddev":NaN

                  },
I have submitted my complete response to

http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com

and got the following exception:

Warning:Invalid quotes on string for the line with  "stddev":NaN
The Solr response broke my PHP code; replacing "NaN" with 0.0 solved the
issue.

Any thoughts on this?

Thanks a lot.
Johannes
