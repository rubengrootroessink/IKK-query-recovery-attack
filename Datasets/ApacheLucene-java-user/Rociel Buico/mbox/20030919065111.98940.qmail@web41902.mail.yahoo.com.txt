SUBJECT: cant rename segments.new to segment
DATE: 19 Sep 2003

all,
when i'm trying to run my index writer program at idea (IDE) i got this error (cant rename
segments.new to segments, sometimes the deletable file got an error), but when im going to
run the program in the command prompt, it looks fine, no error returned.
 
im just making 1 index and no threads
is this a bug?
