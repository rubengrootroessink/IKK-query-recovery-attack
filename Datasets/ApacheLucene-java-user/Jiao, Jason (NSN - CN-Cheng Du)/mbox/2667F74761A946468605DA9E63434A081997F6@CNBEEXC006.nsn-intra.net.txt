SUBJECT: Luke issues "Unknown format version: -6"
DATE: 26 Aug 2008

Hi there,
	I use luke v0.8.1 which build base on lucene 2.3.0. First, I run
lucene/demo/IndexFiles to build index successfully. Then I use luke to
open index, but luke  issues "Unknown format version: -6" . I check the
documentation of lucene which said "lucene 2.3.2 does not contain any
new features, API or file format changes, which makes it fully
compatible to 2.3.0 and 2.3.1".

Any hints?

Thanks in advance.


Jason Jiao
