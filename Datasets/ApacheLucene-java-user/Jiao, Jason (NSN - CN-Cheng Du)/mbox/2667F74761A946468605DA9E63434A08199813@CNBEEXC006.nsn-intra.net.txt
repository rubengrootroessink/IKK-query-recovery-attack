The lucene FAQ says:

What wildcard search support is available from Lucene?
Lucene supports wild card queries which allow you to perform searches
such as book*, which will find documents containing terms such as book,
bookstore, booklet, etc. Lucene refers to this type of a query as a
'prefix query'. 

Lucene also supports wild card queries which allow you to place a wild
card in the middle of the query term. For instance, you could make
searches like: mi*pelling. That will match both misspelling, which is
the correct way to spell this word, as well as mispelling, which is a
common spelling mistake. 

Another wild card character that you can use is '?', a question mark.
The ? will match a single character. This allows you to perform queries
such as Bra?il. Such a query will match both Brasil and Brazil. Lucene
refers to this type of a query as a 'wildcard query'. 

Leading wildcards (e.g. *ook) are not supported by the QueryParser by
default. As of Lucene 2.1, they can be enabled by calling
QueryParser.setAllowLeadingWildcard( true ). Note that this can be an
expensive operation: it requires scanning the list of tokens in the
index in its entirety to look for those that match the pattern.
