SUBJECT: Java Parser or Lucene
DATE: 26 Apr 2004

Hi

I am deciding between using the parsing API provided by Java and Lucene
for searching keywords in a HTML page. Is Lucene an overkill for a
webpage (which is quite small in size) in this case? I don't have a
obvious choice between them because both can do the same job.

Any advise?

Thanks
