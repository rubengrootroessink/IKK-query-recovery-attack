SUBJECT: clean up html before indexing or add tags to ignore list
DATE: 13 May 2004

Hi

This is a typical web crawler, indexing and search application
development. I have wrote my crawler and planning to add lucene in next.
One questions pop to my mind, in terms of performance, do i clean up the
html removing all tags before indexing, or i add all tags into the
ignore list during indexing/search stage. 

Which is better?

Thanks

Sebastian Ho
