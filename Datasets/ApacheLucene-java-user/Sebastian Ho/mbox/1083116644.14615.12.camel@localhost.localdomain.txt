SUBJECT: status of LARM project
DATE: 28 Apr 2004

Hi

I have look at LARM website and I get different results

http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?LuceneLARMPages
It says that development has stopped for this project.

LARM hosted on sourceforge.
The last message was dated 2003 in the mailing list. Is it still
supported and active?

LARM hosted on apache.
It says the project is moved to sourceforge.

Any one here who is active in LARM can comment on the status?

Regards

Sebastian Ho
