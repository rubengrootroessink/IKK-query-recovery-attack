Hi ,
  Yes. Analyzer was the culprit behind eating away some of the letters
in the search string . StandardAnalyser has 'a' and 's' as stop words
(amongst others).
Since i want to search on these (specifically , i want to search on
words like "a/s" , "e/p" , "15%" , " 15' " ..etc). so i commented the
following lines in StandardAnalyser .. (filtering of Standard tokens
and stop words)

  public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
    TokenStream result = new StandardTokenizer(reader);
//    result = new StandardFilter(result);
    result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);
//    result = new StopFilter(result, stopSet);
    return result; 

now stop words are not getting filtered but "/" still goes off.
so "a/s" is read as "a s"

Regards
Robin
