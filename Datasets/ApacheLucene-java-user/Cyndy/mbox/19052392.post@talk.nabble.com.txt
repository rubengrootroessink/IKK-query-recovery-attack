Thanks Anthony,

I understand your comment, and I think it makes sense, the only thing is
that I have the issue that I need to guarantee privacy to the users, so if I
am able to read the indexes (if they are not encrypted), then I can pretty
much know what he says in the document, so that is why I was thinking to
encrypt the whole directory of text files as well as the index files, so the
user by giving his password can decrypt all the files and then Lucene can do
its job. In that sense I will have to open/close the indexs on demand. And
so my concern was that: if I have at a moment 1000 indexes open, would that
hit performance?

Thanks again for your answer.
