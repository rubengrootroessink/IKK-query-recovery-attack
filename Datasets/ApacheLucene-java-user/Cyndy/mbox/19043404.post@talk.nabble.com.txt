SUBJECT: Multiple index performance
DATE: 19 Aug 2008


Hello, I am new into Lucene and I want to make sure what I am trying to do
will not hit performance. My scenario is the following:

I want to keep user text files indexed separately, I will have about 10,000
users and each user may have about 20,000 short files, and I need to keep
privacy. So the idea is to have one folder with the text files and  index
for each user, so when search will be done, it will be pointing to the
corresponding file directory. Would this approach hit performance? is this a
good solution? Any recommendation?

Thanks in advance.
