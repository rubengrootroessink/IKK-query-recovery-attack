SUBJECT: Adding delta terms to the same  lucene doc
DATE: 21 Mar 2006

Hi folks,
   I have a requirement where I want to keep adding deltas (incremental 
terms) to a particular document in a lucene index, and get these 
additional terms indexed to the SAME document in the index. Is there an 
easy/smart way to do it without changing much of lucene ?  Deleting and 
adding the document won't work here, as I dont have access to  the 
original content and know only of the deltas. Also I dont want to delete 
any of the content.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
