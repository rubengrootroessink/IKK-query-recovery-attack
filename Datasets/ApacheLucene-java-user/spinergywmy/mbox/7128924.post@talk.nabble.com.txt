SUBJECT: reindex all files
DATE: 2 Nov 2006


Hi,

   Basically what I want to do is to reindex all the files in particular
directory. I wonder how I can do this with Lucene search? And I noticed that
reindexing all the files will actually take a lot of time and resources, so
how I can optimize the preformance problem.

   Hope there are examples that I can review on.

   Thanks.

regards,
Wooi Meng
