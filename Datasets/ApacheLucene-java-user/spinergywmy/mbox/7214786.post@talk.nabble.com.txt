Hi Chris,

   Another thing I would like to emphasize is:

      for example, if my first query is "Java" and it returned 3 records.
For my 2nd query is "Tomcat", and within my first search, there is only one
record contain the word "Tomcat", this will be my intention to do so.

   Is it possible for lucene to do so?

   Thanks

regards,
Wooi Meng
