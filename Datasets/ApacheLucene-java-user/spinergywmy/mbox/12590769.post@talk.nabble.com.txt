DATE: 10 Sep 2007


Hi,

   I have this exception there are more terms than documents in field
"Title", but it's impossible to sort on tokenized fields.

   I'm try to sort the result by Title and the field title is un_tokenized
and it has only one term such as document, 06, rational, etc, and some other
fields have tokenized.

   The query that I build is something like that: documentName:a or
documentDescription:a or contents:a etc, sort = new Sort("Title"); then
searcHits = searcher.search(query,sort);

   I don't know why I get this error message, anyone can help?

   Thank you.
