SUBJECT: Re: How to delete partial index
DATE: 13 Dec 2006


Hi,

   I manage to delete the document based on term, but that is just 1 part. I
wonder do lucene support how I can pull out the info that I have been
indexed and place it into other index file. Is it the only way that I have
to use indexwriter to perform indexing again with all the necessary fields.
Or actually lucene provide short cut for doing this. The above scenario is
the action cut and paste that I need to do.

   Hope you can provide me some idea on how to do this. Thanks


regards,
Wooi Meng
