SUBJECT: Indexing Performance issue
DATE: 10 Nov 2006


Hi,

   I having this indexing the pdf file performance issue. It took me more
than 10 sec to index a pdf file about 200kb. Is it because I only have a
segment file? How can I make the indexing performance better?

   Thanks


regards,
Wooi Meng
