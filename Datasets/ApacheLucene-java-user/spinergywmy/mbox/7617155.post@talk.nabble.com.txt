SUBJECT: indexing performance issue
DATE: 30 Nov 2006


Hi guys,

   I have posted this question before and this time I found that it could be
pdfbox problem and this pdfbox I downloaded doesn't use the log4j.jar. To
index the app 2.13mb pdf file took me 17s and total time to upload a file is
18s.

   So, is there any way or others software than pdfbox to solve the
performance issue.

   Thanks.


regards,
Wooi Meng
