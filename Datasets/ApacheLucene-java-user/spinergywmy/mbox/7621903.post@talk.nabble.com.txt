Hi Grant,

   Thanks for the tips. I will take ur adviced and look into the link that u
send to me.

   For my scenario will be every time the users upload the single file, I
need to index that particular file. Previously was because the previous
version of pdfbox integrate with log4j.jar file and I believe is the
log4j.jar cause the indexing performance and takes up a lot of memory
resources. However, the latest version of pdfbox doesn't need to integrate
with log4j.jar, and I thought that will actually speed up the indexing
performance but the result was no.

   Please correct me if I'm wrong.

   Thanks


regards,
Wooi Meng
