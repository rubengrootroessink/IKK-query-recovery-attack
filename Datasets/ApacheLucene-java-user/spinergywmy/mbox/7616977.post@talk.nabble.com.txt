SUBJECT: Multiple query criteria search
DATE: 30 Nov 2006


Hi guys,

   I m actually trying on search indeces by entering multiple queries, for
instance, I have 4 textboxes with search criterias such as AND, OR, NOT and
Exact phrase. I m using queryParser operator and then add the query into
booleanquery, therefore I dont think my search result was correct.

   Is there any other better way to do so?

   Thank you.


regards,
Wooi Meng
