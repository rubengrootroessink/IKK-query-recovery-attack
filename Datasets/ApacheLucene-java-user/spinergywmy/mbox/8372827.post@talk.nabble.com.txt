Hi,

   What I have done is I declare a reader = IndexReader.open(dir); then
mSearcher = new IndexSearcher(reader); after the above I close the searcher
but I didn't close the reader. And I'm wondering is it ok if I did not close
the reader, and what will happened if I did not close it?

   Thanks


regards,
Wooi Meng
