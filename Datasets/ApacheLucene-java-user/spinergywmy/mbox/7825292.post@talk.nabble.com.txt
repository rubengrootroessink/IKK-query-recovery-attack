SUBJECT: How to cut certain index
DATE: 12 Dec 2006


Hi guys,

   I m wondering how I can cut certain index out of the index file and paste
it to other index file? For instance, I have index a particular file with
contents and other necessary info into particular index folder, then I would
like to move the index info that I have been indexed to other index folder.
Just portion of the indexed info and not all.

   Thanks.


regards,
Wooi Meng
