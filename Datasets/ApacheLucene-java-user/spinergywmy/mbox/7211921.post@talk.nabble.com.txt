SUBJECT: Filter query method
DATE: 7 Nov 2006


Hi,

   Is there anyone built your own filter query before, in order to perform
search within search results. Meaning after the first search, the result is
cached and the second search searches the result that return from the first
searched, and is not searching the whole index again.

   Just wondering by using Hits, can it achieved the result above?

   I have try using the boolean search but the result wasn't what I
expected.

   Thanks

regards,
Wooi Meng
