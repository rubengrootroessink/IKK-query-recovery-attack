SUBJECT: IndexSearcher in Servlet
DATE: 27 Jun 2006

Hello,

 

I have a question about the IndexSearcher().

I have a Servlet that has a searchDocument(String theQuery) method.

These method instantiate a new IndexSearcher at each query:

 

searchDocument(String theQuery)

{

            Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexPath);

            …

}

 

Is it a good way ? Or Is it better to use a static searcher, and use the
same for each query (and for each user)…

Is it thread safe ? Will results not be mixed to users ? (if user A searchs
car and user B searchs boats, is it sure that user A will get car and B will
get boats, even if the IndexSearcher is static and is the same ?)

 

Thanks a lot,

 

Fab
