I realize that it will be necessary to write or use existing html 
parser. I know that i need But i don't know how the whole framework 
would look like (how to translate pages on webserwer to Lucene 
documents, how to index them, how to search them).

The example on the Lucene home page is very simple and doesn't give me 
much answers.

You are absolutely right. But my client wants to edit the content as 
easy as possible (via notepad or other text editor). If the content were 
in database, it would be necessery to provide my client with some kind 
of application which could let him update the content. The budget of the 
project is strongly limited so i can't afford to allocate more 
developers to build content editor.

Thanks for the reply.
Michal.
