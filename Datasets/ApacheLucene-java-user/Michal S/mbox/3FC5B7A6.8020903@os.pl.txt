SUBJECT: indexing/searching a website
DATE: 27 Nov 2003

Dear Group Members,

I have looked in archives for a simple tutorial which could guide me 
throught process of integrating Lucene with a website based on Struts.
The website uses tiles, the content of the tiles is kept in multiple jsp 
files.

I have read several Marco's posts which seem to be close to my problem. 
However, my experience in Lucene is limited to indexing static html file 
repository, so I need some kind of tutorial.

Also, i didn't find get anything like this from google.
Any help appreciated.

All the best,
Michal
