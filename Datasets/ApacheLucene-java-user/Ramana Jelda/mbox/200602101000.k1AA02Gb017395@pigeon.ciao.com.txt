HI,
I am doing the same.

My design contains.
Index Repository: is responsible for keep up to index.:)Index-configurator.
Index-manager: Real CRUD indexing..
And ofcourse index-searcher: I want results ..:)

U know very well->Searcher and Indexer are both separate functionalities..
So the reason why two components.

Regards,
Jelda
