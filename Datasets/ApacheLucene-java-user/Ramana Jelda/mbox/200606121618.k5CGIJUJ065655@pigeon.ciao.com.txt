SUBJECT: How can I tell Lucene to also use analyzer for Keyword fields
DATE: 12 Jun 2006

Hi,
It seems anaylzers are never get called for UnTokenized fields(Seems no luck
either using PerFieldAnalyzer).

What should I do, If I would like to use analyzer for Untokenized fields.
Lets say for Keyword or Unstored fields.

I basically would like to use lucene Sort functionality on UnTokenized
fields which needs some analyzation at indexing time.

Thanks in advance,
Regards,
Jelda
