SUBJECT: Issue with indexed tokens position
DATE: 17 Aug 2007

Hi,
Lucene doesn't find following value. Some issues with PhraseQuery.

indexed value: pink-I
Indexed tokens:1: [pink:0->5] 2: [pinki:0->5] 3: [i:5->6] (ex. explanation:
"pink" is a term "0->5" term-position)

And I have indexed in a field called "fieldName".
My lucene search with the query [fieldName:"pink i"] can't find above
indexed value.

Can anyone help me out here.

Thx in advance,
Jelda
