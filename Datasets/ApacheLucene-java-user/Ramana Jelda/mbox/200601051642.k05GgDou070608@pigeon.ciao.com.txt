One reader/searcher per server.

My configuration uses
- one Lucene index in a shared location,
- one server that uses either a single IndexReader or a single IndexWriter
to delete or add documents
- several servers that read/search the index.

The 'search' servers each have a single IndexReader open to handle all
requests.
At fixed intervals, they check the version of the index to know if it's time
to close and reopen the IndexReader instance. (I make use of the
DelayCloseIndexReader I contributed in
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-445 to make sure the previous
instance doesn't close while other threads are still using it)

You have to make sure all servers put their lock files in a shared location,
but from then on everything works fine...
There was an issue with getCurrentVersion() and isCurrent() not using the
locks properly (http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-481),
but that's resolved now (the patch is easy to backport to Lucene 1.4.3)

But its best to only have one reader/searcher, correct?

Hi,
You are right. There can be multiple indexreaders but only one indexwriter
is advised. 

No, we can not use two indexwriters simultaneously.

HI all.

i am newbie to lucene

Do lucene provides any way to do indexing ,searching and deleting
simultaneously ..

I hope we could do searching and indexing which means there can be multiple
indexreader and only one indexwriter accessing the index..

Could we have two indexwriter working simultaneously...?

Any help is greatly appreciated
Thanks in advance.

regards
-Hussain
