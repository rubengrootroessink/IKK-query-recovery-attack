Hi,
You are right. There can be multiple indexreaders but only one indexwriter
is advised. 

No, we can not use two indexwriters simultaneously.

HI all.

i am newbie to lucene

Do lucene provides any way to do indexing ,searching and deleting
simultaneously ..

I hope we could do searching and indexing which means there can be multiple
indexreader and only one indexwriter accessing the index..

Could we have two indexwriter working simultaneously...?

Any help is greatly appreciated
Thanks in advance.

regards
-Hussain
