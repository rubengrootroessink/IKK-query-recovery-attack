No problem, it was a bit lenghty, anyway...sorry about that. I just  
tried to give enough information so that people don't get confused  
too much.

Cool :) I shouldn't be working on the weekend either, come to think  
of it.

Yes, I assume we will be doing all sorts of wacky stuff to hide the  
computation of even the first built. Probably something along the  
lines of "predictive execution". But my primary goal is to keep the  
application itself as clean and simple as possible. If that means I  
have to change some of the guts of Lucene, so be it.
It'd be wonderful to be able to just use our unique ids in place of  
the Lucene document ids somehow - then I wouldn't even have to spent  
any significant time at all constructing the filter bitsets. It  
couldn't get much faster than that. We are quite obsessed with  
response times, as you probably guessed by now ;) Thus my obnoxious  
insistence about sharing filter caches etc.

In essence, what I want to achieve are persistent document numbers. ;)

cheers,
