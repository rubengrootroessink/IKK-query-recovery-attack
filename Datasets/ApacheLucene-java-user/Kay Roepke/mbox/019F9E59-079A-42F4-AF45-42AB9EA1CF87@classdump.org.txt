On my development machine I have 1.5 million documents and those are  
weighing in at
~950MB. I suspect that for production we will add more fields, so it  
would be bit bigger
than that. To be able to scale for some time, I think 30-40 GB index  
size is the upper limit.

Yeah, I have seen that, and it looks awesome! Unfortunately, I think  
I cannot use it here,
though it might come in handy for some other problem.
As I understand it, I must create it from a RAMDirectory/FSDirectory,  
right?

Thanks,
