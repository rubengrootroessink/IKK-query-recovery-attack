Cool! :D I should be able to get that down even further with the  
production hardware.

Yep, that could work, all I need

hehe, right you are! I really appreciate your interest in playing  
around with that!

We actually had a bit of sunshine today here in Hamburg, Germany, who  
would've thought that! :)

Yes, the controlled warm-up is definitely going to be crucial in our  
application, but
we do this kind of thing all over the place to ensure near-linear  
behavior in normal
usage. The actual computations are all non-linear and that in a very  
uncomfortable way,
but we can't do anything about that. It is an inherently non-linear  
problem, after all.

I guess the best option I have would be to track the document numbers  
as they are changing,
and use the process you mentioned earlier. If that's close enough to  
what we need, then I
wouldn't have to mess with Lucene's guts - and that's a good thing!

I really appreciate the high quality of help you guys give! Just  
plain awesome!

Thanks,
