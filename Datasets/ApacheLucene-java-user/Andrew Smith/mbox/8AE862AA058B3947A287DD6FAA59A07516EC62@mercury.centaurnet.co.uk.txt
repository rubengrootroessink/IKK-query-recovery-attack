SUBJECT: Incremental vs Full indexing
DATE: 11 Apr 2002

I wish to use incremental indexing in an application based on Lucene. Do
I need to preiodcally perform a full re-build of the index to keep the
index in an efficient state or can I simply use the IndexWriter's
Optimise() function instead?

TIA

Andy
