SUBJECT: Restore documents marked as deleted
DATE: 6 Oct 2010

Hi,

I was indexing some documents, but my program crashed after several days 
of work. If I reopen this index it is empty. I guess the reason is that 
auto-commit was not set and I never performed  a commit. (Lesson 
learned) So probably all documents are marked as "deleted" and 
re-opening the index leads to deletion of these documents.

However, is there a possibility to avoid this? Or do I have to re-index 
all documents again?

Best,
     Philippe
