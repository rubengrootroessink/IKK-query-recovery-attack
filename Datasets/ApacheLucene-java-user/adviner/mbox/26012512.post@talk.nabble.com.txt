SUBJECT: How to loop through all the entries for a field
DATE: 22 Oct 2009


I have a field in called BookTitle.  I want to loop through all the entries
without doing a search.  I just want to get the list of BookTitle's that is
in this field:

I tried IndexReader but MaxDocs() doesnt work because it returns everything
and I have other fields in their which is allot bigger.  


Sorry i originally posted to the developer site which is wrong place so i
moved it here
