SUBJECT: Re: How can I get a term's frequency?
DATE: 22 Feb 2006


en, I describe my question more clearly:

I search with a group of query terms, I can get a document from the search 
result:

Query(term1, term2, term3)-->search index-->Hits(doc1, doc2, doc3, ......)

I wanna get term1's frequency in doc1 ?

Hits(docs1((term1,freq),(term2,freq),(term3,freq)),
     docs2((term1,freq),(term2,freq),(term3,freq)),......)

 
I think the tf value is caculated in the index procedure. can I get the 
tf(term frequency) value of term1 directly?

I can do it in this way:


QueryTermVector vector= new QueryTermVector(Document.getValues(field));
freq = result.getTermFrequencies();


but I think this is a very low efficient way.

Anyone can help me ? thx
