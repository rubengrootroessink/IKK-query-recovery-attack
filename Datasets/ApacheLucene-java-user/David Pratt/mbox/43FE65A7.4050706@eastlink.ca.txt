Thanks Erik. I am continuing to experiment and making good progress. I 
have got my basic functionality established and am now looking at 
sorting and ranking. I guess the good thing is I can adjust and modify 
things as I learn more.  I am reading some archived material from the 
list as well to get a general sense of issues that have come forward. I 
managed to get a powerpoint from apachecon on advanced techniques. This 
  kind of materialhelps to understand what is possible and to discover 
how dynamic Lucene really is.

Regards,
David
