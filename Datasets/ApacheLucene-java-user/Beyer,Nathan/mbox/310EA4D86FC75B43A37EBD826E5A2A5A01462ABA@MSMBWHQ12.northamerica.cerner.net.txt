Taking a guess here, I think this question could be rephrased as ...

Is there an OSGi bundle(s) the exposes the Lucene APIs and is available
in a Maven repository?

For OSGi stuff, check out the Eclipse Orbit project [1], which wraps up
third-party libraries into OSGi bundles and there is a Lucene bundle,
but it's a bit old (v1.9.1).

: Is there a mavenized Eclipse bundle that exposes the Lucene API?

there might be ... it depends on what a "mavenized Eclipse bundle" is.

(googling for those keywords turns up this exact question, and a bunch
of 
threads/docs on building ecplise plugins with maven ... so i'm really
not 
sure what we are talking about)
