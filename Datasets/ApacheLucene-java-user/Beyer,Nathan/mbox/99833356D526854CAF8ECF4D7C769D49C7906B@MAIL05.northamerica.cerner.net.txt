Would using Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED be the same as tokenizing a field
into one token?

Either index them as a series of tokens:

org
org.apache
org.apache.lucene
org.apache.lucene.document
org.apache.lucene.document.Document

or index them as a single token, and use prefix queries (this is what  
I do for reverse domain names):

classname:(org.apache org.apache.*)

Note that "classname:org.apache*" would probably be wrong--you might  
not want to match

org.apache-fake.lucene.document

-Mike
