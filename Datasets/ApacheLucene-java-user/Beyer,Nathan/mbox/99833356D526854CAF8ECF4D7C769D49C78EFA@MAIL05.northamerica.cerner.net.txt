Good point.

I don't want the sub-package names on their own to match.

Text (class name)
 - "org.apache.lucene.document.Document"
Queries that would match
 - "org.apache", "org.apache.lucene.document"
Queries that DO NOT match
 - "apache", "lucene", "document"

-Nathan

Perhaps it would help to include some examples of queries you _don't_  
want to match.  For all the examples above, simply tokenizing  
alphanumeric components would suffice.
