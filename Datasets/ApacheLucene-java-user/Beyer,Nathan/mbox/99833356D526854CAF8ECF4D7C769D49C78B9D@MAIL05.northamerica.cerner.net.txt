SUBJECT: thoughts/suggestions for analyzing/tokenizing class names
DATE: 15 Dec 2007

I have a few fields that use package names and class names and I've been
looking for some suggestions for analyzing these fields.

A few examples -

Text (class name)
- "org.apache.lucene.document.Document"
Queries that would match 
- "org.apache" , "org.apache.lucene.document"

Text (class name + method signature)
-- "org.apache.lucene.document.Document#add(Fieldable)"
Queries that would match
-- "org.apache.lucene", "org.apache.lucene.document.Document#add"

Any thoughts on how to approach tokenizing these types of texts?

Thanks,
-Nathan
