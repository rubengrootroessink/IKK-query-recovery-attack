SUBJECT: Re: Question wrt Lucene analyzer for different language
DATE: 14 May 2009

Thanks for the suprising quick response. :-)

What I mean "correctly" here is that the specific analyzer can tokenize a
text mixed with English and that sepcfic langauge, for example, "12345 ????"
or "????Text???" (where '?' is a character of that specific language and
"12345" and "Text" is english character) to have "12345" and "Text" treated
as token and indexed as well.
BTW, I don't see a needs for stemming it by far since the information our
project encountered is just user's profile info.

For the perticular ChineseAnalyzer,  Can it do that?
