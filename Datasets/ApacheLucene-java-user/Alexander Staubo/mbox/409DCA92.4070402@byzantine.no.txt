SUBJECT: Exact match detection
DATE: 9 May 2004

I need to detect exact matches. For example, if the query is "foo 
bar", a document matching both terms "foo" and "bar" is considered an 
exact match; and everything else is considered an inexact match.

Obviously a union with "+foo +bar" would work, but for performance 
reasons I need to avoid multiple queries.

Lucene's largely undocumented similarity/scoring system looks 
intricate enough that deconstructing a score value after the fact 
isn't possible in a reliable and portable (ie., across Lucene versions 
and varying scoring algorithm implementations) manner.

If it helps, I am not using term boosting.

Alexander.
