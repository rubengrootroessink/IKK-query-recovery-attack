SUBJECT: recovering an index from RAM disk.
DATE: 27 Feb 2007


I generate my index to the file system and load that index into a
RAMDirectory for speed.  If my indexer fails the directory based index
can be left in an inadequate state for my needs.  I therefore wish to
flush the current index from the RAMDirectory back to the File system.
The RAMDirectory class doesn't seem to support this feature.  Is this
possible and can anybody give me some pointers ?
