Dear Erick,
Sorry i am using really "AND" operator, i wrote wrong in email (i am
very tired)...
But..Follow the 'main' part of code:

            Document document = new Document();
            String path = file.getCanonicalPath();

            document.add(new Field("title", path,
                    Field.Store.YES,
                    Field.Index.ANALYZED));

            Reader reader = new FileReader(file);
            document.add(new Field("content", reader));

As you can see I do indexing ! and...
with the others questions, i have a good result with htm files...this
htm, for example, is good for this question:
******APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) Colon Cancer

Thanks,
Celso.
