Hello,

My application is working with PDF files so i use lucene with PdfBox to 
create a little search engine. I am new to lucene.

All seemed to work fine but after some tests I saw that some expressions 
like "stock option" where never found (or returns the wrong documents) 
even if it exist in my PDF files. I searched in the mail archive and 
found that I have to use the "French Analyser" but that didn't work too.

I found that there is a tool named Luke to check the lucene index. I 
could see that the original text contains those words but nothing in the 
tokenizer.

Anybody who can help or can explain where I can start to look ?

thanks
