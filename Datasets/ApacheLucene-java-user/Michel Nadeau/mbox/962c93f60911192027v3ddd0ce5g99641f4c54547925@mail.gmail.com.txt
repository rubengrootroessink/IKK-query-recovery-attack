SUBJECT: ChainedFilter in Lucene 2.9
DATE: 20 Nov 2009

Hi !

Can someone tell me what is replacing ChainedFilter in Lucene 2.9?

I used to do it like this -

h = searcher.search(q, cluCF, cluSort);

Where cluCF is a ChainedFilter declared like this -

Filter cluCF = new ChainedFilter(cluFilters, ChainedFilter.AND);

cluFilters is a Filter[] containing QueryFilter's and/or RangeFilter's, and
ended with a null index.

But in Lucene 2.9, I can't find ChainedFilter anywhere. Is there still a way
to do this? It's crucial for my application.

Thanks!
