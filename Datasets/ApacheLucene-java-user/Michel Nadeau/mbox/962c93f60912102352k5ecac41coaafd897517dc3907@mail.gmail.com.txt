SUBJECT: Returns nothing when sorting
DATE: 11 Dec 2009

Hi !

I have a quite small Lucene 3.0.0 index with around 400,000 documents in it.

I'm trying to sort my results like this :

TopDocs td;
td = searcher.search(q, cluCF, 10, cluSort);
ScoreDoc[] hits = td.scoreDocs;

My cluCF is a ChainedFilter containing at least one filter, and cluSort is a
float type.

I'm not sure where to start - my Lucene application is a Java Web Server
(multithread), and when querying it with sorting, it just returns nothing;
no error, no crash, but no results. If I do the same query/filter without
sorting, I get results.

Anything I could try?

Thanks,

- Mike
