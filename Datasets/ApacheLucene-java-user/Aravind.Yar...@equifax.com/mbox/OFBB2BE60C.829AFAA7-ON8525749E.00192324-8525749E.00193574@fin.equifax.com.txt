Re: escaping special characters







: String escapedKeywords = QueryParser.escape(keywords);
: Query query = new QueryParser("content", new
: StandardAnalyzer()).parse(escapedKeywords);
: 
: this works with most of the special characters like * and ~ except \ . I
: can't do a search for a keyword like "ho\w" and get results.
: am I doing anything wrong here.

QueryParser.escape will in fact escape a backslash, but keep in mind 
StandardAnalyzer splits on backslash so that may be what's confusing you.
