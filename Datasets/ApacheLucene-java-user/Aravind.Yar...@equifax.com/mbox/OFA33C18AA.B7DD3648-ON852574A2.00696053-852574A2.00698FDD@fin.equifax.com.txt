SUBJECT: Clarification on deletion process...
DATE: 11 Aug 2008

The documentation for delete operation seems to be confusing (i am going 
thru the book and also posted in the books forums...), so appreciate if 
someone can let me know if my below understanding is correct.

When i delete a document from the index

1) It is marked for deletion in the BUFFER until I commit/close the 
writer. Does that mean the document is still visible for the Searcher?

2) Once i commit/close the writer then IT IS JUST MARKED for delete in the 
Index. At this time the document is NOT visible for the Searcher, but the 
document is still taking up the space in the index.

3) Once the index is merged (optimized), it is removed from the index
