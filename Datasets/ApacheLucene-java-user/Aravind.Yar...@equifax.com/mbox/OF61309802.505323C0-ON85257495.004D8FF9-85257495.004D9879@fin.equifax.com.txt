Re: Using lucene as a database... good idea or bad idea?






Hi Ian,
Yes, I see that we are discussing an "option" here.

But, as I said before (the three parts to search-based solution), I do not
know (but, would like to know) how Lucene (java only - not Nutch, Solr,
etc.) can be used as a datastore.

Basically, I am not able to connect "database" and Lucene java. :)
