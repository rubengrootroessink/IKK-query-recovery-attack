SUBJECT: lucene index with structured fields
DATE: 9 Mar 2005

hy everybody,

I would like use a index with structured search field.

- flat index (lucene type)
searchfield1
searchfield2
searchffield3
...
-structured index 
search1
   search2
   	search4
   search3
	search5

to allow simple extensions of some search features: 
- the query TermQuery("search2", "coco" )  search in search2 and
search4 fields,
- The score depend of the depth where the word is found : A document
where "coco" is found in search4 field has a score lower than a
document with "coco" found in search2

How {do with,hack} lucene to integrated easily this notion of
structured field  ? (no fuzzy methods allow because of the
performance) ?

thanks in advance,

Nicolas Maisonneuve
