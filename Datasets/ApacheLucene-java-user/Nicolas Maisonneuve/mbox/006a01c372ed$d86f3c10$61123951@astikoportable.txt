DATE: 4 Sep 2003

hy ,
when i use standardTokenizer
for parse for example "I.B.M"
the type of the Token  is HOST and not ACRONYM

WHY ???

in StandardTokenizer.jj

 // acronyms: U.S.A., I.B.M., etc.
  // use a post-filter to remove dots
| <ACRONYM: <ALPHA> "." (<ALPHA> ".")+ >

  // hostname
| <HOST: <ALPHANUM> ("." <ALPHANUM>)+ >

"I.B.M" can be a host or acronym, so threre is a problem , no  ?
