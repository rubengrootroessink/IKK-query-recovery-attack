Thanks Michael.

The exception happens whenever I call open on the indexreader.

There are no open indexwriters on the index as far as I know. Although I am
not certain of exactly how Oracle manages objects and GC, I assume that if I
close a reader then it should be closed in which case there should not be
any open. Although it is not efficient, the readers and writers are only
open for the duration of the stored procedure call.
