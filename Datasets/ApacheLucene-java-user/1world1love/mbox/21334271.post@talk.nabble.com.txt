Thanks Erick.

I do have the same version on both machines (2.4.0). The original index was
created in place with 2.3. I made a copy of the original and deleted some
documents from the copy and then optimized it.

The index sits on space that is mounted from both the machines.

The caveat is that the machine that I get the error on is an Oracle DB
server. The code is called from a Java stored procedure within the Ojvm. I
also created the original index from a stored procedure within the Ojvm.

I can't open it with Luke because I only have CLI access or through the
Ojvm.
