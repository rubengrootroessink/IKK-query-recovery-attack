Thanks Erick. That is what I was assuming but couldn't confirm if it was
worth going down those paths to acheive what I was hoping. Your essay was
very informative about realistic expectations with the fieldselector.

I actually just got through reading the discussion on deprecating hits which
essentially provides great detail about the summary you provided (link for
anyone else who comes upon this thread and is curious -
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1290).

I am still not quite sure how exactly to ustilize the hitcollector api, but
I will make a first pass at refactoring my code to use both.
