I deleted by docid. I got the number by numdocs.

Just to followup, I think that this was caused by some filesystem issues. My
sysadmin said there were numerous nfs errors in the log.

Also, after this happened, I ran a checkindex and got a weird EOF exception.

Since then, I made another copy and did a checksum on all of the files and
then did the optimize and it worked fine.
