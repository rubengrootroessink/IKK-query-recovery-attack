Thanks Toke.

As I mentioned in my response to Erick, this is complicated by the fact that
the error is within a java stored procedure in Oracle. The Ojvm is version
1.5.0_10. From what I understand, the ojvm is pretty true to the sun
implementation and we have not previously run into issues before.

On the other hand, we have never optimized before either.
