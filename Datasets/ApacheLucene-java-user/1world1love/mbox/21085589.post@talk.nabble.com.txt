SUBJECT: optimize: went from 14488449 to 38449
DATE: 19 Dec 2008


Ok. This is crazy. I have an index with 14,488,449 docs in it. Today I did a
CheckIndex on it and everything looked fine. I made a copy of the index, ran
a delete on about 1.3 million docs and then did an optimize and now my doc
count is 38449.

The index was originally built with 2.3, but I am now using 2.4.

Of course I have the original index, but what would have cause this?
