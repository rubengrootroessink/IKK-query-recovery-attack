No, that is the crazy part. I haven't done anything to this index since it
was first compiled until I did the deletes. That is why I made a copy of it
first because I had never done deletes before and wanted to be sure I didn't
mess anything up.

When I did the deletes, there were a few of the delete files in the index,
but not that many. My index went from 22GB to 77MB.
