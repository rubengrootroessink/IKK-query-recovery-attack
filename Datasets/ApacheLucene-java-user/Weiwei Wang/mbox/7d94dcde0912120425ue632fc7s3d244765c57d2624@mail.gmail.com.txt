SUBJECT: Index Update
DATE: 12 Dec 2009

Hi, all,
     I need to update my index everyday so as to keep pace with times.
Current I have two copy of indexes, one is used to provide search service,
the other is used to do updating. Once the updating process is done, I write
all the updated documents to the index which provide search service.

I want to use only one copy of index,  and do updating searching on the same
index? Does the updating process will effect the search result when the
updating process is running?
