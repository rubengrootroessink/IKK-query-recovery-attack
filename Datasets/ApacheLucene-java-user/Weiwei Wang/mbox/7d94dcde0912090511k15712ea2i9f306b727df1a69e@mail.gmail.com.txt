Hi, Rob,
I read
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BackwardsCompatibility#File_Formats and
found no compatibility guarantee for IndexWriter between different version.

You can run your idea as a test and see the output.
If it doesn't work, i suggest you convert your index to new version as I
said in the last post.

You can develop a convert tool to do this job automatically(that what i have
done).

If you do not have full access to the data center, you can read(readonly
mode is preferred) from the data center(through nfs or something like that)
and write to your local disk.

When all converting is done, you can copy the new index to the data center
with the help of the administrator.
