SUBJECT: Recover special terms from StandardTokenizer
DATE: 11 Dec 2009

Hi, all,
     I designed a ftp search engine based on Lucene. I did a few
modifications to the StandardTokenizer.
My problem is:
  C++ is tokenized as c from StandardTokenizer and I want to recover it from
the TokenStream from StandardTokenizer

What should I do?
