SUBJECT: How to do alias(Pinyin) search in Lucene
DATE: 15 Dec 2009

Hi, guys,
     I'm implementing a search engine based on Lucene for Chinese. So I want
to support pinyin search as Google China do.

e.g.
    “中国”  means Chinese in English
    this word's pinyin input is "zhongguo"
The feature i want to implement is when user type zhongguo the results will
include documents containing "中国" or even Chinese

Anybody here know how to achieve this?
