DATE: 26 Nov 2009

Hi guys,

  I’ve read Lucene in Action and also implemented a general purpose FTP
search engine with lucene, you can find the source here:
http://code.google.com/p/askrosa/

I want to learn more about the implementation of lucene, e.g. index ,storing
structure, compression etc.

Could anyone here recommend some books or materials about these topics?





Best Regards!
