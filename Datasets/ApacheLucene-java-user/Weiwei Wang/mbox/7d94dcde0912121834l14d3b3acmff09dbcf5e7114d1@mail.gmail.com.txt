SUBJECT: Re: Recover special terms from StandardTokenizer
DATE: 13 Dec 2009

Thanks, Koji, I followed your advice and change my analyzer as shown below:
NormalizeCharMap RECOVERY_MAP = new NormalizeCharMap();
RECOVERY_MAP.add("c++","cplusplus$");
CharFilter filter = new LowercaseCharFilter(reader);
filter = new MappingCharFilter(RECOVERY_MAP,filter);
StandardTokenizer tokenStream = new StandardTokenizer(Version.LUCENE_30,
filter);
tokenStream.setMaxTokenLength(maxTokenLength);
TokenStream result = new StandardFilter(tokenStream);
result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);
result = new StopFilter(enableStopPositionIncrements, result, stopSet);
result = new SnowballFilter(result, STEMMER);

I use the same analyzer in the search side. As you know, this analyzer can
token c++ as cplusplus, for this reason, it seems I can search c++ with the
same analyzer because it is also tokenized as cplusplus.

I tested it on as string c++c++, however, when i search c++ on the built
index, nothing is returned.

 I do not know what's wrong with my code. Waiting for your replay
