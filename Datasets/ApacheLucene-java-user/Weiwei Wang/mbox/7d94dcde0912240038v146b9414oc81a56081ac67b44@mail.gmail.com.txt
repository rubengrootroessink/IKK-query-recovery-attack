DATE: 24 Dec 2009

Thanks Jake Mannix and N Hira. I'm planning to releasing my code as Apache
licensed.

I have read http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 and replace my own
identifying information with the boilerplate notice.

Aren't you guys on a holiday? (You guys are really hard-working), in China,
we don't have Christmas holiday but Spring Festival Holiday.

Happy Christmas Eve:-)
