SUBJECT: ICU Chinese words
DATE: 24 Apr 2011

hi，all
      I'm working on a Chinese contact search project, I need to transform
the Chinese words to its Pinyin form.

e.g.
 中国--> zhongguo

The problem I encounter is that for some chinese words which have more than
one transforms, like. 贾-> jia, 贾->gu, ...

I already used the ICUTransformFilter(Han->Latin/Names)，how could i get all
the transforms instead just one of them?

Thanks~
