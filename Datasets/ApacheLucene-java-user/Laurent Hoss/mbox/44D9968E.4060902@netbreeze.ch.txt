We had the same idea ;)
Unfortunatelly this only makes sense for simple AND/phrase Queries, but 
we also want more complex boolean queries like :
"nice cat" AND ("mouse" OR "rat" ) AND NOT ("dog")

Scoring right now doesn't interest us (!) , just whether it is a hit or 
not  (though I must admit it could improve the quality of our results , 
like for browsing the top xx results )
Therefor I would really like to know  if the 'feature' I had in mind , 
is feasible , maybe (only) when scoring is ignored  ?
(Btw, is there an option to switch off scoring ?  Could that improve 
performance in general?)
