SUBJECT: Nightly build link is broken
DATE: 4 Aug 2009

Hi,

I was trying to download a nightly build jar, so I went to Lucene website
and clicked on the link that redirected to:

http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/

and I got a "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at
lucene.zones.apache.org:8080".

Is the link broken or the server is down?

Thanks,
Adriano Crestani
