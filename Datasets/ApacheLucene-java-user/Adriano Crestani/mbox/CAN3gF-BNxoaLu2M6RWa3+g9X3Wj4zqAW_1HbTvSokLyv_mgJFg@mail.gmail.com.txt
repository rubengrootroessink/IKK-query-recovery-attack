DATE: 5 Jul 2011

Hi Govind,

I think you are wrong by assuming escape should receive a query string as
parameter. However, it's meant to receive a term as parameter, which will
later be used to create a query. See the example below:

// this is bad, since +, &, * and - will be escaped
String query = "+lucene&solr -apache*";
String escapedQuery = MultiQueryParser.escape(query);
Query q = queryparser.parse(escapedQuery,...);

// this is good, the operators +, * and - will not be escaped
String term1 = "lucene&solr";
String term2 = "apache"
String term1Escaped = MultiQueryParser.escape(term1);
String term2Escaped = MultiQueryParser.escape(term2);
String escapedQuery = "+" + term1Escaped + " " + term2Escaped + "*";
Query q = queryparser.parse(escapedQuery,...);

As you can see in the second example, escape method should be used to escape
terms, not the entire query. The method should only be used to make sure
syntax characters are escaped and not treated as query operator, so it's
wrong to assume escape() will not escape * in the query term*.
