SUBJECT: Re: How to combine QueryParser and Wildcard search
DATE: 19 Nov 2010

Hi Pulkit,

In case you are using the standard contrib query parser (equivalent to
lucence QP), you may want to create a QueryNodeProcessor, that will convert
TermQueryNodes to WildcardQueryNodes, and attach it to the processor
pipeline:

StandardQueryParser qp = new StandardQueryParser();
((QueryNodeProcessorPipeline) qp.getQueryNodeProcessor()).add(new
MyQueryNodeProcessor());

// qp is ready for use


Please, let me know if you have any question about how to implement your own
QueryNodeProcessor.

Regards,
Adriano Crestani
