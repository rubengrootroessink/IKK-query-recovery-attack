Try this:

     BooleanQuery b1 =  new BooleanQuery();
     b1.add(new TermQuery(new Term("url", "news")),
BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
     b1.add(new TermQuery(new Term("url", "politics")),
BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
     b1.setBoost(1.5f);

     BooleanQuery b2 =  new BooleanQuery();
     b2.add(new TermQuery(new Term("content", "news")),
BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
     b2.add(new TermQuery(new Term("content", "politics")),
BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
     b2.setBoost(2f);

     BooleanQuery finalQuery =  new BooleanQuery();
     finalQuery.add(b1, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);
     finalQuery.add(b2, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);

     System.out.println(finalQuery.toString());
