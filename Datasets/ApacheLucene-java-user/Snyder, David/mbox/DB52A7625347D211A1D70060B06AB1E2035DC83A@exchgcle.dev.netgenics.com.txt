SUBJECT: Index compatability between R1 and R1.2
DATE: 27 Nov 2001

I was wondering if there was a known index compatability isssue between
release 1 and release 1.2?  Upgrading seems to have broken any searches
which specify fields (i.e. +author:snyder ).  Searches without specific
fields specified seem to work fine.

Do we need to rebuild all of our indexes with the new version of the
libraries?
