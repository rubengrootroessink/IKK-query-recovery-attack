SUBJECT: hit count within categories
DATE: 27 Jul 2005

I'm working on a problem where I need to search over 160 million
documents.  I know Lucene can do this no sweat; my problem is that these
documents are grouped in more then 500 categories.  I need to get a
count of documents that match a given query, within each category.
There is no need for scoring the documents or even access the documents,
I just need the count.

Currently I'm using an index per category so I can access the total
number of hits quickly.  I've tried to use a custom HitsCollector object
and one large index to achieve the same thing but found that it was 3 to
4 times slower then iterating over 500 individual indexes.

Searches are sometimes taking more than 60 sec to run and can return
counts in the millions.

So my overall question is can this be done??  Any suggestions would be
helpful.

Thanks

Tim
