SUBJECT: Indexing terms limit
DATE: 10 Aug 2005

I'm currently attempting to index the distinct list of terms found in a
Lucene index using the TermEnum.  I'm creating a document with each list
and indexing the document of terms.  It appears there's a limit of
10,000 distinct terms within a given document.  Can this be overcome??
