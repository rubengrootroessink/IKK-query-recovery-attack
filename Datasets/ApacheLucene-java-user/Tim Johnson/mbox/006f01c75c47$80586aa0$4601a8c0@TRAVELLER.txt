SUBJECT: More long running queries
DATE: 1 Mar 2007

I'm still having issues with long running queries. 

I'm using a custom HitCollector to bring back ALL docs that match a search
has suggested in a previous post/relpy (e.g. Nutch LuceneQueryOptimizer).

This solution works most of the time; however, in testing a very complex
query using several range queries and term queries, we're seeing times in
the 40 sec range with NO HITS returned.

The index contains approx. one million docs and the number of Boolean
expressions created is well over 100,000
