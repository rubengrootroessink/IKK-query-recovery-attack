SUBJECT: Compressed fields and gcj-build lucene: does it work?
DATE: 2 Mar 2006

Hello,

I'm trying to use compressed fields with a gcj build of yesterday  
trunk lucene sources, but it crashes with a java exception. The same  
crash also occurred with a checkout made on October, 8th.The relevant  
backtrace for the exception is:

java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
    at java.lang.System.arraycopy(java.lang.Object, int,  
java.lang.Object, int, int) (../lib/libgcj.so.6.0.0)
    at java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream.write(byte[], int, int) (../lib/ 
libgcj.so.6.0.0)
    at org.apache.lucene.index.FieldsReader.uncompress(byte[])  
(Unknown Source)
    at org.apache.lucene.index.FieldsReader.doc(int) (Unknown Source)

org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer) (Unknown Source)
    at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.addDocument 
(org.apache.lucene.document.Document) (Unknown Source)

This happens on linux (redhat 9) with gcj 4.0.2.

I saw http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-480 but I don't  
think it applies here as I'm building the index from scratch and my  
hardware doesn't look faulty :) Obviously the same code, but with non- 
compressed stored fields, works.

Is somebody using compressed fields with gcj-build lucene? Can  
somebody advice?

Thank you in advance,
Michele Bini
