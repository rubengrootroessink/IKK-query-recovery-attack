SUBJECT: Coordination value
DATE: 9 Dec 2004

I would like to adjust the score lucene is returning to use the
coordination component more. For example, I have a BooleanQuery
containing three TermQueries. I would like to adjust the score so that
documents containing all three terms appear first, followed by docs
that contain only two of the terms, followed by documents that contain
only one of the terms.

I understand that the coordination is a component of the overall
document score currently, but I'd like to make it more absolute. I was
wondering if someone on the list has done something similar.

I have implemented a hack that works by adding a function to the
BooleanWeight class but it is very slow. I believe it is inefficient
because it uses the Explanation class to get the coordination value.
There must be an easier way that I'm missing.
