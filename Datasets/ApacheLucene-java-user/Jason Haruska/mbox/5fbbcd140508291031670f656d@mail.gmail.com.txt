To add to other comments:

This functionality should also look at how common a term is in the corpus. 
Using the corpus as "correct" set of terms to search on isn't always what 
you want if the corpus is unclean (misspellings, etc.)

I believe this is why if you search on an uncommon term, Google will try to 
suggest something more common, even if you spelled the term correctly.
