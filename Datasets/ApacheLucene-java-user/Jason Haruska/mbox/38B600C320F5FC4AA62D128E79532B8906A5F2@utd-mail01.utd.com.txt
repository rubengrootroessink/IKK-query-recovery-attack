Another way to get the results you want it to store "ViewPriority" in
the index. Before you return the results to the user, sort the list by
this field outside of lucene.

I need a very fast search engine because I am working with thousends of
images. Lucine is providing me with that.

Does somebody know how to set boost for document during indexing time?
It
seams that it is not working with document.setBoost().  I suppose that I
should switch off Lucenes scorer to get results sorted by my boost
criteria.
Does somebody know how to do this.
