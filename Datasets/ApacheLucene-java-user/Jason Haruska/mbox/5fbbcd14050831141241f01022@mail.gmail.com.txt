I had to do something similar, but I plan on re-writing it into something 
more elegant. I hope this helps give you some ideas.

1. Create a QueryFilter on only those items that matched the criteria (have 
a required clause in your boolean query)
2. Create a BitFilter which takes a BitSet from step 1 and flip the bits
3. Perform a search with each Filter and display results for each search

Here is my BitFilter code:
--------------------------------------------------
package org.apache.lucene.search;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.BitSet;

import org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader;

public class BitFilter extends Filter {
private BitSet bitSet;

public BitFilter(BitSet bs) {
bitSet = bs;
}

public void flipAll() {
bitSet.flip(0, bitSet.size()-1);
}

/* (non-Javadoc)
* @see org.apache.lucene.search.Filter#bits(
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader)
*/
public BitSet bits(IndexReader reader) throws IOException {
return bitSet;
}
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
