SUBJECT: How to find performance bottleneck
DATE: 6 Oct 2010

When running application on Windows XP 32 bit machine the search time is 0.5 second. JVM is
IBM Java 5 for 32 bit.
But when running the same application on much more powerfull Windows Server 2007 64 bit machine
the search time is 3 seconds. JVM is IBM Java 5 for 64 bit.

It just does not make any sense to me.
Could you help me to find what is causing such poor performance. Maybe there are some tools
that I can use.

I'm using MMapDirectory for IndexSearcher. Lucene version 3.0.1.

Typical search is:
(+keywords:cat* +keyword:cat~0.5) AND ((type:black AND catalogs:"57") OR (type:white AND bflag:n
AND pflag:n  ))

I'm running absolutely the same searches on both machines.
