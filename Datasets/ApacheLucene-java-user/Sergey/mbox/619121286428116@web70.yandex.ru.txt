I do some warmup queries on both machines.
I also checked heap size, it is 1G on 32 bit and 4G on 64 bit machine.

I also have SATA disk on 32 bit and SCSI on 64 bit. So I/O should not be a problem.
Actually if I'm using MMapDirectory and doing the same query over and over again I would guess
the part of the file that is being used is placed into RAM.
