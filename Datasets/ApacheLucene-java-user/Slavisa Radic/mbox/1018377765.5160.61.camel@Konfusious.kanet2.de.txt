SUBJECT: Getting Terms sequentially without using TermEnumeration
DATE: 9 Apr 2002

Hi,

I have to build a Terms-Document-Matrix to be able to do some Matrix
operations on it.

the Matrix should look like (I hope this will be displayed correctly):


	term1 term2 term3 term4 ...
----------------------------------
Doc1	freq  freq  freq  freq
Doc2	freq...................      
Doc3	.......................
Doc4	.......................
.
.
.



I tried that by using IndexReader.terms() and IndexReader.TermDocs(term)
to get all the terms and the document-numbers which contain them.
As you can imagine, the TermEnumeration-Object has become to big to fit
into memory.

Is there an "easy" way to get the Terms one by one (without writing my
own IndexReader)?
