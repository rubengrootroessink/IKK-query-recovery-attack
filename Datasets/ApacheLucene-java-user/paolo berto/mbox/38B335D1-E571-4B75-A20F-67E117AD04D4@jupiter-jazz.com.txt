SUBJECT: webserverless search with lucene on offline HTML doc
DATE: 20 Feb 2006

Hello,

I would like to figure out if it is possible to write a java applet  
able to search with lucene through an HTML documentation WITHOUT  
having a webserver installed on the system and on multiple platforms.

So I have a set of static offline HTML files forming a software  
documentation, would like to index it and search through it from a  
browser without having to install a web server and on various  
platforms (osx/win32/linux) Is that possible at all?

Thanks and sorry for the basic question,

paolo
