SUBJECT: Highlighter and HTML tags
DATE: 10 Aug 2004

Hi,

I'm using lucene 1.4 and the Highlighter package from the sandbox.
When the search results are clicked I want to show the original (HTML)
document with highlighting. It seems to work fine, except for one annoying
detail: It also tries to 'highlight' strings that are part of a tag, such
as the href contents in a link. So the user is sometimes presented with
incorrect HTML.
Is there a way to stop the highlighter from highlighting strings inside
HTML tags?

Thanks,

Hennus Bergman
