Hello everone,

I am looking for a simple Servlet that carries out a basic keyword search on 
my site. Does anyone have a servlet and a Html file to go with it that 
performs searches on a site. I have read through the documentation on the 
apache-jakarta-lucence site.



Thanking you in advance.

Regards
Gul
