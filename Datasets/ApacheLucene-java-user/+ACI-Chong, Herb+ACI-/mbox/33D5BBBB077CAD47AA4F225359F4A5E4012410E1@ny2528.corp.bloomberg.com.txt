DATE: 4 Nov 2003

this is the release 1.2 code. the exception as reported by debug is

java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.close(IndexWriter.java:146)
	at org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles.main(IndexFiles.java:73) 

this is either the RAMDirectory close() or the Lock close(). i am inclined to think it is
the RAMDirectory class that is having the problem. i am running Lucene under Windows 2000
and the single directory has 120,000 files in it. no subdirectories.

I suggest you recompile Lucene with the compiler debug flag set (-g, I
think).  That will show you/us the exact line number for that NPE.
Is this a version of Lucene from CVS? 1-3RC2? 1.2?
