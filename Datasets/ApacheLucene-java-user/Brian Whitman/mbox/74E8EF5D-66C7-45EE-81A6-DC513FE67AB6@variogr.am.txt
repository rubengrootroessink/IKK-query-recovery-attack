SUBJECT: copying fields between documents in different indexes
DATE: 16 Feb 2007

Using the lucene API, is there a way to copy the contents and  
parameters of fields between documents in different indexes? Without  
requiring the field to be stored or needing to pass around the  
fulltext contents of the field.

I guess I am looking for

doc.add(new Field("contentsNew", copyFrom(originalDoc, "contents")));

where doc and originalDoc are from different indexes.
