SUBJECT: searching by field's TF vector (not MoreLikeThis)
DATE: 2 Feb 2007

I'm looking for a way to search by a field's internal TF vector  
representation.

MoreLikeThis does not seem to be what I want-- it constructs a text  
query based on the top scoring TF-IDF terms. I want to query by TF  
vector directly, bypassing the tokens.

Lucene understandably has knowledge of the cosine dist of these  
vectors -- does it expose it in such a way that I can query the topN  
results from a field's TF vector?
