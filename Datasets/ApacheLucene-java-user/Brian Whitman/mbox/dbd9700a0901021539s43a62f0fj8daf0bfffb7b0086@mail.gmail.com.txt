So my apologies for the duplicate comments, I went to go get proof of
duplicates and was confused as we apparently have duplicates across
different shards now in our distributed setup (a bug on our end.) I assumed
when I saw duplicates that it was the same problem as last time. Still
doesn't help me get at my segment corruption problem, though :(

Michael, in answer to your question: java 1.6 64-bit, debian linux, amazon
ec2 machine with the index on an elastic block store. No other problems with
that setup for a few months now.

I ran checkindex with -fix on and optimize still throws the same error.
