I just ran it again, and it detected the same error and claimed to fix it. I
then shut down the solr server (I wasn't sure if this would be an issue),
ran it a third time (where it again found and claimed to fix the error),
then a fourth where it did not find any problems, and now the optimize()
call on the running server does not throw the merge exception.

 Did this corruption happen only once?  (You mentioned hitting dups in
the past...

Not that we know of, but it's very likely we never noticed. (The only reason
I discovered this was our commits were taking 20-40x longer on this index
than others)
