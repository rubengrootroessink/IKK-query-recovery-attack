After looking around the archives & Lucene's code & etc, my  
assumption is:

Lucene does not use the entire TF vector space in any search. There  
is no tree search or other log-n search mechanism built into Lucene.  
TF cos dist is using for scoring, once the search space is reduced  
from the occurrence of terms in query from the inverted index, and  
then it's a foreach document operation.

If this is incorrect, please let me know.
