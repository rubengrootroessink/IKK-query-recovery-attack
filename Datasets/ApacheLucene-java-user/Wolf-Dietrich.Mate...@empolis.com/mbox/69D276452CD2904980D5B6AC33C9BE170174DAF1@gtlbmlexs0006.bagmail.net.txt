Wolf-Dietrich is my first name, so leave out Mr. or use
my family name (which is uncommon here).

Yes, but there is no reason to do this in this case.
You search for documents using their file name (including their full path!).
You get a result (some kind of list). Please read Java-Docs about Hits
class.
hits.id(0) returns the (internal) ID of the first hit in your result.
This is the document that you want to remove (using
indexReader.delete(...).).
There are no more documents in your result "hits" unless your key is not
unique.
hits.length() returns 0 or 1.
