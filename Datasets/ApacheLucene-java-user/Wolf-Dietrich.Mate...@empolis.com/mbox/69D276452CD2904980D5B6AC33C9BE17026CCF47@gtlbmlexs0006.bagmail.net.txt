The notebook is quite good, e.g. the Pentium-M might be faster than
your Pentium 4. At least it has a similar speed, because of it better
internal design. Never compare cpus of different types by their
frequency. 
Use benchmarks, e.g. SpecInt_2000 <http://www.spec.org/benchmarks.html>
to
compare cpus, but keep in mind that these ratings will be different from

your "real world" application. 
SPECint2000(base) rating of a P4@3,06Ghz: 1085,

SPECint2000(base) rating of Pentium M 755@2Ghz: 1541 (!)

<http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/results/res2004q2/cpu2000-20040614-03081.ht

Note: this is a workstation using a faster version of your notebook cpu.
I haven't found any Pentium M system with 1,8Ghz in the list.

Maybe your index is small enough to fit into the cache provided by the 
operating systems. So you wouldn't recognize any difference between your

hard disks.

I don't think so. I'm using Windows 2000 pro and SuSE 9.0 and 
(from my memory) Linux seems to be sightly faster, but I can't
provide any benchmark now.
You should re-run your tests on the same hardware.
