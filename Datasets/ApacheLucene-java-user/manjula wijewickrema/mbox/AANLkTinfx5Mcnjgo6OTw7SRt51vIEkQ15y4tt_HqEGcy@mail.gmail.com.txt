SUBJECT: Access indexed terms
DATE: 14 May 2010

Hi,

Is it possible to put the indexed terms into an array in lucene. For
example, imagine I have indexed a single document in Lucene and now I want
to acces those terms in the index. Is it possible to retrieve (call) those
terms as array elements? If it is possible, then how?

Thanks,
Manjula
