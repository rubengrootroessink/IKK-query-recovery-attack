Hi,

In my work, I am using Lucene and two java classes. In the first one, I
index a document and in the second one, I try to search the most relevant
document for the indexed document in the first one. In the first java class,
I use the SnowballAnalyzer in the createIndex method and StandardAnalyzer in
the searchIndex method and pass the highest frequency terms into the second
Java class. In the second class, I use SnowballAnalyzer in the createIndex
method (this index is for the collection of documents to be searched, or it
is my database) and StandardAnalyser in the searchIndex method (I pass the
highest frequently occuring term of the first class as the search term
parameter to the searchIndex method of the second class). Using Analyzers in
this manner, what I am willing is to do the stemming, stop-words in both
indexes (in both classes) and to search those a few high frequency words (of
the first index) in the second index. So, if my intention is clear to you,
could you please let me know whether it is correct or not the way I have
used Analyzers? I highly appreciate any comment.

Thanx.
Manjula.
