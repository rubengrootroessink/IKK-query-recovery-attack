SUBJECT: MaxFieldLength
DATE: 12 Jul 2010

Hi,

I have seen that, onece the field length of a document goes over a certain
limit (
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_3/api/all/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#DEFAULT_MAX_FIELD_LENGTH
gives
it as 10,000 terms-default) Lucene truncates those documents. Is there any
possibility to truncate documents, if we increase the number of indexed
documents (assume, there are no any individual documents which exceed the
default MaxFieldLength of Lucene)?

Thanx
Manjula.
