SUBJECT: Re: Access indexed terms

Hi Andrzej

Thanx for the reply. But as you have mentioned, creating arrays for indexed
terms seems to be little difficult. Here my intention is to find the term
frequencies (of terms) of an indexed document. I can find the term frequency
of a particular term (giving as a query) if I specify the term in the code.
But I really want is to get the term frequency (or even the number of times
it appears in the document) of the all indexed terms (or high frequency
terms) without named them in the code. Is there an alternative way to do
that?

Thanks
Manjula
