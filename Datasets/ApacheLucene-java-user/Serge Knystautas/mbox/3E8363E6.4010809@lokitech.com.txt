SUBJECT: Re: Very large queries?
DATE: 27 Mar 2003

Gary,

I don't fully understand how you use your drug thesauri, but my approach 
would to use your thesauri into an Analyzer.  This would allow you 
during to coerce the various terms to single meanings, somewhat akin to 
how a stemmer works.

As for size, we're currently using Lucene to index about 100 megs of 
data, and lookup performance is blinding.  Indexing takes a while, but 
that's as much because of how we calculate the 20+ fields we're indexing 
on for each Document.

Can you give more specifics on the type of data you'd index, the query 
you'd want to run, and the desired result of the query?
