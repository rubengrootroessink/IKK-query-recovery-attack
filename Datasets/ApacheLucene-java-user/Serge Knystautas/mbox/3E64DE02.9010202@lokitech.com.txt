the same thing wat i am expecting??

When our system does indexing updates, we do the following:
1. make a list of documents that have changed.
2. loop through the list of documents doing the following:
   a. remove those documents (if they exist) from the index.
   b. add those documents to a temp index
3. merge the temp index into the main index
4. record when we did the update.

You can't add and delete from an index at the same time (from our 
understanding), so this is why we're using the temp index.  We have a 
last-updated value for every document in our system, so as an added 
benefit, if the update gets aborted mid-way through, there is minimal 
impact.  The only downside is documents that have been updated are 
removed, but the next time the update runs, it will add those back in.
