No worries, I'm already banging my head because there are 2 'different' 
incoming sources of messages (the sources of messages are redundant 
satellites connections on 2 different satellites), one is supposed to be 
a live backup, the 2 are running in parallel and the broker must ideally 
wait for a message to come from the 2 sources.

If the wait goes beyond a certain threshold, trigger an alert, put the 
failed node, ...

That's the easy part :)
