SUBJECT: Document numbers and ids
DATE: 4 Feb 2005

The LiA says that I can use Sort.INDEXORDER when indexing order is relevant 
and gives an example where documents' ids (got from Hits.id() ) are 
increasing from top to bottom of resultset. Are that ids the same thing as 
document numbers? 

If they are the same, how can it be that they are preserved during indexing 
process? LiA says that documents are renumbered when merging segments.
