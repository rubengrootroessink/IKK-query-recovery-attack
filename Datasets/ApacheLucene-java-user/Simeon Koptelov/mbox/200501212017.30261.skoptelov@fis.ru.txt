SUBJECT: Search on heterogenous index
DATE: 21 Jan 2005

Hello all. I'm new to lucene and think about using it in my project.

I have prices with dynamic structure, containing wares there, about 10K prices 
with total 500K wares. Each price has about 5 text fields. 

I'll do searches on wares. The difficult part is that I'll do searches for all 
wares, the search is not bound to a particular price structure.

My question is, how should I organize my indices? Can Lucene handle data 
effectlively if I'll have one index containing different Fields in Documents? 
Or should I create a separate index for each price with same Fields structure 
across Documents?
