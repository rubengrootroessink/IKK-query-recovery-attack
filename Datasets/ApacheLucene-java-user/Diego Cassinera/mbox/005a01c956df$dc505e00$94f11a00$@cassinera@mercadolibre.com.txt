In the analyzer the function 

public final TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader)

Usually does  a bunch of new filters, from what I seen in most of these
filters none of the use class member variables.  Has anybody tried making
them static to avoid the creation of new objects.

 

Thanks
