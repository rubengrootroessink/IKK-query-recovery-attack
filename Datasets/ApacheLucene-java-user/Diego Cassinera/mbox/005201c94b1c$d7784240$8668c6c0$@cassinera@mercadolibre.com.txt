SUBJECT: Modifiing the values of stored non indexed fields
DATE: 20 Nov 2008

Is there a way to change the value of stored fields that have not been
indexed without having to delete the document and re-index it.  The fields I
need to change will always have the same size, however the value may change
every so often.  I want to do this to avoid hitting my rdbms to display the
results of a search.

Thank You
