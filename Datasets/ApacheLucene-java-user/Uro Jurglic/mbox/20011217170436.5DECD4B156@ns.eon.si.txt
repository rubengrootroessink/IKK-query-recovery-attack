Useful alternative to DateFilter is using RangeQuery, containing string
representations of date objects (DateField.dateToString())
for lower and upper term. At least one of terms must be not null, in case
you want to search after or before specified date. It seems to work better
than filtering with DateFilter - I get no null pointer ex.

Zadeva: Using a DateFilter without a query


Hi,

is it possible to use a DateFilter without a query. I would like to get all
Documents from within a certain period of time WITHOUT specifying any query
except the range of dates.

OR

Is there something like query that will always return all documents from an
index?

Jan
