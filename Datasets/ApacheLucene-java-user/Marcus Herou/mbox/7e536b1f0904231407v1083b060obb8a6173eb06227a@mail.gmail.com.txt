Yes I have considered it for 30 minutes :)

How do one apply that in the real world ?

If the only thing I get access to is the actual docId would it not be really
expensive to get the Document itself from the index and later use some field
in it as external lookup in some optimized structure for this ?

Example, pseudo:

*public* *float* customScore(*int* doc, *float* subQueryScore, *float*
valSrcScore)
{
        *Document document = indexSearcher.doc(doc);
        float score = MyOptimalHashStructure.getScore(document.get("someId"));
        return score**subQueryScore*;*
}

This would not scale well right ? I mean gathering scores through 100M docs
would take some time I guess ? Or even 1M docs...

Please push me in the right direction.

Cheers

//Marcus
