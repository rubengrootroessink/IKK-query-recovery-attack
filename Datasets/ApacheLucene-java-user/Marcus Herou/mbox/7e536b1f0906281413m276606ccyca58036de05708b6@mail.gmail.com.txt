Hi. I think I need to be more specific.

What I am trying to find out is if I should aim for:

CPU (2x4 cores, 2.0-3.0Ghz)? or perhaps just a 4 cores is enough.
Fast disk IO: 8 disks, RAID1+0 ? or perhaps 2 disks is enough...
RAM - if the index does not fit into RAM how much RAM should I then buy ?

Please any hints would be appreciated since I am going to invest soon.
