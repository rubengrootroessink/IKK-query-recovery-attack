SUBJECT: Haloe (Lucene package) released!
DATE: 8 Sep 2008

Hi guys.

Glad to announce that I finally managed to move this package out of the
company code and released it to the OS community. The package contains some
neat classes which we use for instance when indexing and searching through
some hundred thousands of blogs and the ShardedSolrDocumentIndexer will be
used frequently now when we will index the entire Blogosphere.

Check it out at http://dev.tailsweep.com

Kindly

//Marcus
