Hi thanks for your answer, comments inline.

Yes we partition the index, with a simple RoundRobin algo.
The options was just to give the reader some visibility in what kind of
hardware you get depending on which path you choose. I do not really have
that amount of money to spend right now. More like 1/6th of that really.
We crawl blogs... The number of blogs we find is still increasing and we are
not nearly indexing all languages => It will grow at least linear. Let's say
at least 10-20G a month or so ?

OK, so you mean that one should aim for fitting the shard into RAM...

We store no fields in the index besides the actual DB id. We load no more
than 50 docs at a time.

We index all non office hours.

OK like I suspected, answers my previous question(s).


Final question:

Based on your findings what is the most challenging part to tune ? Sorting
or querying or what else?
