Good idea.  I was just following the install directions, but if I don't have
to pay attention to the install directions, I'll find a much better one.

Any hints?  Previous email discussion maybe?  I found some references via
searching the archives, but I'm not 100% convinced they are applicable to my
situation.

Well, what do you need JavaCC for? Isn't it just the technology for
building the supplied HTML-Parser? There are much better HTML parsers
out there, which you can use.
