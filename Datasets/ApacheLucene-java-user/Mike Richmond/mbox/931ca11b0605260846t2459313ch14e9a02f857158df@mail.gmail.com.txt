I'm running into similar sort issues when I try to sort my results on
a date field that was created using the DateTools class as follows:

DateTools.dateToString(dateObj, DateTools.Resolution.SECOND);

I am then storing this in a stored, untokenized field named "date".
When I sort the results by date, I am not getting them in date order.

Ex (dates converted back to a more readable format):

05/26/06 at 08:03:34 AM
05/25/06 at 01:36:57 PM
05/26/06 at 06:58:09 AM

Do I need to have a tokenized date field to get the results that I am expecting?


Thanks,

Mike
