SUBJECT: Query For Top Values
DATE: 15 Jun 2006

Hello All,

Can anyone recommend a solution to get the top values of a field from
the results of a query?  For example, If I have a field named "from"
is there a way to get the top occuring values in that field after I
filter the results based on a query?

Note:
Luke has a great tool that enumerates the top terms for a field, but
it does it for all documents.  I just want to enumerate the top terms
on a set of documents that match a query.


Thanks in advance,

Mike
