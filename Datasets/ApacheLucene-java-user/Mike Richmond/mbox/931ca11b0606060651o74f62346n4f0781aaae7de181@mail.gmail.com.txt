SUBJECT: Re: PHP and Lucene integration
DATE: 6 Jun 2006

I am also working on interfacing Lucene with PHP.  Here are a couple
options that I have found useful:

Call Java directly from PHP:
http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/

Solr - Interacts w/ Lucene via XML requests
http://incubator.apache.org/solr/index.html
There is mention of a PHP interface (SolPHP) here:
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolPHP

Hope this helps.
