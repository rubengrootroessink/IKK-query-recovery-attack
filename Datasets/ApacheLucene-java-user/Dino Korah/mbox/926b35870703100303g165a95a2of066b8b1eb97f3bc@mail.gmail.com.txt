SUBJECT: index optimisation - disk fill-up
DATE: 10 Mar 2007

Hi All,

I understand lucene has a requirement of double the size of index available
free on the disk on which the index is being optimised. But if in case the
disk gets filled up during optimisation, what will happen to the index,
theoretically? Is there an effective way of avoiding this?

Many Thanks
Dino
