SUBJECT: HitCollector - Remote-ability
DATE: 11 Sep 2008

Hi All,
 
I vaguely remember discussions on lucene remote-ability of HitCollectors
based search(). As far as I remember, it is not possible if I use
HitCollectors.
In lucene 3, we are doing away with a lot of search() variants, including
the ones that return Hits.
 
I would like to know which one of the search() variants based implementation
is safe for remoting.
 
Many thanks,
Dino
