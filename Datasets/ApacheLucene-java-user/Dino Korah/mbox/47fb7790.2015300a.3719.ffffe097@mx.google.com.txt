Lucene is a library to index data.
Its up to you to drive it the way you want.
Think about the search result, how would your user like to see the
information that the search page has brought up. Do they want to know page
numbers, or is it section number, or it could be even sentence number.
Depending on that breakup and stick the positional information like chapter,
paragraph, section number, sentence number etc along with the fragment of
the book and make a document.

Hope that helped.!

Each line is a Document, and row are Field. Field like Description will be
stored (and even compress).
