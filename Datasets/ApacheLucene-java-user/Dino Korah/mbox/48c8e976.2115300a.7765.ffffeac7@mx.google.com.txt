SUBJECT: Searcher - search() & Hits Deprecation
DATE: 11 Sep 2008

Hi All,
 
In my project I use Hits from Searcher.search() for my query results. If I
am to move to Lucene 3's ways, I will have to use TopDocs I presume.
 
It'll be great if someone could guide me with some sort of skeleton code.
Also is it possible to cache the results like I do with Hits?
 
Another question I have is on the order of application of Query, Filter and
Sort. Surely sort is last.! At low level if I have an effective filter,
would it reduce the number of seek+read & memory usage?
 
TopFieldDocs search(Query query, Filter filter, int n, Sort sort)
 
Many thanks
Dino
