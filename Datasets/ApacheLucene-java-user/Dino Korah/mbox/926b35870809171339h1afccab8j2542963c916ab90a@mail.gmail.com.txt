SUBJECT: Re: TopDocCollector & Paging
DATE: 17 Sep 2008

I know in applications where we search for a words or phrases and expect the
result sorted by relevance, TopDocCollector would work like a dream.
But what about scenario where the result needs to be sorted chronologically
or by some kind of metadata.

A very common application would be email applications. If someone is to
search on the Inbox, the result will be expected to appear sorted by date.
If there are too many results, the user will most probably be willing to
look through a fair part of the result list, which means paging through the
generated hits/result is quite handy feature for a generic library.
