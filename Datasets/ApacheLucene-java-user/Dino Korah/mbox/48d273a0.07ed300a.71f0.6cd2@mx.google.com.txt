Hi All,
 
Scenario: I have 100 documents in an index and if these documents fall into
10 mutualy exclusive set; And within that set one of them is the main
document.
Now if I am to search on the index and group the result on 10 mutually
exclusive sets. And if I have to display the result with fields displayed
from the main document, How do I do that with minimal overhead.
 
Realworld Scenario: take the example of Inbox of emails with attachments. If
those attachments and the email itself are indexed with a common mail-id
field which is common for the attachments and the mail-body from the same
mail message; Search results would be better displayed as email's subject
and body extract so that user can identify them easily.
 
Many thanks
 
Dino
