SUBJECT: Analyzer at Query time
DATE: 28 Aug 2008

Hi All,
 
If I am to completely avoid the query parser and use the BooleanQuery along
with TermQuery, RangeQuery, PrefixQuery, PhraseQuery, etc, does the search
words still get to the Analyzer, before actually doing the real search?
 
Many thanks,
Dino
