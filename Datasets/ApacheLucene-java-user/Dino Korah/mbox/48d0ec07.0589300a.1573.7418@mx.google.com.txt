SUBJECT: TopDocCollector & Paging
DATE: 17 Sep 2008

Hello All,
 
Anyone has tried  this?
 
My UI has a requirement to show total number of results and then show
results in pages. How do I do that with TopDocCollector, without having to
run search() twice, one to get the total number of hits and then the next
one to get the page being displayed. (like the
demo::SearchFiles::doPagingSearch())
 
In my case I am to search on a few hundred million document index; scoring
is expensive.
 
Many thanks,
Dino
