SUBJECT: search with Filter
DATE: 15 Sep 2008

Hi All,
 
I am trying to utilize Filter to see if I can get a bit more performance out
of my application that searches over 100million document lucene index.
 
On all my documents I have a two fields over which I will have to scope my
searches. One is a date-time field (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) and a user-id filed
(number). How do I specify filter for a field. I feel that I can use
BooleanFilter + RangeFilter (for date-time) + TermFilter (user-id).
 
I couldnt figure out how to specify a Filter per field.
 
Could someone point me in the right direction.
 
Many thanks,
Dino
