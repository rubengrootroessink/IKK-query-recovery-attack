SUBJECT: Case Sensitivity
DATE: 13 Aug 2008

Hi All,
 
Once I index a bunch of documents with a StandardAnalyzer (and if the effort
I need to put in to reindex the documents is not worth the effort), is there
a way to search on the index without case sensitivity.
I do not use any sophisticated Analyzer that makes use of
LowerCaseTokenizer.
 
Please let me know if there is a solution to circumvent this case
sensitivity problem.
 
Many thanks
Dino
