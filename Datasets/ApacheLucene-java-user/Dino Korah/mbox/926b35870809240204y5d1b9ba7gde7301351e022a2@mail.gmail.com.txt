SUBJECT: Index time Document Boosting and Query Time Sorts
DATE: 24 Sep 2008

Hi all,

Could you please help me understand hos that works.

If I boost documents at index time based on some kind of criteria and if I
am to sort on a different criteria at query time, how will the result get
affected by the boosting.


So if I am to index a bunch of text files in a folder structure. If I boost
individual documents based on the depth of the path. But when I search on
the file content and if I sort on the modification time, how will the result
be?

Eg: (boost is 1/depth)
Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/Folder4/Folder5/text_file1.txt,
mod-time:20080101000000, depth-factor: 1/5
Folder1/Folder2/text_file2.txt, mod-time:20080102000000, depth-factor: 1/2
Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/Folder4/text_file3.txt, mod-time:20080101000000,
depth-factor: 1/4
Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/Folder4/Folder5/text_file4.txt,
mod-time:20080105000000, depth-factor: 1/5

Many thanks.
Dino
