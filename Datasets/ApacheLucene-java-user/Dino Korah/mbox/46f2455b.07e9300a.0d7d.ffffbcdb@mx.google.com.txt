SUBJECT: Lucene multiple indexes
DATE: 20 Sep 2007

Hi People,

 

I was trying to get lucene to work for a mail indexing solution.

 

Scenario:

Traffic into the index method is on average 250 mails and their attachments
per minute. This volume has made me think of a solution that will split the
index on domain names of the owner of the message. So if I have say 100
users from 50 domains, I have 50 indexes. Now in the query method for my
program, I have to load the indexes according to the user who is logged on. 

 

Is it a good Idea to cache the Searcher objects once they are created? Or is
there a better approach to what I am trying to achieve?

 

Many thanks
