SUBJECT: Best Practice for Lucene Search
DATE: 30 Jan 2009


Hello,

I googled, searched this Forum and read the manual, but I'm not sure what
would be the best practice for Lucene search.

I have an e-Commerce application with about 10 mySQL tables for my products.
And I have an Index (which is working fine), with about 10 fields for every
product. Is it a common way having the same data (title, description, tags,
paths to pictures, sold_counter..etc) redundant in my mySQL DB and in the
Index? And everytime I add a product, saving it to both? Would it not reduce
the performance doing always things twice?

What would be the best practice? 
1) Save it to both index and mySQL DB (as I'm doing right now). 
2) Save only searchable fields (title, description and tags) and an
product_id to index and use product_id to query everything else from DB?
3) ..?

Would be thankful for some hints and your experience.

Thx,
ilwes

p.s. btw. im working with Zend/PHP but this shouldn't have any impact on
this question
