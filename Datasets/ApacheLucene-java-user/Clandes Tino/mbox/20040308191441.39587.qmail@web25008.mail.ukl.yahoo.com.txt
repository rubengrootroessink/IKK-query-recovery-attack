SUBJECT: Caching and paging search results
DATE: 8 Mar 2004

Hi all, 
could someone describe his expirience in
implementation of caching, sorting and paging search
results.
Is Stateful Session bean appropriate for this?
My wish is to obtain all search hits only in first
call, and after that, to iterate through Hit
Collection and display cached results.
I have checked SearchBean in contribution section, but
it does not provide real caching and paging.
 
Regards and thanx in advance!
Milan
