SUBJECT: Highlighter / cannot be instantiated
DATE: 28 Jan 2010

I'm trying to get the highlighter running, but didn't get it work.

Everywhere it's posted as following:

Highlighter highlighter = new Highlighter(new SimpleHTMLFormatter(), 
new QueryScorer(query));

but that gives me a
"Highlighter is abstract; cannot be instantiated".

I'm using version 2.9 of highliter/2.9 of lucene

Any ideas ? Thanks :-)

Greetings,
Marc
