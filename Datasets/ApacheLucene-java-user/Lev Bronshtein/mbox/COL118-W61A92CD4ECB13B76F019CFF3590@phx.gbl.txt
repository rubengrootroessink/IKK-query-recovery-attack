Thank you for the suggestion Simon. 

However the point is that I want to apply one query as opposed to queries[] to fields[]. 
So if all I have is one query and 30 fields I wil have to create a query[30] array and copy
the same value over and over I presume.  I solved that problem exactly the same way but with
fields, I took one value SHOULD and repliacated that.  The issue is not feasability, but
just the kludginess of doing something like that.
