Hi Group, 

I have an isue when using MultiFieldQueryParser, I would like to use one query against a number
of fields however I get an 
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: queries.length != fields.length

Looked at the javadoc, and it looks like the only way to run one query against multiple fields
is to define flags for every field
See http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_2/api/all/index.html, the very last parse method.Â 
All I really want to do is just run a query against multiple fields, is there a simple way?

Regards,

Lev Bronshtein
