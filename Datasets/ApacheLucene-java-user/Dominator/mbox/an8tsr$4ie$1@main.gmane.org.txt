SUBJECT: HTMLParser or unicode problem???
DATE: 30 Sep 2002

Hi,
I want to include the support for Danish in the HTMLParser of Lucene.
Workflow:

1) In the HTMLParser.jj I have added this to a token: < #LET:
["A"-"Z","a"-"z","0"-"9","","","","","",""] >
2) In the StandarTokenizer.jj I have added "\u0080"-"\u00ff",
"\u0100"-"\u017f", "\u0180"-"\u024f", "\u00c0"-"\u00d6" to the "#LETTER:"
tag


When I search (after compiling and indexing) after words with special
characters in it, the search engine can't find them. For example: when I
search for "civilingenir", I will get no result. When I write out the
comment string of the result (after another search of a word nearby), I see
this in my browser: "civilingeni√∏r". So somehow the parser is mapping the
wrong characters.. What am I doing wrong?


Thx..
