SUBJECT: How to include strange characters??
DATE: 7 Oct 2002

Hi,

I want to use Danish for my search engine. Hereby I have to use characters
like: , , , , , . My search engine is finished, but when I search for
a word with one of those characters in it, I'll get no result. In fact when
I print out a result string it shows a very strange result, for example
search for: "civilingenir" string: "civilingeni√∏r".. I'm sure it's an
unicode problem, but where can I change it??

Thx..
