I am not using the queryParser, but instead a booleanQuery and the state 
field is queried trough a termQuery.  So the StandardAnalyzer should not 
stop the "ON" string because it should not be used on that field by my 
request.  I changed my index building so not to use a "text" document on 
that field, but a "keyword" document instead and nothing has changed, still 
got the 0 results with state:on in my request.

Any other idea ?
