SUBJECT: Is the searched string 'on' a special case ?
DATE: 13 Jan 2003

I have an index wtih many fields, and specially, one for company name and 
one for state.

When I search for :
+company:"inc"~100

I get 114 results from 2 states, HI (Hawaii) and ON (Ontario).


If I search for :
+state:hi +company:"inc"~100

I get 7 results for Hawaii.


But when I search for:
+state:on +company:"inc"~100

I get no results at all for Ontario.

So what is going on ? I tried with many other states and all are working, 
but not 'on'.
Is 'on' a special case ? Like on/off ?
