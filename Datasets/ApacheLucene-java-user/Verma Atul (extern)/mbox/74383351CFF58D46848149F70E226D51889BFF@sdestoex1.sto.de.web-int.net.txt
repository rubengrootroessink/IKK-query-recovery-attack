SUBJECT: User Rights Management in Lucene
DATE: 1 Feb 2005

Hi,

I'm new to Lucene and want to know, whether Lucene has the capability of
displaying the search results based the Users Rights.

For Example:

There are suppose some resources, like :

Resource 1
Resource 2
Resource 3
Resource 4

And there are say 2 users with 

User 1 having access to Resource 1, Resource 2 and Resource 4; and User
2 having access to Resource 1 and Resource 3

So when User 1 searches the database, then he should get results from
Resource 1, 2 and 4, but

When User 2 searches the databse, then he should get results from
Resource 1 and 3.

Atul Verma
