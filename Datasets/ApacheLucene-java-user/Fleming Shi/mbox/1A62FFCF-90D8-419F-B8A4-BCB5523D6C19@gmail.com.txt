SUBJECT: Ability to sort integer fields on large index
DATE: 4 Apr 2008

Here is the problem:

- Single Large index with upto 200 million documents
- Each document contains field using epoch timestamp format (padding  
is required when creating range requests)
- One of the frequently used search query,  a range request on the  
timestamp field (10 digits)
- Other searches are fine, but the search using range request  
(1207190000 to 1207190258), even small result set, still slow when  
"sort" is requested

My questions:
- Is Lucene sorting then search or is it doing search then sort the  
results?
- Is there a way to get this type of searches to return faster with  
heavier weight on the timestamp not on relevancy?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated

/Regards
