Hi--

I just got kamikaze somewhat integrated into a project of mine. I'm
having problems growing the DocIdSets, though. Up to the point where the
first regrow happens, everything is fine. Once the regrow happens, I get
an ArrayOutOfBoundsException. The following unit test will exhibit this
behavior. If I change the third param of getDocSetInstance to be
something lower, I get a p4Doc, if I leave it as is, I get an OpenBitSet
doc, in either case, I get the same crash. Do I need to initialize the
docs in some way other than just creating them?

regards,
Michael

public class KamikazeTest extends TestCase
{
    public void testGrowingP4()
    {
        DocSet doc =
            DocSetFactory.getDocSetInstance(0, 350000, 3000000,
DocSetFactory.FOCUS.SPACE);
        Random rand = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
        int maxDoc = 350000;
        doc.addDoc(rand.nextInt(maxDoc));
        int i = 0;
        try
        {
            while(i < 256)
            {
                int nextDoc = rand.nextInt(maxDoc);
                doc.addDoc(nextDoc);
                ++i;
            }               
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            return;
        }
        assertTrue(false);
    }
}
