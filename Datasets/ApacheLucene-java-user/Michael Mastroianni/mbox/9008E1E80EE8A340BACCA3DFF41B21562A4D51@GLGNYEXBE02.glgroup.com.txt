Thanks. 

I have a couple quick questions. 
1. when I call 	    	DocSetFactory.getDocSetInstance(0, -1, -1,
DocSetFactory.FOCUS.SPACE);

with very large numbers instead of -1, I get OpenBitSets back, which I
found surprising (I get p4 sets back when I pass in the -1 values).

Also, is there any way of creating a plain old DocIdSet out of an
OrDocIdSet or AndDocIdSet, so I don't have to carry around the internal
ArrayList objects?

I couldn't see any way of doing that in the code or docs, but I could
easily be missing something.

regards,
Michael
