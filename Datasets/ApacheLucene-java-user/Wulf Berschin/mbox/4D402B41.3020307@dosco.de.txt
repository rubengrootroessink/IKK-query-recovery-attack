SUBJECT: Re: Highlight Wildcard Queries: Scores
DATE: 26 Jan 2011

Now I have the highlighted wildcards but obviously the scoring is lost. 
I see that a rewrite of the wildcard query produces a constant score 
query. I added
 
setMultiTermRewriteMethod(MultiTermQuery.SCORING_BOOLEAN_QUERY_REWRITE);

to my QueryParser instance but no effect. What's to be done now?
