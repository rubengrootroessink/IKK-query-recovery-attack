SUBJECT: RE: Highlight Wildcard Queries
DATE: 26 Jan 2011

Thank you Alexander and Uwe, for your help.

I read Marks explanation but it seems to me that his changes are not 
contained in Lucene-3.0.3.

So I commented out the rewrite, changed QueryTermScorer back to 
QueryScorer and now I got the wildcard queries highlighted again.
