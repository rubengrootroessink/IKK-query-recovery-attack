SUBJECT: PDF Highlighting using PDF Highlight File
DATE: 10 May 2011

Hi all,

in our Lucene 3.0.3-based web application when a user clicks on a hit 
link the targeted PDF should be opened in the browser with highlighted hits.

For this purpose using the Acrobat Highlight File (Parameter xml, see 
http://www.pdfbox.org/userguide/highlighting.html and 
http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/pdf/HighlightFileFormat.pdf) 
seems most reasonable to me.

Since the position to highlight are given by (page and) character 
offsets and Lucene uses offsets as well I think it could be easy (for 
more Lucene-skilled people than me) to create an Highlighter which 
produces this highlight file.

Does such a Highlighter already exists in the Lucene World?

If not could someone please point me the direction (e.g. where to hook 
into the existing (fast vector?) highlighter just to extract the offsets).

BTW: Luke gyve me the impression that Term Vectors are only stored when 
the field content is sored as well. Is that true?

Wulf
