Hallo Uwe,

yes, thanks for the hint, that sounds good, but it seems to me I would 
then need more fields for all our search modes:

Now we have the fields "contents" without stoppwords and with stemming 
and "contents-unstemmed" whithout stemming.

The search options are:
- whole word (search "contents", no asterisks are being added before search)
- exact match (search "contents-unstemmed", implies whole word)

When decomposition comes into play I will need a third field 
"contents-undecomposed" (sorry) to perform the whole word search. 
Furthermore the contents-unstemmed should not be decomposed as well.

Would you still prefer this approach?

Viele Grüße aus Heidelberg
Wulf
