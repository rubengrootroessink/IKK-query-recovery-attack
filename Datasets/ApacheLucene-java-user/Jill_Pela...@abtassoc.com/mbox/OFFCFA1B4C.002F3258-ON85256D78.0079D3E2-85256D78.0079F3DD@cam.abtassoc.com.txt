solved.

I was building the index incorrectly; the lucene code works just fine.

(you need to go to a subdirectory directly under webapps, and use .. as the
argument for the base of the index, I was using .. and doing it from
webapps (Or from luceneweb ) that's why I got the broken links.  but it
works now :)

when I run the web demo, all the links are formed with
luceneweb/ preceding them (the links are incorrect):

ie-- the links come out as:

http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/examples/foo.jsp

when it should be:

http://localhost:8080/examples/foo.jsp

and I'm using tomcat, btw.

(I sent this earlier along with a javacc question; which people did
answer....but then this part was ignored, so I'm resending it.....since the
above is the problem that I'm really trying to solve)

thanks
