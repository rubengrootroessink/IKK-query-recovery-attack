SUBJECT: broken links
DATE: 4 Aug 2003

when I run the web demo, all the links are formed with
luceneweb/ preceding them (the links are incorrect):

ie-- the links come out as:

http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/examples/foo.jsp

when it should be:

http://localhost:8080/examples/foo.jsp

and I'm using tomcat, btw.

(I sent this earlier along with a javacc question; which people did
answer....but then this part was ignored, so I'm resending it.....since the
above is the problem that I'm really trying to solve)

thanks
