SUBJECT: Re: AND instead OR for the search
DATE: 5 Aug 2003


so, I pasted in the code given in an earlier email:

QueryParser qp = new QueryParser("content", analyzer);
qp.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
query = qp.parse(queryString);


it compiles, but it can't find anything.

when I comment that out and put in the vanilla call to parse, then it works
fine (but with "OR") functionality.

I'm thinking the current fix (although cludgy)
is to prepend each word in the query with a +

what am I doing wrong?  or is this a bug?
(I looked in bugzilla and couldn't find anything)

thanks in advance
