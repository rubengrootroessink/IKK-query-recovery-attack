SUBJECT: Multiple IndexReaders from the same Index Directory - issues with Locks / performance
DATE: 22 Dec 2008

For one of our projects - we were planning to have the system of 
multiple individual Lucene readers (just read-only instances and no 
writes whatsoever ) in different physical machines having their 
IndexReader-s warmed up from the same directory for the indices and 
working on the same. 

I was reading about locks (implemented as files) that Lucene uses 
internally. I am just curious if using multiple readers would be a 
feasible option here, all sharing the same index directory (across NFS / 
similar network mounted storage ) in terms of locking etc.

Would there be a performance hit ( ignoring the NFS related performance 
of course)  that would hinder multiple readers to serve query search 
simultaneously from the same set of index files.
