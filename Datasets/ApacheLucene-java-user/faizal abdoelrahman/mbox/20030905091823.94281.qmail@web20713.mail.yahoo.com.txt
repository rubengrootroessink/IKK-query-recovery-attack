SUBJECT: performance fuzzy queries slow
DATE: 5 Sep 2003

Hi,

Is there a way to speed up fuzzy queries.
I am measuring 1.5 seconds for a single fuzzy query
term
 vs all other types of queries (partial, literal,and
or) which take from 20-40 milliseconds.

I am using an index the size of 40MB querying 60.000
documents and one field containg some 200 words per
document. 

I already tried using a RAMdirectory.
Any comments, please...
