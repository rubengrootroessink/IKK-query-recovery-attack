SUBJECT: Handling a end user query from multiple indexes
DATE: 12 Jun 2006

Hi,

I'm new to lucene.  I'm unsure as to how to use the QueryParser to
execute a search, retrieved from an end user request.

For example, if an end user enters the query "new your"  and selects
"content" from a pull down list, I can easily translate that request
with the QueryParser as the following:

QueryParser query = new QueryParser("new york","content",new
StandardAnalizere());

But, I'm not sure what to do if the end user wants to enter a query
where he/she is search for "new york" from the "content" index  and
"weather" from the "description" index.  In a case like this, I have
two questions.

1) Is there a specific syntax the user must follow for entering such
search (i.e. new york:content and weather:description)?

2) How can the QueryParser be used if it always needs to know which
index to search from?

Thanks, in advance, for any help concerning this issue.
