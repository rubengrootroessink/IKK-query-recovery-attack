In http://www.lucene.com/publications.html you will find many answers to
your questions. The papers "An Object-Oriented Architecture for Text
Retrieval" and "Optimizations for Dynamic Inverted Index Maintenance"
will be especially helpful for your understanding of Lucene.

Hi again!

I should really reword my question as follows:

On which criteria are relevant documents chosen given a particular query

and

once retrieved, how are these documents ranked?

The techniques by which this is done will then determine what type of IR
model Lucene implements.

Thanks again!

Melissa
