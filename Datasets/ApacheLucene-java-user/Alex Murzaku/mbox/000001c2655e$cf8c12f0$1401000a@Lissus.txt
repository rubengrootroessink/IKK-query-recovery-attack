sorry about that - it was early in the morning...
my guess is that the analyzer you are passing to queryparser lowercases
"POST" but doesn't "POST*" or "POST?". could you try seeing the values
of your query when it is going to the searcher?

Hm.. a misunderstanding: i don't create the field with the value 
"POST?" i create it with "POST". "element:POST?" or "element:POST*" are 
the strings i send to the QueryParser for searching.
