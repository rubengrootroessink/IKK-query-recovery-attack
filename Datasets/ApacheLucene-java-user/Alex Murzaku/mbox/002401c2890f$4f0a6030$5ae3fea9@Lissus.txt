You could also do something with org.apache.lucene.analyzer.Token which
includes the following self-explanatory note:

  /** Set the position increment.  This determines the position of this
token
   * relative to the previous Token in a {@link TokenStream}, used in
phrase
   * searching.
   *
   * <p>The default value is one.
   *
   * <p>Some common uses for this are:<ul>
   *
   * <li>Set it to zero to put multiple terms in the same position.
This is
   * useful if, e.g., a word has multiple stems.  Searches for phrases
   * including either stem will match.  In this case, all but the first
stem's
   * increment should be set to zero: the increment of the first
instance
   * should be one.  Repeating a token with an increment of zero can
also be
   * used to boost the scores of matches on that token.
   *
   * <li>Set it to values greater than one to inhibit exact phrase
matches.
   * If, for example, one does not want phrases to match across removed
stop
   * words, then one could build a stop word filter that removes stop
words and
   * also sets the increment to the number of stop words removed before
each
   * non-stop word.  Then exact phrase queries will only match when the
terms
   * occur with no intervening stop words.
   *
   * </ul>
   * @see TermPositions
   */
  public void setPositionIncrement(int positionIncrement) {
    if (positionIncrement < 0)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException
        ("Increment must be positive: " + positionIncrement);
    this.positionIncrement = positionIncrement;
  }

.mt?  Malta?  That's rare! :)

A person called Clemens Marschner just submitted diffs for query
rewriting to lucene-dev list 1-2 weeks ago.  The diffs are not in CVS
yet, and they are a bit old now becase the code they were made against
has changed since they were made. You could either try applying them
yourself, of waiting until they get applied and then you could get a
nightly build.
