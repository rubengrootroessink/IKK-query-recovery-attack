I have read accounts of people in this list dealing with data sets
larger than what you describe. There is one thing that you said you
were considering: why not include both account and language in the
record. Unless planning to distribute them over several machines, I
wouldn't create artificially 100*10 indices. In you case, when
indexing, I would have instead 14 fields * 7 files * 10 segments open
files... I guess you already have resolved the problem of identifying
the language and you have built the corresponding analyzers which you
call when indexing or querying in a given language. Just a thought.
