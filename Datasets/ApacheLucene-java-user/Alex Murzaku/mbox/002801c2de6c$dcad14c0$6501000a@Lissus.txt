I would recommend you use the Snowball analyzers that Doug Cutting has
created on
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contributions/snowb
all/.

I don't think Doug has included any stop words, but, you could extract a
French list from http://download.lissus.com/snowball.zip (which is my
own version of Snowball Lucene analyzers).
