Lucene uses a variation of TF-TDF for the similarity score where the
document length is one of the factors. In the future you will be able
to modify scoring to your needs:

There might be more in the FAQ or in the mail archive. This is
something that has been discussed quite often. For example, you could
learn about the scoring mechanism in:
