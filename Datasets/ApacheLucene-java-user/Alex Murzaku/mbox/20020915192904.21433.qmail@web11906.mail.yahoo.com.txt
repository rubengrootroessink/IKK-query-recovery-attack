I haven't played with this, but I was under the impression that you
only need to worry that same data are indexed and queried using the
same analyzer. If the language is always included in the query (or
indexing) the data would be virtually partitioned by language. As for
the analyzer, you just need to know before submitting the query or
indexing what is the language you will be using and calling the
corresponding analyzer. Now, I don't want to get into too much detail
because I haven't tried this myself. It just seems logical...
