Hi PA,

I don't think a free standing NOT query works. The best way would be to
have a default value that is there for every record (some kind of
support field) which in turn can be combined with a NOT query, e.g.:
	+field:category -category:junk
which assumes you have a field called "field" and a field called
"category"...

Just my 25 Fils,

Alex

Hello,

Is there a simple way to query an index for documents which don't have 
a specific value (a keyword field in this instance). For example, I 
have documents with a category field and I would like to retrieve all 
the documents which don't have any category? Any way to express that as 
a Lucene query?

Thanks.

Cheers,

PA.
