SUBJECT: continue "ideo-logic" error in QueryParser and in BooleanQuery !
DATE: 17 Dec 2001

......
  Let we have 4 docs:
  doc1: "Love is life"
  doc2: "Java is pretty nice language"
  doc3: "C++ is powerful, but unsafe"
  doc4: "Onion and love sometimes are not compatoble"

  So, if search for "love OR NOT onion"

Here I was wrong:  (nevertheless it not solve described bug)
  result must be: doc1, doc2, doc3.
must be:
  result must be: doc1, doc2, doc3, doc4.  (ALL)
.....

Certainly I understand that people will not compose such complex
queries to search for ALL,
but lucene still do not finds all.
