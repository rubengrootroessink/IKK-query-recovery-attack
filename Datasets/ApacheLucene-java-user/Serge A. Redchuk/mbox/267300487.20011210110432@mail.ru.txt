Hello lucene-user,

  You can laugh, but it's not clear to me how to update/remove Field
  from Document (can only add) or even update/remove Document from
  Index.
  But I saw this magic words (update/remove) in this conference.
  And did NOT - in Lucene online documentation !!!

  Can anybody help me ??? I'll be very appreciate ...
