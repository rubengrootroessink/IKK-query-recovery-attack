SUBJECT: Get match exact location
DATE: 2 Nov 2009

Hello, everyone,

 

I´m using lucene to index some PDF documents an its working great. But Im
wondering if its possible to know some extra information of returned
matches by lucene.

 

I need to know the exact page where lucene has found every match, and it
will be get if I could get also the paragraph or some information to go
directly to the word(s) mathing.

 

I really appreciate any advice you could give me.

 

Best regards

 

Vicente Guardiola
