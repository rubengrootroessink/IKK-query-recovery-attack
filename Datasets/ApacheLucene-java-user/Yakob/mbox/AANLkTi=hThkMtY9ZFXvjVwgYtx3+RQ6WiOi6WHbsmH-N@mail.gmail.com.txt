ok after I started asking around in stackoverflow regarding this
problem. someone was kind enough to give an answer. well sort of.

private int index(File indexDir, File dataDir, String suffix) throws Exception {
    RAMDirectory ramDir = new RAMDirectory();          // 1
    IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter(
            ramDir,                                    // 2
            new SimpleAnalyzer(),
            true,
            IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.LIMITED);
    indexWriter.setUseCompoundFile(false);
    indexDirectory(indexWriter, dataDir, suffix);
    int numIndexed = indexWriter.maxDoc();
    indexWriter.optimize();
    indexWriter.close();

    Directory.copy(ramDir, FSDirectory.open(indexDir)); // 3

    return numIndexed;
}

what I am asking now is that the last line.

Directory.copy(ramDir, FSDirectory.open(indexDir)); // 3

the above line is wrong when I try to compile it, as lucene didn't
reserve any keyword "copy" in its class. so is there any workaround
this problem? what's the best solution to copy directory from
RAMDirectory to FSDirectory besides using copy? thanks.
