well yes your information is really helpful.I did find a topics and
qrels file that come in /src/lia/benchmark in the LIA2 sample code.
and the result did change slightly.but the precision and recall value
is still zero. I did also happen to use QueryDriver as you're
suggesting and the result is also the same as precision and recall is
still zero. I really need the value of precision and recall to be
anything but zero

I also put this question in stackoverflow so you can check this link
if you wanted to know more of my problem.

so any further advice would be helpful though :-)
