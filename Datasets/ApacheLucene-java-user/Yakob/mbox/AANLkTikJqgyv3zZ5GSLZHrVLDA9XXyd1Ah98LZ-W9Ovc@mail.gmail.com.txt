I think I'll go with the third option, I had found a class that can do
monitoring of certain directory, it's called Jnotify. I am planning of
inserting this class in my code above. can you tell me how to do that?
or maybe you can forward me to any link tutorials that explain how to
include Jnotify in a certain lucene source code. I had search about
Jnotify on google but the tutorials of Jnotify is still a few I guess.

thanks though.
