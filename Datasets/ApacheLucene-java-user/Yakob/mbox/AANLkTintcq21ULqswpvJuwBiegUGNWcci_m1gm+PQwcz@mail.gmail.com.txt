thanks for the suggestion. but I was also asking of what source code
should I filled in this line

if (condition for flushing memory to disk has been met) { ///THIS LINE
ramWriter.close();
fsWriter.addIndexes(Directory[] {ramDir});
ramWriter = new IndexWriter(ramDir, new SimpleAnalyzer(),
true);
}
}

I mean what source code that I can put after the IF statement so that
it will force the index to be flushed?
but anyway, did I put the ramwriter.close() correctly in the above
source code? you advised me to close ramwriter before the addIndexes()
right?

thanks for your help though. :-)
