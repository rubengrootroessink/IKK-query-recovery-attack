well when I read the ebook of "lucene in action" I came across this sentence.

"Searching is the process of looking up words in an index to find
documents where
they appear. The quality of a search is typically described using precision and
recall metrics. Recall measures how well the search system finds
relevant documents,
whereas precision measures how well the system filters out the irrelevant
documents."

I am just thinking of how to measure the precision and recall metrics
in lucene? I mean I just wanted to do an analysis of precision and
recall in my thesis that happened to use lucene as the framework. :-)
