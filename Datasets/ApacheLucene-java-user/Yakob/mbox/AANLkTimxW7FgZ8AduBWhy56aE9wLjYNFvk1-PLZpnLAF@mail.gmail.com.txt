SUBJECT: asking about incremental update
DATE: 19 Aug 2010

hello all,
you may remember me as the one who ask about how to understand lucene
in the previous email,but I have now been able to create a sample
application of lucene. I read the book and able to test it. which to
me is very great, as I am a new learner.

here is my proof.

http://jacobian.web.id/2010/08/09/how-to-use-lucene-part-1/

but now I am taking lucene to a higher level, I was tasked to create
an index that can update itself. it was called incremental update.
basically lucene will index the text file periodically and will store
the index first in memory then after a while it will be store on the
harddisk.

so anyone can give me any idea of how these things can be done? maybe
there is a sample application out there that I might have miss but can
be of great importance for me to learn about this incremental update.

any help would be greatly appreciated.
