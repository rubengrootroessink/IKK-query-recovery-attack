I did searched about this constructor and find that it's already been
deprecated.
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory,
org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer, boolean)

I am using lucene 3.0 now.can I really use this constructor or I
should try it first? btw I would appreciate if you gave me a code
sample though. thanks. :-)
