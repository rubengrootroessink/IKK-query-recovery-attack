SUBJECT: indexing relational table(s)
DATE: 11 May 2005

As sources of indexable text we always see HTML, XML, PDF, etc. but I 
have not seen much mention of relational tables as a source.  Anybody 
know why?

We have a database with 60,000 records in 6 tables and aproximately 15 
*text* fields per table.  Can we use lucene to index this with JDBC 
being used in an index gathering for loop?

Is there a better way?


Thanks,

Dick Hollenbeck
