I've been trying to use ant to rebuild lucene after toying with the  
source.  I am getting an error message I don't understand (though I  
am admittedly new to ant).  The error is below.  Any help is greatly  
appreciated.  Thank you.

Buildfile: build.xml

BUILD FAILED
/Users/michaeldodson/lucene-1.4.3/build.xml:2: Unexpected element "{} 
HTML" {antlib:org.apache.tools.ant}HTML
