SUBJECT: re: restart interrupted index
DATE: 16 Mar 2006

I'm relatively new to Lucene and I've been trying to index a large  
number of html files.  If my operation is interrupted the index  
appears to be corrupted.  I can no longer open it for searching with  
IndexSearcher (and no amount of toying with Luke's options seems to  
help if I try to browse the index by that route).  I would like to be  
able to restart an interrupted process.  Should I be able to do this?

Cheers,

Mike
