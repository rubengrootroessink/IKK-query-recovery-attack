SUBJECT: re: multiple indexes
DATE: 27 Apr 2006

I know it is possible to query against multiple indexes, but is it  
possible to create a composite query in which part of the query is  
against one index and part is against another (similar to querying  
against a default and a second field)?

for example  index1:query1 AND index2:query2

I thought about querying them separately and combining the scores but  
would like to use lucene's scoring formula all the way through for  
consistency and for evaluation purposes.

Thanks,

Mike D
