The norms are modded so each norm value is stored as 4 byte instead of 1 byte, this modification
is using more memory. But anyway the hw we are running on are
2x 8 cpu hp servers with 16 gig ram in each of them. 

We are scaling the index on daterange (and the ranking is modified to sort by date) 

Ex:
2007-01 - 2007-06  > ix 1
2007-07 - 2007-12 > ix 2

Each index is hosted in a separate hosting application and we have a layer infront of all
indexes to merge the results. So it is our own "search engine" we tried solr but I didn't
really liked it + we had to do some modifications to support the business. 

Since we are running 32 bit OS (we are going to use 64 bit soon it will be interesting) on
windows with pae each process can consume just 2-2.5gb memory so we are having a lot of indexes
on the same machine. 

We did this some years ago and we run it 24/7 without any failure, indexing approx 200-300k
new articles every day. 


Any way... We really need to find a good api / some one that knows how to add inverted searching
to lucene. 

/Regards
Marcus

Don't have any info to add, but out of curiosity, what kind of setup are you
using to host the 300 mil archive? Is the index distributed? Single machine?
Solr?

Thanks,

Mark
