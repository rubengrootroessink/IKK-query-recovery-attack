SUBJECT: Inverted search / Search on profilenet
DATE: 16 Jan 2008

Hi again, 

 

Today we are hosting a 300 million large search index without any
problems in a lucene environment, with just some customization in the
lucene api for ranking etc... 

 

So we are really satisfied with lucene. 

 

We also have the demands to search with documents on profiles we are
currently using verity (autonomy) for this, where we store the profiles
in the index and are using the document as query. 

The verity api we are using seems to have some internal threading
problems (race conditions) so we need to find another way to perform
those kind of searches. 

 

Does anybody have any ideas of any api that could do this for us? Any
ideas on how lucene could be modified to do this kind of searches?

 

The volumes are around 300k full length articles distributed some what
evenly over a 24h period on a 50 k profilenet.

 

 

/Mvh

Marcus
