SUBJECT: SV: SV: Integrating dynamic data into Lucene search/ranking
DATE: 17 Jan 2008

In our solution we used a RAMDir for the newest incoming articles and a FSDir for older ones.
Then we had a limit for the ramdir  like 10.000 documents when that limit were hit we used
mergesegments to move the content from ramdir -> fsdir, actually we had to do some modification
in the mergesegment method since it always seemed to do an optimize on the index after the
merge, I have the code if u want it.

If you use RAMDir + FSDir you can use 2 indexserchers and one multisearcher on top. The indexsearcher
that uses the small RAMDir can be rebinded quite often.

The conventional wisdom is to use RAMDirectory in such scenarios. I.e. 
you commit frequent updates to a RAMDirectory and frequently reopen its 
Searcher (which should be fast). Periodically, merge the RAMDirectory 
index with your on-disk index - you need to open a new IndexSearcher in 
the background, warm it up with the latest N queries, and when it's 
ready you swap searchers, i.e. you close the old one, purge the 
RAMDirectory (since it was synced to the on-disk index), and start using 
the new IndexSearcher.

And again, start accumulating new docs in the RAMDirectory, etc, etc ...
