Yes a profilenet is what Mark describes.

In our Verity profilenet we got ~50.000 profiles (queries) the performance is fine around
20-25 documents / second. 

>From what we can tell the matches are accurate unfortunately I don't have any ideas on
how verity does this under the hood so I don't know if there is any approximation involved.
We do however get information about the each query that hits such as score and words (with
their position within the document).

We need this kind of functionality since we are monitoring the incoming documents for our
customers.

MoreLikeThis:
I get a feeling that it would be very hard to do this using this kind of query, how do I index
the queries with operators such as NOT, NEAR and WildCard?

Taxonomy/Classification
I'm totally lost here ;) Any one that knows what to look for in this case?

MemoryIndex:
We have ran benchmarks using this technique it wasn't enough, if I recall we could run like
10.000 profiles with good performance. And as you say it doesn't scale well at all.

Verity, autonomy, whatever, has a what they call a reverse query system 
called profilenet. A profile is just a query (or I guess more than one 
query?) and you can setup a bunch of them. Then you supply the document 
and you will get the matching queries as well as a score. They say its 
the opposite of doing a search with a query and getting back docs. 
Instead you do a search with a doc and get back these queries. They 
claim it can be used for things like taxonomy/classification among other 
things. I don't know how true this is to a real reverse query system as 
that would seem to be kind of slow -- my guess is its a bit of an 
approximation.
