SUBJECT: Getting Field details on a hit
DATE: 12 Mar 2009


Hello Experts,

I am using a MultiFieldQueryParser to search my index.  The index has been
set up with the following structure:

design: [designcode]
att1: [att1Value]
att2: [att2Value]
...
attn: [attnValue]

Where the attvalues all correspond to the designcode. 

The search works well, and it returns a number of designs with matching
criteria.  However, I also need to be able to return details of which field
a 'hit' occured on, to make the search meaningful.  Any ideas how to do
this??

Many Thanks in advance

Nick Hirst
