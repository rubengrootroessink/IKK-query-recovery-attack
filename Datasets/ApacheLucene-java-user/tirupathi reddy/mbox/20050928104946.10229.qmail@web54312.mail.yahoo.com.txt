SUBJECT: Some error while searching the index
DATE: 28 Sep 2005

Hello,
 
   While searching if I enter one or two characters. It founds lot of results as I can say
almost all and at that time it is giving the following error.
 
8028 total matching documents
 caught a class org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses
 with message: null
 
And search is some what slower if I have some 15000 documents indexed and size of the index
is around 100mb.
 
How can I solve these problems.
 
Thanx,
MTREDDY
