SUBJECT: Small problem in searching
DATE: 15 Sep 2005

Hi guys,
 
    I have some problem while searching using Lucene. Say I have some thing like "tirupathireddy"
 or "venkatreddy" in the index. When i search for string "reddy" I have to get those things
(i.e. "tirupathireddy"   and  "venkatreddy"). I have read in Query syntax of Lucene  that
* will not be given at the starting of the search string. SO how can I achiev that. I am in
very much need of that. So please help me out.
 
 
  WIth Regards,
TirupatiReddy Manyam.
