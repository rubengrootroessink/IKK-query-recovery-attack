SUBJECT: Re: Small problem in searching
DATE: 16 Sep 2005

Hello,
 
     I read the following statement :
Note: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.

in this page:  http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html

So that's why I thought of that. And at present I am using QueryParser. So it is giving error
for *reddy*. I am very new to this. And I have to submit my application by next week. So please
help me how can I use WildcardQuery method instead of QueryParser.
 
At this time I have query like:  id:manyam* AND author:*reddy* OR title:"measurement procedure".
 
and I am passing it to QueryParser as follows
 
query = QueryParser.parse(query1,"ALL",analyzer);
 
and calling the search method of Searcher class as follows
 
Hits hits = searcher.search(query);
 
So can u please help me to modify this code to use WildcardQuery so that I can use *reddy*.
 
  Thanx,
MTREDDY
