SUBJECT: Re: Boolean Search In Lucene
DATE: 3 Jun 2011

The Boolean operators provided basically map to MUST (+), SHOULD (no
symbol) and NOT (-)

If we write query like (jakarta AND apache) OR website what happen?
>> It will return results with documents having Jakarta & Apache or Website

Is it possible that we can get the document that contains 'jakarta'
AND 'apache'. Also document may contain 'website'?
>> +jakarta + apache website should do the trick

Is it possible that if the document do not contains 'jakarta' AND
'apache', but contains 'website', the search result will give the
result for document that contains 'website'?
>> something like this should work -(+jakarta +apache) +website

Another example:

If you search for "(a AND b)" it will return x results
If you search for "c" it will return y results
If you search for "(a and b) or c" the number of results cannot be
less than the larger of x or y. But this is not happening. Please help
how should I proceed to implement this?
>> Should not happen, you may just want to check the query that got executed.

Jayendra
