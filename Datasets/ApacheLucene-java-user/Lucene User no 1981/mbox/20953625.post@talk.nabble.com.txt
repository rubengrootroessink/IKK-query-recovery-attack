SUBJECT: Spell check of a large text
DATE: 11 Dec 2008


Hi,

the problem is as follows: there is a text, ca. 30kb, it has to be
spellchecked automatically, there is no manual intervention, no suggestions
needed. All I would like to achieve is a simple check if there are any
problems with the spelling or not. It has to be rather fast cause there are
tons of docs a minute going thru the system. Solutions like
SpellChecker.exists() don't really apply. Additionally, spelling errors
could be highlighted - haven't really found any reasonable way of leveraging
Highlighter for that task. 

Does anyone have any idea how this problem can be addressed with Lucene?

Regards,
Mac
