SUBJECT: Re: Spell check of a large text
DATE: 12 Dec 2008


Grant,

It's definitely dictionary based spell checker. A bit fleshing out, 
currently the document gets indexed and then it's analysed (bad words, 
repetitions etc), spell check - no corrections - would be yet another 
step in the process. It's all read-only stuff, the document content is 
not modified, it's just tagged accordingly.
That said, I kind of like your idea, I mean token filter looks like the 
good candidate. As of Lazzy, is it any different than Lucene 
SpellChecker (ngram based)? what really matters here is not the 
accuracy (decent but not exceptional - there is a manual double- check 
of tagged docs anyway), what matters most is performance and ease of 
integration. Any grammar check is absolutely immaterial.
About that payload idea, I can only work with a token in a filter. I 
could attach something and spit it out, but what would be that 
something? It would have to be searchable I assume, otherwise I could 
perform the check without filter, out of index. If it's searchable 
then, apart from querying, I could perhaps make highlighter work with 
it nicely.

Thx,
Mac
