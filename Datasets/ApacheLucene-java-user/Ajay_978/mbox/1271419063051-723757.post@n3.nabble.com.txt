SUBJECT: Payload Example for Lucene 3.0.0
DATE: 16 Apr 2010


Hi,
I would like to have example of adding payload for lucene 3.0. I found an
example on internet which uses BoostingTermQuery but I couldn't find this
class in Lucene 3.0.0 jar and I was wondering if someone knows the
workaround or where can I find. If someone can post an example that will be
very helpful.

Thanks
Ajay
