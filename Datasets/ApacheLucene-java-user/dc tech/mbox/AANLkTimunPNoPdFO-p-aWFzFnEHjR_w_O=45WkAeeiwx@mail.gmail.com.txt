SUBJECT: Re: creating tag cloud (with faceted search?) for search result	(filter)
DATE: 3 Aug 2010

I assume that you are
- building your own UI
- and have some specific fields you want to show in a tag cloud?

A generic tag cloud of all terms will not be very helpful as all the
common words will dominate the tag cloud. What you want is to use some
specific fields ie metadata for generating the tag cloud.

One approach is to take all the interesting fields, get facets for
them (solr does this out of the box), combine and then generate the
tag cloud. Alternatively, you can create a megafield and use that for
faceting directly. On click, you then issue a simple filter query.
