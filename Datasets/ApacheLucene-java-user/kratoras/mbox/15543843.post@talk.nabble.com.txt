SUBJECT: Problem using Lucene on Ubuntu
DATE: 18 Feb 2008


Hello!
I ve written a sample application which indexes documents written in Greek
using the GreekAnalyzer and search these documents with both greek and
english words. Though on Windows the searching returns correct results, if i
try it on Ubuntu the searching does not return any results for any greek
word but it continues to search for english words. Could it be a problem of
fonts in my ubuntu or what?Greek fonts are installed though. 

Thanks for any answers in advance
