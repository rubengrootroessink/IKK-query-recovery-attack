SUBJECT: Re: Problem using Lucene on Ubuntu
DATE: 18 Feb 2008


Actually what i figured out just now is that the problem is on the indexing
part. A document with a 15MB size is transformed in a 23MB index which is
not normal since on windows for the same document the index is 3MB. For the
indexing i use:
writer = new IndexWriter(index, new GreekAnalyzer(), !index.exists());
and to add documents:
doc.add(new
Field("contents",content,Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED));

where "content" is a string with the content of the document. Should i
convert this string to UTF-8 using getBytes before i write it to the index??
