SUBJECT: Can use Lucene be used for this
DATE: 12 Nov 2003

Hi,
 
  I have a huge data file with 4 gb data. The data in the file never changes. 
 
The format of the file is as follows:
 
Col1,col2,col3,Value
----------------------------
abababc,xyzzzzzza,ccccc,100
ababadx,xyz,adfdfd,101
 
I need to retrieve the value with simple queries on the data like:
select  value where col1 like %ab&, col2 like %aa% and col3 sounds like aaaa;
 
Is Lucene suitable for doing this kind of tasks? I am using DB currently for this. Wondering
whether Lucene can be used for this.
 
Thanks,
Kumar.
