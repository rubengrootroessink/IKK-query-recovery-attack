Hi Karl,

It is a little bit tricky - but when you get the idea it is not that bad...

I had the same problem with the danish characters. I made changes TOKEN
definition in the "Token Definitions" section of the file "QueryParser.jj"
and that actually solved the problem. One minor detail is that you have to
rebuild the jar file with ANT. (See build.txt for instructions)

I guess that solves your problem,
Regards,
/ Jonas

there must be something seriously broken with the queryparse code.

if a query starts with ø/æ/å (&oslash;, &oaelig;, &aring;) then an exception
in the queryparser occurs.

org.apache.lucene.queryParser.TokenMgrError: Lexical error at line 1, column
1.  Encountered: "\u00c3" (195), after : ""
	at
org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParserTokenManager.getNextToken(Unknown
Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.jj_ntk(Unknown Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.Modifiers(Unknown
Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.Query(Unknown Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.parse(Unknown Source)
	at org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.parse(Unknown Source)

but if the query contains ø/æ/å (&oslash;, &oaelig;, &aring;) then it is
translated wrongly into the swedish/german &auml; regardless of what
character it was.

if someone could point me to where to start I could try to find the problem
because I guess it is errorous unicode translation...
