I see the following on their website...

Q. What does it cost to integrate InfoWrangler™ with my application?
A. If you are a developer and want to give users of your application the
benefit of InfoWrangler™ then you can download the SDK for free and
integrate it with your application at no cost. There is no license fee to
you the developer to integrate with InfoWrangler™.

Q. Who pays for InfoWrangler™?
A. InfoWrangler™ is paid for by the end user. This allows developers the
opportunity to try our technology in their own products, before distributing
them to clients.

But I don't understand. Do you have any insight into the product pricing?
