I've found that pulling information from a central source is simpler than
pushing information. When information is pushing, there is much
administration on the central server to track the recipient machines. It
seems like servers are added and dropped from the push list. Additionally,
you need to account for servers that stop responding. When information is
pulled from the central source, these issues of coordination are eliminated.
