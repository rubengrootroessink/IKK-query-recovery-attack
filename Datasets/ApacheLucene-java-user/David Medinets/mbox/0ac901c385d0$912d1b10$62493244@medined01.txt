There may be no legal objection, but is it considered a good idea to
appropriate the namespace? If you don't own a domain and your name isn't
common, then I'd suggest using a package such as
org.pierrick.brihaye.aramorph. Alternatively you could be more creative. As
far as I know, there are no restrictions on package names except those
imposed on directory names. So you don't need to start with 'org' or 'com'.
How about coder.pierrick.brihaye.aramorph?
