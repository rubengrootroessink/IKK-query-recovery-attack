I typically put all of my open-source code on my blog
(http://www.codebits.com) which is indexed by Google whenever I make an
entry. So that makes it relatively easy to find. The recursiveness of using
a search engine to find search engine code appeals to me.

I think there is also a lucene sandbox where your code can potentially be
stored.
