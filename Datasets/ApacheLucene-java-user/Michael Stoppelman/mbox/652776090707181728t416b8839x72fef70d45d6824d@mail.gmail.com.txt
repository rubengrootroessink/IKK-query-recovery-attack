SUBJECT: StandardTokenizer is slowing down highlighting a lot
DATE: 19 Jul 2007

Hi all,

I was tracking down slowness in the contrib highlighter code and it seems
the seemingly simple tokenStream.next() is the culprit.
I've seen multiple posts about this being a possible cause. Has anyone
looked into how to speed up StandardTokenizer? For my
documents it's taking about 70ms per document that's a big ugh! I was
thinking I might just cache the TermVectors in memory if
that will be faster. Anyone have another approach to solving this problem?
