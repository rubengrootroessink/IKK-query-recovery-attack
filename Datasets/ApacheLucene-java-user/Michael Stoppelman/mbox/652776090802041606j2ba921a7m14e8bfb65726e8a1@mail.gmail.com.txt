SUBJECT: Re: Boosting using an external data source
DATE: 5 Feb 2008

If anyone was wondering how I dealt with this I ended up extending the
TermQuery class and overridding the tf() and idf() functions
like in FuzzyLikeThisQuery.

See FuzzyTermQuery for how they use the SimilarityDelegator object:
contrib/queries/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/FuzzyLikeThisQuery.java
