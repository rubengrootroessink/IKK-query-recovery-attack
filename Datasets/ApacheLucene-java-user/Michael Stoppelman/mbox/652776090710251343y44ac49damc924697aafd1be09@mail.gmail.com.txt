SUBJECT: Speeding up highlighting by storing a cached TokenStream
DATE: 25 Oct 2007

Most of the time the highlighting uses is in getting the next token from the
analyzer (tokenStream.next()). I'm wondering how I can access the tokens
that
are stored in lucene (or store another copy of the TokenStream seperately)
and send a pre-tokenized TokenStream to the highlighter so next() is speedy.

Anyone care to suggest an approach to making this faster?
