SUBJECT: How to promote an unstemmed match over a stemmed match in an index that's stemmed...
DATE: 11 Feb 2008

Hi all,
I've got an index with tokens that are stemmed. Sometimes I really need to
boost the unstemmed
version of a query word to get the most relevant documents.

Example:
Query: [olives].

I don't want to match documents with the words: oliver, oliver's, etc...

Since I'm stemming when creating the index is there a way to store both
versions (stemmed/unstemmed) with
setIncrementPosition()? Is that the correct way to deal with this? I was
reading old archives and this didn't seem
to be a great way decision since it breaks PhraseQuery [1].

It seems like it would be useful if at query scoring time if I could see the
original string values of the tokens in this case
at least.

Thanks in advance,

-M
