Sumit,

The class you'll end up subclassing from would be:
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc//org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.htmlor
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc//org/apache/lucene/search/DefaultSimilarity.html

On an IndexSearcher you can setSimilarity() class that you want to use for
scoring, see:
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc//org/apache/lucene/search/IndexSearcher.html
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc//org/apache/lucene/search/Searcher.html#setSimilarity(org.apache.lucene.search.Similarity)

Does that help?
