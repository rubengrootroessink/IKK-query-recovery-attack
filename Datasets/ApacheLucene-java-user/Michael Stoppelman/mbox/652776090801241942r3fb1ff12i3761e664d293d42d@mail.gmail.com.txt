SUBJECT: Threads blocking on isDeleted when swapping indices for a very long time...
DATE: 25 Jan 2008

Hi all,

I've been tracking down a problem happening in our production environment.
When we switch an index after doing deletes & adds, running some searches,
and finally changing the pointer
from old index to new all the threads start stacking up all waiting on
isDeleted(). The threads seem to finish, they just get really slow taking up
to 30 - 60 seconds.

The problem has been discussed here before in 2005:

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to work around this?

-M
