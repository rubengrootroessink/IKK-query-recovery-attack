SUBJECT: Re: Confidence scores at search time
DATE: 28 Feb 2009

I was just reading the Similarity javadocs (
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html#formula_queryNorm)
and I thought this might be relevant to your issue.

>From the javadoc:
*queryNorm(q) * is a normalizing factor used to make scores between queries
comparable. This factor does not affect document ranking (since all ranked
documents are multiplied by the same factor), but rather just attempts to
make scores from different queries (or even different indexes) comparable.
This is a search time factor computed by the Similarity in effect at search
time.
