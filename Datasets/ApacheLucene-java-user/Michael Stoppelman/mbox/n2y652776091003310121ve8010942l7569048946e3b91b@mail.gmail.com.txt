Hi all,

I was wondering why the InstantiatedIndex gets very slow as the number of
documents increases in the index. I've been looking at the source and have
only found comments saying "it's slow" when the index is big but not why. Do
folks just run out of memory or something deeper?

Thanks for the help,
M
