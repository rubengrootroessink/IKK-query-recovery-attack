SUBJECT: Re: Lucene 2.0.0 index being zeroed out by Lucene 2.2.0.
DATE: 22 Jun 2007

Seems like the lucene 2.0.0 created a file <INDEX_DIR>/segments. In
2.2.0the new segments file has the following convention
<INDEX_DIR>/segments_<NUMBER>. Our codebase had some logic that depended on
this file being named consistently.
It seems like the bug was on my end, my apologies.
