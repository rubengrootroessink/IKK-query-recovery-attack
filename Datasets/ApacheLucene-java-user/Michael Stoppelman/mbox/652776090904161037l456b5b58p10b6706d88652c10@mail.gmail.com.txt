Same here. I'm interested in this answer too... If you're serving a lot of
traffic and need to highlight docs you need to keep
everything in memory. That's my lesson to share with the world.

Yes, this works. The most important thing if you're serving lots of traffic
is to have a master indexing box (that doesn't allow reading) and distribute
those copies to the slaves that are readonly. Also, when you copy your
indices out to slaves and the memory on them isn't twice as big as your
index you can use rsync w/ the fadvise patch (
http://insights.oetiker.ch/linux/fadvise.html) so the current index isn't
evicted from the disk cache (in linux).

I'm not sure about the combining of results, maybe this will help
