SUBJECT: Zilverline webapplication
DATE: 30 Apr 2004

All,

For those that are interested, I've created a web application based on 
lucene that's ready to roll, and can be simply dropped in a Servlet 
Engine. It runs out of the box, doing PDF, WORD, HTML. TXT, and can (on 
WIndows for now) index zip, rart, and CHM.  I've just put up a website 
for it, and will issue the src as GPL soon later, if people are interested.

Please take look at zilverline.org, and have a swing at the war.

cheers,

   Michael Franken
