Hi,

Daniel's suggestions was quite correct. Is the "/" suposed to be turned into a whitespace?
In that case, how do I stop it? I do wish to search for the entire exact word "Blankett/Mall".

Regards,
Björn

I suggest you use toString() on the parsed query. The "/" is probably interpreted like a whitespace
and you may end up with a query "documenttype:blankett mall", i.e. "mall" searched in the
default field, not in documenttype.

If that doesn't help you could create a small test case (index and search just one document)
and post that to the list.

Regards
 Daniel
