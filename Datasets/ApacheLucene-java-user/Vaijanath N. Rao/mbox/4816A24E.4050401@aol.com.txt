Hi all,

How about adding hadoop support for distributed indexing. If required I 
can start working on this. If Hadoop is the fesiable option.

Also what other technique one can think for doing distributed Indexing. 
Currently I am planning on extending the SolrJ to keep a map of where 
the document has gone and trying to get a distibuted Indexing.

--Thanks and Regards
Vaijanath
