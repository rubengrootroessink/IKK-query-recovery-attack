SUBJECT: AW: Poor Lucene Ranking for Short Text
DATE: 24 Dec 2004

Hi Kevin,

Seem like you have some knowledge about the lenghtNorm value in Lucene.
Comparing it to the formula in "Modern Information Retrieval" does it sum up
the denominator sqrt((sum(tf_d*idf_t)²)) * sqrt((sum(tf_q*idf_t)²))

Just a quick note is ok.

Besides that could you invite me to rojo. There beta status seem to be quite
long.

Thanks
Michael
