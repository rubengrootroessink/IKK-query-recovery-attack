hi, i would download the 1.9 version as your starting fresh (unless you
need the 1.4.3 version for some reason), what is your web application?
and what should lucene be doing when intergrated with your web app?

there is a simple example in the binary 1.9 download, /src/jsp, look at
"results.jsp", its a basic example of a search page (but i guess your
need a Context class to hold the IndexSearcher for every
instance/execution of lucene in your web app) that should demostrate an
idea of how it works

I would recommend Lucene In Action, http://lucenebook.com

regards,
