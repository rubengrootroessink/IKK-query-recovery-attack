Hi,

Lucene uses stemmer for supporting multilingualism.The stemming
algorthim differs from language to language.
Can you tell me how many different types of stemmer available & which
stemmer lucene supports.I believe it supports snowball stemmer.I have
downloaded the snowball stemmer .it supports few languages.The source
files are in Core 'C' language.I have compiled C file using C
compiler.Now I want to know how Snowball can be implemented in lucene

Thanks

First steps are to familiarize yourself with just what exactly Lucene
is.  You don't "deploy" Lucene, per se.  It simply(!) a library, a JAR
in Java terms.  Lucene itself becomes integrated into your application
just like any other 3rd party library.

I recommend you begin by reading any of the freely available articles
online - http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/Resources - and  the
wonderful (hey, even I think so ;) "Lucene in Action" book.
