Hi Haritha

Hope the following helps:

Build Lucene Core from SVN

Download the lucene Subversion repository from:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk

Note: The CVS repository is still accessible but is out of date.

I downloaded to:
C:\src\lucene-svn\

To build (using ANT):
cd C:\src\lucene-svn\
ant

The following jar file is produced:
C:\src\lucene-svn\build\lucene-core-1.9-rc1-dev.jar

I have just built lucene using these instructions on my workstation and
it builds without any errors.
Patrick
