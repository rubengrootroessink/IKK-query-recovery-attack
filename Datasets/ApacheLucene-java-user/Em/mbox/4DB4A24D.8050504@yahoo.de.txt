Hi Lars,

in short, without completly reading through your code, I suggest you to
use Solr. Solr is better for beginners like you with little experience
in Lucene and Java and gives you many built-in options, from caches to
facets - out of the box.

Everything you need to use Solr is a Servlet-container (I prefer Tomcat
over Jetty for production, but some people even say that Jetty is okay)
and that's it.

Regards,
Em
