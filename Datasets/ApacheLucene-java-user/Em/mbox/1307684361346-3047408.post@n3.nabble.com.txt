SUBJECT: Re: Telling query-time QueryParser how to work by a TokenFilter
DATE: 10 Jun 2011

Hi list,

if one read line 470 and the following (getFieldQuery) of the queryParser
class, one can see, how some attributes are already used to parse the
query-string correctly. At the moment, I see almost no chance to implement
the wanted behaviour without doing copy & paste on the code for an own
parse()-method.

Please, let me know if you see some other possibilities.

Regards,
Em
