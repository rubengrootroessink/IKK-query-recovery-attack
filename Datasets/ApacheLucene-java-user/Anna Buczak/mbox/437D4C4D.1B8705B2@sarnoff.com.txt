SUBJECT: TermFreqVector
DATE: 18 Nov 2005

I have indexed a set of documents that do not have fields.  I want to
use the getTermFreqVector method from IndexReader to get the
frequencies.  However when I do that as:

TermFreqVector[] z = ir.getTermFreqVectors(0);

z is null.  So I can't get the frequency vectors.

Help will be very much appreciated.

Anna
