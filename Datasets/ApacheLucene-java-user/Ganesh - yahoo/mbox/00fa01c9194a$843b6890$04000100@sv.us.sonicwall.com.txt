My index is growing by 1 million records per day. How much memory do i need 
to increase.

What kind of sorting algorithm being used in Lucene. Is this efficient 
enough to handle millions of records.

Whether we could do sorting using our own algorithm?

Regards
Ganesh

Increase memory.

Lucene uses FieldCache for sorting on non-tokenized field and tries to
maintain fields from all your 4 millions documents, even if you need
to sort only 4000 docs.
