which one will be the best to use as storage server. Lucene or Jackrabbit.

My requirement is to provide support to
1) Archive the documents
2) Do full text search on the documents.
3) Do backup the index store and archive store. [periodical basis]
4) Remove the documents after certain period [rentention policy]

Whether Lucene could be used as archival store. Most of them in this mailing 
list said 'yes'. If so going for separate database to archive the data and 
separate database to index it, will be better option or one database to be 
used as archive and index.

One more idea from this list is to use Jackrabbit / JDBM / My SQL to archive 
the data. Which will be the best?

I am in desiging phase and i have time to explore and prototype any other 
products. Please do suggest me a good one.

Regards
Ganesh
