SUBJECT: Exception while doing sorting
DATE: 17 Sep 2008

Hello all,

I am have indexed more than 4 million documents. My query fetches 300,000 
hits. If i perform sorting on any field, then tomcat reports out of memory 
exception.
Sometimes the query results may be around 1000, but sorting on any field 
might take more than 30 - 50 secs.

I don't know what's going wrong.

My index searcher is static object and it is getting refreshed every minute. 
JSP pages directly calls the index searcher object and performs search.

Regards
Ganesh
