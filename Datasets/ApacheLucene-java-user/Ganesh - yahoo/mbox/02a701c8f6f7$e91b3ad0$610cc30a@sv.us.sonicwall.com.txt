SUBJECT: Per user data store
DATE: 5 Aug 2008

Hello all,

Documents coressponding to multiple users are to be indexed. Each user is going to search
only his documents. Only Administrator could search all users data.

Is it good to have one database for each User or to have only one database for all Users?
Which will be better? 

My opinion is to have one database for all users and to have field 'Username'. Using this
field data will get filtered out and the search results will be served to the User. In this
approach, whether Username should be part of boolean query or TermFilter will be the better
approach?

One more technical question: Username field will have repeated entry of the user names. Whether
the space for this field will be consumped for every document / record or the data will be
tokenzied and a pointer to the document will be stored.

Regards
Ganesh
