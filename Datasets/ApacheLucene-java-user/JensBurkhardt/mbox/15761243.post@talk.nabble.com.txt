SUBJECT: MultiFieldQueryParser - BooleanClause.Occur
DATE: 29 Feb 2008


Hey everybody,

I read that it's possible to generate a query like:

(title:term1 OR author:term1) AND (title:term2 OR author:term2)

and so on. I also read that BooleanClause.Occur should help me handle this
problem.
But i have to admit that i totally don't understand how to use it.
If someone can explain or has a link to an explanation, this would be
terrific

Thanks and best regards

Jens Burkhardt
