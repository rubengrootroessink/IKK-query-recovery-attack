SUBJECT: combine wildcard and phrase query
DATE: 6 Mar 2008


hey everybody,

I'm wondering if it's possible to combine wildcards and phrase query. 

For example "term1 term*"

I know that the documentation says "Lucene supports single and multiple
character wildcard searches within single terms (not within phrase queries)"
but maybe someone has had the same problem and found a solution.

Thanks for your help
