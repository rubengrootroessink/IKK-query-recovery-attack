SUBJECT: explain() - fieldnorm
DATE: 27 Feb 2008


Hey everybody,

As my subject is telling, i have a little problem with analyzing the
explain() output.
I know, that the fieldnorm value consists out of "documentboost, fieldboost
and lengthNorm". 
Is is possible to recieve the single values? I know that they are multiplied
while indexing but
can they be stored so that i can read them when i analyze my search?
The Problem is, that i have 2 Documents I want to compare but the only
difference is the fieldnorm value
and i don't know which value exactly makes this difference.

Best regards
Jens Burkhardt
