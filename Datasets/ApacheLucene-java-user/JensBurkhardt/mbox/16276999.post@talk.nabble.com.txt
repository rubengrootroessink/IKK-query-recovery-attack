SUBJECT: Re: explain() - fieldnorm
DATE: 25 Mar 2008


another problem just occurred. These are the results from explain() :

0.27576536 = (MATCH) product of:
  0.827296 = (MATCH) sum of:
    0.827296 = (MATCH) sum of:
      0.24544832 = (MATCH) weight(ti:genetik in 1849319), product of:
        0.015469407 = queryWeight(ti:genetik), product of:
          10.577795 = idf(docFreq=270)
          0.0014624415 = queryNorm
        15.866693 = (MATCH) fieldWeight(ti:genetik in 1849319), product of:
          1.0 = tf(termFreq(ti:genetik)=1)
          10.577795 = idf(docFreq=270)
          1.5 = fieldNorm(field=ti, doc=1849319)
      0.58184767 = (MATCH) weight(au:knippers in 1849319), product of:

          13.695007 = idf(docFreq=11)
          1.5 = fieldNorm(field=au, doc=1849319)
  0.33333334 = coord(1/3)

          1.5 = fieldNorm(field=au, doc=3221603)
  0.33333334 = coord(1/3)

As you can see, both are exactly the same. The thing i don't understand is,
that the two documents have different documentboosts (the first one got an
boost of 1.62 , the second of 1.65) - the boosts are different because the
two books got different publication years - but explain() tells me that my
fieldNorm value is 1.5.
While indexing i use a new similarity class where lengthNorm just returns 1,
so the field length does not matter anymore.
