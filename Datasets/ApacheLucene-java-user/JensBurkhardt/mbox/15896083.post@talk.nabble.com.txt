SUBJECT: Re: combine wildcard and phrase query
DATE: 7 Mar 2008


hi again,

referring to my second issue, i've got another question. I mean, this field
thing works pretty well but:
My fields look like:
signature: LA A 100
signature: LA A 201
signature: LA A 202
signature: LA B 200
signature: LC B 300
Now i use getFields and search them.
Let's assume i'm searching for a signature like "LA B 200". If i use a
phrase query, no problem. I search all the fields and the only if the field
value and query exactly match, i get a hit.
But what if you want to use wildcards and search for something like LA A
20*. Now all the LA signatures will be in my results even if i just want two
of them. The problems are the blanks but i have no idea how this could work.

Thanks and have a nice evening

Jens
