Hello again,

Thanks for your immediate response. As i understand, the only way to boost
the values is on query side, right?
The Problem is, that i need to boost field values. Okay, some more details:
I need it for a library. The string in the field i'm working with is
something like "Title author year_of_publication some_catchwords" and so on.
It's like on big String.
This field is called "Free-Text" so the query can something like "author AND
title".
And that's the point, the order of the search terms is arbitrary so i don't
know what i do boost in the field. If i want to boost the title i need to
boost the specific value in the Free-Text field.
If I'm wrong and i can handle this problem with using payload, could someone
please explain it cause i don't understand how to use payload on index side.

Best regards
Jens
