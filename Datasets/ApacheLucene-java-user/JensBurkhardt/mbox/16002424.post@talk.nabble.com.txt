Hello everybody,

I have s slight problem using lucenes highlighter. If i have the highlighter
enabled, a query creates 0 hits, if i disable the highlighter i get the
hits.
It seems like, when i call searcher.search() and pass my Hits hits to the
highlighter function, the program quits. All prints after the highlighter
call also do not appear.
I have no idea what the problem is. 

Thanks in advise

Jens Burkhardt
