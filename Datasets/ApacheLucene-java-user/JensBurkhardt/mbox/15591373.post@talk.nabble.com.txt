SUBJECT: Boost Single Values in Field
DATE: 20 Feb 2008


Hey,

I'm wondering if you can boost single values and not the whole field.
For example:
i'm having a field called test with "value1 value2 value3" - all packed in a
String - and
i want to boost specific values e.g value1^0.5 value2^1.5 etc.
The problem is that i can't seperate this field. I don't think this will
work but maybe someone has had the 
same problem.
Trying to search took me nowhere :-) so i decided to just ask and maybe i'm
lucky.

Greetings
Jens
