SUBJECT: Re: combine wildcard and phrase query
DATE: 6 Mar 2008


okay thanks. the first thing was what i've expected :-) . well about my
second issue,
i was totally wrong. Just forget what i've said! I had in mind that if i
have several fields with the same name
these fields are connected to a big string.
Now as i read your message i remember that this behavior is just with
boost-values ;-) and not with field-values. hell no ... 
thanks for your answers :-). You saved a lot of time ;-)

best regards
Jens
