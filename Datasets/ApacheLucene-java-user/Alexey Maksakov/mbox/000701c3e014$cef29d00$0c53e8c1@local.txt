SUBJECT: HTML tagged terms boosting...
DATE: 21 Jan 2004

Hello!

Is there any idea how to achieve boosting terms in HTML-documents surrounded
by HTML tags, such as <B>, <H1>, etc.?

Can it be done with use of existing API or reimplemeting or implementation
of TokenStream with custom Token types is needed?

Though it seems to me, that even such re-implementation won't help without
changing indexing and searcher code... Hope that I'm wrong.

Thanks in advance.

Alexey.
