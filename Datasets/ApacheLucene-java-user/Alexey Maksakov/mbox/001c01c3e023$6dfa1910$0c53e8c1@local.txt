SUBJECT: AW: HTML tagged terms boosting...
DATE: 21 Jan 2004

Thanks for answer.

Yes I'm up to field specific boosting, but also I'm looking for creating
short descriptions on documents found, based on query (like it is done in
most search engines). I've thought about those solutions but it seemed to me
that it is not straightforward and will cause troubles when building
results' description. On second thought answer was found - analyze document
as stream and put terms into separate fields (or create duplicates) while
maintaining original offsets in Token objects.

After that building description is quite simple - just using TermPositions
in IndexReader and than getting corresponding text portion(s) from Field
(sadly it'll work only in case of one "body" field - so only duplicates are
usable, several Fields I think will require extra unindexed "body" Field to
fetch document pieces fast).

Hope I've not missed anything... Hm... not transparent, it is. :-) just hope
it helps somebody else.
