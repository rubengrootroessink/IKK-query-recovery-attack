Yeah I tried looking this up,

If i wanted to do it by document id (highest docs first) , does this mean
doing something like

hits = searcher.search(query, new Sort(new SortFeild(DOC, true); // or
something like that,

is this way of sorting any different performance wise to what i was doing
before ..
