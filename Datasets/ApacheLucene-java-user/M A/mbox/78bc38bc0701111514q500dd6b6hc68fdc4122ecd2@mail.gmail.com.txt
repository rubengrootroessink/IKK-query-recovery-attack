SUBJECT: Excluding partial match for query result
DATE: 11 Jan 2007

Hi,

We are having some trouble with the results that we get from certain
queries.

Basically .. we have documents that we index, each document has a bunch of
tags, the tags could be of the sort

tags: A, B, C, D.P, E.A etc ..

Each story will contain only a subset of the tags ..

For example

Story 1: tags : A, C, E
Story 2: tags : B.A, P, Q  (note "B.A" is one tag) .

Problem occurs when we run a search with query  "A" we get both results,
but what we should be getting is just Story 1.
Query "B.A" returns the correct value.

What would i have to  ensure that a search for "A" only matches "A" and not
"B.A"?

thanx
