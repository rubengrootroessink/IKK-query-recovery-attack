If you know the structure of the index ahead of time and the weights you
want to place on the different levels I'd do a query expansion. i.e.

search2:coco

would become

search2:coco^4 OR search4:coco

but actually creating the query objects rather than generating the
string to be parsed by the QueryParser.
