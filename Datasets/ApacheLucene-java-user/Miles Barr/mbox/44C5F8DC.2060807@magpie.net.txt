I don't see anything wrong with this, but maybe the query parser doesn't 
like it. You could construct it programatically:

1. Use the QueryParser on <some query>
2. Create TermQuerys for AUTHOR_NAME and EMPLOYEE_NAME
3. Construct the necessary BooleanQuery

If it is the query parser and you need free text queries take a look at 
the JavaCC source and find the bit that handles nested queries and see 
why it doesn't like your field restrictions.
