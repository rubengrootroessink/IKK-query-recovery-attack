Take a look at the PrefixQuery and WildcardQuery. 

PrefixQuery works by finding all terms beginning with the query then
constructing a boolean query of them. I assume WildcardQuery works in a
similar way.

If you have several terms or a short prefix (e.g. a*) you might need to
increase the maximum number of clauses allowed in a boolean query
because the number of terms might exceed the default (i.e. 1024).
