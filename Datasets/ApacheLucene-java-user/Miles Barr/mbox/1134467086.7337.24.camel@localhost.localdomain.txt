I've only had a quick play with it so this problem is probably down to
my misuse of the class but I found that negations weren't handled
properly. e.g.

fruit AND -apples

The DistributingMultiFieldQueryParser would correctly generate a query
that would find fruit in one of the fields, but would only ensure that
apples did not appear in one field, not not appear in all the fields,
which was the behaviour I wanted. Hence negations didn't really work if
the term appeared in more than one field.

Has anyone else experienced this problem?



Cheers,
Miles
