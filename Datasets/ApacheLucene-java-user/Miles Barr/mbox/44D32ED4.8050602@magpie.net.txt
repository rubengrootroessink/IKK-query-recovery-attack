It should be fairly straightforward to do it yourself. Compiling Luke 
against Lucene 1.9.1 shows it only uses 4 deprecated calls:

http://www.getopt.org/luke/luke-0.6/luke.zip

1. Field(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,boolean,boolean,boolean,boolean)
2. IndexReader.delete(int)
3. IndexReader.delete(Term)
4. Analyzer.tokenStream(Reader)

For the first one, replace the booleans with the appropriate Field.Store 
and File.Index values.

The delete call has simply been renamed to deleteDocuments.

Analyzer.tokenStream now requires a field name.

Then replace the Lucene jars in the lib directory with 2.0.0 and you 
should be able to build a compatible version of Luke.
