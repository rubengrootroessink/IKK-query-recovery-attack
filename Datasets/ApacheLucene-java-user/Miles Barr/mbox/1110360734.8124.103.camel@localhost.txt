I've used span queries to boost the scores of results where words appear
close together. I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to achieve. All
three documents contain the search phrase, so both span and phrase
queries would return all the documents.

Are you trying to setup a taxonomy? i.e. only display documents in the
category Electronics > Digital Camera, and not those in sub categories?
If this is the case you should try to build the categorisation at the
same time as the indexing process and either add explicit clauses in the
search query or filter afterwards.
