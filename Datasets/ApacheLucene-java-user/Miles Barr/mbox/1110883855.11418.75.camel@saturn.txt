At the moment I need something quite simple. To identify a page that
appears in many forms, e.g.:

- Normal version
- Split across several pages
- Print version
- From a different section (different styling and navigation elements)

Basically identical content, presented in different ways.

I beginning to think any on the fly filtering would have to be quite
simple because of the required response time. Something like looking at
URLs and titles (which are already separate in the index).

A more permanent solution would have to process the pages ahead of time,
trying to break it down into chunks, then maybe built up a list of
hashes of the chunks for each page. Then each page would have a
'fingerprint', and hopefully you could come up with a quick way to
compare them at query time.
