If depends what the type of leaf_category is. If you made it Keyword as
I suggested then it won't be tokenized. i.e. there's one token 'DIGITAL
CAMERA' instead of the two tokens you normally get, 'digital' and
'camera'.

If you change the field type to Text you should be able to use a
SpanNearQuery to do your search.
