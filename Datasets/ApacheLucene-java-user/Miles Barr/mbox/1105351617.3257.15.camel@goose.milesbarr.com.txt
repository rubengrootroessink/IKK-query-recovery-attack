As I understand it you can't have an index reader which you do deletes
on and an index writer open at the same time since they are both doing
write operations. I think locking will prevent you from opening an index
writer once you do a delete on the reader.

So you're either going to have to open and close the reader and writer
for each update, or keep a list of duplicate references and a list of
documents to be updated, then do the deletes like:

for (Iterator it = toBeDeleted.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
  Term term = new Term("Reference", (String) it.next());
  indexReader.delete(term);
}

Close the reader, open the writer, then iterate through your list of new
docs and write them to the index.

Once you close your reader searches won't be possible. So once you've
done your deletes close the reader and open it again to release the
write lock before opening the writer.
