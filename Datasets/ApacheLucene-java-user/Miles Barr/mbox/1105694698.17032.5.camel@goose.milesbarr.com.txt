Did you call optimize on the writer? Alternatively you could have
reached the max number of segments and it optimized automatically (i.e.
turn several segment files like _2meu.fnm into one large one).

I don't know how this affects an existing reader, whether the reader
caches the values or not. Maybe someone can shed some more light on
this.
