That's good to know. When indexing web sites I use the URL as the
identifier and hence store it in a keyword field. While not common, it
is possible for URLs to be longer than 255 characters. That could have
led to some very awkward bugs to track down.

I'll probably switch over to your KeywordAnalyzer.
