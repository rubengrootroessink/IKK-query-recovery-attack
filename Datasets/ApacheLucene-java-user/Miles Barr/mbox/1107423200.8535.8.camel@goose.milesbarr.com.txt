What consequences does this have for the 1.9/2.0 releases? i.e. after
2.0 the deprecated API will be removed, does this mean 1.x will no
longer be supported after 2.0?

The typical scenario being a bug is found that affects 1.x and 2.x, it's
patched in 2.x (i.e. the trunk) but we can't patch the last 1.x release.
The other scenario being a bug is found in the 1.x code, but it cannot
be applied.
