Actually I added that in after I saw that Google does it. You're right
that the context is likely to be completely different so I guess they do
it through some URL matching.

I have to index several sites and I used some examples of the problems
I've come across so far. I don't control the content for any of them,
and they get picked up by a spider so excluding pages requires adding
special cases.

I'll probably adopt a two stage approach.

1. Prevent duplicate documents from getting into the index in the first
place, e.g. compare MD5 hashes and file sizes, maybe make the spider
configurable to spot certain URL patterns, etc.

2. Try out the various techniques suggested in this thread to spot
similar pages at query time and hide them.
