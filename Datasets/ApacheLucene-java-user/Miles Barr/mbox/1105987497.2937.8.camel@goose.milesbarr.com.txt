You'll have to implement org.apache.lucene.store.Directory to load the
index from the JAR file. Take a look at FSDirectory and RAMDirectory for
some more details.

Then you have either load the JAR file with java.util.jar.JarFile to get
to the files or you can use Classloader#getResourceAsStream to get to
them.
