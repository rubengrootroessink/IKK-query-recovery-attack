It's fairly straightforward to write one. Here's the one I put together
for PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper situations:


package org.apache.lucene.analysis;

import java.io.Reader;

public class VerbatimAnalyzer extends Analyzer {

    public VerbatimAnalyzer() {
        super();
    }

    public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
        TokenStream result = new VerbatimTokenizer(reader);

        return result;
    }


    /**
     * This tokenizer assumes that the entire input is just one token.
     */
    public static class VerbatimTokenizer extends CharTokenizer {

        public VerbatimTokenizer(Reader reader) {
            super(reader);
        }

        protected boolean isTokenChar(char c) {
            return true;
        }
    }
}
