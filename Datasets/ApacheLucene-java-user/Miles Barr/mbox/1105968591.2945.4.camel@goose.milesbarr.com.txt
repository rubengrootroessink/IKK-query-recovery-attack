Not unless you iterate through all the documents in the Hits object,
e.g.

Set fields = new HashSet();
for (int i = 0; i < hits.length(); i++) {
    Document doc = hits.doc(i);
    fields.add(doc.get("fieldName"));
}

but you probably don't want to do this on a per search basis because
retrieving the document is an expensive operation.
