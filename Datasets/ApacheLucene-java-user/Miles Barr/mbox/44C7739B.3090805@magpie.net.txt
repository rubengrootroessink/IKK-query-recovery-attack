Using milliseconds as your resolutions will make range searches very 
slow, since it has to enumerate so many values. I suggest using at most 
minutes instead.

But either way I suggest using DateTools rather than using a Date 
object's toString() form, i.e.:

doc.add(new Field("date", 
DateTools.dateToString(itemContent.get("date"), 
DateTools.Resolution.MILLISECOND), Field.Store.YES, 
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
