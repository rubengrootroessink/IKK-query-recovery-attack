Lucene might be overkill in this situation if you don't need it's more
advanced text searching facilities, i.e. you're only searching for exact
matches for folder names and never need to tokenize the search term.

If you still want to use Lucene the approach I would take would be to
have one Document in Lucene per folder name in the text file. Within
this document you store the list of JPG files, it might not even be
necessary to store them in separate fields from the sounds of your
requirements.

Start up parsing the text file and each time you find a new folder name
create a new Document. Assuming the entries in the file are of the form:

/folder-name/filename.jpg

It should be fairly straightforward to do using regular expressions.

If the text document is an unnecessary step I would follow the solution
described in Erik's reply.
