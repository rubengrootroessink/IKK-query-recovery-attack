The other guys have covered caching of results in a general way, so I 
won't go into that.

For a search application I've written I have a separate class that acts 
as the model for a search. Basically it allows you to say how many 
results you want per page, and set the page number. Then you can have it 
spit out some XML for the results that should be visible, this includes 
title, search summary, link, etc. Similarly it can provide the necessary 
information to generate pagination links.

This object holds the reference to the Hits object, and is kept around 
for the duration of that user session. So I do cache the results and 
hence only execute the search once, but this is more as a consequence of 
how I modelled the interaction rather than a desire to cache.
