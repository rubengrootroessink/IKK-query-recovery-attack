Field.Keyword requires an exact match, i.e. you should manually create a
TermQuery. Luke will analyze your query and hence tokenise it. Almost
certainly the tokens it creates won't match the values in your field,
because they have to be an exact match.

The StandardAnalyzer is the analyzer Luke uses by default. It will make
the search terms lower case, and AFAIK it almost removes numbers from
the query.
