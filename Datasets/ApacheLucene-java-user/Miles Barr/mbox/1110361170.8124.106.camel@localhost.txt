There's no built in support in Lucene to have remote directories. You
can do something at the operating system level, e.g. NFS, to make a
remove directory appear local, but I believe this isn't recommended.

Another approach would be to implement the Directory interface yourself:

http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/store/Directory.html

Then make your implementation capable of storing files remotely.
