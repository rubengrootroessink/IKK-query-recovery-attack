SUBJECT: Possible query processing bug.
DATE: 18 Apr 2002

I have some code which submits a query to Lucene and gets some results.
It is fine most of the time, but there are some queries which cause a
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError. An example of such a query is:
  {bargain Y}
The brackets {...} don't mean anything special - it just happens to be a
query in the test set.

The code looks something like this:

    Query parsedQuery = QueryParser.parse(query, "Text", analyzer);
    ...
    Hits h = index.search(query);

analyzer is just a StandardAnalyzer with an empty stop word list, and
index is an IndexSearcher. 

Printing the query with
      System.err.println(parsedQuery.toString("main"));
gives
	{Text:bargain-y}


Any ideas what the problem could be and how to fix it, short of just
removing the { and } characters?
