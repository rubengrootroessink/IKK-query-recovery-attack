SUBJECT: how to get all terms of a given field of curtain docId?
DATE: 30 Jun 2004

Hello Lucene users.

I'm using Lucene within last 3 years and want to say "Great thanks" to
developers and community for perfect product and support.

I'm wondering, what is the best practice to extract all terms of
given document field("contents") for the curtain document id?

Thanks in advance.

Max
