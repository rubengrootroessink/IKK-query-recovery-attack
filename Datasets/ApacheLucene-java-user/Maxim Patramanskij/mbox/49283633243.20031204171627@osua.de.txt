SUBJECT: DateFilter or RangeQuery
DATE: 4 Dec 2003

Hello lucene-users.

What is the better way to filter search results by date (which is one
of the indexed fields):

  - use RangeQuery against date field as a required part of boolean  query;
  - use DateFilter

  First approach seems to be problematic since I have to extremely
  increase maxClauseCount of BooleanQuery and run again extra memory
  usage.
