Hello Grant.

Thanks a lot for quick tip, it's really what I'm looking for.

However, I'm still using  1.3 final, so I have to migrate to newer
release. Additionally, I guess I have to modify my indexing part to
set storeTermVector flag while indexing to true for the field, which I
interested to get TermVector for.
