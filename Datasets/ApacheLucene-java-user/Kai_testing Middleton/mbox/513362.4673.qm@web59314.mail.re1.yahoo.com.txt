I don't think that's all that large, though I have only been working with Lucene for a short
while.  I have two corpuses with 445834 documents (3.43M terms) and 132217 documents (1.6M
terms).  I don't have trouble querying either of these with Luke.

Thanks, Karl.

Do you know if 290k articles and 234 million words is a large lucene index
or a medium one? Do people build them this big all the time?

Thanks!
