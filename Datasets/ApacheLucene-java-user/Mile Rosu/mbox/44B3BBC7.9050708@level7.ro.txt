SUBJECT: Searching for a phrase which spans on 2 pages
DATE: 11 Jul 2006

Hello,

I am working on an application similar to google books which allows 
searching on documents which represent a scanned page. Of course, one 
might search for a phrase starting at the end of one page and ending at 
the beginning of the next one. In this case I do not know how I might 
treat this. Both pages should be returned as hit results.
Do you have any idea on how this situation might be handled?

Thank you,
Mile Rosu
