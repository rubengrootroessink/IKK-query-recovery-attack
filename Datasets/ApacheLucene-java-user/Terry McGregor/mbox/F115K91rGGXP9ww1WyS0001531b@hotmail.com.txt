SUBJECT: how to parse XHTML
DATE: 1 Jan 1970


Hi,

I'm new to Lucene, and I was wondering how I should parse XHTML files. 
Should I name them with the .HTML file extention and use 
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML or name them with the .XML file extention 
and use an XML parser?

Also, I would like to keep my XHTML files with a .XHTML file extention, if 
possible, but that's not so important.

Thanks,
Terry.
