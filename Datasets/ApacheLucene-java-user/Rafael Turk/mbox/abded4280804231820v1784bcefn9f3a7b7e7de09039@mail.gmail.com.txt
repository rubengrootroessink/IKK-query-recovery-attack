Hi Mathieu,

*What do you wont to do?*

An spell checker and related keyword suggestion

If you wont an ngram => popularity map, just use a berkley DB, and use this
information in your Lucene application. Lucene is a reversed index, Berkeley
DB an index.

*Great ideia! Berkeley DB is definitely a try, simple and effective, but
I'll have to work the data previously. I was hopping to take advantage of
Lucene's built in features*
