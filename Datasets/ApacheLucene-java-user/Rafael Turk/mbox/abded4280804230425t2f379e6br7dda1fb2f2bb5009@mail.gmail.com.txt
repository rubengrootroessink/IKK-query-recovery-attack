Hi Folks,

   I´m trying to load Google Web 1T 5 Gram to Lucene. (This corpus contains
English word n-grams and their observed frequency counts. The length of the
n-grams ranges from unigrams(single words) to five-grams)

   I´m loading each ngram (each row is a ngram) as an individual Document.
This way I´ll be able to search for each ngram separated, but I´m ending
with huge indexes witch makes them very hard to load and read the index.

  Is there a better way to load and read ngrams to a Lucene index? Maybe
using lower level api?

Thanks,

Rafael
