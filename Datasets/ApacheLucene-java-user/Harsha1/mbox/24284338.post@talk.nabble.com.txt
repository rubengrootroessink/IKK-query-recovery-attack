SUBJECT: Stop Word list File processing
DATE: 1 Jul 2009


Hi,
I have a string through i need to filter off some of words (say stop words).
But I want to use WhiteSpaceAnalyser. So I have created a custom analyser
with capability of whitespaceAnalyser and filtering unwanted words.
Since the String array of Stop words is increasing, i would like put this
into a file and process this file.

How to go about this?
