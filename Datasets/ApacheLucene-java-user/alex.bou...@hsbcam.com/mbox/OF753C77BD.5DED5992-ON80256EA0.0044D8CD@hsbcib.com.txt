I switched to indexing using a text field instead of keyword, then I tried
the following based on various pieces of advice:

            PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper pfaw = new PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper(new ChineseAnalyzer());
            pfaw.addAnalyzer("language", new WhitespaceAnalyzer());

            try
            {
                query = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(queryString, new String[]{"contents",
"keywords", "title", "language"}, (Analyzer) pfaw);
                System.out.println("Parsed query: " + query.toString());
            }
            catch (ParseException e)
            {
                error = true;
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

I have tried both "language:zh-HK" and  "language:zh\-HK" (which appears in
the debugger as "language:zh\\-HK") as the query, and neither return any
hits. I've tried stepping through the code to see what is being indexed
(which looks OK at least to a relative beginner like myself), and also
through the search code but I'm still none the wiser.

Am I doing something wrong, or have I completely missed the point ??

remember luke does not display the indexed tokens but the stored field.  So
you would expect to see en-uk in the field.

doc.add(Field.Keyword("locale","test-uk"));

are you adding to the document like this?

Also what analyzer you using to pass the query?

org.apache.lucene.analysis.WhitespaceAnalyzer : parses as locale:en-uk
org.apache.lucene.analysis.SimpleAnalyzer : parses as locale:en uk
org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer : parses as locale:en
uk

Try using whitespace analyzer in Luke and see how it's interpreting the
query.  If you are storing as a keyword but searching with tokens, it may
be your problem.

I tried this, but no it does not work. I'm concerned that escaping the
minus symbol does not appear to work. The field is indexed as a keyword so
is not tokenized - I've checked the contents using luke which confirms
this.

Doesn't "en UK" as a phrase query work?

You're probably indexing it as a text field so it's being tokenised.

Hmm, we may have to if there is no work around. We're not using java
locales, but were trying to stick to the ISO standard which uses hyphens.

if you're dealing with locales, why not use java's built in locale syntax
(ex: en_UK, zh_HK)?
