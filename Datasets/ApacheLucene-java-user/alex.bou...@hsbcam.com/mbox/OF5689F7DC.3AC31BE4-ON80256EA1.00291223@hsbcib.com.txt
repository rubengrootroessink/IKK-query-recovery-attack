Thanks Erik :)

We are using 1.3 so it looks like an upgrade should be made asap.

Whilst hacking around I found an alternative solution. I went back to using
a Keyword field, but instead of using the minus symbol in the query I just
used "-language:en*" which has the desired effect.

Now I know about the upgrade to 1.4 I'll have a look at some alternative
solutions.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions on this problem.

Alex B.

I think I can safely say that you are not running the latest version of
Lucene.  This has been corrected in the 1.4 versions.

I've tested this with "Wal-Mart" (without the quote) and QueryParser,
and it works as expected.

Now that is odd.

QueryParser is an awkward beast at times, and combining it with
MultiFieldQueryParser (which I'd recommend against, as you can see with
the odd queries it built for you) gets even more confusing.

Hopefully the latest Lucene 1.4 RC release will fix up your situation.

 Erik
