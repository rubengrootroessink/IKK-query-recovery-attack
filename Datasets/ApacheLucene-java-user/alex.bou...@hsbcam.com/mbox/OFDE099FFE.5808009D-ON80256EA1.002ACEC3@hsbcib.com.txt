Hi Christophe,

we're currently indexing Chinese pages with little difficulty. You can use
the standard analyzer to index the documents and it will tokenize the
content into individual characters. If you want to create a list of 'stop'
words you will need to create your own analyzer and supply it with a list
of unicode characters to stop. We are indexing HTML pages using a spider to
traverse the site and have subclassed Document into HTML_Document. This
allows us to set the content encoding for the input stream reader - as our
system default is iso_8859-1 in common with most western machines - which
enables it to correctly process the unicode characters. You may need to do
this too.

Hope this helps

Alex.
