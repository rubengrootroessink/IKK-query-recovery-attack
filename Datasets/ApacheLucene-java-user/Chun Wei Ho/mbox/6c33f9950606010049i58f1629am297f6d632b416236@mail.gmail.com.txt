SUBJECT: Getting all the matching documents for a search
DATE: 1 Jun 2006

Hi,

I use Hits to search for and get documents matching a particular query, e.g.:
Hits hits = indexSearcher.search(new TermQuery(new Term("startswith","A")));

but it is not returning all the matching documents in the index. From
experimentation it appears to return about less than half the matching
documents unless the number of matching documents is less than 100. Is
there an option that I can specify so that it returns the whole list
of matching documents?

Thanks.
