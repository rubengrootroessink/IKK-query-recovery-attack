SUBJECT: Obtain terms for only particular field(s)
DATE: 4 May 2006

Hi,

I have a pretty large index and I would like to obtain all the Terms
for only one or two particular fields.

As I understand - IndexReader.terms() returns a termEnum of all the
terms in the index, and I would have to iterate through all of them to
pick out the ones from the fields that I want. Is there a better way
to do this?

Thanks :)
