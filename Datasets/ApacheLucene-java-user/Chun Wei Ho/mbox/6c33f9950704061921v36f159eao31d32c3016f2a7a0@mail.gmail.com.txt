Thanks for the ideas.

We are testing out the methods and changes suggested to see if they
work with our current set up, and are checking if the disks are the
bottleneck in this case, but feel free to drop more hints. :)

At the moment we are copying the index at an offpeak hour, but we
would also like to provide updates throughout the day where possible.
