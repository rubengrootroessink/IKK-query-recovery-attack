SUBJECT: Simpler QueryParser
DATE: 20 Mar 2006

I am wondering if anyone has existing code for a simpler QueryParser -
one that does not create the more complex prefix/fuzzy/range queries,
but still allow the usual term/boolean queries.

I use QueryParser to directly parse user input (allowing for more
flexible specification of include/exclude and fields conditions), but
do not want them to use the more resource intensive queries.

Just checking since QueryParser is done in javacc which I have little
experience in to rewrite or subclass.
