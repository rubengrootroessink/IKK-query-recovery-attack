SUBJECT: Suggesting refine searches with Lucene
DATE: 13 Feb 2006

Hi,

I am trying to suggest refine searches for my Lucene search. For
example, if a search turned out too many searches, it would list a
number of document title subsequences that occurred frequently in the
results of the previous search, as possible candidates for refining
the search.

Does anyone know the right/any approach to implementing this in a
Lucene-based search app?

Thanks.
