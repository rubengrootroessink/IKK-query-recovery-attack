SUBJECT: Distributed vs Merged Searching
DATE: 1 Feb 2006

I am deploying a web application serving searches on a Lucene index,
and am deciding between distributing search between several machines
or single searching, and was hoping that someone could tell me from
their experiences:

+ Is there anything particular to watch out for if using distributed
searching instead of  searching one merged Lucene index?

+ What should be the size of the index that I am looking at before I
need to (or should be) turn to distributed searching to reduce
response/search time? I know it would depend a lot on hardware and request
frequency but I was wondering if anyone could post their hardware
info and index size as a reference of when/if they had to use
distributed search due to load issues.

Thanks :)
