Hi,

I suspect this is an easy one but I didn't see a reference in the FAQ's
so I thought I'd ask. I have a file structure like this:

web
  - pages
  - downloads (pdf docs)
  - include

I want to index the html in pages and the pdf's in downloads, but not
the html in include, so I don't want to start my index at web. I've
modified the IndexHTML in demo to do the pdf's. 

What is the best way to do this? Thanks for your suggestions.

John
