I don't know the behaviour of the Japanese Analyzer you are using.
Can you add to your example diagnosis the Token.getPositionIncrement, 
Token.startOffset and Token.endOffset for each of the tokens?

The highlighter groups tokens with overlapping start and end offsets 
into a single TokenGroup for the purposes of highlighting. This allows 
TokenStreams which produce multiple synonyms for the same source token 
to work. This behaviour was also required to get the CJKAnalyzer to 
work. It could be that the Analyzer you are using is producing a stream 
of tokens which *all* overlap?

Cheers
Mark
