SUBJECT: Lucene database bindings
DATE: 17 Sep 2005

I know there have been some posts discussing how to integrate Lucene 
with Derby recently.

I've added an example project that works with both HSQLDB and Derby 
here: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-434

The bindings allow you to use SQL that mixes database and Lucene 
functionality in ways like this:

    select top 10 lucene_score(id) as SCORE,
            lucene_highlight(adText) from ads
               where pricePounds <200 and pricePounds >1
               and lucene_query('"drum kit"',id)>0
            order by SCORE DESC, pricePounds ASC

See the readme.txt in the zip file for details.

Cheers,
Mark
