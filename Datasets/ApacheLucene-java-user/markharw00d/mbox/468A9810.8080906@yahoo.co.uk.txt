>>It looks that we may have different cases.

I was hoping to answer the original question which was how to retrieve 
pages of matching documents from a Lucene index (no database mentioned).

 >>So far worked just fine. I have 5000 rows of items and I think will 
still work fine later when I'd have 100K items.

I have a Lucene-plus-database hybrid application with 100 million 
documents running a business today, taking daily updates. Trust me, I 
don't store Lucene doc ids in the database because it is not  a scalable 
or robust approach for the reasons I outlined earlier :)

Cheers,
Mark
