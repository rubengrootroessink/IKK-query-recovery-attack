I'm keen to understand the pros and cons of these two approaches.

With the HitCollector approach is this just engineering a fall at the 
final hurdle? It could be that long running queries spend all their time 
doing edit-distance comparisions for a a fuzzy boolean query, say  or 
reading TermDocs for a large range filter to create a BitSet only to be 
aborted at the collection stage?
Another point - I noticed in some basic timing tests that calling 
System.currentTimeMillis() in a tight loop like for *every* call to 
HitCollector.collect(..) could add reasonable overhead so you probably 
only want to call this for every nth document collected when testing 
execution times.

Cheers
Mark
