There is a trick to indexing queries in this way... you need only index 
the rarest term in queries which have one or more mandatory terms.
As an example - for the phrase query "XYZ Group limited" you need only 
index the rarest term "XYZ" and thus avoid the selecting the query for 
execution with every document that happens to have the more common words 
"group" or "limited".

Cheers
