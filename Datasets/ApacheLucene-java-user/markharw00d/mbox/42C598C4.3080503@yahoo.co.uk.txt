Assuming your availability is a year in advance and yours is a reputable chain of hotels that
books rooms by the day, (not the hour!) You only need:
4900 * 365 bits of true/false info to cache all the availability data you need.
This is a Bitset occupying less than a megabyte of RAM.
You could index into this sort of structure very quickly (for the appropriate date/doc positions)
and  get a big performance boost.
Perhaps more complex to implement but certainly a very fast solution.
