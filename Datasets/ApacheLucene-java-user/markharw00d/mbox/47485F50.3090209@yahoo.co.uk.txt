SUBJECT: Re: Why exactly are fuzzy queries so slow?
DATE: 24 Nov 2007

The added IO is one factor. Another is the CPU load from doing many 
edit-distance comparisons between index terms and the provided search 
term. You can limit the number of edit distance comparisons conducted by 
setting the minimum prefix length. This is a property of the QueryParser 
if parsing queries and a property of FuzzyQuery if constructing 
programatically.

 >>P.S. arent' there any "best practices" for lucene?

Yes. The front page of the the WIKI has a "Basics of Performace". I've 
added a note on FuzzyQueries to the "ImproveSearchingSpeed" page

Cheers
Mark
