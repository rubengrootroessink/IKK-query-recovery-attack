 >>(a "write once" schema)

I like this idea. Enforcing consistent field-typing on instances of 
fields with the same name does not seem like an unreasonable restriction 
- especially given the upsides to this.

It doesn't dispense with all the full schema logic in Solr but seems 
like a useful baseline for supporting basic numeric field types well in 
Lucene.

One note of caution is that users may be tempted to store primary keys 
as ints or longs and incur the overhead of trie encoding when there is 
no use case for range queries on these types of fields.

I've often thought of field types as belonging to these broad categories 
(rather than ints/strings/longs etc):
1) Quantifiers -   used to express numeric quantities that are often 
queried in ranges e.g. price, datetime, longitude
2) Identifiers  -   designed to be unique e.g. urls, primary keys
3) Controlled vocabularies - enums e.g. male/female or public/private
4) Uncontrolled vocabularies - e.g free text

"Ints" can be used to represent types 1 to 3 but the practical uses of 
them differ (range queries vs straight-look ups vs faceted groups)
It seems like the likely use cases are more important than the raw data 
format (int vs long etc)

Cheers
Mark
