SUBJECT: Re: FuzzyLikeThisQuery what does maxNumTerms mean
DATE: 9 May 2007

The shortlisting isn't based on stop words - a score is produced to 
prioritise term selections. The score uses the IDF (inverse document 
frequency) of the original term and mixes in the "edit-distance" for 
each of the fuzzy variations of original terms. Care is taken to ensure 
that in the query produced, fuzzy variants all use the root term's IDF 
(or if the root term is not in the index the average IDF of all of the 
variants is used by each variant). This avoids the rarer variants 
ranking more highly than the source term in query results.
