Thanks for the reminder, Otis.

I haven't done any more on this since this post:

http://archives.devshed.com/a/ml/200501-114586/lucene-query-sql-kind

The scalability concerns with the user-defined-functions I created 
prevented me from taking it any further. A proper solution would need a 
tighter (ie more complex) integration with Derby internals.
If you have some small-scale requirements and are still interested in 
this UDF-based approach let me know and I can mail you the experimental 
code I wrote.

Cheers
Mark
