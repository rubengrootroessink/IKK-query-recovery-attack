Hi Mark,
Good summary. I was running some timings earlier and my results echo 
your findings.

 >>I am currently trying to think of some possible hybrid approach to 
highlighting...

I was thinking along the lines of wrapping some core classes such as 
IndexReader to somehow observe the query matching process and deduce 
from that what to highlight (avoiding the need for MemoryIndex)  but I'm 
not sure that is viable. It would be nice to get some more match info 
out of the main query logic as it runs to aid highlighting rather than 
reverse engineering the basis of a match after the event.

 >>I have fixed a few things with my Highlighter and will be updating it 
soon.

Look forward to it!

Cheers
Mark
