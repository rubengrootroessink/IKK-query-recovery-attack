The "did you mean" implementation should ideally use all of the other 
words in a query as context to guide the selection of spelling 
alternatives. Google appear to do this - not sure if they use the doc 
content or user queries to suggest the alternatives.
I've got some colocation finding code which can be run on an existing 
index to discover commonly colocated  terms from doc contents. This 
could be of use here.
