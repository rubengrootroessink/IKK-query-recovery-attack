SUBJECT: Re: Clustering Lucene with 40 Servers
DATE: 28 Dec 2006

Not quite yet gone up to this scale but here are some points for 
consideration based on a smaller scale system I have in production that 
may be of interest:


By clustering I presume you are only talking about replication.
When we talk about scaling and using multiple machines we need to think 
of "partitioning" and "replication" - they are 2 techniques for solving 
two different problems (scaling for data volumes and scaling for user 
volumes, respectively). If you have a large amount of data you need to 
partition the data into separate partitions or "shards", distributed on 
multiple machines and query them in parallel. If you have a large number 
of users you need to replicate copies of an index/shard and balance the 
query load across multiple replicated machines.

As for synchronizing I have previously used a centralized database as 
the definitive source of all data from which index search nodes pull 
their content. This has the benefits of using a database's powerful 
transactional, and backup/restore facilities to manage the integrity of 
the source data. Modulo n of a a hash of the database's primary key can 
be used to allocate a search partition ID for each record which is a way 
of evenly apportioning content to your n search partitions. Databases 
also have facilities to automate the timestamping of updated/deleted 
records. Each search server simply reads the latest 
updated/modified/deleted records from the central database for the 
partition(s) they manage and patches their index accordingly. Using this 
approach a search node can suffer a failure and always be able to 
recover without too much trouble. There are more efficient ways of 
distributed content than via JDBC and polling and better ways of 
building replicated indexes than duplicating the indexing logic on 
multiple machines but this has the advantage of being simple to 
implement and may suffice if the updates volume/frequency is relatively low.

Cheers
Mark
