SUBJECT: Re: Does highlighter highlight phrases only?
DATE: 30 Jun 2005

Hi Erik,
Yes I was thinking that code could form the basis of a new highlighter.

I've just attached a QuerySpansExtractor to the bugzilla entry for the 
new highlighter. This class produces Spans from queries other than 
SpanXxxxQueries eg phrase, term and booleans.
I'm thinking you can throw the text to be highligted  as a single doc 
into a MemIndex , extracts the spans using the QuerySpansExtractor and 
the  MemIndex's reader (need to expose a getReader method on this - I'm 
working on it), then use some new highlighting logic on the Spans.

Sound reasonable?
