DATE: 13 Feb 2007

Not sure I fully understand the problem. The query is effectively 
"allContent:someTitleText" and you want to highlight the string 
"someTitleText" in the title field?
If you pass null as a fieldname to the QueryTermExtractor it will use 
all term values, regardless of field, as string to highlight.
If you pass a fieldname it will only select highlight term values for 
that field.
If you want, you can use QueryTermExtractor to extract just the 
"allContent" field values and pass a TokenStream for the "title" field 
to the highlighter and it would highlight the appropriate values in the 
title.

Do any of these options work?
