Did you edit your post on Nabble? That edit didn't come through as a 
message to java-user so I didn't see it.
You shouldn't need to call rewrite on your FuzzyLikeThisQuery unless you 
want to pass it to the Highlighter.

As for which is best,  MoreLikeThis or FuzzyLikeThisQuery -it depends. 
Are the records you are trying to match frequently mis-spelt? If so, 
FuzzyLikeThisQuery may provide better results by matching on spelling 
variations. Try both classes and see.  There is no single solution to 
all tasks as it depends on the data and there are various settings on 
both classes which can alter results. Using the Highlighter will show 
you the basis of any matches produced and can help you to see what is 
going on. Having a human-validated collection of matches will be useful 
so you can measure the effectiveness of your choice of algorithm.

Cheers
Mark
