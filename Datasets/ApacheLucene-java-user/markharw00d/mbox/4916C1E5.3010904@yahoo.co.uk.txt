 >>this can't be nearly as fast as OpenBitSet.intersect() or union, 
respectively, can it?

I had a similar concern but it doesn't seem that bad:

   
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1187?focusedCommentId=12596546#action_12596546

The above test showed a slight improvement using bitset.or when it was 
recognised both docidsets were OpenBitSets. This optimisation is now in 
BooleanFilter.

Cheers
Mark
