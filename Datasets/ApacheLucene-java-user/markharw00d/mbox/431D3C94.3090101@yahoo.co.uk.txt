SUBJECT: Re: Hits document offset information? Span query or Surround?
DATE: 6 Sep 2005

 >>I believe I have heard that Span queries provide some way to access 
document offset information for their hits somehow.

See http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=lucene-user&m=112496111224218&w=2

Faithfully selecting extracts based *exactly* on query criteria will be 
hard given complex queries eg with nested Boolean logic.

The current highlighter matches based on ANY query terms found in the 
provided doc text
The proposal above matches based on any spans/phrases/terms

Both options still fail to take into account any boolean logic and show 
the real basis for the match eg the query
    (author:"Doug Cutting"AND title:"Lucene in Action") OR (author:Erik 
AND author:Otis)
would still highlight references to "Doug Cutting" and "Lucene In 
Action" for the LIA book, despite the fact that the match was actually 
for Erik and Otis (the true authors).
For most people this is a problem they can live with.

Cheers
Mark
