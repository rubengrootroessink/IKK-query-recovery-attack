One "hands off" approach you could try with this is to rewrite the 
fuzzyQuery and then set the minimum number of terms you want a match on. 
e.g.

        FuzzyLikeThisQuery flt=new FuzzyLikeThisQuery(50,new 
StandardAnalyzer());
        flt.addTerms("product critical update", "title", 0.75f, 
FuzzyQuery.defaultPrefixLength);
        BooleanQuery q = (BooleanQuery) flt.rewrite(r);
        int minNumClauseMatches=Math.round(q.clauses().size()*0.5f);
        q.setMinimumNumberShouldMatch(minNumClauseMatches);

In the above code I'm specifying at least half of the input terms must 
have a match.

If a user wants more control then they really need to be more "hands on" 
and specify precisely which of these words are important to them in the 
actual query syntax.

returned by FuzzyLikeThisQuery contains all irrelevant topics. E.g.
