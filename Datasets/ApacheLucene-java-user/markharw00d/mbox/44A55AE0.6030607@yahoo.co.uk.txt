Hi Erik.
Yes, sorry brain is disengaged with all the heat here -  my example 
wasn't great and my scenario may be more complex than I originally 
outlined. I may have 20 different ways of saying "interested" and want 
to query for these words - but only if they aren't immediately preceded 
by "not", "isn't" or a choice of other negatives. I was looking for 
something efficient and succint in SpanQuerys to help.

Thanks for the help
Mark
