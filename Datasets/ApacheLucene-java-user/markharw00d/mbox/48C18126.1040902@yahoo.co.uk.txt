+1. I could definitely use a "commitUserData" option for the same reasons.

I thought about this but was uncomfortable with the idea of adding an 
extra doc - some use cases that become troublesome for any application 
logic are:
1) IndexReader.numDocs/IndexReader.maxDoc will give "incorrect" values
2) Any queries of the type "all documents *without* a value for field X 
return the commit.userdata document.

I was toying with the idea of maintaining my own commit.userdata file 
which I would manage in my framework when calling IndexWriter.commit but 
this does not feel as clean as Lucene core code holding the user data in 
the segments file.

Cheers
Mark
