Roughly speaking:

* Documents containing *all* the search terms are good
* Matches on rare words are better than for common words
* Long documents are not as good as short ones
* Documents which mention the search terms many times are good

...although there are more factors you can choose to add,  like 
emphasising individual query terms or individual docs in the index.

Cheers
