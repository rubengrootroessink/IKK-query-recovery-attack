SUBJECT: Re: Highlighter and complex queries

Hi Marios.

 >>Isn't this wrong?
Yes but this is an itch that no one has been suffficently been bothered 
by to fix yet.
I still haven't had the time or a desperate need to implement this so it 
will probably remain that way until someone feels strongly enough about 
the problem to fix it. Highlighting is not a straight forward problem if 
your goal is to exactly reflect the query logic- especially if you also 
try to summarise large texts AND you are dealing with complex queries 
containing Spans, "NOT" clauses and nested Boolean logic etc Some 
compromises have to be made.

My suggestion as to how this might best be approached and links to some 
related code is here:

This post highlights some of the intricacies involved.
