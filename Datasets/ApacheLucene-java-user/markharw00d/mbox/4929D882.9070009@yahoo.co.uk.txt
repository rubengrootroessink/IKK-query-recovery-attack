If you index the queries consider also that they can potentially be 
indexed in an optimised form.

For example, take a phrase query for "Alonso Smith". You need only index 
one of these terms - an incoming document must contain both terms to be 
considered a match. If you chose to index this query on the rare term 
"Alonso" you would get far fewer requests to run this query than if you 
chose to index the comparitively more common "Smith". Basically any 
query with mandatory terms can be "index optimised" to record only the 
rarest mandatory term (rarity typically being measured by using a 
look-up on some background index).

Cheers,
Mark
