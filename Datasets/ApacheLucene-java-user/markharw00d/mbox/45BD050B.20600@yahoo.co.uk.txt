FWIW, the existing highlighter doesn't *have* to fragment - just pass a 
NullFragmenter to the highlighter.
Ideally we'd have one implementation that tackles phrase support and 
preserves (optional) support for selecting fragments. I can see that to 
achieve this the existing highlighter design would need to change. 
Currently the highlighter identifies fragments first (typically using an 
implementation which arbitrarily chops text after 'n' words) and then 
selects which of these fragments have the highest density of 
high-scoring query terms. This logic would need to change to :
1) Use QuerySpansExtractor to identify all the *spans* in the document
2) Use a sliding window to select fragments, taking care to select 
fragments that wholly contain spans, rather than selecting only part of 
a span.
3) Mark up the hits.
Clearly, for people uninterested in selecting fragments, step 2 can be 
skipped.

Cheers
Mark
