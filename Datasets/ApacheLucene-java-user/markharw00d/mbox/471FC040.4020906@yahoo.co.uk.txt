No, SortedVIntList is in the patch I provided a link to earlier.

Yes. Most caches tend to be held in WeakHashMap keyed on IndexReader so 
that when a new reader takes over old caches are automatically garbage 
collected.

TermsFilter is in "contrib" and is stand-alone so should work with most 
Lucene versions.
Your implementation looks to scan the whole termEnum whereas TermsFilter 
looks up only the selected terms using reader.termDocs(term). 
Benchmarking will tell you which is faster. I'd be interested to know 
the results.
