SUBJECT: Multiple indexes
DATE: 2 Mar 2005

Hi

My site has two types of documents with different structure. I would
like to create an index for each type of document. What is the best
way to implement this?

I have been trying to implement this but found out that 90% of the
code is the same.

In Lucene in Action book, there is a case study on jGuru, it just
mentions them using multiple indexes. I would like to do something
like them.

Any resources on the Internet that I can learn from?

Thanks,
Ben
