SUBJECT: Sorting isn't working for my date field
DATE: 21 Feb 2005

Hi

Do I need to store and index the field I want to sort? Currently I am
only indexing the field without storing nor tokenizing it.

I have a date field indexing as yyyyMMdd and I have two documents with
the same date. When I do my search with:

searcher.search(query, new SortField("date", true));
searcher.search(query, new SortField("date", false));

they both return the same order.

Any idea? Thanks.

Ben
