Hi Rony

Very impressive. Is it possible for you to provide some information
about the technology behind it? Like how do you craw other job sites
and how often you do it. Do you use any other open source software and
what are they?

I think you should clean up the data in the "Recent Searches" area, it
doesn't make sense for me to see:

company%3Amicrosoft

It does make sense if you display:

company:microsoft

Cheers,
Ben
