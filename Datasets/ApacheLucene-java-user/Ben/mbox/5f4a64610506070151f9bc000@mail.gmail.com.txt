SUBJECT: Re: Lucene in clustered environment (Tomcat)
DATE: 7 Jun 2005

My cluster is on a single machine and I am using FS index.

I have already integrated Lucene into my web application for use in a
non-clustered environment. I don't know what I need to do to make it
work in a clustered environment.

Thanks,
Ben
