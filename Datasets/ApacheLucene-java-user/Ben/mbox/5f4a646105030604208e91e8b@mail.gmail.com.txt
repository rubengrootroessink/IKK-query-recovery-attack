SUBJECT: Alerts for search results

Hi

I would like to allow users on my site be able to create alerts base
on the search keywords for every newly posted article. It would be
good to send out the alert emails hourly, daily or weekly, etc.

Anyone has any experience in this area? What are the best practices
when implement such feature? I would imagine it's going to take a lot
of resources to do a search for each keyword.

Any guidance is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Ben
