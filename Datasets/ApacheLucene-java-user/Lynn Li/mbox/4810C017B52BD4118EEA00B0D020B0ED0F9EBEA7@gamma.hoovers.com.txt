I investigated how the algorithm implemented in this spell checker
compares with my simple implementation of a spell checker.

First here is what my implementation looks like:

//Each word becomes a single Lucene Document

//To find suggestions:
   FuzzyQuery fquery = new FuzzyQuery(new Term("word", word));
   Hits dicthits = dictionarySearcher.search(fquery);

For a simple test I misspelled brown, as follows:
 * bronw
 * bruwn
 * brownz

To validate my testcases I checked if Microsoft Word and Google had
any idea what I was trying to spell.  Google suggested brown, brown,
browns, respectively.

Words suggestions were:

bronw==>brown, brow
bruwn==>brown, brawn, bruin
brownz==>browns, brown

The suggestions using  David Spencer/Nicolas Maisonneuve's algorithm
against my index were:

bronw==>jaron, brooks, citron, brookline
bruwn==>brush
brownz==>bronze, brooks, brooke, brookline


The suggestions using my real simple algorithm against my index were:

bronw==>brown, brwn, brush
bruwn==>brown, brwn, brush
brownz==>brown, bronze

It appears that  David Spencer/Nicolas Maisonneuve's Spell Checking
Algorithm returns a broader result set than most commercial algorithms
or a real simple algorithm.  I will be the first to say, that this is
just anecdotal evidence and not a rigourous test of either algorithm. 
But until extensive testing has been done I'm going to stick with my
real simple dictionary lookup.
