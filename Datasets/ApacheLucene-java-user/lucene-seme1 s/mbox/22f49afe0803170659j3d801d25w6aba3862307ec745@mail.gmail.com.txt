SUBJECT: Indexing/Querying Annotations and Fields for a document
DATE: 17 Mar 2008

Hello,

I am a newbie here and still experimenting with Lucene. I have annotations
and features generated by GATE for many documents and would like to index
the original content of the documents in addition to the generated
annotations. The annotations are in the form of [<Person> John </Person>
loves fishing]. I would like to be able to search using the Person
attribute.

Any hint or suggestion is highly appreciated

regards,
JK
