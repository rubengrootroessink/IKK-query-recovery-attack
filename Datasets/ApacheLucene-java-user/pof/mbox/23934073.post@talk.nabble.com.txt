SUBJECT: Re: How to distribute lucene using rsync
DATE: 8 Jun 2009


Is their a way to address this without Solr? I was looking at Solr today and
it looks like a lot of piss-farting around just to backup an index. I also
found their explaination on
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CollectionDistribution poorly explained, so I am
a bit confused with the whole process.
