Try to use CJK analyzer for both indexing and searching chinese language.
Then you won't need "text"->"*text*" transformation.

There might be some false positives in the results though.
You can also may want to try smartcn analyzer which is dictionary based, but
I have no expertise to evaluate the results (we still use CJK for asian
languages, as there are no complains so far)
