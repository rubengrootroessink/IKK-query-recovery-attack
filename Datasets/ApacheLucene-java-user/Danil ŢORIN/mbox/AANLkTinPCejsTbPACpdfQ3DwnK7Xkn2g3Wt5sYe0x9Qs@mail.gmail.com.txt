There are no noticeable performance gains/loses when moving to 64 bit,
assuming is the exactly same hardware (just 64bit OS), same index and
reasonable amount of java heap
(keep in mind that if you had 2gb on 32 bit you'll need almost 3gb on
64 bit due to lager pointer representation)

But once your index grows...heap grows, GC pauses might be quite
unpredictable on such large heaps.
That's why most people for 10 fold growth will recommend scale out,
instead of scale up.

But it depends a lot on how your index is structured, what kind of
queries you run, how often you update your index, and so on.

YMMV...the only to find out what works for you is to try it.

to know about its performance and if anyone in this group has already tried using it.
