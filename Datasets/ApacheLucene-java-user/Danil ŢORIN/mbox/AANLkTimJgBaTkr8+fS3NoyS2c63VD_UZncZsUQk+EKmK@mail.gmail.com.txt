Is it possible for you to migrate to 2.9.x ? Or even 3.x ?
There are some huge optimization in 2.9 on reopening indexes that
significantly improve search speed.

I'm not sure..but I think indexWriter.getReader() for almost realtime
was added to 2.9, so you can keep your writer always open and get very
cheaply a new reader on each search request.
