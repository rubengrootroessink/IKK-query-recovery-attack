SUBJECT: Re: Questions about Lucene usage recommendations
DATE: 27 Sep 2010

Lucene 2.1 is really old...you should be able to migrate to lucene 2.9
without changing your code (almost jar drop-in, but be careful on
analyzers), and there could be huge improvements if you use lucene
properly.

Few questions:
- what does "all data to be indexed is stored in DB fields" mean? you
should store in lucene everything you need, so on search time you
shouldn't need to hit DB
- what does "indexing is done right after every modification" mean? do
you index just the changed document? or reindex all 1.4 M docs?
- do you sort on some field, or just basic relevance?
- how big is each document and what do you do with it? maybe
highlighting on large documents causes this?
- what's in the document? if it's like a book...and almost every word
matches every document...there could be some issues
- is the lucene the bottleneck? maybe you are calling from remote
server and marshaling+network+unmarshaling is slow?

Usual lucene patterns are (assuming that you moved to lucene 2.9):
- avoid using NFS (not necessary a performance bottleneck, and
definitely not something to cause 2 minutes query, but just to be on
the safe side)
- keep writer open and add documents to the index (no need to rebuild
everything)
- keep your readers open and use reopen() once in a while (you may
even go for realtime search if you want to)
- in your case, I don't think optimize will do any good, segments look
good to me, don't worry about cfs file size
- there are ways to limit cfs files and play with setMaxXXX, but i
don't think it's the cause of your 2 minute query.
