It depends what you call a server :
  - 4 dual Xeon, 64G RAM, 1TB of 15000 rpm raid10 hard-disks is one thing
  - 1 P4, 512M RAM, 40G 5400 rpm hard-disk, Win2K is completly something else

It depends on index structure and the size of the documents you index/store .

It depends on the way you query your index:
 - simple TermQuery, top 500 by relevancy, should be fast
 - complicated fuzzy and prefix query sorted by a string field,
retrieving 10k stored document, will be definitely slow

It depends what it "slow" for you...1 msec, 50 msec, 1 sec, 1 min ?

I saw indexes with 100 millions documents and tens of Gb in size with
reasonable performances (on reasonable hardware)
