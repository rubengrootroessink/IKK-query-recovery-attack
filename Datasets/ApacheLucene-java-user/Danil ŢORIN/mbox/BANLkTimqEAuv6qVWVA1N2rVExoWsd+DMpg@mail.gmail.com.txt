It depends....

If all documents are distinct then, yeah, go for it.

If you have multiple versions of same document in your data and you
only want to index the latest version...then you need a clever way to
split data to make sure that all versions of document will be indexed
on same host, and you won't have duplicates later.

But my biggest concern is: if your index is that big that you need to
index it on different hosts, are you sure you want it to be combine in
a single index?
Maybe it's a good idea to partition it?
