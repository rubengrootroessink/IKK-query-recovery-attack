Thanks Otis for you reply.

If I want to solve the problem that I have defined in my previous mail,
what is the suggested approach? 

Thanks,

Hello Sreedhar,

This is the expected behaviour.  The query is run against each index,
and it won't have any matches in either index, because neither index
has both fields.
