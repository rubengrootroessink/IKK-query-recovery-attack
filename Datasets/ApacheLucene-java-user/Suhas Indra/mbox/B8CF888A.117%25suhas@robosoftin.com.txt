SUBJECT: documentation on Lucene
DATE: 2 Apr 2002

Hello folks,

I am new to Lucene search engine. I have read about the power of Lucene in
indexing and search. I just browsed through the site
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene
to find about the documentation on Lucene classes. But I was unable to find
the required information(about the abstract classes and implementation of
the same). Is there any documentation available on other sites? If so please
forward me the same.

Thanks and Regards

Suhas
