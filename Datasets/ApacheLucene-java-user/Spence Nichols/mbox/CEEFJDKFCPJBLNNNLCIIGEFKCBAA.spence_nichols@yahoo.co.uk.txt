The index location specified in the configuration file must be the same as
that specified for the -index parameter when running IndexHTML .  Use an
absolute path for both to make sure its looking at the same location.

Looks like you may need to restart Tomcat to see your new configuration.jsp
file.

  Hello,
  I am trying to do search for Standalone. I made it up to configuration
level. All is working well. But when I try to search in
  http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/index.jsp , I get
  Welcome to the Lucene Template application. (This is the header)

  ERROR opening the Index - contact sysadmin!

  While parsing query: C:\opt\lucene\index not a directory


  Jakarta Lucene Template WebApp 1.0

  These are the steps that I have followed


  C:\Progra~1\Apache Tomcat 4.0\java
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index mysearch ..
  I got a directory named "mysearch" in c:\Progra~1\Apache Tomcat
4.0\mysearch
  I got a direcotory named "luceneweb" in tomcat\webapps\luceneweb after
copying luceneweb.war file to tomcat/webapps

   I have already configured the configuration.jsp and made changes to
indexLocation as C:\\Program~1\ApacheTomcat 4.0\mysearch; I am attaching my
configuration.jsp for your review.

  I updated my .war file too. But why am I getting this error?

  Thanks
