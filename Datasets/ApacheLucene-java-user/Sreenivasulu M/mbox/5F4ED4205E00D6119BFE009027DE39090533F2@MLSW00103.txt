DATE: 20 Feb 2002

Hello All,
	I am using Lucene in a site to search on HTMLs. Can anyone help me
how to display the summary containing the searched keyword. I think the
summary is predefined in the Document Object  while creating index. How can
I dynamically select summary depending on the search keyword? Is there any
max. limit for the summary length?

Please do respond quickly. Thanks in advance.

regards,
sreeni
