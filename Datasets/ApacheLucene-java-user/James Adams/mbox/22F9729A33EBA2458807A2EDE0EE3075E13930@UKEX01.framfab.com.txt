Surely it's best to have a specific analyzer for each language?

Would support for multiple Analyzers with a single index require a
different IndexWriter for each Analzser/language?  Would you then need
to manage the disk access of these regarding locking etc, so two
IndexWriter's can not do so at the same time?

But then, if you do so, you do not benefit from any specialized Analyzer

you could use for each language, do you?
Then again, maybe it's not that interesting to use specialized analyzers

for each language?.
