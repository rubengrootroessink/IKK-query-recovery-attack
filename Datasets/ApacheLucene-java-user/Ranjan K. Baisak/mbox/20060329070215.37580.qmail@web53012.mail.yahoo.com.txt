I am using HTMLparser to parse all html pages and to
get required information out of that.
Let me tell you my crawler.
I have to search for all pages of group website(e.g.
www.group.com and it contians links to
news.groups.com, forum.news.com etc...).So I will get
all links of group website using Parser and download
all html pages.
Once download is completed, I will use html parser to
parse and get required information. This is based on
business requirement.
Then I would create Lucene index using Lucene.
Insearch I am using lucene api as well as Lucene
highlighter utility to highlight search tokens.

I used to refresh my index on everyday. This is based
on crone job in Spring.

Hope it would help you for your requirement.
Incase you need any help please IM me
ranjanbaisak@yahoo.com
