SUBJECT: Suggestion needed for extranet search
DATE: 21 Jan 2005

I am planning to move to Lucene but not have much
knowledge on the same. The search engine which I had
developed is searching some extranet URLs e.g.
codeguru.com/index.html. Is is possible to get the
same functionality using Lucene. So basically can I
make Lucene as a search engine to search extranets.

regards,
Ranjan
