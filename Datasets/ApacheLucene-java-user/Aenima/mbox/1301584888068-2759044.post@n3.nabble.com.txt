SUBJECT: Storing Semantic Role labeling information with Lucene
DATE: 31 Mar 2011

Hi to everyone,
I'm new with Lucene and I'm trying to store SRL information in Lucene
indexes. Since it is a metadata I thought that payloads could be of some
use, but I need to store String not a numerical value. I need to be able to
search by word as well as by SRL information.
Is it possible to do it with payloads or should I use something else? At
present I'm working with Lucene 2.9.4

Thanks in advance
