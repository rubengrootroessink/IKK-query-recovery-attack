Hi Erik,

Thanks for your reply. Have you tried it on a collection yet? I'd love 
the get some of your feedback. I have limited knowledge of the 
underlying capabilities of the lucene library, which is a complement to 
you, since it was extremely easy to integrate lucene. But I'd like to 
get more out of  lucene, such as incremental indexing, to name one. On 
the otherhand I'm interested in general requirements and wishes for the app.

regards,

  Michael Franken
