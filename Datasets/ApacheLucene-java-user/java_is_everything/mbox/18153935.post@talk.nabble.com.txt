SUBJECT: Doubt on IndexWriter.close()
DATE: 27 Jun 2008


Hi all.

IndexWriter.close() API states that ::

"Flushes all changes to an index and closes all associated files.".

What does "closes all associated files" mean, since we are apparently able
to still addDocument() even after calling IndexWriter.close() ?


Looking forward to a reply.
