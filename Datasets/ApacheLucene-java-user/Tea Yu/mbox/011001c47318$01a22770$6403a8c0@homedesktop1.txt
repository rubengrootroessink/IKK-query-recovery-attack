Mark,

I'm also planning a distributed index system.  After reading some code, I
think it's more efficient to get rid of Hits and work directly with TopDocs
returned by ParallelMultiSearcher.search(), I dun need the cache anyway as I
dun need stateful netvigation.

Another question is - does each Hits.doc(i) lead to an obj
serialization/traffic/deserialization?  Do we need a ValueListHolder to
optimize that?

I also wonder why many search() methods don't throw RemoteExceptions, any
idea?

Thanks
Tea
