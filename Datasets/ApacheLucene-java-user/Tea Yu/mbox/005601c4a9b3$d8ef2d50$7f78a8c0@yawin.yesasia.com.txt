SUBJECT: Re: multifield-boolean vs singlefield-enum query performance
DATE: 4 Oct 2004

Hi,

For the following implementations:

1) storing boolean strings in fields X and Y separately
2) storing the same info in a field XY as 3 enums: X, Y, B, N meaning only X
is True, only Y is True, both are True or both are False

Is there significant performance gain when we substitute "X:T OR Y:T" by
"XY:B", while significant loss in "X:T" by "XY:X OR XY:B"?  Or are they
negligible?

Thanks!

Tea
