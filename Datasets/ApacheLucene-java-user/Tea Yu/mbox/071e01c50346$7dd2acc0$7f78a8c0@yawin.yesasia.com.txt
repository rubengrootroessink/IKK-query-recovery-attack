SUBJECT: Re: Optimal index structure
DATE: 26 Jan 2005

  How many total documents will be there?  I'll opt for a single index if
search in "all categories" meets the performance target, else you may want
to consider distributed searchers.  arguments for a single index:

  1) all doc scores will have to be calculated anyway leveraging Searcher or
(Parallel)MultiSearcher which should be most expensive (with a slight
overhead to aggregate and sort the docs in the latter)
  2) you'll most likely want to aggregate N categories into an index anyway
to avoid having too many opened files
  3) most of the time will be spent in context switching if having too many
indexes searched in parallel

  an alternative will be to optimize the structure base on usage pattern,
e.g. having 1 full category index and several sub-categories indexes, if
reindexing is not a problem
