SUBJECT: use of FieldInvertState class
DATE: 19 Jul 2011

Dear Lucene developers,

I am a student from an University in Italy and I am using Lucene for a
project.

I need to use the *FieldInvertState* class in order to get all the values of
a given field state at indexing time. Is there a method that returns a *
FieldInvertState* object? Is there any tutorial on how to use it?

Thanks.

Best regards.

Raffaele Branda.
