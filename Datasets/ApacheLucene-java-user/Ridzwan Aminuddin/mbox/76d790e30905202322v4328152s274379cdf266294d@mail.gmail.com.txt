hi can someone point me in the direction of how i can get a string array of
the corpus/index vocabulary from the index using an indexreader?

Currently this is what i am doing:

IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(indexdirectorypath);
termenumvar = reader.terms();

then i iterate through this termenum using the term() function while
termenum.next() still exists.

Is there a more simple refined way to do this? Thanks

Thanks.
