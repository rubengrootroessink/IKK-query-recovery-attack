SUBJECT: Greetings and my first question - Is it a good practise to store application configuration in Lucene
DATE: 1 Feb 2006



I have just joined this user group, but I probably will be asking questions / contributing
for a while now as I am starting to work on a product which will use Lucene exclusively.

Still in the designing phase, and I see that we need to manage several user / application
specific configurations and I am exploring the idea of storing the configuration information
also in the Index, may be create a separate index just for the configuration, because each
module of the application will have access to Lucene classes.

I know technically this can be done, but are there any best practises which discourage this?

Thanks in advance.
