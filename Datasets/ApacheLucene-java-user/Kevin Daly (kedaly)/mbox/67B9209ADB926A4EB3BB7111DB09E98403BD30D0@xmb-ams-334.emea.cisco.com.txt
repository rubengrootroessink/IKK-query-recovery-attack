SUBJECT: CLucene and Lucene
DATE: 16 May 2008

I am have a question concerning interop between CLucene and Lucene. It
is possible to have a C++ Application using CLucene acting as an
IndexWriter, and then have a Web Applicaltion using Lucene to query the
index. Could there be issues with locking under load for example.
 
I have done some basic test where I can write/read to/from index using
Clucene and Lucene.
 
- Kevin.
