Hi Grant,

You're welcome to use any of my slides (Dave's got them), with attribution
of course.

BUT....

Have you considered a section something like "why the hell do you think
Relevancy tweaking is gonna save you!?!?"

Basically that, as a corpus grows exponentially, so do results list sizes,
so ALL relevancy tweaks will eventually fail.  And FACETS (or other
navigators) are the answer.  I've got slides on that as well.

Of course relevancy matters.... but it's only ONE of perhaps a three pronged
approach:
1: Organic Relevancy and top query suggetions
2: Results list Navigators, the best the system can support, and
3: Data quality (spidering, METADATA quality, source weighting, etc)

Mark
