Hi Otis

  May be i am asking for more.. is there some class that accepts this
document field terminology, would you be in a position to name out the class
name,

 and also i did not understand clearly what u mean by creating Field form
the text  and than create document form these field....

 The Q are...

 1)  How to decide how much or what to be in a field....

 2) and than how much and what to be in document.

 Considering the PDF file might have 300+ pages.. than how much logical
field and hence document can be created....

 I think i am acting like an idiot asking the above Q... may be things will
be more cleared if i know about this demo class and the understanding of the
Fields and document categorization.

 wait for your positive reply.

Cheers
Vin.

Once you extract the content of the PDF and have it in your String
variables, you can create Fields with them, then create Documents with
Fields, and finally add those Documents to IndexWriter, which indexes
them.

Please look at the demo code that comes with Lucene first.
