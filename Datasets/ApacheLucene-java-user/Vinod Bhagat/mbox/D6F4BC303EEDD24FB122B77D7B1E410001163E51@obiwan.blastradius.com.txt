SUBJECT: Integrating the PDF Extract With Lucene!!!!
DATE: 17 Oct 2002

Hi Gurus

 I manage to get the content form the PDF file using the JPedal libraries.
Now i need to use this content to Index inside Lucene, so that PDF
(binaries) files can be searched/indexed by Lucene. 

And i am new with Lucene. Can anyone share there experience of indexing the
extracted content from PDF into Lucene. How to go about it, i have no idea
at the moment?

 Wait for the positive and early response.

 Best Regards.

 Vin
