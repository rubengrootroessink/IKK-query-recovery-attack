DATE: 14 Oct 2002

Dear People

  I am using Lucene and one of the requirement is to index PDF. I am using
JPEDAL's  API to extract text from PDF.  Till now i manage to get the text
of the first page, I am using the ExtractTextObject.java class to do the
above. But i want to extract the complete text of the PDF file. Have anyone
done this and possible could guide me towards it.

 Appritiate for your positive and quick reply.

 Cheers
Vin.
