SUBJECT: RE: Clarity: Is there a Query boosting 50-50 over 1000-1 ?
DATE: 29 Aug 2008

Sorry to mislead you. The query output like: +((TITLE:A | BODY:A) (TITLE:B | BODY:B)).
Let me explain it. Say S(A) means score of query A; TF(A) means term freq of A in the current
document.
Currently I'm using BooleanQuery to combine them to a query, if TF(A)=1000 and TF(B)=1 in
document D1, TF(A)=50 and TF(B)=50 in document D2, then usually D1 has higher score than D2.
But I want D2 show on top of D1 since D2 is more significant from our customer's point of
view. So my question is if there is an existing query can handle this case or I should create
a new query class. My idea is compute final score with S(A) * S(B) instead of S(A) + S(B)
like BooleanQuery. If I have to create my own query, could you give my some advices?

Thank you so much,
Shi Hui

Can you share your query generation code?  Your description doesn't
make sense to me and I wonder how you are creating and running the
searches.

Can you run the explain() method on your documents?

Also, FWIW, it sounds like you are prematurely optimizing.   For every
query you ever do in your entire life (or until search engines are
capable of reading your mind, and even then, I'm not sure) on any
search system, you will be able to find at least one result that you
think is better than one that is ranked higher.  Now, if you told me
you had 50 queries that all scored badly, that is different.
