SUBJECT: Clarity: Is there a Query boosting 50-50 over 1000-1 ?
DATE: 27 Aug 2008

Hi,

I think I should clarify my question a little bit. I'm using BooleanQuery to combine TermQuery(A)
and TermQuery(B). But I'm not satisfied with its scoring algorigthm. Is there other queries
can boost up the documents with 50 of A and 50 of B on top of documents with 1000 of A and
1 of B? And I'm looking at the source code and found lots of classes are not public and some
important methods are protected. What's the reason? Why make them public and let users to
customize the Query easily?

Thank you very much,
Shi Hui

Hi,

Say, I have a query with two terms: A + B, I want to return the documents with 50 of A and
50 of B on top of documents with 1000 of A and 1 of B. Is there an existing Query class can
handle this case or I have to implement a new Query?

Thank you,
Shi Hui
