SUBJECT: Is there a Query boosting 50-50 over 1000-1 ?
DATE: 27 Aug 2008

Hi,

Say, I have a query with two terms: A + B, I want to return the documents with 50 of A and
50 of B on top of documents with 1000 of A and 1 of B. Is there an existing Query class can
handle this case or I have to implement a new Query?

Thank you,
Shi Hui
