SUBJECT: how do I get my own TopDocHitCollector?
DATE: 9 Jan 2008


Question:

The documents that I index have two id's - a unique document id and a
record_id that can link multiple documents together that belong to a
common record.

I'd like to use something like TopDocs to return the first 1024 results
that have unique record_id's, but I will want to skip some of the
returned documents that have the same record_id. We're using the
ParallelMultiSearcher. 

I read that I could use a HitCollector and throw an exception to get it
to stop, but is there a cleaner way?
