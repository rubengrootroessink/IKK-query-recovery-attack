This may seem like a na√Øve question - since the garbage collection is not enforcable, is it
possible to send a flag to the IndexReader to give this up once the reader is no longer needed?

An IndexReader holds open the files... this is a feature.  Not holding
the file open would mean that the index would actively change while
being searched.  Lucene is designed to search on a static index (but
one that can be updated in the background with no impact to the
current open readers).
