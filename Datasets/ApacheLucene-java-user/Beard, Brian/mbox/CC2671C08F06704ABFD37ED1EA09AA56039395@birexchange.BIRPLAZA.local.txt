SUBJECT: index integrity detection in lucene 2.1.0?
DATE: 16 May 2007



I noticed in previous discussion about some index integrity detection
classes that were around in version 1.4 (NoOpDirectory or
NullDirectory). Does anyone know if this in the 2.1.0 release? I didn't
see in 2.1.0 or the contrib folders.
