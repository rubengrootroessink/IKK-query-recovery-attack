Currently the default setting is being used with our setup, so
autoCommit is true. I'll set this to false to see if it improves.

Question: If autoCommit is false, does this apply to optimization also,
so that during an hour long optimization that gets killed in the middle,
will the index be in the left in the initial state before optimization
started?

autoCommit=false will definitely help, and there is normally no reason
not to use it.
Bigger batches (or a single batch) will also help indexing speed.  A
single IndexWriter session can now avoid copying stored fields on
segment merges.
