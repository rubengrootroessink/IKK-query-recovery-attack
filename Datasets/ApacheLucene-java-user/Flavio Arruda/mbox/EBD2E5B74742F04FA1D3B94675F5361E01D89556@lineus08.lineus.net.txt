SUBJECT: Index problem
DATE: 8 Apr 2002

Hi everybody,
 
All documents of my application (indexed by Lucene) came from a Web Form which 
the application´s Administrator can change/remove/add (fields) regularly.
 
Researching Lucene´s FAQs I got that the only way to alter a indexed
document (adding index, deleting index, modify fields) is deleting the given
document and after this adding the modified version. Unfortunately this looks
very slower on my application, because I have thousands of documents of each
Form.
 
My questions are:
  - Are there any eficient way to do what I need using Lucene?
  - If not, where is the best place to modify Lucene code? Is someone working on this?
 
 Thanks by advance and best wishes,
 
                Flavio
