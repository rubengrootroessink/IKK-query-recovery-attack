Hi,
I have an index with field "documentNumber". There are 10 documents. One of the documents
has documentNumber A5058970

I want to return all matches where documentNumber != A505*. I should get 9 docs back.

I construct a query like

wq = WildcardQuery("documentNumber","a505*")

BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
bq.addQuery(wq,false,true);

I always get no results for this type of query.

Ideas?
