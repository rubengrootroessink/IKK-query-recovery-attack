Hi,
Suppose I want to match documents where fieldX is equal to "A" OR "B". Is the following correct?

BooleanQuery bq = new  BooleanQuery();

Term a = new Term("fieldX","A");
Term b = new Term("fieldX","B");

TermQuery tqA = new TermQuery(a);
TermQuery tqB = new TermQuery(b);

bq.add(tqA,false,false);
bq.add(tqB,false,false);

Then the code searches on bq

Does this do what I want? I can't get it to work.
