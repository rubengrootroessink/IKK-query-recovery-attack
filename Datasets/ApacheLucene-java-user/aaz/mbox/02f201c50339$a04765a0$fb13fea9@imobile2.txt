SUBJECT: multiple filters
DATE: 25 Jan 2005

Hello,
Every document in my index has 2 date related fields.

created_date and modified_date stored via the DateField.dateToString()

Users want to be able to search via such between like queries such as:
(where modified_date > X AND modified_date < X AND created_date >= created_date =<
X)

Now I tried using RangeQuery's for this but quickly ran into the TooManyClauses exception
issue. The next thing I am looking at is the use of DateFilters to pass in with the query
at searcher.search(). However the interfaces only supports one filter. Is it possible to pass
multiple filters that would be needed for my example above?

thanks
