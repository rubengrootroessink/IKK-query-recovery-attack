SUBJECT: searching on for null/blank field val
DATE: 13 Nov 2002

Hi,
We have a document with 2 Fields.

a) title = "X"
b) fieldX = ""  

How can I do a search to only get documents where fieldX = "". When I construct a TermQuery
against FieldX with "" as the value I get no results. What is the best way to do searches
for such values or should we create some psuedo null/blank placeholder to store in such fields
with blank values?

thanks
