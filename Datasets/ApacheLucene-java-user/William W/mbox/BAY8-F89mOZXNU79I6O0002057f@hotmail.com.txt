Hi Erik,
I'm using Lucene more than one year in our project. Lucene gave us the 
flexibility that we need ( - the like %something  syntax :).
But... I would like to know if we are doing everything in the best way 
(nothing in particular).
Why don't you write a book about Lucene ? : )
Thanks Erik,
William.
