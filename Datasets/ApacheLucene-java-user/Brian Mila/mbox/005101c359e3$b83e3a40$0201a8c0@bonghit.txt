SUBJECT: Re: NLucene up to date ?
DATE: 3 Aug 2003

I talked to one of the maintainers of NLucene and he said that he was
planning on releasing a 1.2 version (not beta apparently) in two months.
That was back in June and I haven't heard or seen anything since then so I
cant really say if it is still being actively developed.  Sounds like you
are doing the same thing I am doing which is adding functionality that you
need on your own.  I've also added a few things to NLucene like multifield
queries and the default boolean operator setting.

term position score factoring, etc).
