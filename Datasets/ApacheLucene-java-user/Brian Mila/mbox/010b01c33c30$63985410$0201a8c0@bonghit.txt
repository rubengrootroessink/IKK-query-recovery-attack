That might be an option, but I'm using NLucene and C# so porting a full java
app is more solution than I'm looking for.

That's not quite what I wanted, actually.  I don't intend to use a
dictionary at all.  My
hope is that the misspelling should be close enough to the correct spelling
that
the soundex code would be the same (i.e., spelling and speling and spellling
would
all have the same soundex code).
