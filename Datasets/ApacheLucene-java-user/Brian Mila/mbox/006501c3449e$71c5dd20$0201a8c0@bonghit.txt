Jagdip,

You could try using the .NET port of Lucene.  I haven't tried doing
any asp.net yet but I imagine it should be fairly easy to connect to.  

http://sourceforge.net/projects/nlucene

I've been using it for several months now.  It seems pretty stable and
most of the functionality is there.

Brian
