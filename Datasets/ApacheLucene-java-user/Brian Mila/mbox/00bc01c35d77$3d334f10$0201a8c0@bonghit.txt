No.  There is some code in the contributions section of the lucene site that
does highlighting (http://www.iq-computing.de/).   However, its pretty
inefficient as it scans the entire document looking for each word and then
highlights it (which is the part you have to code yourself).  I think using
IndexReader.termPositions()  to seek to the location of the terms would be a
better way to do things.  In either case, I guess the long answer to your
question is no, there is no native support for term highlighting (or context
retreival).  You'll have to write at least some code if you want to do that.
I'll be working on that very shortly for the project I'm on right now, but
I'm using the C# port of Lucene so the code will have to be changed to work
with the regular Java version (although only slightly I'm guessing).
