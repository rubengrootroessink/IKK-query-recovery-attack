SUBJECT: indexing large documents problem
DATE: 11 Dec 2002

Hello, All!
When I index large document >110000 symbols
and then try to search using words that are in the very end of that document - can't find
anything... :((

Is this a feature of Lucene or I am doing something wrong?
Any help will be appretiated.

Regards, Andrey Grishin
