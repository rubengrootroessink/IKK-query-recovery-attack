SUBJECT: Unique City, State results from index based on zip
DATE: 4 Apr 2007


I am having the following problem.
I have an index I built from a standard US Zip Code table.
Users can search for any combination of City, State and Zip.
If they search for City, State, I want to find unique results, instead of
one result for every zip code that city state has.
For instance, a search for "Mill Vally, CA" (mispelling on purpose), gives
these results:
94941, Mill Valley, CA
29715, Fort Mill, SC
46365, Mill Creek, IN
29708, Fort Mill, SC
94114, Mill Valley, CA... etc.  Notice the duplicates.

Any suggestions?
