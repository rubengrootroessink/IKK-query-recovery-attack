Hi Michael,

I'd suggest first using the explain() mechanism to figure out what's
going on.  Besides lengthNorm(), another factor that is likely skewing
your results in my experience is idf(), which Lucene typically makes
very large by squaring the intrinsic value.  I've found it helpful to
flatten lengthNorm(), tf() and idf() relative to what is used in
DefaultSimilarity.  There is a comparative evaluation of Similarity's
going on now.  You might consider looking at these:

Bug 32674 has a WikipediaSimilarity posted that you might want to try.
You might want to flatten lengthNorm() even further (e.g. all the way to
1.0), but I'd suggest trying it as is first.  If you try it, please post
your assessment.  Here's the link:
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32674

You also might find it interesting to read the thread entitled "RE:
Scoring benchmark evaluation.  Was RE: How to proceed with Bug 31841 -
MultiSearcher problems with Similarity.docFreq() ?" on lucene-dev, as
this contains a discussion of many of the issues.

Good luck,

Chuck
