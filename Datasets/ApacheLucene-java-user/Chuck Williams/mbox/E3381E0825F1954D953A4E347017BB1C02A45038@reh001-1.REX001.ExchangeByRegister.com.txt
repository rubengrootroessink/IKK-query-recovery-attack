Lucene does support stemming, but that is not what your example requires
(stemming equates "roaming", "roam", "roamed", etc.).  For stemming,
look at PorterStemFilter or better, the Snowball stemmers in the
sandbox.  For your similar word list, I think you are looking for the
class FuzzyTermEnum.  This should give you the terms you need, although
perhaps only those with a common prefix of a specified length.
Otherwise, you could develop your own algorithm to look for similar
terms in the index.
