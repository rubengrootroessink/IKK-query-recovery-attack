There is an easier way.  You should use a custom Similarity, which
allows you to define your own coord() method.  Look at DefaultSimilarity
(which specializes Similarity).

I'd suggest analyzing your scores first with explain() to decide what
you really want to tweak.  Just a guess, but your issue might be that
your idf()'s are dominating the score computation.  I had this problem
and change the default idf() to take a final square root, since Lucene
squares that contribution (which is one of its few areas that is
generally not considered best practice).  I also boost the base of the
logarithms on both tf and idf to weight those factors lower.

Good luck,

Chuck
