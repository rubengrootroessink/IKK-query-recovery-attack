Nhan,

Re.  your two differences:

1 is not a difference.  Norm_d and Norm_q are both independent of t, so summing over t has
no effect on them.  I.e., Norm_d * Norm_q is constant wrt the summation, so it doesn't matter
if the sum is over just the numerator or over the entire fraction, the result is the same.

2 is a difference.  Lucene uses Norm_q instead of Norm_d because Norm_d is too expensive to
compute, especially in the presence of incremental indexing.  E.g., adding or deleting any
document changes the idf's, so if Norm_d was used it would have to be recomputed for ALL documents.
 This is not feasible.

Another point you did not mention is that the idf term is squared (in both of your formulas).
 Salton, the originator of the vector space model, dropped one idf factor from his formula
as it improved results empirically.  More recent theoretical justifications of tf*idf provide
intuitive explanations of why idf should only be included linearly.  tf is best thought of
as the real vector entry, while idf is a weighting term on the components of the inner product.
 E.g., seen the excellent paper by Robertson, "Understanding inverse document frequency: on
theoretical arguments for IDF", available here:  http://www.emeraldinsight.com/rpsv/cgi-bin/emft.pl
if you sign up for an eval.

It's easy to correct for idf^2 by using a customer Similarity that takes a final square root.
