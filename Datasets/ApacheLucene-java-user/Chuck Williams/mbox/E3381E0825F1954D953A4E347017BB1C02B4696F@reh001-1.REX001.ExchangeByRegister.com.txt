SUBJECT: RE: structuring a multifield query
DATE: 4 Dec 2004

There are at least 3 different ways to achieve this.  You need to expand
the query such that the terms which spread a single word across fields
are combined differently from the terms which combine the words.  You
want to boost the score of the result based on different words matching,
but not count the scores of a single word matching in multiple fields as
highly.

I created a MaxDisjunctionQuery to use as the expansion of a single word
across multiple fields precisely to solve this problem.  You combine the
MaxDisjunctionQuery's within an encompassing BooleanQuery with one
field-expanding MaxDisjunctionQuery for each separate word.

Paul Elschot created a DisjunctionQuery that can be used similarly.

Doug Cutting proposed a solution using just BooleanQuery's with
different Similarity's (and some method specialization as I recall).

If you search the archives for MaxDisjunctionQuery and DisjunctionQuery
you'll find the full discussion and code.

I think that MultiFieldQueryParser should use one of these techniques,
but unfortunately it doesn't, so for most purposes I can think of it
generates poor relevance ranking.  I don't use it because of this.
