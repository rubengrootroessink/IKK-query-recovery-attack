Does this code imply you are optimizing after every new document is 
indexed?  10MB is actually a pretty small index.  Depending on your 
inflow of documents, you should be able to optimize maybe once a day, 
during your application's least busy period.  Your IndexSearcher can 
still search your documents effectively while the index is unoptimized.  
As a first step, try not optimizing at all.

 book too but everywhere it says Lucene is quite scalable and don't have trouble in indexing
even with huge data. Can anyone please provide  some insight into this?
