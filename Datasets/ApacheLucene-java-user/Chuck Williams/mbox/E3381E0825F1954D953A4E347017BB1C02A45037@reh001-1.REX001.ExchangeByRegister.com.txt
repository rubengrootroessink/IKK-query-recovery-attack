A good way to do this is to add a keyword field with whatever unique id
you have for the document.  Then you can delete the term containing a
unique id to delete the document from the index (look at
IndexReader.delete(Term)).  You can look at the demo class IndexHTML to
see how it does incremental indexing for an example.
