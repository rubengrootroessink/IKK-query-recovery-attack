It sounds like you need to pad your numbers with leading zeroes, i.e.
use the same type of encoding as is required by RangeQuery's.  If you
query with 000005 instead of 5 do you get what you expect?  If all your
document id's are fixed length, then string comparison will be
isomorphic to integer comparison.
