I think you are confusing lengthNorm and the overall normalization of the score.  For overall
normalization (prior to a final forced normalization in Hits), Lucene uses the formula you
cite, except that it never sums td_d*idf_t, using instead tf_q*idf_t again, because the former
is computationally intractable (changing even a single document changes the idf values, which
means either that all document norms would have to be computed or that the sum over the document
would need to happen at query time; the former is unacceptable for indexing time with large
indices and the latter is unacceptable for query time with large documents).

lengthNorm is by default 1/sqrt(number_terms_in_document).  It is not 1.0f by default because
1.0f is in general not a good value; e.g., a single occurrence of a term in a 1meg document
is not as significant as a single occurrence of the same term in a 1k document.  However,
I find the default value to need additional damping because it affects the score too much,
especially for small documents.  So, I use something like
   3.0f/log10(1000 + number_terms_in_document)
