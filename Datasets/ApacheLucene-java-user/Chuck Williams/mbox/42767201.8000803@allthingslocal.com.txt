There was a process to do an empirical evaluation of the current Lucene 
query parsing and default score computation formulas (DefaultSimilarity) 
vs. mine (and any others who wanted to parpticipate). Personally I think 
the point was proven, but the effort seemed to lose steam. I'm only in a 
position to lobby.

Glad it worked for you,

Chuck
