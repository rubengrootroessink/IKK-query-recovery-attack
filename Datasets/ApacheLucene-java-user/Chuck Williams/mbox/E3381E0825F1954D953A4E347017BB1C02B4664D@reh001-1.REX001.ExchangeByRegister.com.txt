If you want this to be efficient in your application, I'd suggest
integrating at a lower level.  E.g., take a look at TermScorer.explain()
to see how it determines whether or not a term matches in a field of
document.

Another approach might be to specialize BooleanQuery to keep track of
which clauses matched.
