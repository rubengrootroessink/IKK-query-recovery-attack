If I understand what you are trying to do, you don't have a problem.
You can OR to your heart's content and Lucene will properly create the
union of the results.  I.e., there will be no duplicates.

There is built-in support for this kind of thing.  See
MultiFieldQueryParser, and for better results, consider
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32674.
