You could support only terms with no operators at all, which will work
in most search engines (except those that require combining operators).
Using just terms and phrases embedded in ""'s is pretty universal.
After that, you might want to add +/- required/prohibited restrictions,
which many engines support.  After that, I think you're getting pretty
specific.  Lucene supports all of these and many more.
