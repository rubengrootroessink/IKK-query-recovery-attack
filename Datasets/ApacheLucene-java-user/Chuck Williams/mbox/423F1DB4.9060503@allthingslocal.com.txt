I solve this problem by using two separate fields:  one for range 
queries and one for sorting, each formatted appropriately.  Adds very 
little space to the index.  A bit ugly, but better than writing a custom 
hit collector.

A better solution that unified these formats, perhaps along the lines 
Hoss suggests, would be appreciated.
