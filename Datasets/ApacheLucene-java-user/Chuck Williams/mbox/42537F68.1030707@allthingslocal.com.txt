Hi Erik,

Might it be as easy as creating a SpanWilcardQuery that transforms into 
a SpanOrQuery of SpanTermQuery's, and then use a SpanNearQuery of 
SpanWildcardQuery's?  You could use a WildcardTermEnum.to generate the 
list of terms for the SpanOrQuery.  This would have some issues like 
computing the idf as the sum of all the pattern-matched terms, but it 
looks like that issue still exists with WildcardQuery too.  I haven't 
done much with SpanQuery's so this might not work out so simply, or be 
acceptably efficient.

Chuck
