SUBJECT: RE: Is there an easy way to have indexing ignore a CVS subdirectory in the index directory?
DATE: 5 Nov 2004

Thanks Daniel and Justin for the suggestions!  I have a fix and will
record my experience here for the benefit of anybody else facing this
problem:

1.  .cvsignore did not work.  CVS may ignore the Lucene index directory,
but it still insists on creating the CVS subdirectory of the index
directory.

2.  I didn't try the suggestion of defining an alias module with a CVS
directory exclude (!) restriction.  This might have worked had I limited
all my CVS operations to just work with the alias module, but this would
limit flexibility and remove a lot of the nice CVS integration features
in the Netbeans ide.

3.  Bernhard's patch solves the problem!  I had a couple minor glitches
installing it.  First, there is a missing "throws IOException"
declaration on the list(FileFilter) method he has added.  Second, the
patch is based on a newer version of FSDirectory than the version in
1.4.2, so my attempt to apply the patch automatically failed.  Applying
the patch manually and adding the throws declaration fixed all problems.

I would like to suggest that Bernhard's patch be integrated into the
next version of Lucene.

Chuck
