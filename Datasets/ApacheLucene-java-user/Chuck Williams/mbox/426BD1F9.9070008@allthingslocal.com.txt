If you want a complete count of all documents in the index for each 
category term, you should keep these counts in your own data structure 
as you index.  If you want to determine a global count for a specific 
category term on demand, I'd suggest using IndexReader.termDocs().  If 
you want to determine counts relative to the results of a particular 
search query, then you need to either iterate the results of the query 
and count occurrences of the category term(s), or perform queries that 
AND the additional category term of interest (the former will be much 
faster if you are computing this for many category terms simultaneously).
