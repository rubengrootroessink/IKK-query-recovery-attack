I'd suggest putting the URL into the index, untokenzied, and then use 
IndexReader.terms(<Term for you new URL>). This will seek to precisely 
the URL you want or the one just after it, and do it quickly. This will 
be orders of magnitude faster than approach 1, and much faster than 
using the search API if that is what you intended by approach 2. The 
disk space should not be noticeable unless your documents are very very 
small.
