There is also a long thread on this that pre-dates Wolf's solution for 
the MultiSearcher's.  I've never created the more general patch to make 
scores across separate indices normalizable.  In conversations with 
Doug, I concluded the best approach is to generalize the notion of a 
search score into a score object, thereby allowing multiple score facets 
(e.g., relevance as defined now, percent of query terms matched, etc.).  
The original idea was to use the percent of boost-weighted query terms 
matched of the highest result as the top normalized score (which fully 
defines the normalization).

Sorry it's not there...
