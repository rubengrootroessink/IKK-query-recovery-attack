SUBJECT: Maintain a backup index
DATE: 5 Jun 2007

We want to maintain a backup of our production index directory. We are
using Lucene 2.0 v. The normal way to have backup is to run a small
reindex script every 5 mins, which would pick up only those files which
were modified in that time frame and reindex them. This is one way to
rebuild and update a backup index from a master index. Is there any
other simpler way in Lucene v2.0, which would help us do the same task?
please let us know.
Please help
Thanks !
