 Would this be costlier than a fssync (filesystem) of the index folder
from the primary site to the backup site. How is it different from a
normal file sync operation). Would there be any data consistency issues
?

One option, is to incrementally reindex the files on primary site to
replicate the index of the primary site to the back up site. But, other
than this, does Lucene 2.0 provide any facility of replicating  master
index on a backup site ?

please let me know.

Divya.

Here is one way to do it:
You can read/open an index at any point, even when it's being modified.
You can then open a new FSDirectory pointing to a new directory and add
your original FSDirectory to that new FSDirectory.  That will copy the
index.  Of course, any new documents you add to the original index after
you've opened it will not be copied.  The same goes for any documents
that were still buffered in memory when you opened the index, and were
not yet flushed to disk.

Hello,

I have a scenario, where we need to set up our application, that uses
Lucene (and has on-demand indexing of documents) in Disaster-recovery
site.

The simple files/attachments used by our application can be simply
copied to the DR site just by syncing (manual copying).

Yes, we can also copy the index directory, but problem arises when we
have copy the index directory, while the index directory is being
updated, that means the Index is open.

Wont this corrupt the index directory.

Does Lucene 2.0 have support for copying opened index directory, without
corrupting it.

Please do let me know.


Thanks,
Divya.
