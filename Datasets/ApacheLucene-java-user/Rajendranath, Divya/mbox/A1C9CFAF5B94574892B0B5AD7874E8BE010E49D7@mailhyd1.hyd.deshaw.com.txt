SUBJECT: Copy index while updating the index
DATE: 10 Apr 2007

Hello,

I have a scenario, where we need to set up our application, that uses
Lucene (and has on-demand indexing of documents) in Disaster-recovery
site.

The simple files/attachments used by our application can be simply
copied to the DR site just by syncing (manual copying).

Yes, we can also copy the index directory, but problem arises when we
have copy the index directory, while the index directory is being
updated, that means the Index is open.

Wont this corrupt the index directory.

Does Lucene 2.0 have support for copying opened index directory, without
corrupting it.

Please do let me know.


Thanks,
Divya.
