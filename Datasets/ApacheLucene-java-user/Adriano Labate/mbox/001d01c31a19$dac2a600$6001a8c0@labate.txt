SUBJECT: Indexing documents for several languages
DATE: 14 May 2003

Hi,

I am new to Lucene, I know this is already discussed in the list, 
but I haven't found a solution yet.

I have to index file documents in english, french, german, etc.

I know that the same analyzer used for indexing must be used for 
the search. Ok, but how could I create an index that must use a 
different analyzer for each different language document? Same 
question for the search.

What the best practices?  

Do I have to create one index per language?

Do I have to write a custom analyzer that dynamically detects the
Document language and apply the right stemming, stop word list, etc?

Thanks.
