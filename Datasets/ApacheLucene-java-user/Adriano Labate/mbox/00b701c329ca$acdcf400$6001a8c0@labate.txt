SUBJECT: Field where the search term has been found?
DATE: 3 Jun 2003

If a do a multi field search, is it possible to know the field name
where
the search term has been found?

In my case I have documents containing several fields and I search for
a term
in all or a part of these fields.

What I would like to know is the name of the field(s) where the term
has been
found, so that I can then display for example:

"Organization: ... bla bla TERM bla bla ..."
"Category: TERM"

Any suggestions?

Regards,
Adriano Labate
