The www.textmining.org text extractors work very well for Word and pdf
documents. 
They use both PDFBox and POI.

For Excel, using POI directly is very easy. Tell me if you want to see
code samples.

I'm looking myself for a Powerpoint text extractor, if you know one...

Hi all,

I have a rather nice html parser that I got from SourceForge.  Does
anyone know of any good parsers for pdf and Microsoft Office Suite
(.doc, .ppt, .xls, etc), any help would be much appreciated.

Pete Lewis
