Lucene doesn't support native hit highlighting, but look at this web
site:

Highlighting search results with Lucene 1.3
http://home.clara.net/markharwood/lucene/highlight.htm 

I don't use it because I'm still with version 1.2, but I plan to give
it a try as soon as I upgrade
Lucene for our applications.

Hope this helps.
Adriano

Objet : native hit highlighting?


Hi,

Does lucene (any version) support native hit highlighting? If so, how?
I 
searced the mailing lists and didnt come up with anything definitive.

Thanks
