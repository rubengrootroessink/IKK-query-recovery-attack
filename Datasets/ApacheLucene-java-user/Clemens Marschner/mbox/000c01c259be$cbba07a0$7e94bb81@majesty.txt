 score_d = sum_t(tf_q * idf_t / norm_q * tf_d * idf_t / norm_d_t * boost_t)
* coord_q_d

One last thing I wondered about: Is idf_t really going into that equation
twice?
>From what I see, idf_t/norm_q is completely left out, isn't it?

tf_q is applied although it is never calculated - if a term occurs more
twice in the query (very unlikely, though) the whole sum is calculated
twice. And for each term, the equation tf_d * idf_t / norm_d_t * boost_d *
boost_f * boost_t is calculated.

Doug?
