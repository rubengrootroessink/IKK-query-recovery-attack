Yes.

MS SQL Server and Lucene are two completely different things. It's like
talking about apples and pears.

You want to index .jsp files???? Or do you mean the data that comes from
your database?
Regarding HTML files: yes you can index anything you want with Lucene, but
you have to do some manual steps. See
http://lucene.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/faq/faqmanager.cgi?file=chapter.indexi
ng&toc=faq#q11 for a pointer.

See http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/powered.html
which by the way is a page you should have read before posting ;-)
