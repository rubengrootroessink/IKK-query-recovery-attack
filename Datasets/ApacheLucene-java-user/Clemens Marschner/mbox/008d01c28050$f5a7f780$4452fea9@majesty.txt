Thanks Peter for the update,

for those of you who read the doc on the LARM crawler: I added some new
sections, reflecting the changed state of the CVS version of the crawler:

- command line options were extended such that a list of URLs can now be
transmitted, not only one.
- URL normalization was added. See the new section on that
- the HostResolver was divided from the HostManager (in order to make it
more resusable) and can now be configured from the command line

The crawler still is in fact a framework with a "reference implementation"
in the class FetcherMain. You can change many options only by editing this
main class. You can see an example there on how Lucene can be made a storage
for the crawler.
