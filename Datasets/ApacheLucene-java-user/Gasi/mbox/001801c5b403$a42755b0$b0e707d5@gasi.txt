SUBJECT: lia demos without ant
DATE: 7 Sep 2005

Hallo,


IBecause of less or better say no experience in Ant I try to run some demo applications out
of the LuceneInAction Examples folder. For example I wanted to test AnalyzerDemo.java. I set
the -classpath c:/LuceneInAction/lia/analysis because there is AnalyzerDemo.java on my system.
I tried to compile it with :
 java -classpath lucene-1.4.3.jar lia.analysis.AnalyzerDemo but it failed. The error is NoClassDefError.
Has somebody a hint why it fails


Thanks in advance



Greetings



Gaston
