SUBJECT: Re: index size doubling / optimization (Lucene 3.0.3)
DATE: 11 Feb 2011

New information: it appears that the index size increasing (not always
doubling but going up significantly) occurs when I search the index while
building it. Calling indexWriter.optimize(1, true); when I'm done adding
documents sometimes reduces the index down to size, but not always.

 

Has anyone else seen this?
