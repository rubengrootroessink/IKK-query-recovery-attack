DATE: 10 Oct 2006

Hi,

I am designing a search engine based on Lucene 2.0 and I would like to add a specific feature
to help users in their search by suggesting them a number of queries related to their seach.
e. g. user searches for "Java" and we will suggest him "Building web applications in Java"
and "SOAP technology and Java" and "Visit the Java island".

Do you know any solutions that would already exist? Otherwise do you have any idea about designing
such a feature?

Thank you!

Louis Sicard
