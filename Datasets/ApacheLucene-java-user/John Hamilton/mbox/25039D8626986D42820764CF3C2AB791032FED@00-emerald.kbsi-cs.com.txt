SUBJECT: search a subdirectory (New to Lucene)
DATE: 22 Feb 2006

I'm new to Lucene and was wondering what is the best way to perform a search on a subdirectory
or subdirectories within the index?  My thought at this point is to build a query to first
search for files in the required directory(ies) and then use that query to make a QueryFilter
and use that QueryFilter in the actual search.  Is there an easier way?
 
On an unrelated note, does anybody know of a way to get results a the section level within
a document?  For example, could I find not just a document that matches my query, but the
paragraph within that document that best matches the query?
 
thanks,
 
John
