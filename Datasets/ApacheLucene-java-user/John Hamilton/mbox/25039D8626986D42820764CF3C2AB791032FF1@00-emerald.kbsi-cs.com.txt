I reindexed with the path as a keyword field and now the PrefixQuery filter does exactly what
I need.  Thanks!

I'm going to hold off on the paragraph-level indexing for now, but that does sound interesting.

many thanks,

John

I presume by saying "subdirectory" you're referring to filesystem  
directories and you're indexing a directory tree of files.   If you  
index the path (perhaps relative from the root is best) as a keyword  
field (untokenized, but indexed) you could perform filtering on a / 
path/subpath sort of way using PrefixQuery.

As for paragraphs - how you index a "document" is entirely  
application dependent.  Maybe it makes sense to parse the documents  
before handing them to Lucene such that you're creating a Lucene  
Document for each paragraph rather than for each entire file.   
Slicing the granularity of a domain into Documents is a fascinating  
topic :)
