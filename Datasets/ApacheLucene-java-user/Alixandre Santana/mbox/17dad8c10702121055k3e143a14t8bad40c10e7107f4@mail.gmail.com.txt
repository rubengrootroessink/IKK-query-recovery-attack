SUBJECT: decrypting a PDF to read the content
DATE: 12 Feb 2007

Hi All,

I got this error when i tried to decrypt a pdf document encrypted by
com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfEncryptor class, with a null password:

"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/bouncycastle/cms/CMSException"

Does anyone know which version of Bouncy Castle is the right one to
use with PDFBox API? i dont know anything about Bouncy Castle.

IÂ´m using the LucenePdfDocument Class, from the PDFBox API to decrypt
the document, with a  null password.

Thanks in advance.
Alixandre
