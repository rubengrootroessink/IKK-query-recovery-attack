SUBJECT: Re: decrypting a PDF to read the content
DATE: 12 Feb 2007

I´m using PDFBox 0.7.3

The problem i think its that i´m encrypting a PDF with Itext, with a
"null" User/Owner password. Then i try to decrypt the doc with a class
from PDFBOx. Its exactly there that
occurs the exception. That is, a format incompability problem.

In addition, i didnt found the  "org/bouncycastle/cms/CMSException" on
PDFBox lib, as you said. So...i tried to use the  "bcprov-jdk15-135",
a bouncy castle provider. Nothing happened.

do you have any idea?

Thanks
