SUBJECT: IndexWriter.optimize() need to much time.
DATE: 5 Oct 2005

Hello,

my problem is that IndexWriter.optimize() take 20 minutes. OK it is not 
a lot of time, but I can't allow me to block the system such a long time 
:-(.
I don't know when I can take the time for optimize().

Has someone allready find a workarround for this problem ?
Is it possible to make a sleep in the 'optimize() while' so that the 
index is avaible for another Thread ? Would it be usefull ?

thanks
    Ã‰ric.
