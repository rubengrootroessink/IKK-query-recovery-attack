SUBJECT: Indexing large index with Lucene
DATE: 28 Sep 2006

I'm using Lucene since several year. We had to index allways more documents.

I'm now trying to optimise the index process with more than 1.000.000 
documents and I can see that the performance will decrease when the 
index size is greater.
I would like to know if someone as allready studied this case.

It's interactively maintained index and the fisrt index process is my 
biggest Problem.

- A document contains several attributs.
- I can't block the index during the index process (the search must 
allways be availlable).
- I need to delete the older version of document if I become an newer.

Thank you to tell me about you personnal experience.

Éric Louvard.
