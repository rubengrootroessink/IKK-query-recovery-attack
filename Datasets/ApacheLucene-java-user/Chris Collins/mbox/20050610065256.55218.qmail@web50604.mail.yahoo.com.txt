Well I am currently looking at merging too.  In my application merging will
occur against a filer (read as higher latency device).  I am currently working
on how to stage indices on local disk before moving to a filer.  Assume I must
move to a filer eventually for whatever crazzy reason I need to....dont ask it
aint funny :-}

In that case I have a different performance issue, that is that FSInputStream
and FSOutputStream inherit the buffer size of 1k from OS and IS  This would be
useful to increase to reduce the amount of RPC's to the filer when doing merges
..... assuming that reads and writes are sequential (CIFS supports a 64k block
and NFS supports upto I think 32k).  I haven't spent much time on this so far
so its not like I know its hard todo.  From preliminary experiments its obvious
that changing the OS buffersize is not the thing todo. 

If anyone has successfully increased the FSOutputStream and FSInputStream
buffers and got it not to blow up on array copies I would love to know the
short cut.
