SUBJECT: Re: Optimizing indexes with mulitiple processors?
DATE: 10 Jun 2005

I found with a fast RAID controller that I can easily be CPU bound, some of the
io is related to latency.  You can hide the latency by having overlapping IO
(you get that with multiple indexers going on at the same time).

I think there possibly could be more horsepower you can get out of the inverter
and merge aspects of the indexing.  I am currently jprobeing this at the
moment.

If your using high latency disks (such as a filer) during merge you may want to
consider increasing the size of the buffers to reduce the amount of rpc's to
the filer....however my previous attempts to change this failed.
