dear list

i want to add a entry to an index with a custom synomlist to an index. for 
example with the following text:

[i worrie about nothing beacuse this worls is crazy]

and i want to add the two custom synonyms

[anything]=>[nothing] 
and 
[lazy]=>[crazy]

so that a search for lazy, crazy nothing and anything gives me a hit to the 
entry in the index.

the point is, that prasesearch must still work. for exapmple when im searching 
for:

"this world is crazy" or "i worrie about nothing" must result in a hit, and i 
cannot just paste the sysnonyms after the existing words like this:

[i worrie about nothing anything beacuse this worls is crazy lazy]

how ca i do this? is there a possibility to insert more then one word at the 
same position?

gruess,
timon
