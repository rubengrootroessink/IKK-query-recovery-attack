SUBJECT: how to change the getPositionIncrementGap for a field which has multiple values
DATE: 21 Sep 2010

Hi, Guys:

I try to change the getPositionIncrementGap for a field which has multiple
values per document on index time.  But got no clue how to approach this
issue.  Any ideas?

Thank you very much.

Best regards,
Qi Li
