Thanks for checking it out!  My implementation is pretty simple.

Building the index, I only look at <META NAME="keywords" ...> elements
from the generated HTML, which conveniently contains all class/interface
names, as well as methods and constants.  The last two I'm currently
indexing, but not yet searching, mostly because it adds a lot to the
results, and I couldn't quite convince myself that I'd really use a
method lookup (but, if you do break on case shifts, it might be more
useful).

Each document contains the classname, the fqcn, and package name.  So I
just construct a BooleanQuery across all three with the user's input
(appending *), then sort the results by the shortest match.

I do like the idea of breaking on case, this would be especially great
for finding interface implementations (searching for readers and
writers, e.g.).

Nice!   I'm curious, what do you have cooking on the server-side?    
Having Lucene showing terms from an index of javadocs would allow for  
partial matches such that QueryParser pops ups if someone types  
"parser" (provided the text was tokenized at case shifts).
