SUBJECT: Re: PHP-Lucene Integration
DATE: 7 Feb 2005

Hi Owen

I am using Lucene with PHP, though in previous replies it was suggested 
to run Tomcat on an alternate port, but for me that was not a solution. 
I did not want to run too many tasks or too many servers
for various reasons (maintenance, security etc) and also needed to have 
control over PHP sessions and what not.

The original PHP extension for Java is broken and is far fro being 
usable in production. Instead I have been using PHP and Lucene with a 
PHP-Java-Bridge for the past 6 months or so.
It does the job very well and I can call classes and methods right out 
of PHP just like you would expect with a PHP extension.

The bridge is available here: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge


Hope this helps,
