Hi Otis

I did try, here's what I get:

[amigo@venus tmp]# time java MemoryVsDisk 1 1 100000 -r  
Docs in the RAM index: 1
Docs in the FS index: 0
Total time: 142 ms

real    0m0.322s
user    0m0.268s
sys     0m0.033s

I tried other combinations but they dont seem to affect the outcome 
either :(

thanks
