SUBJECT: Re: Not entire document being indexed?
DATE: 25 Feb 2005

Anyone else has any ideas why wouldn't the whole documents be indexed as 
described below?

Or perhaps someone can enlighten me on how to use Luke to find out if 
the whole document was indexed or not.
I have not used Luke in such capacity before so not sure what to do or 
look for?

thanks
