Have you checked Manning's site (http://www.manning.com), where you can 
order the book directly from them (the publisher) and they will also 
provide you
with a copy of an eBook in the mean time until your paperback arrives in 
mail?

P.S. two cubes of sugar with that tea, please :)

>Sorry if this is the wrong forum but I wondered what's happened to 'Lucene In Action'
in the UK.  Looking forward to reading it but amazon.co.uk report it as a 'hard to find' item
and are now quoting a 4-6 week delivery time and  tacking on a rare book charge.  Amazon.com
are quoting shipping in 24hrs.  Is this a new 'Boston Tea Party'?
