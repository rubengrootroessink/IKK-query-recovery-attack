I've done some thinking afterwards, and instead of messing with complex 
queries, would it make sense to
replace all "special" characters such as "é", "è" with "e" during 
indexing (I suppose write a custom analyzer)
and then during searching parse the query and replace all occurances of 
special characters (if any) with their
normal latin equivalents?

This should produce the required results, no? Since the index would not 
contain any French characters and
searching for French words would return them since they were indexed as 
normal words.
