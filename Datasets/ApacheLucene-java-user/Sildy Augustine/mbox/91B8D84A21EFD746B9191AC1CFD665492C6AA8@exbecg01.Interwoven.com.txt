SUBJECT: Could search results give an idea of which field matched
DATE: 12 Jul 2004

I search the index on multiple fields. Could the search results also
tell me which field matched so that the document was selected? From what
I can tell, only the document number and a score are returned, is there
a way to also find out what was the field(s) of the document matched the
query?
