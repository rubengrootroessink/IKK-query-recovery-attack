"javac" has an option "-encoding", which tells the compiler the encoding 
the input source file is using, this will probably solve the problem.
or you can try the unicode escape: \uxxxx, then you can save it in ANSI, 
had for human to read though.
or use an IDE, eclipse is a good choice, you can set the source file 
encoding, and it will take care of the compiler for you.
