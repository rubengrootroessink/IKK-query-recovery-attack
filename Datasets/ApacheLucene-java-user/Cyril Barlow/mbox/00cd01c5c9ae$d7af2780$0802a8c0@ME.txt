SUBJECT: IndexSearcher in servlet containers
DATE: 5 Oct 2005

Has anyone got experience of using the IndexSearcher in a servlet? I'm having caching problems
when there's a lot of different concurrent users with the current setup. Currently the setup
is to create a IndexSearcher per servlet doPost call and close it after. But with concurrent
requests - especially ones which are performing fairly complex ranked boolean queries that
take a few seconds are causing caching problems - sometimes a completely different set of
results will be returned or nothing at all. Has anyone come across errors like these before
or know best practices for searching in concurrent servlets?

Thanks
