query is reexecuted in order to grow the list to at or beyond the request,

200 most recently requested Document objects, so it is unlikely they will
need to be reconstituted more than once.

the so-called "low level" IndexSearcher routines which return TopDocs rather
than Hits.

How long does the Hits object stay in memory for? Until the IndexSearcher
closes? And if you just use 1 IndexSearcher would there be a big collection
of Hits in memory?
