SUBJECT: How I can find wildcard symbol  with WildcardQuery?
DATE: 19 Aug 2008


Hello    
    
For example, we have a text:    
    
" Hello w*orld"    
 it's indexed as NO_NORMS, so this phrase is term.    
    
And I have a code:    
    
Query query = new WildcardQuery(new Term("field", " Hello w*orld")); its work    
    
But I need symbol '*' as ordinary symbol, not escape symbol.    
    
The QueryParser's analogue '\\*'    
Query query = new WildcardQuery(new Term("field", " Hello w\\*orld"));    
don't wokrs.    
    
Thanks
