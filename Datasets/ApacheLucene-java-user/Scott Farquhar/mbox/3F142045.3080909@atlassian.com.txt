SUBJECT: Lucene 1.3 Release Schedule
DATE: 15 Jul 2003

Morning all!

Is there a document where I can find the release schedule for Lucene 
1.3, or a list of issues that are still remaining to be fixed?

I would like to upgrade our product (JIRA) to a later Lucene version, 
and I was waiting for 1.3 to be released.  However, I see that it has 
been in rc1 for 4 months - so I was curious to hear if I should wait for 
a final release.

Thanks for your time.  If there is a url / document answering my 
concerns - please feel free to just point me at that.

Cheers,
Scott
