SUBJECT: Default queries to using And
DATE: 3 Sep 2003

Is it possible to get QueryParser.parse() to parse queries defaulting to
'AND' rather than 'OR'?

Currently if you search for 'A B' that is the same as 'A OR B'.  What I
would like is to default to 'A AND B'.

Apologies for the simple question.  I'm guessing the answer is probably more complex
(like Lucene returning A+B, then A, then B)?  I couldn't find anything in
the FAQ about this.

Cheers,
Scott
