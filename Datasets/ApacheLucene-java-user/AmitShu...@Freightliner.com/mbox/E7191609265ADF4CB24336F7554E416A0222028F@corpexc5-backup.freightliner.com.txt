SUBJECT: Question regarding using Lucene or not
DATE: 2 Oct 2004

Hello
I have a stand-alone java application. We have a new requirement where there
will be around 1000 data files in XML format. Each of them have the same
format. Nodes will have value and attributes. In the application, the user
will search for a particular spec (the data file) by defining parameters.
The parameters are both string and numeric. For example, the model should be
Cargo and its HP value should be 55,000 or near it . If we specify tolerance
value of 5000 then it should search for all the data files where model node
is Cargo (definitive match) and HP value is between 50,000 to 60,000 with
the one having 55,000 coming as the 100% match. 
Do you think Lucene can meet this requirement or do I need to look into any
other product ?

Please let me know.

Thanks.
