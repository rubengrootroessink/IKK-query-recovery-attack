That is true, but our goal is to return the top X hits.  Some of the
potential matches are single characters (like 'F' for Ford) so we want
to apply the filter.  Of course the partial matches are unlikely to be
the user's targeted match.  I guess for 1 or 2 character inputs we could
apply only exact matches and on 3 or more apply the partial matches.

This sounds interesting.  I will take a look.

Thanks,
Peter
