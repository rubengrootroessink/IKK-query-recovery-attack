SUBJECT: highlight only some terms from query string?
DATE: 6 Sep 2007


When user inputs some terms to query by lucene, I want to only high light
some terms in some fields I specified. Is it possible?

For example:
The record has 3 fields: Name, Title, Desc.
and user search terms are: willas, SE, self des.
how can I set only the terms [willas] and [SE] high lighted in [Name] and
[Title] fields?
