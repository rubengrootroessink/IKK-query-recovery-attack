Thanks Peter,

We've used Struts and Expresso for our application. As you suggested,
SearchBean would be a good starting point to look at integrating Lucene with
it.

Another thing. Our application requires search capability to search .rtf,
.doc and .pdf files as well. Does this feature already exist?

Kindly advice.

Regards,
Rakesh.
