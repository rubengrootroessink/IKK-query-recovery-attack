SUBJECT: What is a good book on Lucene?
DATE: 28 Jun 2006

I wonder what is the best book, that can be recommended as an
introduction as well as 'in-depth' coverage of the latest version of
Lucene? There are a few in the Internet, but I was wondering which has
the most comprehensive coverage of all features, etc.

Thanks!

Vlad
