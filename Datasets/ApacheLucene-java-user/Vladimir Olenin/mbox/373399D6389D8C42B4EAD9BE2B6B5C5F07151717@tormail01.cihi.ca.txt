SUBJECT: term OR term OR term OR .... query question
DATE: 26 Sep 2006

Hi.
 
I have a question regarding Lucene scoring algorithm. Providing I have a
query "a OR b OR c OR d OR e OR f", and two documents: doc1 "a b c d"
and doc2 "d e", will doc1 score higher than doc2? In other words, does
Lucene takes into account the number of terms matched in the document in
case of the 'or' query?
 
Providing that I don't know the algorithms behind the Lucene, how does
'or' query time depends on the number of searched terms? Does it grow
linierly, exponentially? How does 'and' query time depends on the number
of searched terms? (it should decrease, right?)
 
Thanks.
 
Vlad
