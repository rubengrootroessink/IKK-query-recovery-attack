SUBJECT: search performance benchmarks
DATE: 26 Jun 2006

Hi,
 
I'm evaluating Lucene right now to use as a base for one open source
project. I found some _indexing_ benchmarks on the lucene website
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/benchmarks.html), but, after a short
browsing, couldn't find any 'runtime' performance benchmarks (Query
speed). Only one of the benchmarks contained some reference to the query
execution... Is there any other source of benchmarks I can refer to? Or
probably some heruistic rule that can help to estimate query execution
time?
 
Thanks.
 
Vlad
 
PS: let me know if details of the searched data will help in evaluation
- I'll be able to provide what I know at this point...
