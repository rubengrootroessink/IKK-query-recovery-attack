Mark,

thanks for sharing your insight and experience about LuceneIndexAccessor!
I remember seeing some people reporting some issues about it, such as:
http://www.archivum.info/java-dev@lucene.apache.org/2005-05/msg00114.html
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34995#c3

Have those issues been resolved?

Where did you get the latest release? It is not in the official Lucene 
sandbox/contrib.

Finally, are you willing to share your extended version to include your 
tweak relating to the MultiSearcher?

Thanks a lot!

Jay
