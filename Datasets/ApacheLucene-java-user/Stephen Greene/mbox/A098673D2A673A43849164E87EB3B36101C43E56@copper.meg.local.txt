SUBJECT: Term offsets for highlighting
DATE: 16 Apr 2010

Hello,

 

I am trying to determine begin and end offsets for terms and phrases
matching a query.

Is there a way using either the highlighter or fast vector highlighter
in contrib? 

I have already attempted extending the highlighter which would match
terms but would not match phrases.

 

The reason I am attempting this is the document content is stored in a
separate database.

I need to get a list of the begin and end offsets for all matches so
that I can highlight the text coming from the other database.

 

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

 

Best regards,

 

Steve
