Hi Koji,

An additional question. Is it possible to access the FieldTermStack from
the FastVectorHighlighter after the it has been populated with matching
terms from the field?

I think this would provide an ideal solution for this problem, as
ultimately I am only concerned with returning positional offsets to have
highlighting tags applied to them in a separate process. 

Thank you for your insight,

Steve

Hi Steve,

I thought you were using 2.9 or later because you mentioned
FastVectorHighlighter in your previous mail (FVH was first
introduced in 2.9). If I remember it correctly, 2.4's QueryScorer
doesn't recognize phrase, but SpanScorer does.

I'm not sure FVH offers benefit for you, but yes, FVH can
recognize phrase and highlight terms per phrase.
