SUBJECT: large document with multiple fields performance
DATE: 8 Sep 2009

Hello,

 

I am new to lucene and building an application which requires documents
with many fields to be searched.

A "project" id is being stored (not_analyzed) and all matching project
ids will be returned to be used to join other data from a database.

Will it provide better performance to store each comment field in a
separate document with the project ID and a comment ID or to store all
the comments for a single project in a single document with multiple
fields?

 

Thanks,

 

Steve Greene
