Hi Koji,

SpanScorer was not highlighting correctly for me in 2.4.x. I have
upgraded to 3.1 in the hopes of having better luck!

Thank you,

Steve

Hi Steve,

I thought you were using 2.9 or later because you mentioned
FastVectorHighlighter in your previous mail (FVH was first
introduced in 2.9). If I remember it correctly, 2.4's QueryScorer
doesn't recognize phrase, but SpanScorer does.

I'm not sure FVH offers benefit for you, but yes, FVH can
recognize phrase and highlight terms per phrase.
