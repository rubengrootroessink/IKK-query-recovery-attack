use "TokenStream" to print out the Tokens after using FrenchAnalyzer; test it work well, and
the result is just you want?

You can use another tools "Luke" to see the "Lucene index File", is there any token of "or"(French)
?
And you can query using the "Luke"...



Good Luck

Thank you for your reply. 

I am using my own FrenchAnalyzer for lexical analysis.  It extends  
org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer and my stopwords set is empty.
