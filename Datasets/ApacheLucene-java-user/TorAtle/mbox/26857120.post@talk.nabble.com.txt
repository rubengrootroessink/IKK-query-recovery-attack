SUBJECT: Wildcard searches and document boost
DATE: 19 Dec 2009


I have indexed a number of geotagged locations and want the results sorted by
relevance.

For instance, when searching for "wash*" I want "Washington" (the city) to
appear before "Washington Park", so I have boosted the "Washington"
document. Unfortunately, when using WildcardQuery, the score is always 1.0.

Luke says my query has been rewritten to "ConstantScore(myField:wash*), so
that sort of explains what's going on. But why? And short of sorting the
result, what is the solution to my problem?

Best regards,
Tor Atle
