SUBJECT: Re: Appropriate disk optimization for large index?

Mike-

Are the index files synced on writer.close()?

Thank you so much for your help.  I think the seek time is the issue,
especially considering the high merge factor and the fact that the segments
are scattered all over the disk.

Will a faster disk cache access affect the optimization and merging?  I
don't really have a sense for what of the segments are kept in memory during
a merge.  It doesn't make sense to me that Lucene would pull all of the
segments into memory to merge them, but I don't really know how.

Thank you so much,
Matt
