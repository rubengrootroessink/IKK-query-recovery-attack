SUBJECT: Spellchecker Evaluation Criteria
DATE: 15 Oct 2008


So, it appears to me that the criteria for a "good suggestion" is the n-gram
overlap of a given term, not the edit distance.

Thus, if we're looking for "britney", but we mess up and type "birtney",
"kortney" will come up before "birtney."

Is there a way to force the SpellChecker to use the edit distance?  Or does
anyone have any suggestions about this?

Thanks,
Matt
