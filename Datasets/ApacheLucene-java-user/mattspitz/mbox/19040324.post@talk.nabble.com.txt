Thanks for your replies!

Is there no way to ensure consistency on the disk with 2.3.2?

This is a little off-topic, but is it worth upgrading to 2.4 right now if
I've got a very stable system already implemented with 2.3.2?  I don't
really want to introduce oddities because I'm using an "unfinished" version
of Lucene.  Is there a rough date for 2.4's release?  I poked around the
website and couldn't find one.

Thanks,
Matt
