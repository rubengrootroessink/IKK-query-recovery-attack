Document 1: little boy is runningDocument 2:boy is littleI mean that a&nbsp; query for

I'm not clear what exactly you are asking. With your examples:Document 1: little boy is runningDocument
2:boy is littlea phrase query for "little boy" will match the first and not thesecond. Is
that what you want?a phrase query for "litter boy" won't match either, but a generalquery
might match on boy depending on how you set your must/shouldqualifiers.So maybe you should
have a 2 phase approach: do a phrase query andstop if you get hits or do a general non-phrase
query if you don't.Alternatively issue both at the same time but with the phrase queryboosted.--Ian.On

help me implement such a phrasequery?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Exact match document
add some score&gt;&gt; All other match document add 0 score.(no matter how big slop
is)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For example:&gt;&gt; Document 1: little boy is
running&gt;&gt; Document 2:boy is little&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I query "little
boy"&gt;&gt; Document 1 add score 100(Exact match)&gt;&gt; Document 2 add
score 0( not Exact match)&gt;&gt; But the two document can match the query.&gt;&gt;
user that search "litter boy" should see both the Document,&gt;&gt; but the Document
1 is on the top!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------To
