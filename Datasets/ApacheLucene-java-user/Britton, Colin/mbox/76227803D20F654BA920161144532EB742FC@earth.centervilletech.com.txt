DATE: 9 Apr 2002

I have worked with the cocoon indexer and it creates a field for each
xml-element and xml-attribute, with complex xml the number of segment
files grows out of control. There is two ways I see to change this.

1) change the cocoon indexer (I looked at this and decided against it)
2) add a stylesheet to the cocoon view to simplify the xml before
indexing (cocoon indexer uses views to extract the links and content for
indexing)

I ended up writing a webapp and indexing the html not the xml because I
also wanted to index jsp's and other things.
