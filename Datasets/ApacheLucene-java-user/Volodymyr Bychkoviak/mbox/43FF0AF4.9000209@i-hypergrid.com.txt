This is not the case.

maxClauseCount limit number of terms that can fit into BooleanQuery 
during some queries rewriting. And default value is 1024, not 32.

32 required/prohibited clauses is limitation of Lucene 1.4.3 due to 
usage of bit patterns to mask required/prohibited clauses.
You can solve this problem by using Lucene 1.9 RC or use Filters.
