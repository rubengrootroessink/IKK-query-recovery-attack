You can get Lucene 1.9.1 and make Luke use this version. (you need 
luke.jar not luke-all.jar)
version 1.9.1 contains API which is removed in 2.0 version of Lucene (as 
deprecated) and should still be able to read indexes created by Lucene 
2.0 (correct me if I'm wrong)

and then run Luke with command line like this:

java -classpath luke.jar;lucene-1.9.1.jar org.getopt.luke.Luke
