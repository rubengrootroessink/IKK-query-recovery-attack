DATE: 13 Jun 2005

hello

I'm using following code in the startup of my program


    String indexDirectory = //some init
    try {
      if ( !IndexReader.indexExists(indexDirectory)) {
        // working index doesn't exist so try to create a dummy index.
        IndexWriter iw = new IndexWriter(indexDirectory, new 
StandardAnalyzer(), true);
        iw.close();
      } else {
        IndexReader.unlock(FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexDirectory, false));
      }
    } catch (IOException e) {
      // Exception happened when trying to unlock working index
    }

regards,
Volodymyr Bychkoviak
