SUBJECT: FieldCache vs TermVector
DATE: 22 Nov 2006

Hello all.

Previous message lost somewhere, resending...

Index in my application has about 15M docs and about 6Gb in size;
I want to implement sorting on some fields, but using default approach
FieldCache size can be quite large.
But I want to keep application footprint small.

So question is:
- Can TermVector be used instead of FieldCache to implement sorting (and
other activities where FieldCache is used) ?
- Would it be much slower?
