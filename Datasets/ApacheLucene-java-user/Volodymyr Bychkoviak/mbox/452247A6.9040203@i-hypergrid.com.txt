SUBJECT: MultiFieldQueryParser vs concatenated field
DATE: 3 Oct 2006

In my application I need to implement search across several fields.

What is better approach in term of relevance scoring:
Index in separate fields and search using MultiFieldQueryParser or index 
everything as concatenated field an search using this field?

Thanks in advance.
