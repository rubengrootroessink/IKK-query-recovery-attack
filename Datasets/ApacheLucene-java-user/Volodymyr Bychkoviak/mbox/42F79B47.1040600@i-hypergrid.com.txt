SUBJECT: merging indexes together
DATE: 8 Aug 2005

Hello All.

In my program I index new information to temporary dir and after then I 
delete outdated information from main index and add new information by 
calling indexWriter.addIndexes() method. This works fine when doc number 
is relatively small but when index size grows, every call to addIndexes 
can take very long. (NOTE: new information is ONLY part of all index)

The reason I'm using this approach is that I want old information to be 
available during indexing new information and then switch as fast as I 
can to new information.

current index 336Mb / 1100000 Docs. and growing...
current time to merge indexes is about 5min.

Any ideas how to optimize this?
