Ok, I'll try to explain a bit.

User has an input (javaScript calendar) on page where he can choose some 
date to include in search. Search resolution is day resolution.

If user will enter same date in different time of date he will get 
different results (because calendar will also set current hour and 
minute in the date). But this is not right behavior.

I propose not to use GMT when rounding time to selected resolution. This 
will prevent us from situation described above.

This can be done by replacing two lines  "Calendar cal = 
Calendar.getInstance(GMT);" with "Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();"
