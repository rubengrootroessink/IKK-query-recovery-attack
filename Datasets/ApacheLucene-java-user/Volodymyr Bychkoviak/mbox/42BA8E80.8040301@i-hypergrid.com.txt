SUBJECT: Re: Question for Wildcard Search:
DATE: 23 Jun 2005

Hello
about 3 months ago I posted some idea about wildcard searching.

main idea was to index every character of input as separate term. and 
then search using PhraseQuery.
for example word "12345" would be indexed as "1" "2" "3" "4" "5". to 
find "*23*"  you can use PhraseQuery with this two terms ("2" "3"). But 
this approach is limited only to queries with wildcards in the begin or end.

Later I did some research and wrote Extension to PhraseQuery that allows 
to set term relative position to range of values (to insert gaps for "*" 
and "?") this approach is good because it does not rewrite queries and 
never run into OutOfMemory or TooManyClauses Exceptions

regards,
Volodymyr Bychkoviak
