Hi,

The best way to determine bottlenecks is profiling. (JProfiler is very 
good tool for that. It's commercial product with free evaluation)

I was indexing 1.5 million documents in 45 minutes.
before optimizing it took much more time to index. optimization was done 
through 'select' query changing.
