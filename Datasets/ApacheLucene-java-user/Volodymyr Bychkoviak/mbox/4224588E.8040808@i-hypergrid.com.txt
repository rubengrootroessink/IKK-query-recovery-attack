SUBJECT: Re: Is IndexSearcher thread safe?
DATE: 1 Mar 2005

Additional question.
If I'm sharing one instance of IndexSearcher between different threads 
Is it good to just to drop this instance to GC.
Because I don't know if some thread is still using this searcher or done 
with it.

Regards,
Volodymyr Bychkoviak
