SUBJECT: DateTools again
DATE: 2 Oct 2006

I'm using DateTools with Resolution.DAY.
I know that dates internally are converted to GMT.

Converting dates "2006-10-01 00:00" and "2006-10-01 15:00" from 
"Etc/GMT-2" timezone will give us
"20060930" and "20061001" respectively.

But these dates are identical with day resolution.

Is this bug or I'm missing something?
