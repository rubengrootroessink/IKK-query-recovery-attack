Hi Olivier!

In my code i'm using following IndexSearcher extention:

public class IndexSearcherWrapper extends IndexSearcher {

  private int referenceCount;

  private final IndexReader indexReader;

  public IndexSearcherWrapper(IndexReader indexReader) {
    super(indexReader);
    this.indexReader = indexReader;
    this.referenceCount = 1;
  }

  public IndexSearcher getReference() {
    referenceCount++;
    return this;
  }

  public void close() throws IOException {
    referenceCount--;
    if (referenceCount <= 0) {
      super.close();
      indexReader.close();
    }
  }

};

in the code obtaining IndexSearcher I do call getReference() method and 
use indexSearcher as usual (search & close);
also referenceCount initially is set to 1 to prevent underlying 
indexReader being closed after first call of close() method.

when opening new IndexSearcher (after index change) I do call close() 
method one more time ensuring this IndexSearcher will be closed as soon 
as last thread closes this IndexSearcher.

and about second question:
while changing index all open IndexReaders(and IndexSearchers) don't 
"see" changes until reopening.
