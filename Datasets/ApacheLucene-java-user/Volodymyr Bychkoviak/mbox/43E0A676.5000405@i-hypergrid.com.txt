DATE: 1 Feb 2006

As long as you have many document in index there can many unique terms 
in index.
Every 128th term(by default) is written to term info index for faster 
term lookup.
This info is loaded entirely to memory when searching so this can 
increase memory usage.
Note that this does not depends on number of documents in index, it 
depends on number of unique terms in index.

This can be changed by setting higher value in 
indexWriter.setTermIndexInterval();
Be aware of setting this value too hight because search performance will 
degrade.
NOTE: this options is available only in Lucene 1.9.

Also it can depend on number of fields in document, the way you process 
them (store, index, tokenize etc.)
