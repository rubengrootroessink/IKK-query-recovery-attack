Hi All.

In my index documents have field named "group". I need to show result of 
search in form of "N items found in M groups", where <N> is a number of 
total hits found and <M> is a number of different groups according to 
"group" field.

Does anybody has an idea to to achieve this.
P.S. It have to be fast enough, because it will be used in incremental 
search.

Thanks for answer.

Regards,
Volodymyr Bychkoviak.
