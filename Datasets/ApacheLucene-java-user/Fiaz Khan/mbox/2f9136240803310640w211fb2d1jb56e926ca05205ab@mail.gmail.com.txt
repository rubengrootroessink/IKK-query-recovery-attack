Thanks Erick....

Ok,..

I have a track called METAL MAN, this has 4 categories assigned to it like so:

GUITAR
ROCK
ROCK AND ROLL
METAL

I have another track called NOISE with the following 3 categories:

GUITAR
ROCK AND ROLL
METAL

When a user searches using the keyword ROCK, it is finding both when
really it should only find METAL MAN.

The reason for this is because... when i created the lucene index, i
concatenated all categories into one field called KEYWORDS like so:
METAL MAN keywords are: GUITAR, ROCK, ROCK AND ROLL, METAL,
NOISE keywords are: GUITAR, ROCK AND ROLL, METAL,

So therefore, when tokenized using the standardanalyser, they end up as
METAL MAN keywords are: GUITAR, ROCK, ROCK, ROLL, METAL,
NOISE keywords are: GUITAR, ROCK, ROLL, METAL,
i.e. they are tokenized on the space char words like AND are removed.

What i would like is for the tokenizer to split on the comma and leave
each keyword as is and not, for example, turn ROCK AND ROLL into ROCK,
ROLL

My attempts so far were to replace spaces with "another" char, e.g. ~.
Strip spaces from the keyword. This broke the rest of the search
engine which doesnt need to work like this.
Un tokenize, issue with this was that i could no longer partial string
search as the work ROCK was being picked up in the word FROCK.

Am i going about this the wrong way?
Caveat is that i am using .net version (2.1). Hopefully it is possible
with this version.

Hope this explains it a bit better.
