SUBJECT: sort field should not be tokenized?
DATE: 9 Jun 2010



Hello,

I'm using Lucene 2.9 and when reading java doc for the Sort class I noticed
it says "The field must be indexed, but should not be tokenized".

But I tried to sort on a tokenized field, it works too. Just wondering
what's the difference between tokenized and untokenized in terms of sort?
Why in javadoc and "Lucene in Action" they all mention that the sort field
should not be tokenzied?

Thanks,
-Fujian
