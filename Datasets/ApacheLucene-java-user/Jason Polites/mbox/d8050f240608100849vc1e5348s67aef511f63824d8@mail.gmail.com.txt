Thanks for the Jira issue...

one question on your synchronization comment...

I have "assumed" I can't have two threads writing to the index concurrently,
so have implemented my own read/write locking system.  Are you saying I
don't need to bother with this? My reading of the doco suggests that you
shouldn't have two IndexWriters open on the same index.

I know that if I try a search from a different JVM while the index is being
written I get the odd "FileNotFound" exception, so I had assumed writing
concurrently would be a bigger problem.

Of course there is a difference between multiple threads in a single JVM,
and threads in multiple JVM's (which is my situation).  But I may be able to
re-architect so I have a single JVM reading/writing the one index if it will
allow me to ignore my own locking/unlocking system.

As it turns out I have devised an alternate strategy.  Storing large amounts
of data in the index (compressed or not) seems to have the secondary effect
of slowing down retrieval of results... and even led to OutOfMemory errors
for me (presumably because the hits.doc(n) call loads the stored fields into
memory?).

I needed to store the contents of all fields, so when I re-index the
document (as some fields change) I don't lose this data (my kingdom for the
ability to "update" a field!).  I decided to store the "large" data
elsewhere outside the index (where I can store/compress it asynchronously)
and pull it out from here when I need to re-index.

Thanks again for the response.
