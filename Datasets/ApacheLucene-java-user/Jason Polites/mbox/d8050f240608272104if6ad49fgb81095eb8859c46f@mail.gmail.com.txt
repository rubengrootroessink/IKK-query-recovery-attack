Not sure what the desired end result is here, but you shouldn't need to
update the document jut to give it a boost factor.  This can be done in the
query string used to search the index.

As for updating affecting search order, I don't think you can assume any
guarantees in this regard.  You're probably better off sorting the results
manually.  The simplest solution would be to add a timestamp to each
document when it's created (milliseconds since epoch for example), then sort
by that.  This will have an impact on speed, but in my experience it's
marginal.
