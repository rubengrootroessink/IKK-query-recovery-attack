Sounds like you're a bit frustrated.  Cheer up, the simple fact is that
engineering and business rarely see eye-to-eye.  Just focus on the fact that
what you have learnt from the process will help you, and they paid for it ;)

On the issue at hand...Lucene should scale to this level, but you need a
good architecture behind it.  Google has good indexing tech, but it's their
architecture that allows them to spread the index across thousands of
servers which really gives it grunt (to the point that they invented their
own RAID-style file system).

Just think very carefully about the architecture underpinning the index.
Lucene is core-tech.  It's up to you to provide the framework to make it
hum.
