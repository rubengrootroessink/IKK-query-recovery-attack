I think they do a proximity result based on keyword matches.  So... If you 
search for "lucene" and the document returned has this word at the very 
start and the very end of the document, then you will see the two sentences 
(sequences of words) surrounding the two keyword matches, one from the start 
of the document and one from the end.

How you determine which words from the result you include in the summary is 
up to you.  The problem with this it that in Lucene-land you have to store 
the content of the document inside in index verbatim (so you can get 
arbitrary portions of it out).  This means your index will be larger than it 
really needs to be.

I usually just store the first 255 characters in the index and use this as a 
summary.  It's not as good as Google, but it seems to work ok.
