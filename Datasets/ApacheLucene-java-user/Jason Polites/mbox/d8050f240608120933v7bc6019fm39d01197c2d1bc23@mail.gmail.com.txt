This strategy can also be nicely abstracted from your main app.  Whilst I
haven't yet implemented it, my plan is to create a template style structure
which tells me which fields are in lucene, and which are externalized.  This
way I don't bother storing data in lucene that it stored elsewhere, but I
also don't bother storing data elsewhere that is available in lucene.

Of course I always have the source data from which I can do a total re-index
if necessary.  The end result is an abstraction of a "document" which (by
using a template) will automatically retrieve data from the index or from
external storage based on the meta information in the template.  This means
the app that uses the index no longer cares where the data is, and it can
re-index whenever it likes with confidence that everything will be handled
appropriately.

Unfortunately you may have transactional problems with this approach.  That
is, if you write to lucene and in the same logical transaction you write to
external storage you may have atomicity problems if one of these actions
fails.  But you can't have everything!

As long as you can "fix" the index if it gets out of sync you should be ok.
