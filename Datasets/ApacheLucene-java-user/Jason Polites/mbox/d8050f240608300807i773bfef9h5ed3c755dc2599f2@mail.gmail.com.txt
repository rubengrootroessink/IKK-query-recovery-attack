SUBJECT: Re-created fields consistently indexed?
DATE: 30 Aug 2006

Hi all,

I understand that it is possible to "re-create" fields which are indexed but
not stored (as is done by Luke), and that this is a lossy process, however I
am wondering whether the indexed version of this remains consistent.

That is, if I re-create a non-stored field, then re-index this field in a
new document, will the indexed (inverted) data be the same as in the
original version?

Thanks.
