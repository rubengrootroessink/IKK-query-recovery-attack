Agreed on the "set of unique messages", however the problem I have is with 
the "count" of the Hits.  The Hits object may contain 100 results (for 
example), of which only 90 are unique.  Because I am paging through results 
10 at a time, I need to know the total count without loading each document. 
If I get a count of 100 but a Collection of only 90 my paging breaks.

After careful consideration I have decided that the better approach is to 
create a separate "global" index in which all messages are stored.  This 
will not only relieve my duplication issue but should also scale better 
if/when there are several hundred or several thousand distinct indexes.

Thanks,
