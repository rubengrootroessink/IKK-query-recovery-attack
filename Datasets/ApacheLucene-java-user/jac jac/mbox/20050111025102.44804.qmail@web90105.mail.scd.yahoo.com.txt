SUBJECT: Please help - installation problem
DATE: 11 Jan 2005

Hi all,
 
This is jac here, and I am currently in urgent need to install Lucene on a unix machine. However,
I am not sure where to set the paths coz I am unfamiliar with Unix & am a newbie to Java
as well.
 
I have installed Lucene on the Windows version and it works but I cant understand why unix
can't.. 
 
The following paths are what I have entered:
Can someone please check for me?
 
-  PATH=.:$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin
- TOMCAT_HOME=/home/jac/jakarta-tomcat-3.2.4
- ANT_HOME=/home/jac/apache-ant-1.6.2
- CLASSPATH=$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/luc/WEB-INF/lib/lucene-1.4.3.jar:
$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/luc/WEB-INF/lib/lucene-demos-1.4.3
 
Can I also know if tomcat version 3.2.4 is sufficient for Lucene to run?
 
Thanks in advance!
 
Regards,
jac
