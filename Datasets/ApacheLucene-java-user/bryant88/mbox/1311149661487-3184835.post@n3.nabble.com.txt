SUBJECT: Re: use of FieldInvertState class
DATE: 20 Jul 2011

Ok. I need to use this class to get length of a given field at index time to
pass it as parameter to the computeNorm method from a custom Similarity. 
 
The issue is that i don't know how to get a FieldInvertState object and
precisely i didn't understand if I have to create and populate it myself or
there is a method that, passed a field name (or something like
myField.getFieldInvertState() ), returns a FieldInvertState object with all
its parameters (i.e. position,length, numOverlap, offset and boost) already
populated.
