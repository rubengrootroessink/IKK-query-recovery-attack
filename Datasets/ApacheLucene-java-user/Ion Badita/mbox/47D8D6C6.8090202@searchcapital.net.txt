SUBJECT: Re: Unique Fields
DATE: 13 Mar 2008

My unique is more like synonym. For instance: Brain cancer, Cancer of 
the brain, Brain neoplasm, are the same, so i need to tokenize the title 
remove the stop words etc.

I have a problem with the indexing... with a new title first i have to 
search in the index, if the title is not found write it to the index, 
flush the indexwriter and recreate the searcher (to reflect the 
changes). Is there a way to avoid recreating the Searcher/Reader for 
every new title inserted into the index?


Thank you
John
