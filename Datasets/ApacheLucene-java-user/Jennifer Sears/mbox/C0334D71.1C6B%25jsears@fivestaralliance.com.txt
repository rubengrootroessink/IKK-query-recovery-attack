SUBJECT: ReIndex or rework query
DATE: 7 Mar 2006

We've built an index that has 8 stored, tokenized text fields. For
optimizing search results, should we:
1. build the query programmatically and try to determine which field the
searchTerm might fit in (i.e. Terms that would match in City, country, would
not match in award or amenity)

2. Do a multi field query

3. Do a boolean query for searchTerms on all 8 fields?

4. Option we haven't thought of.

We're able to get results from the index using the following code, however,
we have been unable to get reliable or appropriate scoring.

If there's a better way, we'd appreciate the help.

Thanks,

Jennifer


IndexSearcher is = new IndexSearcher(indexDirectory);
StandardAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
String[] fields = {"hotel_name","hotel_city", "hotel_brand",
"hotel_country","hotel_type","hotel_feature","hotel_activity","hotel_award"}
;
BooleanClause.Occur[] flags =
{BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,BooleanClause.Occur.S
HOULD, 
BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,BooleanClause.Occur.SH
OULD,BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD};
Query q = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(query, fields, flags, analyzer);
hits = is.search(q);
