SUBJECT: Question about Boolean Operators
DATE: 2 Jan 2008


Hi,

Ive search to see if anyone has asked this before, and i couldn't find
anything. Apologies if this is a stupid question.

What's the difference between the "AND" and the "+" boolean operators. Also
the "NOT" and "-" boolean operators? Are each of these pair of operators
functionally equivalent?

>From the examples provided in the Query Syntax documentation at:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html#Boolean%20operators
it looks as if these are the same.

Any comments would be welcome on this.
