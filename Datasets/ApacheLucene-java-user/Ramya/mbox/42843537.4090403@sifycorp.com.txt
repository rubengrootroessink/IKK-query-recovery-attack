SUBJECT: Re: indexdir/segments (No such file or directory) lock file present..
DATE: 13 May 2005

I have chenged my logic as suggested..
boolean create = !(new File("indexdir/segments").exists());
System.out.println("Number of objects writing to index=" + count);
index = new IndexWriter(d, new StandardAnalyzer(), create);

But still one problem persists..When i do a huge number of documents, 
the files except the segment files get removed..
and the segment file is just 8K

1. How does the locking work.. When another process/thread is writing 
the index, will the current process block or exit with an exception. 
This information is crucial because there might be number of users 
updating the same index.
2. Wat would happen when a document has variable number of fields each 
time i update the index
Example
First doc

Heading                    Part1
Heading                    Part1               Part2
Heading                    Part1               Part2             Part3


Could this be the reason why i loose my index data when i try to update 
it???
