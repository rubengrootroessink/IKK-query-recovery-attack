SUBJECT: indexdir/segments (No such file or directory) lock file present..
DATE: 12 May 2005

1. I am trying to pump in large number of documents( to the tune of 
50000) ... I use muliple threads and i depend on the internal locks of 
lucene to synchronize the write access to the index.

try
            {
                index = new IndexWriter(d, new StandardAnalyzer(), false);
            }
            catch(IOException e)
            {
                index = new IndexWriter("indexdir", new 
StandardAnalyzer(), true);
            }
            index.addDocument(x.doc);
            index.close();

<then i add a docu

I have the following problem.
1. Somehow one lock file remains in the tmp directory. When this 
happens  i get the error
FileNotFoundException: /root/mails/mailindex/indexdir/segments (No such 
file or directory)
2. I thought when the index is closed the lock is released internally. 
If it had been the case y would the lock file remain in the tm dir??

2. The size of the index file is too large(Almost 50% of the original 
document). I use the standard analyzer. Will using a different analyzer 
help. What would i loose if i use a different one.



I use the version lucene-1.4.3


Any hellp would be appreciated.
