SUBJECT: using lucene with a very large index
DATE: 16 Jan 2002

Hi, I'm building a very large index, that contains several categories.
I have several questions I hope you can answare.
1) Is there a way to use lucene with several indexes without merging them?
2) Does the Document id changes after merging indexes adding or deleting documents?
3) Has anyone implemented a GUI to the lucene index, such that enables to deletions by id
or sql-like queries?
4) assuming I have a term query that has a large number of hits say 10 millions, is there
a way to get the say the top  10 results without going through all the hits?

thx tal.
