 See the Javadocs for Searcher and IndexSearcher, I think you'll find
 the answer there.

 thx Otis,
but I still don't understand , because the documents are stored per Term
sorted by docId,
in order to get the top ranking document for a TermQuery you have to go over
all of the TermDocs
for that Term, this causes problems for search engine that contain many
Documents.
one solution to that is to change the implementation and store the docs
sorted by their term score.
what do you think?
