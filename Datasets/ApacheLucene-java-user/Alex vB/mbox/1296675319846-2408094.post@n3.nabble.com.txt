SUBJECT: Storing payloads without term-position and frequency
DATE: 2 Feb 2011


Hello everybody,

I am currently using Lucene 3.0.2 with payloads. I store extra information
in the payloads about the term like frequencies and therefore I don't need
frequencies and term positions stored normally by Lucene. I would like to
set f.setOmitTermFreqAndPositions(true) but then I am not able to retrieve
payloads. Would it be hard to "hack" Lucene for my requests? Anymore I only
store one payload per term if that information makes it easier.

Best regards
Alex
