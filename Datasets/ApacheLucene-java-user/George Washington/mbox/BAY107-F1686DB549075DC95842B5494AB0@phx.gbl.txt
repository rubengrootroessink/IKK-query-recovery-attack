Thank you all for your replies (and Otis and John for your lively sense of 
humour as well).
I obviously accept the need to encrypt the index, but am not sure that using 
the Windows (or Linux) file system encryption will solve the problem. My 
understanding is that both cannot be under my application control, they need 
to be part of the site policy. Hence cannot be relied upon in all instances. 
I want the user to decide if encryption is required and then enable it 
knowing that it will be done.
If my understanding above is correct, the other alternative is to use the 
Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) to encrypt (and decode) the index on the 
fly. This however is more complex, and where I was hoping your knowledge of 
Lucene could help.
I suspect it would require careful choice of positioning of the encryption 
and decoding calls so as not to interfere for instance with segment 
optimisation and merging and many other such complications. Searching 
through this mailing list has revealed no interest in encryption at all.
Any suggestion as to how JCE could be embedded in Lucene? (or whether I am 
on the right or wrong track!)
Thanks
Victor
