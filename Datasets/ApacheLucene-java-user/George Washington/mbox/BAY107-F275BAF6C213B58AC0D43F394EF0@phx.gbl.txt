Thanks Chris for making it clear, I had read the comment but I had not 
understood that it implied incompatibility. But will the code be preserved 
in Lucene 2.0, in light of the comment contained in the Lucene 1.9.1 
announcement ?
QUOTE
Applications must compile against 1.9 without deprecation warnings
before they are compatible with 2.0.
