SUBJECT: RE: Storing large text or binary source documents in the index and memory usage
DATE: 21 Jan 2006

Thank you ipowers for your reply. Perhaps I did not make myself clear 
enough. As I explained in my original posting I want to store large 
documents  in the Lucene index. Storing them elsewhere is not an option, 
otherwise I would have done so already. My real question is question number 
one, which did not receive a reply, is there a formula that can tell me if 
what is happening is reasonable and to be expected, or am I doing something 
wrong or something which can be done better. I realise I can breakdown a 
large file into smaller chunks, but I don't want to do that unless the 
answer to question one is that there is no other alternative.
Cheers
