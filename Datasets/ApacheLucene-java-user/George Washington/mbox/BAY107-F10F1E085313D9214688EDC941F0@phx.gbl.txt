SUBJECT: Storing large text or binary source documents in the index and memory usage
DATE: 20 Jan 2006

I would like to store large source documents (>10MB) in the index in their 
original form, i.e. as text for text documents or as byte[] for binary 
documents.
I have no difficulty adding the source document as a field to the Lucene 
index document, but when I write the index document to the index I 
consistently get out-of-memory errors for documents larger than approx 9MB.
Is there a formula that can help calculate the max size of a document which 
can be added to the index?
Is there an alternative way to store such large documents that you can 
suggest?
I have 512MB memory under WinXP. Increasing the VM heap size does not help.
Many thanks
