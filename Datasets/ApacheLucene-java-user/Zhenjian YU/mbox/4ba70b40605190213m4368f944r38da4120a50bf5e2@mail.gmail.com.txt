SUBJECT: does anybody have the experience to do some pooling upon lucene?
DATE: 19 May 2006

I'm using apache commons pooling library to pool the IndexSearcher, so that
my system
can provide high performance.

I wonder if it is reasonable to pooling objects of lucene?
If yes, is there any other objects I can also pool?

Thank you!
