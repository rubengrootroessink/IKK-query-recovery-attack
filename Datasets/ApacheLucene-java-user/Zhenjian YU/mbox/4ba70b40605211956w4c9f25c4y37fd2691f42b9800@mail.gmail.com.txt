Hi, Erik,

Thanks for your prompt response.

I didn't dig the source code of lucence deep enough, but I noticed that the
IndexSearcher uses an IndexReader, while the cost of initializing
IndexReader is a bit high.

My application is a webapp, so I think it may be good if I cache some
instances of IndexSearcher to provide service for my webapp. I haven't done
any performance testing yet. Maybe I test it later to see the difference
between caching and without caching.

Best Regards,
Zhenjian
