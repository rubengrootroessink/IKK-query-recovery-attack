SUBJECT: use Lucene to index sentences
DATE: 6 Feb 2006

I'll appreciate any advice on whether Lucene is appropriate for index/search
sentences.  I have millions of documents broken down into millions of
sentences. Each sentence does not exist as a document.  All these sentences
are in a small number of big files. How can I use Lucene to index/search the
sentences? Search will return which sentence matches the query.  If Lucene
does not do it, any better approach besides using mysql database?

Thanks,
AJ
