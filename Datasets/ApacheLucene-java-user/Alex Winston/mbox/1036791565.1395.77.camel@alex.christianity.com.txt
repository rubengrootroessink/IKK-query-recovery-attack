apologizes for replying to myself, but another nice side-effect of this
fix is that it virtually eliminates the potential for an
OutOfMemoryError, which was a problem i encountered on extremely large
fields, over 10000 terms, while i was profiling the RangeQuery class.

i can get into specifics if need be, any thoughts?
