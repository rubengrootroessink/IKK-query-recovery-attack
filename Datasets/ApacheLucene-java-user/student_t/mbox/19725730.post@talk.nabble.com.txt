Thank you Erick!

I got Luke and it's a great tool! I verified from Luke my queries posted
originally worked as expected (i.e., "Canadian pepsi" produced fewer results
than "pepsi" along.)

Based on your suggestion, I found out the program re-wrote the query before
it was sent to Nutch as the following:

(content:"+(content:pepsi) +((host:ca^10.0)^10.0)")

I think this is messing up the query results. Literally, this is what the
code was doing:

Query nutchQuery = new Query();
nutchQuery.addRequiredTerm("+(content:pepsi) +((host:ca^10.0)^10.0)",
"content");
nutchBean.search(nutchQuery, maxHits, maxHitsPerSite);

The above code must be using a default analyzer, which I have not found out
yet. But after looking at Luke results and this code, I think my problem is
in the query construction. Could you shed some light about how the new query
be constructed based on the following String?

+(content:pepsi) +((host:ca^10.0)^10.0)

Thanks again!
