SUBJECT: PHP and Lucene integration
DATE: 6 Jun 2006

Hi Folks,

I'm working on project that is going to have free-text
search mechanism. The project is completely based on
open source technologies, such as MySQL and PHP.
I'm reading about Lucene and think that this is
probably the first candidate. 

BTW, the (obvious) question is: "How to integrate PHP
and Lucene ?". What are possible ways to solve this 
task ?

Sure, this question was asked a lot of times ... btw
need your opinion. Any information, advices (cons and
pros of a given approach), links are welcome.

Thank you a lot,
/Alexander
