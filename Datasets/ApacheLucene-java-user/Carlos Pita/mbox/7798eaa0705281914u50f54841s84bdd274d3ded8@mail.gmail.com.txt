sorry but is the document id renumbering caused by a merge visible from an
opened reader? Or can I assume that document ids are kept the same while my
searcher is opened, disregarding how many updates or optimizations happened
after its opening? This way I could regenerate my extra in-memory data
structures indexed by document id just when the searcher is reopened (say,
every 1000 updates) instead of after each update.

Thank you in advance.
Cheers,
Carlos
