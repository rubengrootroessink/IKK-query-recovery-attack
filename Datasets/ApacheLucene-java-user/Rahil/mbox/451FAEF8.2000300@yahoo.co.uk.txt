SUBJECT: Performing a like query
DATE: 1 Oct 2006

Hi

I have a custom-built Analyzer where I tokenize all non-whitespace 
characters as well available in the field "TERM" (which is the only 
field being tokenised).

If I now query my index file for a term "6/12" for instance, I get back 
only ONE result

SCORE    DESCRIPTIONSTATUS    CONCEPTID    TERM
1.0    0    260278007    6/12 (finding)

instead of TWO. There is another token in the index file of the form

2561280012    0    163939000    R-eye=6/12 (finding)    0    3    en

At first it wasn't quite obvious to me why this was happening. But after 
playing around a bit I realised that if I pass a query "R-eye=6/12" 
instead, I will get this second result (but not the first one now). Is 
there a way to tweak the  Query query = parser.parse(searchString) 
method so that I can get both the records if I query for "6/12". 
Something like a 'contains' query in Java.

Will appreciate all help. Thanks a lot

Regards
Rahil
