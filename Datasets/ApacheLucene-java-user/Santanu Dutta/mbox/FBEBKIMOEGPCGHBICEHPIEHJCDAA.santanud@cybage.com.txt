Hi All

java.io.IOException: Lock obtain timed out:
Lock@C:\WINNT\TEMP\lucene-4bf302dec76f27bff81fc3dd3118abbb-write.lock
	at org.apache.lucene.store.Lock.obtain(Lock.java:58)

Sometimes it happens and it again start working if I remove the lock file
from the temp directory. I didn't get any permanent solution. Sometimes it
corrupts the index itself. So can anybody provide some solution for this?

Santanu
