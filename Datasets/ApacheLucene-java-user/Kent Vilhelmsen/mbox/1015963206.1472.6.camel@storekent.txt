SUBJECT: Search result ordering question
DATE: 12 Mar 2002


I've been using Lucene a bit, and find it very flexible and fast.

However, I need to order search results by date (or, equally, document
id); I've looked a bit into (re)writing a collect method without any
luck. I'm not programming Java too much, so I'm not getting any way with
the (few) hints I've seen regarding date-sorted result sets. 

Does anyone have a quick solution/example to give?

thanks,
Kent Vilhelmsen
