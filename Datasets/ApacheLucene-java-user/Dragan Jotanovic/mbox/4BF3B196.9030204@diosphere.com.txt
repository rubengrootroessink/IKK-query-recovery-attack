SUBJECT: Re: How to achive this kind of document ordering
DATE: 19 May 2010

Thanks for trying to help, but that is not the answer I was looking for.
The requirenment is a bit more specific. When sorting by second field, I 
don't want to sort it as A,A,A,B,B,C,C but A,B,C,A,B,C,A.
I'm not sure even if this is possible using the Sort API. Maybe custom 
scoring or document boosting or some other approach would be more suitable?
