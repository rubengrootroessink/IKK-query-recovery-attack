I need a very fast search engine because I am working with thousends of
images. Lucine is providing me with that.

Does somebody know how to set boost for document during indexing time? It
seams that it is not working with document.setBoost().  I suppose that I
should switch off Lucenes scorer to get results sorted by my boost criteria.
Does somebody know how to do this.
