SUBJECT: Maximum Length of String for a Field
DATE: 17 Apr 2006

Is there maximum length to a string that is analazyed and put into a field?
IE if the String is 1 billion characters and analyzed, tokenized, and the
last word in the string only appears once at the end, would searching for
that last word against that field end with a hit for that document?
