Hi I'm a newbe to lucene, I have troubles creating the index to be usable by my web application.
 
The problem is that with the guide lines of the documentation, I created a index with URLs
relative to my local file system
doc.get("url");   // Returns paths like C:/CopiaSite20030228/Legislacion/reglamentos/index.htm
How can I create an index and specify that the ROOT of my documents points to mydomain.com??
 
Please help, I've been searching the docs and mailing list, but I've been without  luck!!
 
Regards!
