DATE: 5 Mar 2003


I downloaded and instaled the i2a websearch application. Looks fine, but I have a problem,
my site contains a lot of Macromedia Flash Objects and there are a lot of links of my site
in this flash objects. Clearly this links wouldn't be crwaled easily. Is there a way to create
a index for i2a websearch or to adapt code to parse a directory structure?
On the other hand I have some pdfs files and they seem not to get indexed. I looked at the
servlet cointainer log and found:
java.util.zip.ZipException: unknown compression method
