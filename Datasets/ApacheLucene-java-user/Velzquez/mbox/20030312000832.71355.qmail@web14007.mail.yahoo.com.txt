Also if you download Lucene sources and modify configuration.jsp, you can point your web application
to look at some other path:
/* Author: Andrew C. Oliver (acoliver2@users.sourceforge.net) */
String appTitle = "Lucene";
/* make sure you point the below string to the index you created with IndexHTML */
//String indexLocation = "/opt/lucene/index";
String indexLocation = "C:\\PathToMyIndex\\";
String appfooter = "Lucene";

Then you can ant rebuild your war file, and redeploy it to your web container (aka Tomcat,
JRun, etc).

Regards!

The tomcat webapp will look in /opt/lucene/index by default, for the index to 
use with the webapp. If you're running the system on linux/unix, create the 
directory /opt/lucene/index and when you run your index (java 
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index /opt/lucene/index ..) you 
should see it claim to be adding files.

If you do, in fact, see this output, then check to make sure that you either 
modify the configuration of the webapp to point to the appropriate index 
location, or change the location of your index to match where the webapp will 
look for it.
