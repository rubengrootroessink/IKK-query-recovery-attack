SUBJECT: How to search both Tokenized and Untokenized fields
DATE: 9 Mar 2009


Hi,

I've been trying to find a way which allows executing a query that contains
both Tokenized and Untokenized fields on Lucene's index, without having to
parse the query. I've been able to execute a query which only uses Tokenized
fields as follows:

   QueryParser queryParser = new QueryParser( DEFAULT_FIELD, analyzer);
   Query query = queryParser.parse(queryString);
   Hits hits = indexSearcher.search(query);

This works fine for Tokenized fields but I'm not sure how to execute a query
("queryString") which contains both tokenized and untokenized fields.

Any suggestion is very much appreciated.

Rokham
