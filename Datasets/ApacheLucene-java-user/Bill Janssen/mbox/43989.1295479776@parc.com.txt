There are two kinds of failures:  no language, or wrong language.

For no language, I fall back to StandardAnalyzer, so I should have
results similar to yours.  For wrong language, well, I'm using OTS
trigram-based language guessers, and they're pretty good these days.

Yes, I think it might improve things, but again, by how much?  Stemming is
better than no stemming, in terms of recall.  But this approach would also
improve precision.
