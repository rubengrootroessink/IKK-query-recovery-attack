I wasn't sure that everything "went through" getFieldQuery().  If so,
yes, that should work.  In either case, I don't even think a subclass
is necessary.  Just have a different constructor for QueryParser that
takes multiple default field names, and just add the behavior to
QueryParser, keyed off that characteristic (more than one default
field name).
