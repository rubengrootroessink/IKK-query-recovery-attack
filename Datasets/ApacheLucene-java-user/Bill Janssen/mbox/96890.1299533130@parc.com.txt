I've built a pipeline in UpLib (open source at http://uplib.parc.com/)
to extract both the page images and the text (along with wordboxes and
font size, etc.) from PDFs, along with various metadata items.  It also
includes a converter (ToPDF) which will convert Web pages, Word,
Powerpoint, email etc. to PDF first, and then do the extraction.

  uplib-add-document --noupload mydoc

will create a temporary directory with all the pieces in it and output
the name of that directory to stdout.

Actually, with HTML and CSS you can do just what "searchable PDF" does.
Put up the text in an HTML file, using "span" tags with absolute
positioning, and using the special color "transparent".  Use CSS to make
the page image the "background-image" for the HTML, and you have a
browser-displayable object which looks like a page image with selectable
text.
