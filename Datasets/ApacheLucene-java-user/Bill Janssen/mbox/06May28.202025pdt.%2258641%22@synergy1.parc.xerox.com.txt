SUBJECT: IMAP server that uses Lucene?
DATE: 28 May 2006

Hi!

I've got oodles of email stored in MH (one file per message,
hierarchical directories) format.  I'm looking for an IMAP server that
will use Lucene to index that mail and perform the various search
parts of the IMAP protocol.  Ideally, the mail would not have to be
converted to another email format, but can be if necessary.

I know how to index mail, so tropo.com isn't terribly interesting.
I'm not sure I understand just what ZOE does, but it doesn't seem to
be an IMAP server.

Any pointers?  

Bill
