I got a chance to copy my corpus to another G4 and try indexing with
Lucene 2.2.  This one seems OK!  Same texts.  So now I'm inclined to
believe that it *is* the machine, rather than the code.  Whew!  Though
that doesn't explain why 2.0 works fine on the same corpus on the same
machine, in repeated tests.

I'm going to run some diagnostics on the first G4, and see if I can
find a hardware problem.  I'll report back.

Bill
