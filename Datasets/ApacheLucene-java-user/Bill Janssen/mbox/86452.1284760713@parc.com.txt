And, given that the sole purpose of this Version frob is to support the
use of indices that were created with a different version of Lucene, it
would be a very good thing to have methods on IndexSearcher,
IndexReader, and IndexWriter (or perhaps simply on Directory?) which
would allow a program to figure out what Version is appropriate for that
index.
