SUBJECT: Re: Using lucene as a database... good idea or bad idea?
DATE: 29 Jul 2008

I do this with uplib (http://uplib.parc.com/) with fair success.
Originally I thought I'd need Lucene plus a relational database to
store metadata about the documents for metadata searches.  So far,
though, I've been able to store the metadata in Lucene and use the
same Lucene DB for both metadata and content.
