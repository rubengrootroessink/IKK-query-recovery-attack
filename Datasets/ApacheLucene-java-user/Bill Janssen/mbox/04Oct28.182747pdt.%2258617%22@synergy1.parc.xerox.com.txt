Sure, that works fine.  For instance, if you have the three default
fields "title", "authors", and "contents", the one-word search
"robust" expands to

   title:foobar authors:foobar contents:foobar

just as it should.

Good point.  My older version (see below) found these, but the new one
doesn't.  Oh, well, back to the working version.  I knew there was some
reason getFieldQuery wasn't sufficient.

The working version is in the file SearchTest.java, which you can find
at ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/transient/janssen/SearchTest.java.  It's a
test program which runs the query through the NewMultiFieldQueryParser,
and then prints it out, so that you can see what the expansion is.
