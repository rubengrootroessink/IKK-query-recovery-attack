In UpLib, I use xpdf-3.02pl2 with a patch which gives me position and
font information for each word.  You can get the xpdf sources from
http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/, and the patch file is at
http://uplib.parc.com/misc/xpdf-3.02-PATCH.  To extract the byte
positions, use pdftotext with the "-wordboxes" switch, and see the
pdftotext man page for more info.  This is run automatically in UpLib
before the indexing is done.
