Thanks for pointing this out, Marvin.  I wish Sun (or someone) would
document and register this particular character set encoding with
IANA, so that it could be used outside of Java.  As it stands now,
it's essentially a bastard encoding, good for nothing, and one of the
warts of Java.

Lucene probably shouldn't be using it in its file formats.

Bill
