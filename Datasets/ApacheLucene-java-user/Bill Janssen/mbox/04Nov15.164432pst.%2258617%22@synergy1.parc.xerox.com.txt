That's right, the new version (the one that overrode getFieldQuery())
wasn't a good idea.  The current version on ftp.parc.xerox.com yields:

% javac -classpath .:/import/lucene/lucene-1.4.1.jar SearchTest.java 
% java -classpath .:/import/lucene/lucene-1.4.1.jar SearchTest '+gut* +test'
query is +(title:gut* authors:gut* contents:gut*) +(title:test authors:test contents:test)
% 

This is "the old version that doesn't implement getFieldQuery()."
