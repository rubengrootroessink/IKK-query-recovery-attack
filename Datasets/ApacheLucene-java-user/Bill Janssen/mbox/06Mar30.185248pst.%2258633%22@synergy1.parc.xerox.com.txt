SUBJECT: Any plans for a 1.9.2 release?  Need timeout setting!
DATE: 30 Mar 2006

I presume the patch that gives us a way of overriding the default
timeout for write locks has made it into the source DB, but I really
need a jar file to point people at which contains it.  Any chance of
a 1.9.2 release?

Bill
