Not to mention multi-word phrase tokenization, like the difference
between a document which contains the text

  "...should not be allowed to possess a lethal weapon like a..."

and a document which contains the phrase

  "...should not be allowed to see Lethal Weapon until at least the age of..."

In the first case, tokenization of "lethal weapon" should take place, while
in the second case, we need to preserve the the phrase as a single term.
