SUBJECT: using a document as a query?
DATE: 30 Jan 2007

I was thinking of trying something, and wondered if someone else
already had it working...

I'd like to take a document, and use it as a query to find other
documents in my index that 'match' it.  I'm talking about short
documents, like newspaper articles or email messages.  Seems to me
that there should be some TF*IDF tricks one could play here with the
index...

Anyone done something like this already?

Bill
