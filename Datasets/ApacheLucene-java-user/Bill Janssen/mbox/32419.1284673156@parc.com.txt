SUBJECT: recommended way to identify a version to pass to StandardAnalyzer constructor?
DATE: 16 Sep 2010

So, in version 3, I have to pass a version parameter to the constructor
for StandardAnalyzer.  Since Version.LUCENE_CURRENT is deprecated, I'd
like this to be the same as the version of the index I'm using.  Is
there a way of getting a value of Version for an index?  I don't see
obvious methods on IndexReader and IndexWriter.

Bill
