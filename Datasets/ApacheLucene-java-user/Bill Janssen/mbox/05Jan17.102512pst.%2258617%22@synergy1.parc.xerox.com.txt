SUBJECT: How to add a Lucene index to a jar file?
DATE: 17 Jan 2005

Hi.

I'd like to package up a Lucene index with the Lucene class files and
my own application classes into a single jar file, so that it forms a
"double-clickable" single-file Java application that supports
searching over the index.  However, I'm not sure how to read the index
(create an IndexReader) if the files that form the index are packaged
into the same jar file with the code.

If anyone could shed some light on how to do this, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks!

Bill
