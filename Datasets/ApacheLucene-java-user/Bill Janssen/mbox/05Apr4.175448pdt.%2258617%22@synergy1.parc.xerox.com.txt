SUBJECT: Normalizing search scores over multiple indices
DATE: 4 Apr 2005

I've got a situation where I'm searching over a number of different
repositories, each containing a different set of documents.  I'd like
to run searches over, say, 4 different indices, then combine the
results outside of Java to present to the user.  Is there any way of
normalizing search scores over multiple searches over different
indices?

Bill
