There's no need to.  My existing code works just fine with them.  For
instance, if you put in the query "foo*", with the default fields
"title", "authors", and "contents", you get the expanded query
"title:book* authors:book* contents:book*".  Please try running the
code at ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/transient/janssen/SearchTest.java,
and point out specific problems.
