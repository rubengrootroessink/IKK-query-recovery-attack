Yes, the UpLib system from PARC does this.  It supports Word,
Powerpoint, PDF, Web pages, email, images, etc., as input documents.
It caches all documents given to it, in their original format, but
also allows access to them as HTML or PDF.  It Lucene-indexes both the
full content text of each document, along with metadata for each
document, and contains a number of document analysis engines for
calculating "indirect" metadata from the document.  It includes
several off-line browsers, including a Web-browser tool and a Java
client (I tend to use the Java rich client), for searching, reading,
and annotating the gathered pages.  Screenshots are at
<http://uplib.parc.com/uplib/screenshots.html>.

We're currently in beta test of our first public release (it's been
used internally at PARC for over four years now); to be added to the
beta-test list, just create an account on the blog at
