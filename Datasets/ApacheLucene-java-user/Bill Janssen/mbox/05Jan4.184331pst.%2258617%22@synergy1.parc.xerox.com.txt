Let me be a bit more explicit.  My method (essentially an
after-method, for those Lisp'rs out there) begins thusly:

    protected Query getFieldQuery (String field,
				   Analyzer a,
                                   String queryText)
        throws ParseException {

          Query x = super.getFieldQuery(field, a, queryText);

	  ...
	}

If I remove the "Analyzer a" from both the signature and the super
call, the super call won't compile because that method isn't in the
QueryParser in 1.4.1.  But my getFieldQuery() method won't even be
called in 1.4.1, because it doesn't exist in that version of the
QueryParser.
