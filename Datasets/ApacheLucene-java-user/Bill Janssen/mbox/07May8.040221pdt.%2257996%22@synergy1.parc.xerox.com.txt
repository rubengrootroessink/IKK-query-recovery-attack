Just to make sure I'm following...

So you're suggesting splitting the document into paragraphs, then
treating each paragraph as if it were a Carrot2 search result,
performing the clustering, then looking at the label Lingo chooses for
each cluster, and treating that label as the "key phrase"?

Would DirectDocumentFeedExample be a good starting point?
