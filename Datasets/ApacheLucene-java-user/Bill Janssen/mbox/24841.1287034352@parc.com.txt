Ching, in UpLib I use a patched version of xpdf which reports the
bounding box and font information for each word (as well as the Unicode
characters of the word :-).  It works fine with the Long_9.pdf file
that's attached to the issue you pointed out.  You might want to try
that.  (The same wordbox info is available from PDFBox, but you have to
write some code to access it.)

To build the patched xpdf:

Download and unpack xpdf-3.02pl4 from http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html.

Download UpLib from
http://uplib.parc.com/uplib/releases/1.7.10/uplib-1.7.10.tgz and untar
it.  You'll find a file called "patches/xpdf-3.02-PATCH".  Patch the
xpdf sources with that patch:

  cd xpdf-3.02
  patch -p0 < /tmp/uplib-1.7.10/patches/xpdf-3.02-PATCH

Then configure and build xpdf.  You can now extract words and wordbox info
from the PDF file with "pdftotext".  

There's still the issue that neither PDFBox or xpdf or the built-in
Windows, OS X, or Linux utilities for extracting text from PDFs does
layout analysis properly, so the words you get will often be in the
wrong order.  But that's usually only a problem if you are doing things
with multi-word phrases.
