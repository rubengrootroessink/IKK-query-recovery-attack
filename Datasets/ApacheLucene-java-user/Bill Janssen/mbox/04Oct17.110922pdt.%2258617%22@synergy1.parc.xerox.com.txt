Bill,

My system (see http://www.parc.com/janssen/pubs/TR-03-16.pdf) uses
pdftotext underneath.  I've been very satisfied with that.  Another
Java solution would be to use Multivalent
(multivalent.sourceforge.net).  Multivalent, by the way, advertises
the following:

"Extract text from all formats. Full-text search with Lucene."
