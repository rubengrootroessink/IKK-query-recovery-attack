Yes, I thought of that.  But when I comment out the call to
"optimize()", no exception is signalled.  So I think it's unlikely.

I'm thinking it might be an endianness issue.  Do you folks test a lot
on big-endian platforms?  Just the kind of thing that affects
bit-string manipulation.  I'm going to run the same software on an
Intel machine and see what happens.
