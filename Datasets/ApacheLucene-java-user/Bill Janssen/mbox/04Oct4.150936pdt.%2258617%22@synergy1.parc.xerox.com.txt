This wouldn't catch PrefixQueries or RangeQueries, etc., would it?  If
QueryParser.TermQuery() wasn't final, you could just override it (or
fix it to do the right thing).

By the way, I've found a bug in my implementation of
MultiFieldQueryParser.  Single-word queries weren't being expanded
properly.  I've fixed that, and placed a revised copy of the code at
ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/transient/janssen/SearchTest.java.  See
my original post at
http://issues.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=9757
for instructions on how to use it.  Or just read the SearchTest.java code.
