Hi,   You can boost an individual query.
For example
Assuming your query to be a boolean query containing a term for the creator
BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
.
(any other part of your query)
.

TermQuery termQ = new TermQuery(new Term("creator", user));
termQ.setBoost(3.0f);  //boost this query by factor of 3

query.add(termQ, Occur.SHOULD);

This will make sure that any document matching creator with user will be
given more boost.
