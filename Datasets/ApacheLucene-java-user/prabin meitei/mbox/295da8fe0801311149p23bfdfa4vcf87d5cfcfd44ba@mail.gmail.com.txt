SUBJECT: Different levels of negative boosting
DATE: 31 Jan 2008

Hi,  I want to give different levels of negative boost (reduce the score) to
documents for different matching queries. How it can be done?? Googling I
found out this link
http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/CommunityContributions  but  it just
gives the option of giving single level negative boost.
is there any way of having multiple matching queries and give them different
negative boosts???


Regards,
