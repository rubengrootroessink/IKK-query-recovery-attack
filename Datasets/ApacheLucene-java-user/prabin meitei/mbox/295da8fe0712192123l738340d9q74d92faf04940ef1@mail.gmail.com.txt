Hi Erick,
  Thanks for your response.  I have tried searching the archive. I could not
find andy relevant thread. that's why i posted the question here. May be I
am not using the right keywords. If you know any archive link which deals
with this problem please send me.
    I have seen the case study about theServerSide in the book "Lucene in
Action". But there also they haven't given how date boosting can be
implemented.
