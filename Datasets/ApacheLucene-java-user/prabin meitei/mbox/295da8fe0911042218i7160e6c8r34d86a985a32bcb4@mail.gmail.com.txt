Hi,
    I have a scenario as described below
user U1 - books purchased ,b1, b5, ... so on
user U2 - books purchased ,b2, b7, ... so on
...
...
...
Un - books purchased b1, b2 .... so on

how can a design an index in such a way that
- i can search who purchased a book say b1, sort the result by purchase date
- find all the users who purchased a book say b1 in last 30 days
- find users who matches certain criteria and also purchased a book say b1
(sort by purchased date)

the details of the user is large , so i do not want to have multiple entry
for same user in the index.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Regards,
Prabin
