SUBJECT: Re: using list of items to be excluded while querying
DATE: 17 Oct 2008

Hi, Thanks for the reply. I looked through the Filter class. I think i can
use the TermFilter for my requirement. But I have few doubs regarding the
use of termFilter.

Can I add any number of terms to it?? say 5000 terms? Is there any limit?
Can i use this term filter by adding to another boolean filter??
