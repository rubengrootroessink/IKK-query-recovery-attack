SUBJECT: constructing query from string
DATE: 16 Jan 2008

Hi ,
    I want to construct a query from string. how can I do it??  Actually i
saved a query(a boolean query) as string (using query.toString()).
Is there a way to reconstruct the query from the string i saved? How can i
add more clauses to the  reconstructed query?
Thanks in advance.
