SUBJECT: document with different index time boost returns same score
DATE: 18 Dec 2009

Hi,
   I have an index in which documents are inserted with different boost
during indexing.
eg.
doc1 has boost 5.64
doc2 has boost 5.25
doc3 has boost 5.10
doc4 has boost 4.8
doc5 has boost 4.4
doc6 has boost 4.0
and so on... some documents even having boost only 1.0

when i search the index for a term which occur only once in these documents
i expected that the final scores of the search hit will differ according to
the document boost set during indexing.
But surprisingly i found that doc1, doc2 and doc3 have same score (even the
raw score) and doc4 and doc5 have same score.

I even tried changing index time boost to 564, 525, 510 .. and so on for
doc1, doc2 doc3 and so on... but it still returned same result.

Can anyone explain what is happening? why the scores are same even when the
index time boost was different. Is there any other way to implement my
expected result.
any help will be highly appreciated.

Prabin
