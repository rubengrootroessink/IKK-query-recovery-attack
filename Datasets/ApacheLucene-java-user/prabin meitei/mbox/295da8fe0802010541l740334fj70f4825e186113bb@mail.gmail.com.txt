SUBJECT: Re: Different levels of negative boosting
DATE: 1 Feb 2008

Hi Grant,
    I have an index for articles containing fields 'id' , 'body' and others

BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery;
queryParser = new QueryParser("body", new StandardAnalyzer());
query.add(queryParser.parse("keywords"), Occur.MUST);

if i query at this level then i get all the articles I want. But I want to
de-boost some of them if they matches another term
.
BooleanQuery q1 = new BooleanQuery;
BooleanQuery q2 = new BooleanQuery;
queryParser = new QueryParser("body", new StandardAnalyzer());
q1.add(queryParser.parse("body"), Occur.SHOULD);
queryParser = new QueryParser("some field", new StandardAnalyzer());
q2.add(queryParser.parse("keywords2"), Occur.SHOULD);

q1.setBoost(0.1);
q2.setBoost(0.3);
query.add(q1, Occur.SHOULD);
query.add(q2, Occur.SHOULD);
### what I want here is that any document matching the queries q1 and q2
will be boosted negatively(reducing their score but *not eliminating from
the search result*)
# puting values less than 1.0 (as I tried doing) did not help (lucene seems
to assume it as 1)
# if there was only one query then I could do it as I wrote in my last mail.
But the problem is when there a multiple queries to reduce the score by
multiple levels.

or am I going in a wrong direction?? It wud be nice if you have some
suggestion.
