Hi Experts,

Iam  a new bie. Iam suppose to select a search engine for my project, which should search
from the given URL and display the result.

I should use the search engine in windows OS only. I should not use any other external tool
like CGYWIN which is used in NUTCH. 

Any expet guidance would be much appreciated .

Thanks 

Kamesh
