I have a Lucene related questions/problem.

My search results can potentially get very large 200,000+. I want to
categorize my results. So for example if I have an indexed field "type" that
has such things as CDs, books, videos, power drills, or anything else in the
world, I would want to display how many results are found for each unique
"type". So I may get 200 CDs and 3000 books and so on.

The brute-force way of doing that is traversing the returned
documents/results and counting each unique type. Unfortunately this solution
is too slow. I am having trouble figuring out a faster approach and was
hoping someone can suggest one.

Thank you for your time.

Dima
