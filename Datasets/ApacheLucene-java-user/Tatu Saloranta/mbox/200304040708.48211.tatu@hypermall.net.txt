Yup... that's the root of all evil. :-)
(I'm in similar situation, going through user acceptance test as we speak... 
and getting ready to do second version that'll have more advanced metadata
based search using Lucene).

If you don't need to tokenize a field, you don't need an analyzer either. 
However, to get case insensitive search, you should lower-case field contents 
before adding them to document. QueryParser will do lower casing for search 
terms automatically (if you are using it), so matching should work fine then.
