Not really, you can pass Reader to tokenizer, which then reads and tokenizes 
directly (I think that's the way code also works). This because internally 
String is read using StringReader, so passing a String looks more like a 
convenience feature?

I guess for things that are both tokenized and stored, passing a Reader can't 
really help a lot; if one wants to reduce mem usage, text needs to be read 
twice, or analyzer needs to help in writing output; or, text needs to be read 
in-memory much like what happens now. It'd simplify application code a bit, 
but wouldn't do much more.

So.... I guess I need to downgrade my suggestion to require just 2 
Reader-taking factory methods? :-)
I still think that index-only and store-only version would both make sense. In 
latter case, storing could be done in fully streaming fashion; in former 
tokenization can be done?

Yes, I understand that. It'd not be reasonable to do such a change. But how 
about adding more intuitive factory method (UnStored(String, Reader))?

Best standards are created by people doing things others use, follow or 
imitate... so it was worth a try! :-)
