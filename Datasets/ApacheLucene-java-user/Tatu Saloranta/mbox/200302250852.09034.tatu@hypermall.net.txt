Perhaps it also depends on platform -- on Linux (for example), all smallish 
files are very likely to be kept in memory, if accessed often. This because 
all non-allocated RAM is used for disk buffers automatically.
There is still syscall overhead for reading, but compared to actual disk reads 
it will be much faster.
