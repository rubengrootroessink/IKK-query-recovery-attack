It might be enough to just replace analyzer passed in to QueryParser
to do this? This is the case if QueryParser only handles modifiers outside
terms, and terms are passed to analyzer.
I think this is the case (QueryParser does  call the analyzer in couple of 
places, and one word may actually expand to a phrase or vice versa)?

Still, it seems like using a hyphen as separator shouldn't necessarily cause 
big problems when indexer does the same; queries against "2 - 5" would be 
phrase queries for "2 5", which is still reasonably specific (and should 
match the content).

On the other hand, simple analyzer and standard analyzer have pretty different 
tokenization rules, so it's important to make sure same analyzer is used for 
both indexing and searching (that mismatch can prevent matches easily).
