Right. In my case that's ok -- the documents I'll be indexing are hybrid 
documents, with some structured/plain text content and additional metadata 
(in DB normalized form). Thus the dates (from normalized metadata fields) can 
easily be converted to numeric form and indexed (for things like "last 
modified" etc that'd be normally searched via DB).

The other part (UI) needs more work... either need to add a new quoting
mechanism for dates (or just do that for if certain field prefix is used), or 
(more likely) the UI will use simple web forms for constructing query.

Thanks to everyone for quick replies,
