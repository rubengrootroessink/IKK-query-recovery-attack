Actually, Hits contains a Vector (could be an array as well), but is not a 
Collection itself (one can not extend array classes in Java, so no Object 
besides basic arrays can be arrays or treates as one).
Hits be made a Collection, though.
In fact, I think it would be a reasonable thing to do, to make Hits be
a simple Collection (or perhaps List since it is an ordered collection).
You could file an RFE for this, or better yet, implement it. :-)
I'd think including such patch for Lucene would make sense as well.

No, it should be enough to write a simple wrapper that implements
Collection, and accesses Hits instance via next() method.
