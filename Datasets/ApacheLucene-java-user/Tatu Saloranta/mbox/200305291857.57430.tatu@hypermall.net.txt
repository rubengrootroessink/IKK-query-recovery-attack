[apologies if somebody else already pointed this out... I missed some mails to 
the list from yesterday]

One of the most interesting solutions somebody posted earlier, was to use
2 indexes; one for 'normal' searches, with normal analyzer etc, and second
one that uses reversed words; ie. analyzer reverses words tokenized by
standard analyzer. This second index would then allow for searches
to do prefix match, in this case query would be something like

reverse_field:txe.*

This would work efficiently, although pretty much double the size of index for 
content that has to be prefix-searchable. Still, this solution somehow 
appeals to my hacker side. :-)

In this specific case, though, what others have suggested (add file prefix as 
separate field to search on), is probably more practical.
