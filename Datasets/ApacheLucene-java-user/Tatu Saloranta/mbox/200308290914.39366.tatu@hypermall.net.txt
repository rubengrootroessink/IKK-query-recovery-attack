This can be done, AFAIK.

This is one thing that many people seem unaware of: you don't HAVE to use
QueryParser to build queries. In your case it seems like you should be able
to construct query you want if you either by-pass QueryParser, or create
a dummy analyzer (one that does no tokenization but returns all input as
one token).

Since QueryParser is fairly simple class, you should be able to see how wild 
card queries are constructed. You can not (and need not) create a phrase 
query since it does not allow wild cards (like someone pointed out), but 
since the whole phrase is just one token for keyword fields, you can use 
normal wild card query (or prefix for cases like "Hello w*").

It would be nice if FAQ could point out that QueryParser is higher-level 
interface to query part, but it is possible and sometimes necessary to do 
your own query construction. I think it's very cool Lucene queries were 
properly modularized this way -- too many open source projects have 
components too tightly coupled.
