Query parser has to know which field term should be matched against by 
default, if user does not explicitly specify field, and that field is passed 
to query constructor. At this point actual query is not known; it's passed 
with parse methods, and parser can be used multiple times (although it's not 
re-entrant).

Method you are calling is a convenience method that just creates a new parser 
for this particular query, then calls non-static parse method.

I _think_ you can just pass null (or dummy field name) in your case if you are 
absolutely sure fields for all terms are defined in query.
