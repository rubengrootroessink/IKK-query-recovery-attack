This sounds interesting, as I have been thinking of what's the best way
to boost newer documents. Can you share some of your experience regarding 
boost values that seemed to make sense? In my case, CMS I'm working on stores 
support documentation for software/hardware, meaning that content is highly 
time-sensitive (ie. documents "decay" pretty quickly).

Since the system is already doing both incremental reindexing, and nightly 
full reindexing (latter to make sure that even if temporarily some changed 
content was not [fully] reindexed, it eventually gets indexed properly), I 
can fairly easily add boosting I think.

On a related note, it would also be nice if there was a way to start 
categorizing general "hot topics" for Lucene developers; it seems like there 
are about half a dozen areas where there's lots of interest for improvements 
(most of them related to ranking). If so, perhaps there could be more 
specific discussion groups, and also perhaps web pages summarizing some of 
discussions, consensus achieved, even if there's no code to show for it?
