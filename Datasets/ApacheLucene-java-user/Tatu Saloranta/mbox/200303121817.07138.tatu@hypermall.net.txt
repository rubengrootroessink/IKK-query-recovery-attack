Yes, but neither is compound word itself ever user in query either, assuming
same analyser is used (like it always should)?

But same happens during indexing; fotbollsmatch should be properly
split and stemmed to "fotboll" and "match" terms, right?

I actually think that if user has to be aware of internal stemming and 
reformulate query I think this would be bit of a problem. :-)
But I'm not 100% sure search string would differ from indexed string, assuming 
same base token (unprocessed token, ie "fotbollsmatch") was both contained
in the document and searched for using QueryParser.

I think that in general behaviour is heavily dependant on analyser (tokenizer 
+ stemmer) being used, so it's probably different between most languages.
