Actually I think it should, as long as you change 'and' to 'AND' and 'or' to 
'OR' (upper case versions are used, I think, to make it less likely user 
meant to match words 'and' and 'or'?).

Well, writing simple grammar and parser is fairly easy to do, if you've ever 
used java_cup or javacc (or just (b)yacc / bison), shouldn't take all that 
long since all actual query classes already exist. But I don't think you need 
to do even that. :-)

The only feature that might need some additional work is matching "oracle 
admin*"; PhrasePrefixQuery allows doing something like that, but it's not 
integrated with QueryParser (I think it probably should, and might be quite 
easy to do).
