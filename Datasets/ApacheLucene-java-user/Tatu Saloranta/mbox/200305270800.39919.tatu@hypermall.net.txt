I think question kind of still stands, since J2EE does not really mean (just) 
EJB, but complete set of APIs, from servlets and JSPs to JNDI and EJB.
I was also bit curious about EJB aspect; perhaps implementation would be 
needed to more easily access Lucene functionality from app that is based on 
EJB? On the other hand, if system is nicely modularized and perhaps 
distributed, that wouldn't be a requirement? (ie. it's possible to make 
things co-exist).

On the other hand, having dummy implementation of JDBC-driver for Lucene might 
be interesting... (related to your first point of using Lucene as replacement 
for RDBs) after all, Lucene's (user visible) data model should map quite 
easily to a table, and implementing metadata methods should be trivial from
that.
Not sure how easy it'd be to map queries, but for certain subset that might be 
possible too. :-)
