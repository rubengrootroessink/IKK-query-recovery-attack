Two obvious candidates are locking bottleneck methods and doing index
writing in a critical section, or having a background thread that does
reindexing, and other threads add requests to a queue. In CMS I'm working we 
are doing the latter (so as not to block actual request threads which could
happen with first approach, adding/deleting documents is done as 
post-processing when documents are created/edited/deleted).

In either case you usually have a singleton instance that represents the 
search engine functionality (assuming single index), and from there on it's 
reasonably easy to reuse IndexReader as necessary.
