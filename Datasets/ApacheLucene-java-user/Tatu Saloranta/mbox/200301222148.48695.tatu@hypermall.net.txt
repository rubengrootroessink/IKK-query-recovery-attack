SUBJECT: Range queries
DATE: 23 Jan 2003

My apologies if this is a FAQ (which is possible as I am new to Lucene, 
however, I tried checking the web page for the answer).

I read through the "Query syntax" web page first, and then checked the 
matching query classes. It seems like query syntax page is missing some 
details; the one I was wondering about was the range query. Since query 
parser seems to construct these queries, I guess they have been implemented, 
even though syntax page didn't explain them. Is that correct?

Looking at QueryParser, it seems that inclusive range query uses [ and ], and 
exclusive query { and }? Is this right? And does it expect exactly two 
arguments?
Also, am I right in assuming that range uses lexiographic ordering, so that it
basically includes all possible words (terms) between specified terms (which 
will work ok with numbers/dates as long as they have been padded with zeroes 
or such)?

Another question I have is regarding wildcard search. Page mentions that there 
is a restriction that search term can not start with a wild card (as that 
would render index useless I guess... would need to full scan?). However, it 
doesn't mention if multiple wildcards are allowed? All the example cases just 
have single wild card?

Sorry for the newbie questions,

ps. Thanks for the developers for the neat indexing engine. I am currently 
evaluating it for use in a large-scale enterprise content management system.
