There is another question I was wondering; since JSP is not XML (ie. can not 
be reliably parse using an XML or even HTML parser [or for that matter, even 
with simplest XML markup tokenizer that ignores nesting], needs a lower level 
scanner), has anyone tried connecting an actual JSP processor to Lucene? Or 
writing a simple one just meant for indexing, without having to execute code 
embedded?
[the problem with JSP compared to XML is that it need not nest properly with 
HTML content around; one can use JSP inside attribute values, for example; 
thus, first JSP has to be processed to HTML, and then HTML needs to be 
further tokenized]

Jakarta has to have at least one such processor (haven't looked at whether 
there's a separate component or if Tomcat just has one embedded?). Of course 
parsing JSP is problematic in many ways, not just getting jsp tagging out; 
dynamic portions probably just have to be ignored, and all text inside 
included (except for things inside comments).
