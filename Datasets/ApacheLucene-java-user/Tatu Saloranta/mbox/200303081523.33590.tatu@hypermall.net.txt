I have never done sorting, and results have come in descerding order of 
relevance... and I doubt that could happen by just pure coincidence. :-)
I haven't looked at the sources, but I believe at least the 'high-level' 
access methods do return results in best-match-first order.

If I have understood ranking code properly (from FAQ and previous messages on 
this list; check archives for those), there's no guarantee that term boosted 
by '4' would get 40% weight of resulting score, nor that '1' would get 10%. 
Rather, 4 would mean it gets (relatively speaking) 4 times as big boost 
before normalization as it would by default.
Default weighing depends on frequence of the key term in indexed content as 
far I have understood.

It should be possible to override this if you just want equal weighings 
independent of search term (before boosting; normalization does not alter 
relative weighing), although I haven't gone through ranking code.
