Further, oftentimes search index only contains key to actual content indexed 
(which itself is stored as a file, in database, or so)... so it's enough to 
cache just set of such ids, not actual search result objects.
And assuming ids are simple (int id, short String), such information can be 
stored in, say, user session.
In system I'm working on, we store up to 500 hits, only storing document id 
(int) and hit quality (byte), stored in session.
