Not me... but at some point I think I briefly mentioned that someone with 
extra time might want to do a very simple JDBC driver to be used with
Lucene. Obviously it would be very minimal for queries (and might need
to invent new SQL operators for some searches), but it could also expose
metadata about index. Should be an interesting exercise at least. :-)
Plus, if done properly, tools like DBVis could be used for simple Lucene
testing as well.

If so, who knows; perhaps that would make it even easier to do prototype
implementations of Lucene replacing home-grown SQL-bound search
functionalities of apps.

Most of all above would just be a nice little hack, though. :-)
