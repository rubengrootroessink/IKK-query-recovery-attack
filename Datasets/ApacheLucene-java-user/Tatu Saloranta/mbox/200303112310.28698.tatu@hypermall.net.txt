(same applies to many other languages so this is a common problem I think).

However... I'm not sure why you consider this a problem? The reason quotes
are added is that since a single token (as parsed by QueryParser) expands no
multiple terms, it becomes a PhraseQuery. Same happen (should happen)
during indexing, so end result should match word in both "normal" case (word 
is correctly spelled as compound word) and when word is (incorrectly) spelled 
with spaces?
As to quotes; they are only shown when converting query to a String; 
internally there are no quotes to be matched.
