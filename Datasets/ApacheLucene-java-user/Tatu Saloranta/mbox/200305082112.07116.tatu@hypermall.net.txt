Whether wildcard/prefix queries are lowercased or not is a configurable 
option, defaulting to doing lowercasing automatically. You probably should 
turn it off (check out QueryParser.jj for exact method name).
And yes, wildcard queries do not go through analyzer, since there are 
potential problems from applying an analyzer. If you'd like to make them go 
through analyzer, making this change to QueryParser.jj would be easy to do. 
There was also some talk about allowing analyzer to use for wildcard queries 
to be configured, defaulting to 'none'.

Hope this helps,
