Have you looked at MultiFieldQueryParser source? It's a very simple class, and
modifying it (making a new class) should be easy; pass in not only field names 
but also weights to apply?
(as a sidenote, MultiFieldQueryParser does some unnecessary work as is... it 
seems to re-parse same query once for each field, could just clone it)
