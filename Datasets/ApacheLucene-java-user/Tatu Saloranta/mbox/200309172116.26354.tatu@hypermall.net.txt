Perhaps just one generic "content" field, which would contain tokenized
content from all XML segments. That could be done easily & efficiently
with just sax event handling? Since it's a simple demo, you can't get much
simpler than that, but it should still be fairly useful?
Attributes could/should be ignored by default; common practice for XML markup
seems to be for attributes not to contain any content that would make sense to 
index.

So I'd think just stripping out all tags (and comments, PIs etc) might be 
reasonable plain simple approach for demo app.
