On the other hand, one needs to be sure that no other code assumes Tokens are 
immutable. For example, if they weren't one couldn't reliably use tokens in 
Sets or Maps (not sure if it's useful to do that, just an example).

I guess it's really matter of whether tokens were designed as immutable (which 
often makes sense for similar objects), or if they just happen to be, due to 
lack of modifier method(s).
