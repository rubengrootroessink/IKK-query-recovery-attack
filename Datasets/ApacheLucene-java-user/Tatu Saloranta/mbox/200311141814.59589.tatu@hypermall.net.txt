Isn't that quite strict interpretation, however? There are many cases where 
linguistically separate sentences do have strong dependendies; in web world 
simple things like list items may be very closely related. Put another way;
it may not be trivially easy to detect sentence boundaries, nor is it certain 
that what (from language viewpoint) is a boundary really is hard boundary 
from semantic perspective? And are there not varying levels of separation 
(sentences close to each other often are related, back references being 
common), not just one, between sentences?

As to storing boundaries in index; am I naive if I suggested just marker 
tokens that could easily be used to mark boundaries (sentence, paragraph, 
section)? Code that uses that information would obviously need to know 
details of marking used, but would it be infeasible to use such in-band 
information?
