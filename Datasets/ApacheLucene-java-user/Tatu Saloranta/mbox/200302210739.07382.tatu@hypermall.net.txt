Perhaps look at the line where the null pointer exception is thrown and see 
what happens? NullPointerException is thrown when a null reference is being 
de-referenced. Seeing the immediate cause should be easy, given line number.

Perhaps you have added a field with null value? (just a guess, I don't know if 
that's even illegal).
