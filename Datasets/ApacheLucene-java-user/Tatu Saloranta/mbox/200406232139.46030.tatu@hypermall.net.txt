You could also use a StAX-compliant parser (StAX is the 3rd somewhat official 
XML-parsing API for J2EE; JCP recently approved); implementation of which are 
as fast as SAX-parsers, but significantly easier to use, especially for 
things like extracting content. Combination is achieved by using fully 
streaming parsing, but in pull (as opposed to SAX' "push") mode, ie. don't 
call me, I'll call you ("inversion of inversion of control", IOIOC?)

You can go to:
http://stax-utils.dev.java.net/
to find more info, or google for something like "stax java". There are at 
least 2 publicly available open source implementations, and they should both 
work for simple XML content extraction (disclaimer: I wrote one of the 
implementations, so no comments on goodness etc; you should be able to find 
links from stax-utils page; if not, email me for details).

If anyone tries this approach, I'd be very interested in performance results,
