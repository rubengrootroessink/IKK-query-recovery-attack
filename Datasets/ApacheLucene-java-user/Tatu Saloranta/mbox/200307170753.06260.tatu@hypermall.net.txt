You can also replace all stop words with "dummy" token ("" might be an ok 
candidate?). That would be similar to indexing "the" (which probably is  
better idea than indexing ",").

I'm planning to do something similar for paragraph breaks (in case of plain 
text, double linefeed, for HTML <p> etc), to prevent similar problems.
