[regarding ext2-fs 'feature' on Linux]

I think this 'feature' might be useful thing to document in a FAQ. Perhaps 
there should be a platform-dependancies FAQ (or sub-section). Wasn't there 
also some concern regarding Windows platform, where deleted status of a file
was not reliably accessed by Java (or something similar)?

Also, do you think ext3 has same problem? (or if it has, other new journaling 
file systems).
