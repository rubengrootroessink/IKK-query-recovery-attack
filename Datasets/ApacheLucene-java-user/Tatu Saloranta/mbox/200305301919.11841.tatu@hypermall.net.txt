Yes, this is the exact problem that was brought up last time this was 
discussed. It may not be a very common problem (most of the time stemming a 
wildcard part probably works ok, somebody had tried that), but still a 
potential one. And that's why default lower casing was added, as it solved 
one of FAQs. It is much more common that analyzer used for non-wildcard query 
does lower casing, than not, and thus default setting (which leads to having
to turn feature off by some users) seems to make sense.

More general problem then is that there's no real way to stem "foo?ar", or any 
non-prefix wildcard query, but that could be figured out by QueryParser if 
necessary.
