Although technically speaking that would work, in general it's almost always 
better to check for a condition that can occur  instead of waiting for an 
exception to occur. For example, if there is a chance that a reference may 
well be null, it's better to check for null than to do try-catch for 
NullPointerException; if no null is expected, no specific catch block is 
needed (it may make sense to have catch-all construct for robustness, but not 
for specific one).

Exceptions are to be used only for exceptional things, and for iterating over 
non-optimized index, finding a deleted doc is nothing too exceptional? If 
index is assumed to be optimal, and no deleted docs should be there, then it 
may be reasonable to use try-catch "just in case".

There's a significant overhead for just creating the exception object (JVM 
needs to unwind the whole call stack, and that's seldom optimized by VMs... 
because they optimize non-exception cases etc. etc.), and when iterating over 
all docs, this overhead may make traversing significantly slower if there are 
multiple deleted docs.
