A guess: this was an something easy to implement and still useful for some 
users (since in many cases some documents can be considered "better", based 
on some feedback or source or type). It doesn't really replace more advanced 
methods of figuring out relevance. So what you are requesting could well 
co-exist with doc boost feature.

I don't know if there's any feature that would do exactly that, but if you can 
separate just one or two classes of "more important" words (keywords), you 
could create separate index(es) for those, and boost the search to keyword 
index higher than search for other plain text content.
