SUBJECT: Data structure of a Lucene Index
DATE: 29 Mar 2006

It seems to me that lucene doesn't use B-tree for its indexing storage. 
Any paper/article which explains the theory behind data-structure of  
single index(segment).  I am not referring to the merge algorithm, I am 
curious to know the storage structure of a single optimized lucene index.

Any pointer is greatly appreciated.
