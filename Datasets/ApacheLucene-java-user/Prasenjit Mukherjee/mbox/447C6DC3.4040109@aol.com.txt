SUBJECT: Enforcing Primary key uniqueness in lucene index
DATE: 30 May 2006

I want to enforce the concept of a unique primary key in lucene index by 
having a field whose values has to be unique for all lucene documents. 
One way  is to do a search just before indexing, but that seems to 
consume lot of time as you have to create a new IndexSearcher every time 
you want to index/search.

Won't it be nice if we could do it while indexing itself ?

thanks,
Prasen
