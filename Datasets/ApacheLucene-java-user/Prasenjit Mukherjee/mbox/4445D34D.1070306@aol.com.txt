SUBJECT: Any storage initatives for optimized indexing/searching
DATE: 19 Apr 2006

It seems that the performance aspects of any indexing/searching 
algorithm is very much dependent upon the disk-access-technologies.  
Just curious, anybody know of any company working(mostly storage 
companies)  in improving their storage/disk access technology  to make  
indexing/searching efficient by optimizing  k-way merges/sorts ?
