SUBJECT: WIll storing  docs affect lucene's search performance ?
DATE: 11 Aug 2006

I have a requirement ( use highlighter) to  store the doc content 
somewhere., and I am not allowed to use a RDBMS. I am thinking of using 
Lucene's Field with (Field.Store.YES and Field.Index.NO) to store the 
doc content. Will it have any negative affect on my search performance ? 

I think I have read somewhere that  Lucene shouldn't be used(or 
misused)  to provide RDBMS like storage.
