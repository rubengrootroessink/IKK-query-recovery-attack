Hi  All,
           I would like to ask for suggestions to my issue.
I have implemented by extending the MultiCombination Query class, a
 query term(s) to be searched across ALL /ANY of the fields ( just like
 we do AND/OR among the query term(s)).
But, it takes too much time( in fact never completes) for those query terms
that are there ( at least one among them) in the inverted stored list( based
on the index earlier formed)
 but are not satisfying the Fields' combination criteria.
But, if perform an OR among the same specified fields( from a search box)
then it performs quickly.

Regards,
Jitender
