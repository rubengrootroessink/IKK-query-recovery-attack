 Thanks for your reply. I think you mean to say that  for the case of 2 fields title, body
and query "aaa bbb"
what the AND should look in the "query" data item is:
+(title:aaa + title:bbb) +(body:aaa + body:bbb)
and not
+(title:aaa title:bbb) +(body:aaa body:bbb)

But will this apply if on eof the fields is null as my original query had missed one issue,
i.e. if one field is null 
for a given Hit object even it ( the given Hit object  ) is there.
