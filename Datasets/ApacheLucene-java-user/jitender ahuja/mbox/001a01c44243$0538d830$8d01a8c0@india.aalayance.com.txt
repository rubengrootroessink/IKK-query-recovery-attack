Hi,
     First, u need to generate index using ur own or the demo(e.g.,
IndexHTML for text or HTML) provided file to create index at the command
line. If u can create ur own index creator file that 's the best and very
easy. Regarding links u better use some search engine and search for "
lucene tutorial" by erik hatcher or generally.
Regards,
Jitender
