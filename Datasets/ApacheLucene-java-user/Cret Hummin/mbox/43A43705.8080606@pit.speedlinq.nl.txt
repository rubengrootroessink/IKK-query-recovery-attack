SUBJECT: Filtering after Query
DATE: 17 Dec 2005

Hi All,

When using Searcher.search(Query, Filter), and I use my own custom 
filter, it appears I'm presented with /all/ the documents in the index, 
i.e. in the method bits(IndexReader reader) from my custom Filter, the 
value of reader.maxDoc() is always the number of documents in the index. 
The same is true when do Searcher.search(FilteredQuery(Query, Filter)).

Is it possible to filter /after/ the query has limited the number of 
possible documents, /before/ returning a Hits collection?




Regards,
Laurens
