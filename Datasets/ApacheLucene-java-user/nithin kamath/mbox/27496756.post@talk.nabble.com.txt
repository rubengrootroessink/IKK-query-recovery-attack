SUBJECT: Lucene document get values
DATE: 8 Feb 2010


Hi,

I have a lucene document which has a field which appears repeatedly in the
document, I use doc.getFieldables(fieldName) to get the field values; when
the number of fields become huge; getting the field values is taking up a
lot of memory, is there some other way that I could get the field values
probably in a more efficient way.

thanks & regards
nithin
