SUBJECT: Lucene IndexOutput
DATE: 21 Nov 2009


I use Lucene's IndexOutput to dump index contents to a file, I use
createOutput method in FSDirectory to create the file in the directory with
the given name and use writeString and writeInt to write into it. 

The createOutput method though creates a new file each time, is there anyway
that I can append to an existing file by seeking to the end of the file? 

Thanks,
nithin
