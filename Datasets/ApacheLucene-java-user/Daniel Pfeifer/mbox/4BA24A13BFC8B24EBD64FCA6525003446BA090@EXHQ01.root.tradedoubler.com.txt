Well,

We are sporting Solaris 10 on a Sun Fire-machine with four cores and
12GB of RAM and mirrored Ultra 320-disks. I guess I could try switching
to FSDirectory and hope for the best.

I seem to say this a lot :), but, assuming your OS has a decent
filesystem cache, try reducing your JVM heapsize, using an FSDirectory
instead of RAMDirectory, and see if your filesystem cache does ok.  If
you have 12GB, then you should have enough RAM to hold both the old
and new indexes during the switchover.
