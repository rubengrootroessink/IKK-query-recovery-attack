SUBJECT: How to use LARM
DATE: 17 Aug 2003

Hello,
     I have a requirement for a web crawler which should
recursively search a given URL for a set of search keywords.
e.g.. I would like to search http://cnn.com for any news on
Formula-One that happened today.

I would like to know the following,
1> Can i use LARM with Lucene for this.
2> Where can i get a copy of LARM jar file.

Any help is appreciated,

Thanks,
Jagadesh.
