Good suggestion, I tried watching the GCs in YourKit while testing but
unfortunately they don't seem to line up with the searches that take
forever. They also don't last long enough to make up that kind of
time. I have our heap limited to 1GB right now and its using around
768MB of that.

Are you sure it's not just a big GC?  How big is your heap?
