SUBJECT: Understanding QueryParserTokenManager and QueryParser classes
DATE: 20 Jun 2007


Hello.

I want to add an operator like (*) to query syntax. Then, I need to know and
understand QueryParserTokenManager and QueryParser classes well.
But I don't know, how can I find documents about these classes and
algorithms of identifying tokens and other things in query string .

Thanks for your help.
