ok so why do you build lucene documents if you use solr? Can you use
SolrJ which does all the serialization work for you?!

Again solr should do all the tokenization work for you - no need to
use a TokenSTream on the client side.

so you mean you would want to do that analysis on the client side and
only shoot the already tokenized values to the server?
What exactly is too slow? Can you provide more info what the problem is?

After all I think you should ask on the solr-user list instead.
