you have maxDocs which gives you the maxdocid-1 but this might not be
super accurate since there might have been merges going on in the
background. I am not sure if this number you are asking for will
really help you with what you are trying todo.
If you want to rollback to your previous version why don't you keep
that commit point around and just open it again if something goes
wrong. You can specify a DeletionPolicy that keeps your opimized index
around until you nuke it in the case everything goes ok?
