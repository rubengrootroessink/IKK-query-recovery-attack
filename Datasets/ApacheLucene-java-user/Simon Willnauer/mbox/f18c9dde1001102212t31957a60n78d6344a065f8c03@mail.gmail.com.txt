You should really look at Nutch.
from the website http://lucene.apache.org/nutch: Nutch is open source
web-search software. It builds on Lucene Java<http://lucene.apache.org/java/>,
adding web-specifics, such as a crawler, a link-graph database, parsers for
HTML and other document formats, etc.

sounds like a good place to start, doesn't it :)
