Hi Otis,

well if i have to such a query I need a "dummy" value. To point that
out a bit more in detail...
A xml document has "n" mandatory elements described by a schema or
dtd. Some of the could have empty values. Would it make any difference
to the index / searching  if I just index an empty string?! Well I
guess not, to index an empty string feels good for me to have all
fields in every document. This tiny little disc space does not matter
I guess.

Is that true so far?!

regards Simon

you'll actually have to stuff a "dummy" value when no real value for field F is present. 
If you have an index schema, perhaps that's a good place to add a 'defaultValue'-type attribute
with that dummy value.  Perhaps Solr already has something like this, I'm not sure.
