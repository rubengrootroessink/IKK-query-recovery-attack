hi there,

the answer is yes, you are missing something :). When you open the
reader from your writer via IW#getReader() you get a "current view" of
your index (same is true when opening from directory). To refresh this
view you need to call IndexReader#reopen() in order to seen any
updates. For the NRT reader (created via IW#getReader()) this will be
an uncommitted view giving you access to documetns not yet committed.
If you are opened from a Directory you see all the already committed
changes.

you should use the reopen like this:
IndexReader reader = ...
IndexReader newReader = r.reopen();
if (newReader != reader) {
   // reader was reopened
   reader.close();
}
reader = newReader;

please be careful with reopening the reader, this operation can be
costly if you are useing NRT readers. You should maybe do this
periodically or if you don't have any freshness constraints simply use
a reader opened from a directoy and reopen after commit.
