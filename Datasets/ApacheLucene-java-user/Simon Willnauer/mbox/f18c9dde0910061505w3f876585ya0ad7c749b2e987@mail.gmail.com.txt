Hi,
a call to IndexSearcher.doc(docId) will load the document. Internally
this call forwards to IndexReader.document(docId) which could be very
expensive because this method will load all stored document fields.

I would recommend to have a look at IndexSearcher.doc(docId,
FieldSelector). This method offers you way more control over field
loading costs. With the FieldSelector you can directly load fields, do
lazy loading or stop the loading process once a certain field was
loaded.
If you do not load a field due to the fieldSelector a call to
Document.get("fieldname") will return null.
