Sure you can do this.
You index your document with the keywords assigned to the document and
search with and Boolean Query to get all document having the keyword
1,2,...n-1,n. Just be aware that there are limitations to boolean
queries in lucene. see setMaxClauseCount(). which can be very memory
consuming. But I guess you will search for a small amounts of
keywords, do you?
