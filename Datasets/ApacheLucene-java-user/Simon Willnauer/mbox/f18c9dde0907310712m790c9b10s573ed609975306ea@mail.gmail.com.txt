SUBJECT: Re: Is there any difference between using QueryParser and	MultiFieldQueryParser when have single default search field ?

This would not make much of a difference. I would guess that you have
one additional "wrapping" boolean query if you use
MultiFieldQueryParser. For query "foo AND bar" the MFQueryParser
creates +(fname:foo) +(fname:bar) and QueryParser would create
+fname:foo +fname:bar so in this case one level of BooleanQuery more
than QueryParser.
