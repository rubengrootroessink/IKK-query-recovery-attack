SUBJECT: Re: Modifying score based on tf and slop
DATE: 6 May 2009

Hey,
If I get you right you wanna make tf not affecting the score at all.
if so why don't you just return 1.0f by overriding similarity?
If you just wanna do that for the query you are using you could
override Query#getSimilarity and return a delegate to the actual
similarity.

Hope that helps.
