DATE: 17 Mar 2009

Hi Paul,
If you do not store all the data inside lucene you have to get you
updated data from you spreadsheet again. Even if you would store all
the data you would have to update the document by creating a new one
and adding it to the index using updateDocument(). You can not update
just one single field. If you get a Document from your index calling
removeField() does not have any effect. The add and removeField
methodes only make sense prior to adding a document to an index. These
methods cannot be used to change the content of an existing index! In
order to achieve this, a document has to be deleted from an index and
a new changed version of that document has to be added.

Creating and updating your document from the spreadsheet data is the way to go.
