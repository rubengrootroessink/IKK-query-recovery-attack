An other way to prevent your indexsearch from reopened everytime you
delete an document is to use a global delete filter which excludes all
deleted documents from being retrieved e.g. included in your search
results. That won't work with updates without using a buffer or
something similar but if you have to deal only with deletes a filter
would do the job and the indexsearcher will remain open until you
commit an update or insert (thats what you would call it in a db
context, remember lucene is a reverse index not a database).
