Those punctuation are only for floating point, ip-addresses etc.
StandardTokenizer does not have punctuation explicitly set. You can
assume that it will drop and split on almost all punctuations coming
along in the input string.

Have a look at StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex the gramma is quiet easy to
understand and gives you a better idea what this tokenizer does.

The string ahmet:arslan will produce two tokens ahmet and arslan. It also breaks words at
"=" character in both query/index time.

the file StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex. It recognizes the followings as one token: {ALPHANUM},
{APOSTROPHE}, {ACRONYM}, {COMPANY}, {EMAIL} {HOST}, {NUM}, {CJ}, {ACRONYM_DEP} and ignores
the rest. There are some definitions of these token types, similar to Regular Expression.
You can change behavior of StandardTokenizer by editing this file and generating StandardTokenizerImpl.java
from it. There is also another jflex file named WikipediaTokenizerImpl.jflex. By looking it
you can understand how new token types can be added.
