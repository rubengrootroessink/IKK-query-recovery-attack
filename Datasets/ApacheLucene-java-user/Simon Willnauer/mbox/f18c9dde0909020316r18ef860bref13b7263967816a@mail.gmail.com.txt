Hey there, AFAIK this problem on S3 has not been solved but anyway
there might be other solutions to overcome this problem. As you are
running on amazon anyway you might wanna consider to have some locking
service like ZooKeeper  (http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/) which
could help you with other problems in the future too. You might wanna
look at the recipes section
(http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.2.0/recipes.html#sc_recipes_Locks)
and create you distributed lock yourself.
One more thing, I guess this is not a lucene-locking problem as the
locking API is highly customizable see LockFactory
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/store/LockFactory.html)
and Directory@setLockFactory
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/store/Directory.html#setLockFactory%28org.apache.lucene.store.LockFactory%29)
