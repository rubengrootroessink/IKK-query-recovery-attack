Anshum, thanks for posting this on the list. I have a view comments on
that benchmark while being happy that lucene has an upper hand in
yours.
I wonder if you can publish the various modifications you did to
either of those? If not would it be possible to run the benchmarks
against the vanilla versions? Did you use an already released version
of lucene or did you do modifications against the trunk? I found it
little hard to read - putting it into a table would make little more
sense to me though. I personally would be interested in what kind of
analysis you have applied to the index document and the queries
though.
