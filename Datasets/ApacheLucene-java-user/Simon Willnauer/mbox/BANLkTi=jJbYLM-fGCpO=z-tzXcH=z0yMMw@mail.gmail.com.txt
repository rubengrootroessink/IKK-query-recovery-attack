SUBJECT: Travel Assistance applications now open for ApacheCon NA 2011
DATE: 6 Jun 2011

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)'s Travel Assistance Committee (TAC) is
now accepting applications for ApacheCon North America 2011, 7-11 November
in Vancouver BC, Canada.

The TAC is seeking individuals from the Apache community at-large --users,
developers, educators, students, Committers, and Members-- who would like to
attend ApacheCon, but need some financial support in order to be able to get
there. There are limited places available, and all applicants will be scored
on their individual merit.

Financial assistance is available to cover flights/trains, accommodation and
entrance fees either in part or in full, depending on circumstances.
However, the support available for those attending only the BarCamp (7-8
November) is less than that for those attending the entire event (Conference
+ BarCamp 7-11 November). The Travel Assistance Committee aims to support
all official ASF events, including cross-project activities; as such, it may
be prudent for those in Asia and Europe to wait for an event geographically
closer to them.

More information can be found at http://www.apache.org/travel/index.html
including a link to the online application and detailed instructions for
submitting.

Applications will close on 8 July 2011 at 22:00 BST (UTC/GMT +1).

We wish good luck to all those who will apply, and thank you in advance for
tweeting, blogging, and otherwise spreading the word.

Regards,
The Travel Assistance Committee
