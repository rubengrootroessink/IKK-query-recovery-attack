when searching with Lucene? I read some about WordPress but it seems those synonyms are predefined
English words. The application I am working with searches for the names of contacts and companies.
I would like for the user to be able to set "Dan" as a synonym for "Daniel" or "BOA" for "Bank
of America" ...etc
