In this case i am getting frequently OOME. If i increased the memory limit to 1 GB / 1.5 GB
then it is working fine. My point is it will also will get exhausted when it reaches 60 /
90 million documents.

This parameter has no effect. Whether this parameter should be set while building index? I
build the index using default value. After hitting OOME i am setting this.
I would be curious what you do to your index. do you have a lot of
pending deletes? do you call optimize frequently? In which situations
do you hit the OOM?

Loaded terms might not dominate your memory consumption in side
lucene. Again, you should provide more information of indexing, the
environment and the situation where the error occurs.
