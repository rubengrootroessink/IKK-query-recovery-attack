Hey Lucene Users,

Heise.de (
http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/Such-Engine-Lucene-in-Version-2-9-erschienen-810377.html)
has just published an article about the new 2.9 release.
Unfortunately they only published the german version while we tried to get
the english one too. Thanks to Isabel (http://blog.isabel-drost.de/) again
for all the work.
