Hi Kim,

Bad news, branch_3x has not been released yet! Good news, we are about
to release 3_x in the very near future. Branch is already in a code
freeze status so the release might happen very soon though (next 2
weeks I hope / guess). You can follow the dev@lucene.apache.org if you
are interested in the status. Once the release is out we will announce
on the user list too.
