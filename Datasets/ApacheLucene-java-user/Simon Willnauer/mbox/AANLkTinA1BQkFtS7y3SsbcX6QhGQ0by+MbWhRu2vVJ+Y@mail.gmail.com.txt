Jan, can you elaborate the problem a little more. I see you do
indextime analysis with lowercasing (look at LowerCaseTokenizer btw.)
but you don't do lowercaseing at query time.
You could also use the QueryParser to create phrase query automatically though.

Could you give us an idea what the "wrong" documents look like an what
it matched?

One more unrelated question, what course are you doing - just out of curiosity.
