SUBJECT: [GSoC] Apache Lucene @ Google Summer of Code 2011 [STUDENTS READ THIS]
DATE: 11 Mar 2011

Hey folks,

Google Summer of Code 2011 is very close and the Project Applications
Period has started recently. Now it's time to get some excited students
on board for this year's GSoC.

I encourage students to submit an application to the Google Summer of Code
web-application. Lucene & Solr are amazing projects and GSoC is an
incredible opportunity to join the community and push the project
forward.

If you are a student and you are interested spending some time on a
great open source project while getting paid for it, you should submit
your application from March 28 - April 8, 2011. There are only 3
weeks until this process starts!

Quote from the GSoC website: "We hear almost universally from our
mentoring organizations that the best applications they receive are
from students who took the time to interact and discuss their ideas
before submitting an application, so make sure to check out each
organization's Ideas list to get to know a particular open source
organization better."

So if you have any ideas what Lucene & Solr should have, or if you
find any of the GSoC pre-selected projects [1] interesting, please
join us on dev@lucene.apache.org [2].  Since you as a student must
apply for a certain project via the GSoC website [3], it's a good idea
to work on it ahead of time and include the community and possible
mentors as soon as possible.

Open source development here at the Apache Software
Foundation happens almost exclusively in the public and I encourage you to
follow this. Don't mail folks privately; please use the mailing list to
get the best possible visibility and attract interested community
members and push your idea forward. As always, it's the idea that
counts not the person!

That said, please do not underestimate the complexity of even small
"GSoC - Projects". Don't try to rewrite Lucene or Solr!  A project
usually gains more from a smaller, well discussed and carefully
crafted & tested feature than from a half baked monster change that's
too large to work with.

Once your proposal has been accepted and you begin work, you should
give the community the opportunity to iterate with you.  We prefer
"progress over perfection" so don't hesitate to describe your overall
vision, but when the rubber meets the road let's take it in small
steps.  A code patch of 20 KB is likely to be reviewed very quickly so
get fast feedback, while a patch even 60kb in size can take very
- Hide quoted text -
long. So try to break up your vision and the community will work with
you to get things done!

On behalf of the Lucene & Solr community,

Go! join the mailing list and apply for GSoC 2011,

Simon
