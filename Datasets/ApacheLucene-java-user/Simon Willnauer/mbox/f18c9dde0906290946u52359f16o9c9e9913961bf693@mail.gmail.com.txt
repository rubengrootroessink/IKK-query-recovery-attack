do you really need to get all docs? wouldn't it be enough to fetch
just the top N you want to display or do you want to display all of
them?

Example:
  IndexReader open = IndexReader.open("/tmp/testindex/");
    IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(open);
    final String fName = "test";
    TopDocs topDocs = searcher.search(new TermQuery(new Term(fName, "lucene")),
        Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    FieldSelector selector = new FieldSelector() {
      public FieldSelectorResult accept(String fieldName) {
        return fieldName == fName ? FieldSelectorResult.LOAD
            : FieldSelectorResult.NO_LOAD;
      }

    };

    final int totalHits = topDocs.totalHits;
    ScoreDoc[] scoreDocs = topDocs.scoreDocs;
    for (int i = 0; i < totalHits; i++) {
      Document doc = searcher.doc(scoreDocs[i].doc, selector);
    }
