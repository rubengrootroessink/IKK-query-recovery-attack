Hey,

you are right FSDirectory is abstract, yet the fact that it doesn't
declare an abstract method doesn't make it wrong. Please use the
static factory methods FSDirectory.open(File) to create an instance.
This factory will create a reasonable default for your platform. see
the javadoc for details
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_3_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/store/FSDirectory.html)
