Hi Chris,

Do you open the writer to add your "update" to before you close the
indexreader to delete the outdated index document?
Another question comes in mind, do you open a new IndexReader for your
searches after the update was written to the index?

You have to follow these steps:
1. Add you document
2. close writer
3. open reader
4. delete the outdated stuff
5. close reader
6. open writer
7. add the update
8. close writer
9. release new searcher / reader

hope that gives you a little help.

best regards simon
