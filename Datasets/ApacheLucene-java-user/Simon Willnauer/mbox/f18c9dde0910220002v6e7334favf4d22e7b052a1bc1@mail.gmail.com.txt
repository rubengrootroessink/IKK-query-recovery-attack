Bill,
per segments search does not replace index optimisation neither it
prevents the performance degrade if your number of segments is
increasing. Depending on how your index changes it can give you a
performance improvement when reopening the index and it will certainly
prevent one or another GC if a segment did not change since last
opened. This will improve the overall performance but the general
query performance will not be improved by per seg. search.
