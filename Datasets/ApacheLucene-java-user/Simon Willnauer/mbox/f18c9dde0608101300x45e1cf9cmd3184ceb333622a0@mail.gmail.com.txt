Hey,
you don't actually need to store it, If you store the content of a
field you can later retrieve it like it used to be and display it may
be in a result list. If you have large content you can also store it
compressed (Field.Store.Compress). If you don't need the content in
any way just use Field.Store.NO.

best regards simon
