The ucene-2.4.0.zip contains the binary distribution of lucene while
ucene-2.4.0-src.zip contains the source files etc.
If you wanna build lucene yourself you need the source distribution,
otherwise the binary is fine for you.
Include the jar files in you project / classpath and start playing
around with it.
These links should give you a good start...

The asc files are signature files, you can use them to verify the
downloaded files using the GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). Check GPG if you
are curious.

happy coding...
