Before you do any further investigation you should have a quick look
at the Lucene index format
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_2/fileformats.html) to get a
feeling about lucenes "standard" index format. We use some compression
techniques like delta coding, VarInt etc. in the current releases but
current trunk development might be more interesting for you. On Lucene
4.0 trunk you will be able to "plug-in" customized codecs for posting
lists, term dicts and others like stored fields (stored fields maybe
soon!). There are efforts towards implementations like PFor
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1410) and others coming
up (GVInt would be nice :).

You should also have a look at mikes post on PFoR
