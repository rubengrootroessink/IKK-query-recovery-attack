SUBJECT: Re: Outof memory exception on using Integer.MaxValue
DATE: 28 Dec 2010

MultiSearcher uses the given integer as the expected number of results
and creates a hitqueue for it. Since you are asking for INT_MAX hits
Lucene creates a hitQueue for either INT_MAX or maxDoc() documents and
preallocates that memory. So in the worst case it creates an Object
array with INTEGER_MAX elements - each taking 8 bytes as the object
reference on a 64 bit VM - unless you have lots of heap space this
will make your vm barf.

you should only specify the number of documents you really want no
blindly get all of them.

why your query returns 0 docs is a different question.
