I can not help you to figure out your exact problem but you can use an
the same indexwriter instance without synchronization. IndexWriter is
threadsafe so you synchronized block seems obsolet.
I could imagine that there is a backgroud merge going on while you try
to access the critical section ( you synchronized block) which could
block you code for a while until the merge has finished. Can you
figure out if a merger-thread is running? The threads name should be
set to something like "Lucene Merge Thread #n"
