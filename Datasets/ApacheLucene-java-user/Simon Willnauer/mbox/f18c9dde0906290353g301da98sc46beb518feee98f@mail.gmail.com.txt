Hey there,
currently lucene offers several possibilities to do what you want.
1. Use payloads
you can encode arbitrary values per term you index and affect scoring
by overriding Similarity#scorePayloads.
2. use IndexReader#termPosition(term) inside a query
you can access the actual term position during scoring to change a
score of a document according to the terms position inside a
document.The returned TermDocuments provides you <document, frequency,
<position>* > for each document a term is contained in. To use this
for scoring you must write your own query or rather subclass an
existing one.

hope that helps.
