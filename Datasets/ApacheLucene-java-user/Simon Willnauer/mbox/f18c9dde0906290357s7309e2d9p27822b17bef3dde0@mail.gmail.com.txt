Hey there,
before going out to use hadoop (hadoop mailing list would help you
better I guess) you could provide more information about you
situation. For instance:
- how big is you index
- version of lucene
- which java vm
- how much heap space
- where does the OOM occure

or maybe there is already an issue that is related to you like this
one: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1566
