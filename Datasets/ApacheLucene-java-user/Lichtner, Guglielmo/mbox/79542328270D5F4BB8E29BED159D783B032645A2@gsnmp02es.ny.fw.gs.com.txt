I'm a newbie, but I could suggest this:

BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
bq.add(firstQuery, true, false);
bq.add(secondQuery, false, true);

That should make the first query required, and the second
one prohibited, which is like saying "+firstQuery -secondQuery"

I haven't tried this myself but I did try this for an either/or combination,
and it does work for me.

hi all

I have a method which takes in a normal query breaks into token and places +
in front it
I have a second method which does the same instead puts a - sign front the
token

the reason i have done this is so that the user do not need to add + and -
signs by themselfs and also I cound
 not get the booleanQuery to work

this makes it so that i have 2 queries 

1) a file must contain all these words
2) a file must exclude this words

my question is how do join these 2 queries togther so it filters out words
that i want and do not want ?

Alex
