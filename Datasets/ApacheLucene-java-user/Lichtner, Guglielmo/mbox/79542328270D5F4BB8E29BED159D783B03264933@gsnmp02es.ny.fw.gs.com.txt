I think I missed the reason why it is now necessary to retrofit Lucene
into an EJB model. EJB is designed for certain uses. What are you planning
to use this for?

I am using Lucene in an EJB environment but I didn't test it thoroughly. I
am new in both technologies, so it wouldn't be strange I made a wrong
approach.

Stateless Session Bean: IndexWriter
Stateless Session Bean: IndexReader
EntityBean: IndexInformation

IndexInformation has the location for accessing the index based on a key.
IndexReader makes the queries with the location set in IndexInformation.
IndexWriter writes a new index in a different location ([indexKey]+[time]),
it doesn't overwrite the old one, so there is no lock problem. When it
finishes the index, it sets a new location in IndexInformation and new
queries are made against the new Index. IndexWriter also waits x time  and
tries to delete the old index (just in case it is in use by an IndexReader
started before the completion of the new index).

I guess it is wrong beacuse It accesses the filesystem but It could be
solved with a jdbc storage.

Please let me know if it is obvious it will stop working soon.

Edgar
