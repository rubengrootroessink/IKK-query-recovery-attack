You should check out the work of Jon Herlocker at Oregon State 
(http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/iis/).  They have written a CF engine that has 
been on my to-do list to check out for a few months (sounds good on 
"paper").  If you get the chance to play with it, I'd be curious to hear 
your feedback.  Having a CF engine in the open source domain would be a 
great thing.
