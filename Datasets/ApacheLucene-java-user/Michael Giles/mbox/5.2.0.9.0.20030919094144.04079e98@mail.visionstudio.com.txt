Fortunately, the sole purpose of the parser that ships with Lucene is 
indexing HTML documents.  As such, I see no reason to worry about 
functionality for other use cases (i.e. IDE development).  There are plenty 
of other parsers out there that try to be complete.  It would be great if 
this one was optimized for the task at hand (and thus can ignore text 
inside <script> tags).

I'd definitely be interested to see what you did.  My application needs to 
index "public" documents as users submit requests (eventually 1000's per 
day), so I don't have control over the HTML (i.e. it needs to be fault 
tolerant) and it needs to be efficient.  Parsing a big page (i.e. 
http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql/bychapter/manual_Reference.html) 
is another good way to stress the basic parsers (some are frighteningly CPU 
intensive).

Even though I think a solid HTML parser that is optimized for the task of 
indexing is actually quite important to Lucene, we can take any further 
discussions off-line as they are probably not deemed relevant to the Lucene 
list.
