SUBJECT: HTML Parsing problems...
DATE: 18 Sep 2003

I know, I know, the HTML Parser in the demo is just that (i.e. a demo), but 
I also know that it is updated from time to time and performs much better 
than the other ones that I have tested.  Frustratingly, the very first page 
I tried to parse failed 
(<http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/32593.html>http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/32593.html).

It seems to be choking on tags that are being written inside of JavaScript 
code (i.e. document.write('</scr' + 'ipt>');.  Obviously, the simple 
solution (that I am using with another parser) is to just ignore everything 
inside of <script> tags.  It appears that the parser is ignoring text 
inside script tags, but it seems like it needs to be a bit smarter (or 
maybe dumber) about how it deals with this (so it doesn't get confused by 
such occurrences).  I see a bug has been filed regarding trouble parsing 
JavaScript, has anyone given it thought?

Outside of the HTML parsing, all is well (and outside of a few pages, the 
parser is a champ).

Thanks!
