Certainly any advancement in this area seems like a good idea.

I'll throw a use case on the pile as well.  For my own interest, the 
biggest need is in highlighting (i.e. highlighting relevant segments within 
the full text of documents).  I need to provide highlighted abstracts in 
the search results, so the solution would need to be performant enough to 
provide that service.
