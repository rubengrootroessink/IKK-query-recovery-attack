Don,

I think you misunderstood Otis.  You will need to use some sort of parser 
(i.e. pdfbox, xpdf) to get the title text from the PDF (I assume you are 
indexing the documents, so you have this already).  Then you create a 
"title" field in your index and store the text of the title in there (so 
that you can return it with the results).  That is independent of what you 
do with the rest of the PDF document.
