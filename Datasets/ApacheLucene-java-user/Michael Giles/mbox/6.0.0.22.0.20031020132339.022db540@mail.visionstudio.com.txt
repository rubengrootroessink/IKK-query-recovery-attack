SUBJECT: Re: Dash Confusion in QueryParser - Bug? Feature?
DATE: 20 Oct 2003

Erik,

I agree with that assessment.  I hadn't taken the time to look at the 
patch, but I am in agreement that the fix should be "stop QueryParser from 
interpreting characters as operators when there is no whitespace 
surrounding them".  As long as the QP doesn't do anything in this case, the 
Analyzer will be able to handle it the same way it did when indexing (which 
is what we want).
