SUBJECT: Performance hits using MultiSearcher?
DATE: 12 Jan 2005

I am pretty new to Lucene.

In my situation, there will be one, most likely, fairly large index, and over 
time a trickle of smaller indexes being created that could eventually number 
into the hundreds. Does using MultiSearcher to search against all these 
separate indexes impose a performance hit as compared to merging the smaller 
indexes into the original larger one? How long could a typical index merge 
take, just arbitrarily?

Thanks,
Ashley
