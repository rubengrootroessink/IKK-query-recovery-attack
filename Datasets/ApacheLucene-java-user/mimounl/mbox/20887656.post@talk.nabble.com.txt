Don't you thing I have to migrate my lucene version to 1.4 because in this
version, it sounds like the writings of document in the index files are
independant from the merge operation ?
I mean, in last version, the merge is performed by default by a
ConcurrentMergeScheduler that will make the commit operation approximatly
constant whatever the size of the index. Is that true ?
