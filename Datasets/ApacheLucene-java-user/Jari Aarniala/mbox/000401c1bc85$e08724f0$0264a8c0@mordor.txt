Well, that's pretty obvious even for me :) If you have separate words,
just tokenize the string and add a plus in front of each of the words.
But what I'm trying to do here is this:

	Let's say I have a more complicated query, say

	'george bush "white house"'

	There you have two separate words, "george" and "bush" and then
"white house" enclosed in quotes. If I use a piece of simple
tokenization code, the above query becomes

	+georbe +bush +"white +house"

See what I mean? That won't work the way expected.
	Anyway, I'm still a bit confused the inner workings of Lucene,
so maybe I'll come up with something myself.
