DATE: 1 May 2007


Hi Mike,

I decided to go ahead and upgrade to Lucene 2.1.  My regression tests seem
fine.  However, I still don't understand the files of the index you've
described.  

>>You can also remove all now-deleted filenames if you are only interested
in the most recent snapshot.
I'm not sure what these "now-deleted filenames" you are referring to.  I'm
indexing a sample set of 10,000 records for my little unit-test and I don't
see (or know) which files would be considered "deleted".  I only see five
files for my 10k records.  They are:

_cd.cfs
_d1.cfs
clearcache
segments.gen
segments_d3


>>it's possible with the trunk version of Lucene to make a simple index
deletion policy that would allow you to run a backup slowly in the 
background without pausing indexing.
Two questions here.  1) when you mean trunk version, can I safely assume
that it has already been packaged in lucene-2.1.0.tar.gz distributed on
17-Feb-2007?  2)  I don't understand what you mean by "simple index deletion
policy".  I think this is a new feature since I can't find it anywhere in my
Lucene In Action book.  Is there some documentation on this?  Seems like
this deletion policy is the key for making live backups.

Thank you.

LH
