SUBJECT: lucene indexes back up strategies
DATE: 27 Apr 2007


I'm pondering on long term maintenance issues with Lucene indexes and would
like to know of anyone's suggestions or recommendations to backing up these
indexes.  My goal is to have a weekly, or even daily, snapshot of the
current index to make sure it is recoverable if the index gets corrupted.  I
won't be able to reindex since my database contains millions of records so
reindexing on-the-fly is not an option.  Also the index size is growing
fast--already at the 56GB mark--that I'm not even sure creating a snapshot
copy is fast enough.  Maybe clustering is better?

Hence if anyone has any recommendations regarding backup strategies for
lucene indexes, I would be grateful.  

Sincerely,

LH
