SUBJECT: IndexingChain and TermHash
DATE: 6 Nov 2009

Hi,

I am trying to modify the indexing chain of Lucene. To start, I have 
extracted and modified the default indexing chain. I have just removed 
the TermVectorsTermsWriter from the chain, i.e., I instantiate a 
TermHash with a null 'nextTermsHash'. So, in the chain, my inverted doc 
consumer looks like:

   final InvertedDocConsumer termsHash = new TermsHash(documentsWriter, 
true, freqProxWriter, null);

 From looking at the code of TermsHash, it looks like you can pass a 
null value as 'nextTermsHash' parameter. However, I got a NPE during the 
TermsHashPerThread initialisation (line 48, primaryPerThread is null).

Is it a normal behavior ? Do TermHash is always waiting for a non null 
'nextTermsHash' by design ?

Thanks
