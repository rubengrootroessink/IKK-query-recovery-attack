As a first impression, what will be handy in order to customize postings 
list will be to make an abstract class FreqProxTermsWriter, that 
separates segment creation and term information serialisation. This 
class will implement the generic logic for flushing and appending 
postings, but will delegate to subclasses the way you write doc + freq 
and prox + payload info.

A first idea will be to have the following abstract methods:
- writeMinState : called by appendPostings, and define how to serialise 
one FreqProxFieldMergeState
- writeDocFreq : called by writeMinState, and define how to serialise 
docs and freq
- writeProx: called by writeMinState and define how to serialise 
positions and payloads

I think other parts of the FreqProxTermsWriter can stay generic. What do 
you think ?

Regards.
