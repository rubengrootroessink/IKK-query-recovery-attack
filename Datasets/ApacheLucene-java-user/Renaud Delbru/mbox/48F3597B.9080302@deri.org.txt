DATE: 13 Oct 2008

Hi Andrzej,

sorry for the late reply.

I have looked at the code. As far as I understand, you sort the posting 
lists based on the first doc skip. The first posting list will be the 
one who have the first biggest document skip.
Do the sparseness of posting lists is a good predictor for sampling and 
ordering posting lists ? Do you know evaluation of such technique ?

In order to implement sorting based on frequency, we need the document 
frequency of each term. This information should be propagated through 
the Scorer classes (from TermScorer to higher level class such as 
ConjunctiveScorer). This will require a call to 
IndexReader.docFreq(term) for each of the term queries. Is docFreq call 
mean another IO access ?

Thanks for the clarification,
Regards.
