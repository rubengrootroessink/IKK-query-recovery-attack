SUBJECT: Posting List Encoding: Group Varint Encoding
DATE: 5 May 2009

Hi,

I know that a new encoding technique, PFOR, is being implemented in the 
Lucene project [1]. Have you heard about the "Group Varint" encoding 
technique from Google ? There is a technical explanation in the talk of 
Jeffrey Dean, "Challenges in Building Large-Scale Information Retrieval 
Systems" (44:02). From the talk, this technique seems quite fast in 
decoding: 400M numbers/second against 180M numbers/second for normal 
Vint encoding; and it seems easy to implement.
It will be maybe interesting to benchmark it against PFOR.
