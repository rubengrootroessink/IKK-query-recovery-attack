So, does it mean that the codec interface is likely to change ? Do I 
need to be prepared to change again all my code ;o) ?

I am using the flex API with the high level Lucene interface 
(IndexWriter and IndexReader).
I am creating a RamDirectory, register my codec into the IndexWriter, 
and index 64 documents. Then, I use the IndexReader.termPositionsEnum to 
get my own DocsAndPositionsEnum in order to check if all the information 
that have been stored in the new index data structure are correctly 
retrieved.
In that case, I got the previous errors (a MultiDocsAndPositionsEnum is 
returned). However, when I am indexing only one or two documents, the 
original DocsAndPositionsEnum is returned.

Hope that helps,
cheers
