SUBJECT: Sorting posting lists before intersection
DATE: 17 Sep 2008

Hi all,

I am wondering if Lucene implements the query optimisation that consists 
of ordering the posting lists based on the term frequency before 
intersection ?
If yes, could somebody point me to the java class / method that 
implements such strategy ?

Thanks in advance,
Regards.
