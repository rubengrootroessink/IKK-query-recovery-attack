SUBJECT: Update of stored and non-indexed binary fields
DATE: 8 Apr 2008

Hi,

I am aware that there is already lots of discussions about field updates 
in Lucene. I post my question anyway because I don't find any 
information about my problem, which is to update a stored but 
non-indexed field.
For example, I have for each document a stored and non-indexed binary 
field 'pagerank', which is a float and which is used for computing the 
score of a document. As the document collection evolves, the pagerank 
for each document evolves also.
Since the pagerank value is stored as a float (BinaryValue), I guess 
that the value size (in byte) is fixed in the field data (.fdt) file. 
Then, could it be possible to overwrite the old float value by a new 
float value ?

Thanks,
