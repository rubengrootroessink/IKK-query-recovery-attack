SUBJECT: Flex & Segment Merging
DATE: 16 Feb 2010

Hi,

I would like to start creating a codec with my own set of index files 
(instead of using the ones from the Standard codec). I have multiple 
questions (I haven't yet found answers by myself) like:
how to specify how these files should be merged ? Is it automatically 
done by the Codec interface ? How is it working currently ?
Is there some restrictions on how segments can be merged ?
Is there a way to extend easily the mechanism on how segments are merged ?

Cheers,
