Ok, thanks for the pointers. I will examine this part of the Lucene code.

Yes, it will be really handy in order to experiment alternative inverted 
index structures. At the moment, it requires quite some work, and 
reverse engineering, in order to be able to modify the index structure.

Ok, thanks for the reference. I will try this solution, and will report 
you any problems I will encounter.
