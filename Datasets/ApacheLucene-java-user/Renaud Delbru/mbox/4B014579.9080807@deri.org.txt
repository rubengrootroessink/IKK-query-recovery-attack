Hi Michael,

I see there is already a huge amount of work already done in 
LUCENE-1458. Is there a way to checkout the corresponding branch, and 
start to use it ? At least, to see if I can extend it and create my own 
Codec.
I have started on my side to abstract the indexing chain of Lucene 2.9, 
in order to be able to plug my own chain, but I have the impression that 
you've done something similar already (with the codec abstraction). 
Would be a pity to lose my time doing something less convenient that 
your appraoch.

Thanks.
