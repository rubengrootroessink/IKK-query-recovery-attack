It depends on the complexity of the search, I think. Also, I belive 
scoring might use more memory than the search itself (can anyone confirm 
this?). For example, I often use the HitCollector interface (and a 
BitSet) for queries where I  am not interested in the score.

Apart from that, I'm not aware of any other methods for reducing the 
memory consumption.
