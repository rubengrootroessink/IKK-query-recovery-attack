Yes, using a range search requires loading all the (existant) terms 
between '10' and '60' and combining them into one big Boolean "or" 
query. There is a limit to how big such a query can get.

The performant alternative is to use a Filter. You lose the ability to 
do boosting on that field, but it can handle ranges of any size.
