There is no such thing as a stupid question ;-)

At the end of the day, Lucene just handles strings; and it handles them
lexocographically. The DateField class turns a Date into a string that
sorts well. (DateField doesn't handle all values of a 'long', though).

For float, you may have to pick some range of floats that you will
allow, and use a java.util.DecimalFormat to format them to a
fixed-width, zero-padded string. If you are going to allow -ve values,
then it gets trickier (I have the trick if you need to know this).
