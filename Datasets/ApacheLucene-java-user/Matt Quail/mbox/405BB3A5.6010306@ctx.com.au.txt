Dennis,

I've attached some sample code that works well for my needs. You should
find it scales very well, even when you search for a "parentpath" near
the root.

The output I get from running this program is:

query:  name:rt.jar
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\jre\lib\rt.jar

query:  name:LICENSE
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\jre\LICENSE
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\LICENSE

query:  fullpath:"D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\LICENSE"
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\LICENSE

query:  parentpath:"D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\include"
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\include\jawt.h
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\include\jni.h
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\include\jvmdi.h
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\include\jvmpi.h
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\include\win32\jawt_md.h
   D:\opt\j2sdk1.4.2\include\win32\jni_md.h
