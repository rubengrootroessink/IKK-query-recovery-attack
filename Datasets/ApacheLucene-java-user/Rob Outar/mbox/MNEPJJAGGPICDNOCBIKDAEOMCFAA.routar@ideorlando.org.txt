SUBJECT: RE: Not getting any results from query
DATE: 18 Nov 2002

I am using the QueryParser class and for that query "test r*" it is forming
a boolean query, not a prefix query.  The problem is I allow clients to
search on whatever they define, if I knew the fields they were searching on
ahead of time then I could use classes that extend Query, but since I do not
know I am forced to use QueryParser class.

Thanks,

Rob

Does not work either, I think it has something to do with the space between
the two words.

This fails test r*

but
test*r* works.

Understanding how the internal of Lucene work is one difficult task but this
group does help a lot.

Thanks,

Rob

How does releaseability:test r* work?
Returns anything?
