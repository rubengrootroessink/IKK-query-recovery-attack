SUBJECT: Checkpointable Index
DATE: 7 Aug 2003

Hi all,

	We have sandboxed file system which Lucene indexes.  Periodically we dump
the file system to disk (checkpoint it); can a Lucene index be checkpointed
then restored and used?  Currently we simply rebuild the index since it only
takes a few minutes.  But we would like the user to be able to take a
snapshot of that file system and restore and use it without rebuilding the
index.

	Let me know.

Thanks,

Rob
