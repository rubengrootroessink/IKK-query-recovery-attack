Otis,

	Tried this:

        f = doc.get(key);

        while (f != null ) {
            l.add(f);
            //get next value for same key
            f = doc.get(key);
            System.out.println(f);
        }

I got an outofmemory error after a while so it looks like it will keep
returning the same value, and not null;

Thanks,

Rob

Looking at the source if looks like you can just call it multiple times
until it returns null.
