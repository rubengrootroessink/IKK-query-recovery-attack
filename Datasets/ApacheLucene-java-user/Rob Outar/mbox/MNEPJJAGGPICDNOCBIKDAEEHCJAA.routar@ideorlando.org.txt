DATE: 9 May 2003

Hi all,

	I keep randomly getting the above exception, although it does not seem to
corrupt the index, I would like to know what is causing it.  Has anyone seen
the above error, or knows why the above error is generated?  I also get
errors about renaming of index files.

	Let me know.

Thanks,

Rob
