We use windows and linux but I have only seen this error on Windows so far.
I will check the Jar file I am using to make sure it is the most recent, I
am assuming the most recent is Lucene 1.3 RC1 ?

Thanks,

Rob

Rob,

Are you using the very latest Lucene code? The standard File.renameTo
operation fails every once in awhile, especially on Windows. I sent in a
patch that was put in somewhat recently. It fixed all the errors we were
seeing with renames.

Regards,
Matt
