Yeah it has been a bad week.  I don't think Query parser is not lowercasing
my fields, maybe it is something I am doing wrong:

 public synchronized String[] queryIndex(String query) throws
ParseException,
    IOException {

        checkForIndexChange();
        QueryParser p = new QueryParser("",
        new RepositoryIndexAnalyzer());
        this.query = p.parse(query);
        Hits hits = this.searcher.search(this.query);
        return buildReturnArray(hits);

    }

When I create Querypaser I do not want it to have default field since
clients can query on whatever field they want.  I use my Analyzer which I do
not think is lowercasing the fields because I have tested querying with all
lowercase (got results) with mixed case (no results) so I think my code or
my analyzer is hosed.

Thanks,

Rob

Yup... that's the root of all evil. :-)
(I'm in similar situation, going through user acceptance test as we speak...
and getting ready to do second version that'll have more advanced metadata
based search using Lucene).

If you don't need to tokenize a field, you don't need an analyzer either.
However, to get case insensitive search, you should lower-case field
contents
before adding them to document. QueryParser will do lower casing for search
terms automatically (if you are using it), so matching should work fine
then.
