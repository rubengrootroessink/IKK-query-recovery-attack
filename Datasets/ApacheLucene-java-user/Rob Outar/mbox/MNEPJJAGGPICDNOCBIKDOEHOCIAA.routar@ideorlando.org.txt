They look like the type of file name that would be created
when documents were added to the index.  So I still think
something is adding stuff to your index.  Could it be an
external process as someone suggested?  Does the index
grow even if you don't search?  In the code you posted,
what does checkForIndexChange() do?  Yes, I can guess what
it is supposed to do, but is it perhaps doing something else
as well or instead, directly or indirectly?
