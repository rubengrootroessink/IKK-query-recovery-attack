DATE: 8 May 2003

After experimenting, if I take out the quotes, it works?  It looks like when
I had in the quotes it was trying to match that text exactly instead of
wildcarding the last portion.  I read something Otis posted a LONG time ago
that said if you have quotes around the value it become a phrase query
instead of a prefix query or vice versa, don't remember exactly but anyhow
after I took out the quotes it seems to work.

Thanks,

Rob

What David is suggesting would at least allow you to figure out whether
the problem is with the QueryParser, or WildcardQuery itself, etc.

Look at unit tests for examples of WildcardQuery usage as well as
QueryParser usage.  Unit tests pass, which makes me think the error is
in your code.  You didn't mention the version of Lucene either.
