SUBJECT: User Base
DATE: 24 Oct 2002

All,

	I am trying to sell my lead on using this awesome search\indexing engine,
but he wants to know the user base for this product.  He wants to be assured
that if we choose this products that it will not go away, and that we will
have some form of support.  Worst case of course is we do have the source.
Anyhow if anyone can let me know what the user base is, or anything that
would lead to some assurance for him, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,

Rob
