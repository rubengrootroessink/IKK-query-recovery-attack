DATE: 8 May 2003

Clients are allowed to enter free form queries, that is why I use Query
Parser because I have no idea what they will be entering, it could be
wildcard or it could not be, for me to know if it is a wildcard query I
would have to parse the string, and if they have 'ANDS', OR's, etc.. it
become even more difficult.

Thanks,

Rob

Have you tried using the WildcardQuery() method instead of the QueryParser
as a test? I have an simple example of the WildcardQuery() is you need it.
