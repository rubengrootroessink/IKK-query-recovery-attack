DATE: 30 Oct 2002

Hello all,

	I did not know there were packages like ISOGEN that used Lucene to build a
searchable index based on XML files.  From visiting ISOGEN's website it
looks like it is a commercial software, are there any open source extensions
to Lucene that allow XML indexing and searching?

	Please let me know.

Thanks again,

Rob
