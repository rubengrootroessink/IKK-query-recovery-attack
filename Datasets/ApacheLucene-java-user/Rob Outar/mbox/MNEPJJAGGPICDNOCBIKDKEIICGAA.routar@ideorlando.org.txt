SUBJECT: write.lock file
DATE: 17 Dec 2002

Hello all,

	This is the first time I have encountered this in 3 months of testing, the
above file got created, not sure how or when, but every time I try to write
to the index I get an IOException about the indexing being locked.  It is
obviously due to that file but what would cause that lock to get created and
not removed?

	Let me know.

Thanks,

Rob
