SUBJECT: RE: Error when trying to match file path
DATE: 24 Oct 2002

I finally got it to work, but I do not understand the solution, instead of
storing the file path (F:\blah\blah\blah.xml), I stored the URL of file in
the field called path, I was then able to use a TermQuery(path, URL) to
retrieve that one document from the index.

Thanks,

Rob

The Analyzer is stripping your \ characters.  Query Parser doesn't do
that...
