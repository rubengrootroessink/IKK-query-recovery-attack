Thanks Otis, one other question the constructor's are kind of odd for the
QueryParser class:

Constructor Summary
QueryParser(CharStream stream)

QueryParser(QueryParserTokenManager tm)

QueryParser(String f, Analyzer a)
          Constructs a query parser.

I guess I can create one using:

QueryParser(String f, Analyzer a)

But when I call query(String query) will it form the Query object
disreguarding the argument I passed in the constructor?

Let me know.

Thanks,

Rob Outar

The QueryParser will handle input such as field1:value1 AND
field2:value2 OR field3:value3, and will construct the appropriate term
and boolean queries.

See Query Syntax page.
