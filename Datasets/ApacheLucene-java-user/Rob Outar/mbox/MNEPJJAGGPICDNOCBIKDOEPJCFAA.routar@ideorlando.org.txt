SUBJECT: A little date help
DATE: 20 Nov 2002

Hello all,

I am indexing the date using the java.io.file.lastModified() method

doc.add(new Field(MODIFIED_DT,
            DateField.timeToString(f.lastModified()), true, true, true));

I am trying to search on this field, but I am having a hard time formatting
the date correctly.  I am not sure what date format lastModified() uses so
trying to come up with a query in milliseconds for the above date field is
difficult.

Has anyone run into this problem?  Is there an easier way to do this?

Let me know,

Rob
