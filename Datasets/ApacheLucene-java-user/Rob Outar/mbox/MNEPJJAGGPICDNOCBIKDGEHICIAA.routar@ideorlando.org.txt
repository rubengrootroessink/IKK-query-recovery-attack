SUBJECT: Indexing Growth
DATE: 1 Apr 2003

Hi all,

	Will the index grow based on queries alone?  I build my index, then run
several queries against it and afterwards I check the size of the index and
in some cases it has grown quite a bit although I did not add anything???

Anyhow please let me know the cases when the index will grow.

Thanks,

Rob
