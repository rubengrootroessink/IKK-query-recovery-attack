I did not get any results from that query either, seems with the below that
text value string was tokenized. According to what I specified in the field
it should not have been tokenized.  I tried to use the example query:
author:"bob dobbs"

figuring that if you are searching for a set of strings that it had to be
quotes, but that did not work either....

Thanks,

Try searching for:
+releaseability:Test +releaseability:Releaseability
