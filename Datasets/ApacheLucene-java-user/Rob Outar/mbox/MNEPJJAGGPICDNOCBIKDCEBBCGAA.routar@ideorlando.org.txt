SUBJECT: Searches are not case insensitive
DATE: 25 Nov 2002

Hello all,

	I created the following analyzer so that clients could pose case
insensitive searches but queries are still case sensitive:

      // do not tokenize any field
        TokenStream t = new CharTokenizer(reader) {
            protected boolean isTokenChar(char c) {
                return true;
            }
        };
        //case insensitive search
        t = new LowerCaseFilter(t);

        return t;
    }

I use that index when I create a new instance of IndexWriter and when I use
QueryPaser, I am not sure why my searches are still case dependent.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Rob
