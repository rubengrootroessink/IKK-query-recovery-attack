I don't know if this helps but I had exact same problem, I then stored the
URI instead of the path, I was then able to search on the URI.

Thanks,

Rob

Subject: Slash Problem


I've got a Text field (tokenized, indexed, stored) called 'path' which
contains a string in the form of '1102\A3345-12RT.XML'.  When I submit a
query like "path:1102*" it works fine.  But, when I try to be more specific
(such as "path:1102\a*" or "path:1102*a*") it fails.  I've tried escaping
the slash ("path:1102\\a*") but that also fails.

I'm using the StandardAnalyzer and the default QueryParser.  Could anyone
suggest what's going wrong here?

Regards,

Terry
