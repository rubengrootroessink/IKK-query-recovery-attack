SUBJECT: RE: Error when trying to match file path
DATE: 24 Oct 2002

Some more information, with the following:

		this.query =
QueryParser.parse(file.getAbsolutePath(),"path",this.analyzer);
        System.out.println(this.query.toString("path"));
I got:
F:"onesaf dev block b pair dev unittestdatafiles tools unitcomposer.xml"

So it looks like the Query Parser is stripping out all the "\", and doing
something with the F:\, would anyone happen to know why this is happening?
Do I need to use a different query to get the infromation I need?

Thanks,

Rob

Hi all,

I am indexing the filepath with the below:

 Document doc = new Document();
        doc.add(Field.UnIndexed("path", f.getAbsolutePath()));

I then try to run the following after building the index:

 this.query =
QueryParser.parse(file.getAbsolutePath(),"path",this.analyzer);
        Hits hits = this.searcher.search(this.query);

It returns zero hits?!?

What am I doing wrong?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Rob
