SUBJECT: RE: Not getting any results from query
DATE: 15 Nov 2002

That is exactly what is happening, I was using the QueryParser class because
I wanted to do stuff like this:

field1 = value and field2 = value2 or field2 = value3

But from what you are telling me I cannot use the Query Parser class because
it tokenizes my queries?  Do I need to use a different analyzer?

The classes that extend Query I don't believe I can use because you cannot
specify and and or's for those queries.  The MultiTermQuery class I do not
believe I can specify and and or's for the various terms.

Thanks for all the answers, as always any help is appreciated,

Rob

Yes.
The field is indexed, but not tokenized. That means that the
value of the field will be indexed as given: "Test Releaseability".
To query this, you need to make sure that the queried value is
not tokenized either, ie. the query should not use an analyzer
for the field values.
The space in the field value conflicts with the query parser, ie.
you can't use a parsed query to query a value containing a space.

However, in case your query analyzer does not put values in lower case
this query should match:

releaseability:Test*

Lots of fun here: spaces, query analyzers, query parsers, upper/lower case,
and truncation.

You'll have to construct the query yourself in case you want to query with
the whole string "Test Releaseability".
