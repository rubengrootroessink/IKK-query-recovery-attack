Yeah it looks like I am going to have to handle it internally instead of
relying on IndexReader.lastModified(), oh well so much for
cross-platform-ism :-)

Oh, I see what you mean.  You are talking about the delta between the
original time stamp, and the time stamp that you expect after you add a
document.  I thought you were saying that it takes the F/S at least a
second to update the time stamp, after the file has been modified.

In that case, this is a file system issue that Lucene can't do much
about.
