Not cool at all, well a way around it is to have an boolean attribute called
index in the XML file that folks assign on elements that they wish to index.

If anyone else has a better solution let me know.

Thanks,

Rob

I had this problem when using xerces to parse xml documents. The problem I
think lies in the Java garbage collector. The way I solved it was to create
a shell script that invokes a java program for each xml file that adds it to
the index.

Hope this helps...
