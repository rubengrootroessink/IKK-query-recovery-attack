Hi all,

	I am intermittently getting the above exception while build an index.  I
have been trying for an house to reproduce it but can't as of yet.  But in
any case I was wondering if anyone knew anything about the above error and
if so how to stop it from occurring.  In the stack trace I printed out, it
looked like it was in the rename method of FSDirectory that the exception
occurred.  As soon as I can replicate I will post the exception and any
additional information requested.

Thanks as always,

Rob
