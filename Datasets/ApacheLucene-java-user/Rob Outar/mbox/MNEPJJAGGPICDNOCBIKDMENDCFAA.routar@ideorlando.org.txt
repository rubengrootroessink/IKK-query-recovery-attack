SUBJECT: Not getting any results from query
DATE: 14 Nov 2002

Hello all,

	I am storing the field in this fashion:

	          doc.add(new Field("releaseability", releaseability, true, true,
false));

	so it is indexed and stored but not tokenized.

	The value is "Test Releaseability";

	I am using the query releaseability:test releaseability

	I am not getting any results, is my query wrong?

Let me know.

Thanks,

Rob
