SUBJECT: Updating documents
DATE: 22 Nov 2002

I have something odd going on, I have code that updates documents in the
index so I have to delete it and then re add it.  When I re-add the document
I immediately do a search on the newly added field which fails.  However, if
I rerun the query a second time it works??  I have the Searcher class as an
attribute of my search class, does it not see the new changes?  Seems like
when it is reinitialized with the changed index it is then able to search on
the newly added field??

Let me know if anyone has encountered this.

Thanks,

Rob
