Is there a chance the index might be corrupted by any of the below
happening?

Your busy? It's the holidays we should we all be home or out Christmas

Thanks,

... an index opened for writing, but not closed successfully (process died,
threw a runtime exception, etc.)

you might want to check the log(s) for your indexing process and see what
failed.  in order to write, just delete the lockfile...

(sorry not so verbose - busy, busy :)
