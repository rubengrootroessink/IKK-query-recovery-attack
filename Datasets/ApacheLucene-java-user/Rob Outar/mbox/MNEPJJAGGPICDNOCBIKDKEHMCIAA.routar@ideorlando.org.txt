Just about everything calls getValue:

 public synchronized String getValue(String key, File file)
    throws ParseException,  IOException {

        Document doc = getDocument(file);
        return doc.get(key.toLowerCase());
    }

which calls get document:

 private synchronized Document getDocument(File file) throws
MalformedURLException,
    IOException {


        checkForIndexChange();
        Term t       = new Term(PATH,
file.toURI().toString().toLowerCase());
        TermQuery tQ = new TermQuery(t);

        Hits hits    = this.searcher.search(tQ);

        if (hits.length() == 1) {
            return hits.doc(0);
        }
        //this should never happen, cannot have a URL that returns 2 hits
        //that would mean the same file has been indexed twice
        else {
            return null;
        }


Thanks,

Rob

Sounds like you either have an indexer that's run amok (maybe
a background process that's continually re-indexing your sandbox -
or expanding outside your sandbox) or your Query code is doing more
than querying. It's not behaviour I've seen. Without a snippet of
Query code, it's going to be hard to help.
