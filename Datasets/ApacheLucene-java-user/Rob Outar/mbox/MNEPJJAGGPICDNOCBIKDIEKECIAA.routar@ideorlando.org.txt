SUBJECT: ava.io.FileNotFoundException: Too many open files
DATE: 8 Apr 2003

Hi all,

	I am running my unit tests in Linux and I am receiving:
		java.io.FileNotFoundException:
/local/build12/onesaf_dev_block_b/PAIR_dev/INDEX/_rk.f9 (Too many open
files)
    [junit] threadName :main

I had the sys admin bump up the number of file descriptors to 4096 but I
still got the same error.  Has anyone encountered this before?  I know it
has to be something weird I am doing.

Help!

Rob
