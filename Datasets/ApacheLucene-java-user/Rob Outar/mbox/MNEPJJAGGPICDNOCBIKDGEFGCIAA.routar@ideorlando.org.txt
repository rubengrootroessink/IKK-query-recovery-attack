Hi all,

	I am experiencing an odd problem where sometimes the write.lock files gets
left behind.  I have looked over all the my code and I close IndexWriter
after I use it.  I do a lot of batch processing where I write tons of files
to the index.  Has anyone run across this before?  Is IndexWriter the only
class that creates the write.lock file?  When is that write.lock file
deleted?

Let me know.

Thanks,

Rob
