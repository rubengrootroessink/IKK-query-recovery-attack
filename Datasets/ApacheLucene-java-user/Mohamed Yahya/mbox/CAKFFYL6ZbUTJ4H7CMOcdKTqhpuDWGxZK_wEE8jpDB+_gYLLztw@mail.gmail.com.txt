SUBJECT: Jaccard Similarity in Lucene
DATE: 14 Jul 2011

I need to calculate the similarity of a query and document in Lucene
using Jaccard similarity over n-grams. As Jaccard similarity is is a
very common measure in IR, I expected to find a Lucene implementation
for it, but I couldn't.

Is anyone aware of such an implementation?

Regards,
Mohamed
