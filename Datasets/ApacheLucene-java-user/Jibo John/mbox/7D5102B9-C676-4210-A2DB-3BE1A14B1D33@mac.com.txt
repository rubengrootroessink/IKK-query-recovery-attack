Hello,

I am in the process of  trying out the lucene patch LUCENE-1634,  
however I'm not getting the expected behavior.
I  see that the segments are not getting merged even after all the  
documents are deleted from it.

Because of this, the index size really grows to a huge number. The  
expected  index size is 50- 60 GB, however, it went past beyond 115 GB  
and is still growing.

Any pointers will be helpful.

Thanks,
-Jibo
