SUBJECT: ThreadedIndexWriter  vs. IndexWriter
DATE: 31 Jul 2009

While trying out a few tuning options using contrib/benchmak as  
described in LIA (2nd edition) book, I had an interesting observation.

If I use a ThreadedIndexWriter (picked the example from lia2e, page  
356) instead of IndexWriter, the index size got reduced by 40%  
compared to using IndexWriter.
Index related configuration were the same for both the tests in the  
alg file.

I am curious how come using a threaded index writer will have an  
impact on the index size.

Appreciate your input.

Thanks,
-Jibo
