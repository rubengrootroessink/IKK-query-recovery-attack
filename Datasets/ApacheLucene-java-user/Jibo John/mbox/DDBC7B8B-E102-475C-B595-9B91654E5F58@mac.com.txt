Mike,

I wasn't exactly using the lucene core jar from MEAP.

I have been building lucene from the source, and running the tests  
under lucene/java/trunk/contrib/benchmark/ (checked out 2 weeks ago, I  
guess)  and, also under  lucene/java/tags/lucene_2_4_1/contrib/ 
benchmark/.
In both cases, copied CreateThreadedIndexTask to  
org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks and ThreadedIndexWriter to  
org.apache.lucene.index.

I have observed the issue in both the versions of lucene.

Indexes were optimized separately using Lucli.


PFA the classes and the alg.
