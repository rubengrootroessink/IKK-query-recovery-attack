SUBJECT: Looking for crawler recommendations.
DATE: 1 Feb 2007

Has anyone integrated a crawler with lucene that they had success with?  I 
cannot use Nutch, since 60% of our searchable content is contained in a 
database.  I need to do a hybrid between database indexing and website 
crawling.  I would be just crawling one domain with a given set of 
directories.

I found this list of crawlers, but nothing that quite seems to fit my needs. 
One problem with a couple of the libraries that may work is that they use a 
GNU license.

Thanks.
