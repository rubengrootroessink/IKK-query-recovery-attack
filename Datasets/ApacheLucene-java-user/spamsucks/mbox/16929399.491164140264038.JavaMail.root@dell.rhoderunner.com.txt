SUBJECT: Federated search (lucene custom and nutch)?
DATE: 21 Nov 2006

Hi Everybody,

I am successfully using lucene to index/display results for a hugely 
successful tourism site...  We even for nearby's of attractions of different 
categories.  Love it.

The next step is to start indexing all the "legacy" content, which numbers 
around 3000 or so JSP's that will never be migrated to a database.  While I 
know I could use nutch to crawl my site, I don't want 2 different search 
engines for this site (custom lucene and nutch) , I need to present a single 
search interface and single set of results to the user.

Has anyone tried to inject the crawling of nutch or reuse pieces of nutch to 
augment the index of lucene?
Thanks.
