SUBJECT: Increase performance using Pool of IndexSearchers?
DATE: 7 Feb 2007

I currently am sharing my IndexSearcher across multiple requests as a static 
object.

While I understand that the IndexSearcher is threadsafe, this does not 
necessarily mean that it's multi-threaded capable.  I was wondering if there 
is any thread blocking going on between requests?

Would it improve performance to create a pool of IndexSearchers?

Thanks!
