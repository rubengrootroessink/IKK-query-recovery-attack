SUBJECT: Question regarding proximity search
DATE: 20 Sep 2007

Hi,
I have a doubt on proximity search.
Is the query "cat dog"~6 same as (cat dog)~6 ?
I think both case will search for "cat" and "dog" within 6 words each other.
But I am getting different number of results for the above queries. The
second one may be the higher. Please clarify this.

Thanks,
Sonu
