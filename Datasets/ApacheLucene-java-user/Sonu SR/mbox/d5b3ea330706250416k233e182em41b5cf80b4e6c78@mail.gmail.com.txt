SUBJECT: Index issue with unexpected termination of program without optimizing the index.
DATE: 25 Jun 2007

Hi,

I am using lucene in our site for index and search. We are creating the
index with large collection of documents (XML). The program some times
terminating without completing the index process. So the index optimization
and closing is not properly done. Is it to be optimized on the next index
time? Is there any issue with the existing indexed documents? Is there any
transaction management in lucene?

Thanks,
Sonu
