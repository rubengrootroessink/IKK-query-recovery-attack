SUBJECT: Question regarding proximity search
DATE: 1 Nov 2007

Hi,
I got confused of proximity search. I am getting different results for the
queries TTL:"test device"~2 and TTL:"device test"~2
I expect same result for the above two queries. Is there any importance of
position of terms in a proximity query?  Anybody please help me how lucene
exactly handles proximity query search. Is there any good documentation for
it?


Thanks,
Sonu
