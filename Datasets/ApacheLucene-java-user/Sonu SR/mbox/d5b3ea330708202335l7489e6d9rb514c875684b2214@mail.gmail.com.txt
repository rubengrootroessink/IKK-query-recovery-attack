SUBJECT: Problem In wild card search with NOT
DATE: 21 Aug 2007

Hi All,

I have problem when searching terms with wild card and NOT.
Simple Example is,
The query TITLE:(test1234 OR test567)  return two results,
the query  TITLE:(test1234 OR test567) AND NOT TITLE:(test1234)  return one
result as my expectation,
the query  TITLE:(test1234 OR test567) AND NOT TITLE:(test1234)  return one
result as my expectation,
But the query TITLE:(test1234 OR test567)  AND NOT TITLE:(test*)  returns
the two results (In normal i expect nothing will be returned).

But the Query works correctly when giving as TITLE:(test1234 OR test567) AND
NOT TITLE:(test1234 OR test567).  ie:- returns nothing


Is it a bug in lucene?

Thanks,
Sonu
