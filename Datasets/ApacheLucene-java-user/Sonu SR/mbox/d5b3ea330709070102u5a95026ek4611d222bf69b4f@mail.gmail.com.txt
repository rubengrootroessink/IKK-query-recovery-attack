SUBJECT: How to distinct phrase matches between lines
DATE: 7 Sep 2007

Hi,
Is there a way to distinct adjacent words between lines. I have problem
while searching a phrase. Since I am using stopword analyzer, the newlines
starting with stopwords are ignored in phrase search. So, such documents
comes as search result.

Please help me to solve this issue.

Thanks,
Sonu
