Hi all,

I know Lucene is a free project, however I think its use is under Apache Software License
(ASL) terms, so someone using Lucene should reference the project, use the logo 'powered by
Lucene', ...

I have suspects about a company releasing a commercial search engine based on Lucene and not
mentioning Lucene at all. What kind of actions can we take to protect Open Source projects
like Lucene of this kind of malicious use?

Thanks,
