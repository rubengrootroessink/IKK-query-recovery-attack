I'm new to lucene and have a question on how to create a query for the
following example... Say I have two fields, Title and Description, with the
following data

Item 1
Title: The greatest hits
Description : Collection of the best music from The Beatles.

Item 2
Title: U2 collections
Description : Greatest hits collection of U2


In my search, I want to search for 'greatest hits beatles'. The result
should return only Item 1..  how should the query looks like??


Thanks.
