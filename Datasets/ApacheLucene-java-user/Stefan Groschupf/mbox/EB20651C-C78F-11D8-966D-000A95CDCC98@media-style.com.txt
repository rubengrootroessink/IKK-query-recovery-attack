SUBJECT: term frequence in hits
DATE: 26 Jun 2004

Hi,
another question, but first many thanks for the last hint, the new term 
frequency functionality of lucene is just GREAT! ;)
I have index a set of documents with different meta data, Language = DE 
or Language = EN.
Now i wish to get Term frequencies for DE and EN. The easiest solution 
would be to  create one index for the DE and one index for En but that 
is very unhandy for the other things i wish to do with the corpus.
Alternativly i would do a query and iterate of the documents and count 
the terms by my self, but this is very slow.

Is there another way I may be didn't see to get  term frequencies for a 
defined set of documents?

Thanks for providing any light! ;)

Greetings,
Stefan
