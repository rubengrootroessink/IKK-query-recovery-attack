Hi there,

I wish to run an pre analyzer that help me to choice the right analyzer 
I wish to run on my stream.
For instance i wish to analyze the language of my text and choice then 
an language dependent stop word remover.
Since it is a token stream an my language detection need the whole text 
to identify the language, how to implement a pre Analyzer?

I wish to do something like a pipeline.

Thanks for any hints.

Stefan
