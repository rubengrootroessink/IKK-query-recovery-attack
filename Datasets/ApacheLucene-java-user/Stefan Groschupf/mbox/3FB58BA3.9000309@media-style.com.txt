I'm not sure understand you right. You wish to make language based 
queries to a IR system?
If I'm right may be I can help you!
Here is presentation by the MIT that does something similar.
http://mitworld.mit.edu/stream/155/
That is a video > 1h. But the first talk will contain the part is 
interesting for you.
Leslie Pack Kaelbling: MIT Professor, Electrical Engineering and 
Computer Science hold it.
(the sequence with the two guys with a phone is interesting for you).
They just have 2 components around the "nl ir query". It is speech to 
text and text to speech.

What you can do is use a pos tagger (i.e. a maximum entropy model based 
or  Brill tagger if you just have english) and use a data mining 
algorithm for weight your terms.
May be you can use a hidden Markov model for that.

You can build this on top of lucene, shouldn't be that difficult.

But may be I understand you wrong.. ..


Cheers
Stefan
