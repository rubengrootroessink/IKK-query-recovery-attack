SUBJECT: hit score in 1.3 vs 1.4
DATE: 11 Jun 2004

Hi,

I'm having a strange problem until upgrading lucene 1.3 to 1.4 rc4.
I'm using a third party component that include the old lucene 1.3 but i 
need to run the new 1.4 rc 4 in the same vm.
So i unpack the component jar, remove all lucene 1.3 classes and repack 
it again and just add the new lucene in the classpath.
So far everything running well, but the hits.score(i) method return for 
each hit 100 %. ;-o

Does someone has any idea where may be the problem can be?
Thanks for any hints,
Stefan
