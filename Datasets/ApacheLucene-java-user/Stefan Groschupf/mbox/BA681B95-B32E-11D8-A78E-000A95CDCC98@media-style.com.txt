Lucene can't help you.
Search for text classification or text clustering.

Browse the tools section @ www.text-mining.org there you will found may  
be tools that can help you with this task.
In general some key words for your further search:

Feature extraction from text.
Data mining algorithms for clustering or classification.
One Algorithm you may be will found useful is "Support Vector Machine".
