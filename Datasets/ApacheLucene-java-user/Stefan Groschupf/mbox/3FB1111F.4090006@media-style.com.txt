Hi,
>How is document clustering different/related to text categorization?

Clustering: try to find own categories and put documents that match in it. 
You group all documents with minimal distance together. 

Classification: you have already categories and samples for it, that help you to match other
documents. 
You calculate document distances to the existing categories and put it in the category with
smallest distance.

Cheers
Stefan
