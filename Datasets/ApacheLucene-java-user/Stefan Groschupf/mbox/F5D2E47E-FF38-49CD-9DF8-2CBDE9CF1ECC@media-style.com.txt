SUBJECT: Re: Is There Other Ports of Nutch?

No! Porting nutch in general makes no sense.
Since nutch is not a library as lucene but a complete ready to use  
application you can download and start.
There is a kind of  'webservice' (open search rss) to be able to  
integrate nutch search results in third party applications.

... and no from the performance point of view it is also senseless to  
port nutch :-)
