DATE: 11 Nov 2003

Hi Marc,

I'm working on it. Classification and Clustering as well.
I was planing doing it for nutch.org, but actually some guys there 
breakup some important basic work I already had done, so may be i will 
not contribute it there.
However it will be open source and I can notice you  if something useful 
is ready.
But it will take some weeks. I actually working on radical minimizing of 
feature selection

Cheers
Stefan
