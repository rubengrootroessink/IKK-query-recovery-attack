DATE: 4 Jul 2009

Then see my other mail about Java Serialization. It works (but not so fast),
but is the simpliest way to do it.

I do not use the serialized fields during searching, I store them only for
usage in some special maintenance tasks on the indexed documents. So it's
the same use-case.

For this use case serialization speed is enough.
