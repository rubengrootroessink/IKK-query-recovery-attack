This is he correct behavior for deprecating methods that are intended to be overridden by
users (in this case abstract ones - abstract in 2.4). The reason behind is:

If you have legacy 2.4 code that is not yet updated to use nextDoc(), but only overrided the
previously abstract next(), the backwards layer in the default implementation of DocIdSetIterator
calls next() for you, so the old code still works. If you have code that is already on 3.0
or 2.9 stage, you will override nextDoc() and next() is never used.

The nextDoc() -> next() is therefore only called, when you have an 2.4 legacy class.
