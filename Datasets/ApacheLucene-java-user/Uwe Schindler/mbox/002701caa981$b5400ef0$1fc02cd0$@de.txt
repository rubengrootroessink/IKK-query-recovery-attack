Hi Renaud,

In flex the correct way to add additional posting data to these classes would be the usage
of custom attributes, registered in the attributes() AttributeSource.

Due to some limitations, there is currently no working support in MultiReaders to have a "view"
on the underlying Enums, but we are working on that.

In general what you do (if it works in future):
Define an interface for your extensions based on the Attribute interface and also provide
the implementation class. Then call YourEnums.attributes().addAttribute(YourInterface.class)
in the ctor of your enum, store a local reference to the attribute and fill this on iteration.
Any consumer of this Enum can check using TermPositions.attributes().hasAttribute/getAttribute/addAttribute
for the existence of the the same and then read the attributes during iteration. There is
no need to change the Enum class API at all.

It works in the same way like the TokenStreams since 2.9/3.0.

Uwe
