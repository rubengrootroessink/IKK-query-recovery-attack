Or even faster: use a column stride field (not yet available), but as a
workaround (see Michael Busch's talk at ApacheCon:
https://www.box.net/file/273223052/encoded/26352752/9701662183cdd5f9c7ff68b9
e25a631c): Index a "dummy" term for each document, attach a payload
containing the value to it and then use TermPositions on this single term,
iterating over all documents and retrieve the payload.
