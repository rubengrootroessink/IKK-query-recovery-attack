SUBJECT: RE: Best way to use Lucene from perl
DATE: 9 Jul 2010

Have a look at Apache Solr - it implements a server that manages and queries
the index, supports schema configurations and makes the "API" accessible
RESTful. You have to run Lucene in a Servlet Container like Jetty or Tomcat,
but your application is written in any language that supports
REST/JSON/whatever. Bindings for some languages like PHP, Perl are
available.
