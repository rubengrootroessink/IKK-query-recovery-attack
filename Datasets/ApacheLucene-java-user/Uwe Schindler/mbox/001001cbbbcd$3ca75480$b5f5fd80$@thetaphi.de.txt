SUBJECT: RE: Preserving original HTML file offsets for highlighting
DATE: 24 Jan 2011

You can use HTMLStripCharFilter that is plugged into the chain before the
Tokenizer. This one strips all HTML but preserves the Token positions, so
you can later highlight using those positions.

This filter is currently only released through Apache Solr, but in Lucene
4.0 its part of the analysis module.
