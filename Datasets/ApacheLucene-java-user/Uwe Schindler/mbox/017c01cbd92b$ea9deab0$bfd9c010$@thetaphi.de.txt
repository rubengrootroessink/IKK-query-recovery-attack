Hi,

Lucene trunk aka 4.0 does not ship with any special analyzers in its core
JAR file anymore. In trunk you have to use the module analyzers-common for
this analyzer.

The problem with this module is, that the nightly build don't generate a ZIP
file out of it (this needs to be fixed for all the new modules). You have
two possibilities:
- Export source from SVN and build yourself
- Use the nightly Maven JARs instead (they include the modules as JARs):
