DATE: 21 Feb 2011

Hi David,

With current Lucene versions, the usage of ParallelReader is very
complicated to keep in sync. The problem is how merges occur. For
ParallelReader to work, all internal document ids (the integers) must be
parallel. As the new MergePolicies now work on size of documents and also
may work concurrent, it's almost impossible to have all merges also done in
parallel s internal doc ids keep the same, so ParallelReader, as it is, is
currently only working with carefully optimized indexes. Also it is not
really useable for your usecase at the moment.

There are approaches in Lucene trunk to support updateable fields (so called
parallel indexing), but this is not yet working. Please search in JIRA for
corresponding issues.
