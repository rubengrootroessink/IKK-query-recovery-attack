SUBJECT: RE: Question about FilterIndexReader and IndexSearcher
DATE: 26 Jun 2011

Hi,

usage of FilterIndexReader is not always as easy as it seems. There are
several problem, that can easy lead to the fact that you FilterIndexReader
implements all document filtering, but IndexSearcher does not respect it. I
have no idea what you are doing, but the following thing need to be done to
correcty filter documents:

- FilterIndexReader should implement isDeleted() methods & co (I assume you
did this)
- FilterIndexReader should filter postings returned: termPositions(...) and
termDocs(...) to exclude deleted documents
- return the correct numer for numDocs()

The biggest problem since Lucene 2.9 is one specific method that will
circumvent all you had done above:

getSequentialSubReaders() is used by IndexSearcher to directly pass the
searches to all atomic segments of a MultiReader/DirectoryReader structure.
As the subreaders returned by this method do not implement the above (they
are passed as is by the default impl), IndexSearcher will in fact only talk
to them and so ignore the above methods on the top-level reader

To do this correct do one of the following:
 
- easy: override getSequentialSubReaders() to return null, this will make
the filtered IndexReader itself atomic, so IndexSearcher will use it during
search. The backside: searches may get significantly slower
- override getSequentialSubReaders() and also wrap each subreader returned
by the delegate reader with your impl.

If you implement the last option (but also the return-null option) you may
also override reopen(), to correctly wrap reopened segments - you need to do
this if you use reopen.

If you are already using Lucene trunk (coming version 4.0), you can follow
the following issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3212
It will implement exactly the above once I have time to do it finally. I
will post a first patch soon. This version will not work with Lucene 3.x, as
it is lots of work to get all this running easily with Lucene 3.x
(especially the above termPositions, termDocs mehods). In Lucene 4.0 the
filtering of documents is much easier, you only have to override
getDeletedDocs() and numDocs(), everything else is automatically handled!

Hope that helps.
