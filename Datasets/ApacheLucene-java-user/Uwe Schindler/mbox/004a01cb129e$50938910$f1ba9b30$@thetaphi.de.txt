Hi Vinicius,

You should read the Package-Level Docs:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_2/api/all/org/apache/lucene/analysis/packa
ge-summary.html

To get the Token attributes, you have to add Attributes to your TokenStream
using addAttribute() and then you have easy access to the various attributes
of each token, when iterating with incrementToken().

If you want to program an own Tokenizer, start by inspecting a provided one
and do it similar. Also test cases for existing analyzers are a good way to
look into the usage. A good method to test TokenStream/Analyzers are in the
test-package's class BaseTokenStreamTestCase: assertTokenStreamContents(),
assertAnalyzesTo().

Also the Lucene In Action *2* book gives good examples.
