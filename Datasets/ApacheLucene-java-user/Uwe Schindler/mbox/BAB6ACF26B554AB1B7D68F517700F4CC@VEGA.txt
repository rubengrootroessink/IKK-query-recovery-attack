We can add a note to FSDirectory about that.

For IndexWriter/IndexReader this hint is no longer needed (in Lucene 2.9),
as all methods taking String/File instead of Directory are deprecated and
users should create directory instances and then will automatically get to
the place where the LockFactory can be supplied.
