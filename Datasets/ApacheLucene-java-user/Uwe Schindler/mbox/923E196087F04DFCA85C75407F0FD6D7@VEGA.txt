AddAttribute(Token.class) should throw an Exception, but it doesn't (it's a
bug in 3.0). addAttribute should only affect interfaces, it also accepts
Token, because the AttributeFactory accepts it - bang.

Sorry, but you can only pass attribute class literals to
addAttribute/getAttribute/hasAttribute and so on.

Sorry.
