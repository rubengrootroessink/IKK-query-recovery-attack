DATE: 14 Apr 2010

You can add the terms with Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED multiple times to the same field. If you
use an analyzer like WhitespaceAnalyzer and you analyze your tersm, you must also pass the
analyzed term through analyzer when building a TermQuery. This may explain, why you donâ€™t
get those IDs.

But for IDs in general, you should not use analyzers and add as NOT_ANYLYZED and query with
TermQuery. As explained before, just add more than one term to the same field.
