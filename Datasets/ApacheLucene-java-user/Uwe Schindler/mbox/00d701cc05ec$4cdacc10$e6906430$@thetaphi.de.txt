Hi Otis,

Can you reproduce this somehow and send test code? I could look into it. I
don't expect the error in the quicksort algorithm itself as this one is used
e.g. BytesRefHash / TermsHash, if there is a bug we would have seen it long
time ago.

I have not seen this before, but I suspect a problem in this very strange
comparator in MemoryIndex (which is very broken, if you look at its code -
it can compare Strings with Map.Entry and so on, brrrr), maybe the
comparator is not stable? In this case, quicksort can easily loop endless
and stack overflow. In Lucene 3.0 this used stock java sort (which is
mergesort), maybe replace the ArrayUtils.quickSort my ArrayUtils.mergeSort()
and see if problem is still there?

Uwe
