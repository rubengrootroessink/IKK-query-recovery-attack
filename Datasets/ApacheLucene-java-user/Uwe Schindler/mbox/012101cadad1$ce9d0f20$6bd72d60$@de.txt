SUBJECT: RE: WhitespaceAnalyzer and version
DATE: 13 Apr 2010

As of Lucene 3.0, WhitespaceAnalyzer has not yet a Version ctor. It will come in 3.1, when
Lucene is changed to be Unicode 4.0 conform (3.0 and before is Unicode 3.0, which is Java
1.4).

QueryParser need the Version ctor for the handling of stop words. As WhiteSpace Analyzer does
not use StopFilter, there was no need for a version ctor. QueryParser will pass the version
not to the analyzer, it will use it solely for its own behavior. But you should use the same
version for QP and your Analyzer. If one of the components has no Version, there is no incompatible
change (in fact, Whitespace Analyzer was not changed). Please also read the document about
moving from Java 1.4 to Java 5/6 in the Lucene ZIP file (if you already used Java 5/6 with
older Lucene versions before, all is fine - reindexing may only required if you move your
JVM installation from 1.4 -> 5/6; independent from Lucene's version).

Yes! And please, please: Don't use Version.LUCENE_CURRENT (which is already deprecated as
of Lucene 2.9.2 and 3.0.1 as a warning). Use a specific version, so you will never need to
reindex until you change the version.

To have backwards compatibility with existing indexes from pre-2.9 without reindexing use
LUCENE_24.
