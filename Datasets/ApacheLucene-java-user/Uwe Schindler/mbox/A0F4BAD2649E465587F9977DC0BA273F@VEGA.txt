Look here:

tml

As you see, the Solr analyzers are just standard Lucene analyzers. So you
can drop the solr core jar into your project and just use them :-)

Currently I am not sure which one is the analyzer Robert means, that can do
english stemming and detecting non-english parts, but there is to look for
it.
