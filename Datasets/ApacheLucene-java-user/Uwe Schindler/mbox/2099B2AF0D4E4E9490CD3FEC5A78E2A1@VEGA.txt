The size is in bytes and the RAMDirectory stores the bytes in bytes, so size
is equal. I would suggest to not copy the dir into a RAMdirectory. It is
better to use MMapDirectory in this case, as it "swaps" the files into
address space like a normal OS swap file. The OS kernel will automatically
swap needed parts into physical RAM. In this case the Java Heap is not
wasted and only needed parts are swapped into RAM.
