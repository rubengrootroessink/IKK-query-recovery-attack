If it is a 2.4 index, you can read it without any problems. It is only no
longer possible to add fields with Field.Store.COMPRESS. Nothing more
changed.

If you want to add field with some compression, you have to compress
yourself e.g. to a byte[]. You can then add this byte[] as a binary stored
field. How you deal with this is in your responsibility.
