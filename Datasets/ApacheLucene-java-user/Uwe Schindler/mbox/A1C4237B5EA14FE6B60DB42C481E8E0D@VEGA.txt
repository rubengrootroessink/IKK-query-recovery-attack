Use NumericRangeQuery from trunk lucene 2.9 by indexing longs from
Date.getTime(). This will help and offers you real numeric ranges very fast
and also the FieldCache only takes 8 bytes per doc (size of long).

Hopefully Lucene 2.9 will be released soon, but you can start to test it.

If you want to do sorting only (with Lucene 2.4), it is also good to simply
index the date as a plain text long number (using
Long.toString(Date.getTime())) and use SortField.LONG to sort (which does
the same). Only RangeQueries are not possible that way.
