I wanted to say the same, like Yonik... One addition, the FieldCache only
supports one value/doc and the second approach is slower, when deleted docs
are involved and 0 is inside the range (need to consult TermDocs).

By the way, the numbers are similar to mine from the FCRF issue and the
explaination for 0-inside-range:
