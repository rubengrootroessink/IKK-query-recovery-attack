SUBJECT: RE: comparing lucene scores across queries
DATE: 28 Mar 2011

No, scores are in general not comparable between different queries. The
problem lies in many things:
- Each query has a norm factor that makes it more compareable if they are
sub clauses of a BooleanQuery. But you are right, this norm factor should be
the same. 
- Some queries like FuzzyQuery rely on the terms in index and those matches
the query
- Inside Boolean queries, there is also a coord-factor involved

If you are always using the same simple type of query (e.g. simple
TermQuery, only with different term) on the same index, you can compare the
scores. As soon as you are using complex queries (e.g several terms compared
in a BooleanQuery as QueryParser produces), the scores are no longer
comparable.

You can read more on all factors that are included in scoring:
