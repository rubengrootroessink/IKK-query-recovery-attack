Hi Todd,

I am not sure if I understand your problem correctly. I am not familiar with Lucandra/Cassandra
at all, but if Lucandra implements the IndexWriter and IndexReader according to the documentation,
numeric queries should work. A NumericField internally creates a TokenStream and "analyzes"
the number to several Tokens, which are somehow "half binary" (they are terms containing of
characters in the full 0..127 range for optimal UTF8 compression with 3.x versions of Lucene).
The exact encoding can be looked at in the NumericUtils class + javadocs.

About your testcase: The test looks good, so does it fail? If yes, where is the problem? You
can also look into Lucene's test TestNumericRangeQuery64 for more examples. Or modify its
@BeforeClass to instead build a Lucandra index. 

The test has one thing, that is not intended to be done like that:
numeric = new NumericField("long", Integer.MAX_VALUE, Store.YES, true);

You are using MAX_VALUE as precision step, this would slowdown all queries to the speed of
old-style TermRangeQueries. It is always better to stick with the default of 4, which creates
64 bits / 4 precStep = 16 terms per value. Alternatively for longs, 6 is a good precision
step (see NumericRangeQuery documentation). MAX_VALUE is only intended for fields that do
not do numeric ranges but e.g. sort only. precisionStep is a performance tuning parameter,
it has nothing to do with better/worse precision on terms or different query results. If you
are using NumericRangeQuery with this large precStep, you are not using the numeric features
at all, so your test should not behave different from a conventional TermRangeQuery with padded
terms.
