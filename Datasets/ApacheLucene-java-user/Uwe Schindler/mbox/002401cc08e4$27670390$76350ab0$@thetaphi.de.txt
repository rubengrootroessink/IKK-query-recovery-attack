SUBJECT: RE: MultiPhraseQuery slowing down over time in Lucene 3.1
DATE: 2 May 2011

Can you checkout latest 3.1 branch @
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/branches/lucene_solr_3_1

And test if it solves your issue. There was aproblem in PhraseQuery's
internal sorting and quicksort. It does not slowdown over time, but with
type of query (how many terms the phrase contains). Maybe you sort your
queries according number of terms and so you get a slowdown.

See issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3054
