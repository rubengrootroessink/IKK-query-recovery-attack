Hi,

> Document d = searcher.getIndexReader.document(doc + docBase)

This is of course working, but somehow useless as it transforms the ID two
times and that slows down a little bit. Inside collectors you should *only*
use the IndexReader and Scorer given by the setNextReader / setScorer calls.

> Document d = reader.document(doc)

This is the correct way to do it.
