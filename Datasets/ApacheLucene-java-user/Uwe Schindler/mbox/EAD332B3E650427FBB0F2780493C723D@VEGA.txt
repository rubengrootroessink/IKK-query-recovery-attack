Hi Dhivya,

you can iterate all terms in the index using a TermEnum, that can be
retrieved using IndexReader.terms(Term startTerm).

If you are interested in all terms from a specific field, position the
TermEnum on the first possible term in this field ("") and iterate until the
field name changes. As terms in the TermEnum are first ordered by field name
then by term text (in UTF-16 order), the loop would look like this:

IndexReader reader = ...
String field = ....
Field = field.intern(); // important for the while loop
TermEnum tenum = reader.terms(new Term(field,""));
try {
	do {
		final Term term = tenum.term();
		if (term==null || term.field()!=field) break;
		final String termText = term.text();
		// do something with the termText
	} while (tenum.next());
} finally {
	tenum.close();
}
