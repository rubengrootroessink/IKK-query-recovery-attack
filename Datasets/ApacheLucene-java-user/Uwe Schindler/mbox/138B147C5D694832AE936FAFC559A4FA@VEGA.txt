SUBJECT: RE: Disk full while optimizing an index
DATE: 30 Nov 2009

Hi siraj,

There is now way to find out the free space on a partition using Java 5
(Lucene 3.0) or Java 1.4 (Lucene 2.9) without any native JNI calls. So
Lucene cannot calculate it before optimizing.

With Java 6 it would be possible, but Lucene 3.0 is only allowed to use Java
5: File#getUsableSpace()
A workaround would be to only check it conditionally using reflection on
File.class.
