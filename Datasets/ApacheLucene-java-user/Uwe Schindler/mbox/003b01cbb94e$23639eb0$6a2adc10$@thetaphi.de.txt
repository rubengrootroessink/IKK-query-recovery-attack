Hi,

> "If you’re changing analyzers, you should rebuild your index using the
new analyzer so that all documents are analyzed in the same manner."

It says everything: Take your original data and re-create the index.
Indexing is a lossy operation, so you must recreate the index using *all*
the original data like it was done the last 2 years. Just use another
analyzer.
