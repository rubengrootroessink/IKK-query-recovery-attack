SUBJECT: RE: TermQuery - ExactMatching, Lucene 3.1.0 vs. 3.3.0, special character behavior
DATE: 18 Jul 2011

Hi Thomas,

Just one question: Are these docIds from Lucene or your own ones? And second, are the underlying
indexes also built with the corresponding Lucene versions?

The reason behind: Nothing in Lucene guarantees the order of docIds for same scores, they
can be arbitrary. One change in Lucene 3.3 is for example the use of TieredMergePolicy, that
reorders documents during indexing for more efficient merging. So when you indexed also with
Lucene 3.3 and the displayed document IDs are your own application specific ones (not the
internal Lucene ones), the different order of search results can simply be caused by the fact,
that the indexer in 3.3 can suddenly reorder the documents during merging (TieredMergePolicy).
There is nothing wrong with that.

Uwe
