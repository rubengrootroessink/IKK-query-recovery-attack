SUBJECT: RE: RangeFilter performance problem using MultiReader
DATE: 10 Apr 2009

You got a lot of answers and questions about your index structure. Now
another idea, maybe this helps you to speed up your RangeFilter:

What type of range do you want to query? From your index statistics, it
looks like a numeric/date field from which you filter very large ranges. If
the values are very fine-grained and so you hit a lot of terms for the
range, you might consider using TrieRangeFilter, which is a new contrib
module in the yet unreleased Lucene 2.9:
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc/all/org/apach
e/lucene/search/trie/package-summary.html

The name and API may change before release (if it moves to core), but you
can try it out, it is working stable and currently runs in productive
websites! It works for int, long, double, float and Date values (if encoded
using Date.getTime() as long).
