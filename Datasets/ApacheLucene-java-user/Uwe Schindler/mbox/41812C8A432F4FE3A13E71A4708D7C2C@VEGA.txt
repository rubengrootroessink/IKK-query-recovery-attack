SUBJECT: RE: Using the new tokenizer API from a jar file
DATE: 27 Dec 2009

Where did you place the jar file inside Solr on which servlet container? I
suspect some strange classloader problems. As the attributes are loaded by
lucene, the impl should be available from classes inside lucene-core.jar
file and placed in the same classpath of the lucene-core.jar classloader.
