You have to implement it yourself. Lucene 3.3 will provide some additions to
IndexSearcher to merge TopDocs results from different searchers, but
collecting those results and transferring over the network is your task. Or
simply use Solr (which is an implementation, to exactly do that). This new
API does not have the problems MultiSearcher had as it uses no global IDF
and does not try to make scores compatible between searchers to merge. These
algorithms caused major bugs.

The new interface is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3191
