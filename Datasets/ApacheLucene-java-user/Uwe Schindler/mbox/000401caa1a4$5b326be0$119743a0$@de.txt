SUBJECT: RE: MMapDirectory need twice more virtual memory than actually need?
DATE: 30 Jan 2010

I am sorry, we know nothing about how the JVM internally handles this. But we do not force
it to map into memory! MMapDirectory just maps but does not call MappedByteBuffer.load().
So it is completely handled by the kernel when something is swapped in or not.

I have a server with 32 GB RAM that mapps about 100 GB files using JAVA's MappedByteBuffer
into its address space and it still runs :-) (Solaris 64 bit, Java 5, no unmap hack).
