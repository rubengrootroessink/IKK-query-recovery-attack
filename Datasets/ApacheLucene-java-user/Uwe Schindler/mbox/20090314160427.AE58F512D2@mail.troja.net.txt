Hello Niels,

You cannot use the trie package with current lucene stable. To compile, you must also apply
LUCENE-1478 to the core. Another option is to checkout trie and remove the SortField and static
FieldCache parsers from TrieUtils. I am the developer of trie and I use it with trunk lucene
on www.pangaea.de.

This looks very promising.

As far as I understand this is only available from the unreleased 
development version, right? How safe is this version for use?

Is it possible to use only the org.apache.lucene.search.trie package 
from there together with the old and stable Lucene?

Best
