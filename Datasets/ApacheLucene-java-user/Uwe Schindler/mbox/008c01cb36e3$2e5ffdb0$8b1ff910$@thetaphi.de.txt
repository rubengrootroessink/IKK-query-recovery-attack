Hi Yakob,

In this mailing list are all the people who wrote this book, making such a
suggestion is not a good idea, especially if you need help in future. You
cannot get everything for free. If you look through the internet (e.g.
twitter, blogs of authors) you may find Coupon Codes / Promotional Codes
(e.g. 25% less). Be sure to buy the second edition, my first link was
incorrect: http://www.manning.com/hatcher3
