SUBJECT: [ANNOUNCE] Release of Lucene Java versions 3.0.3 and 2.9.4
DATE: 3 Dec 2010

Hello Lucene users,

On behalf of the Lucene development community I would like to announce the
release of Lucene Java versions 3.0.3 and 2.9.4:

Both releases fix bugs in the previous versions:
- 2.9.4 is a bugfix release for the Lucene Java 2.x series, based on Java
1.4.
- 3.0.3 has the same bug fix level but is for the Lucene Java 3.x series,
based on Java 5.

New users of Lucene are advised to use version 3.0.3 for new developments,
because it has a clean, type-safe API.

This release contains numerous bug fixes and improvements since 2.9.3 /
3.0.2, including a memory leak in IndexWriter exacerbated by frequent
commits, a file handle leak in IndexWriter when near-real-time readers are
opened with compound file format enabled, a rare index corruption case on
disk full, NumericRangeQuery / NumericRangeFilter sometimes returning
incorrect results with bounds near Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE, and
various thread safety issues. Lucene 2.9.4 can now also read indexes created
by 3.0.x.

Both releases are fully compatible with the corresponding previous versions.
We strongly recommend upgrading to 2.9.4 if you are using 2.9.x; and to
3.0.3 if you are using 3.0.x.
