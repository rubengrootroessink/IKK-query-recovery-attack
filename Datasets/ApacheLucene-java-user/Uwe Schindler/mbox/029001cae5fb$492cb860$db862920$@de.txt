SUBJECT: RE: Range Score in Lucene
DATE: 27 Apr 2010

The score is an arbitrary number > 0. It's not normalized to anything, it should only be
used to e.g. sort the results. You cannot even compare scores between two searches. They should
only be used to compare hits *within* one result set (e.g. sort as done in top docs).
