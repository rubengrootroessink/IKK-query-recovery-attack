SUBJECT: RE: Filter.getDocIdSet() returning null, and what this means for 	CachingWrapperFilter
DATE: 26 May 2010

Can you open an issue, null should be handled like an empty DocIdSet? This seems to be a bug
in CachingWrapperFilter.

To go around this, donâ€™t return null, and instead return the constant DocIdSet.EMPTY_DOCIDSET.
This is the preferable solution and maybe we will change this in Lucene 4.0, to not allow
null as return value.
