There are two problems:
- You can go back to your old code and you don't need to move to
NumericField at all. As noted before: The *replacement* for RangeQuery and
ConstantScoreRangeQuery is TermRangeQuery. NumericRangeQuery is a new API
and is totally different. If you use it, you have to get rid of old code and
old way of use patterns - sorry :-)
- 3.0 breaks backwards, so you cannot use any legacy-APIs anymore
