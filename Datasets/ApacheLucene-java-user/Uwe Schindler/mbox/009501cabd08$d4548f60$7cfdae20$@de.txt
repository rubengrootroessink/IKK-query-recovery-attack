What problems are you experiencing? For min/max==null, the inclusive flags make no difference.
Can you provide a testcase? The code in NumericRangeQuery.NumericRangeTermEnum.<init>
(which is used for the filter, too) is keeping the lowest/biggest value for null values.

That is indeed wrong :-) I'll fix for 3.1.
