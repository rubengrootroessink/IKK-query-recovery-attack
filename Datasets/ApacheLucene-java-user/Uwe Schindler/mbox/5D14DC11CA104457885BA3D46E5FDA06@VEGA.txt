SUBJECT: RE: Storing a Lucene Index on a SAN Storage: good idea?
DATE: 26 Sep 2009

If it's only 200,000 documents, I think the index will not be very big (a
few Gigabytes), especially, if the documents indexed are 150 kiB raw size
documents like PDFs or DOCs that have much binary overhead not indexed. Most
times the number of distinct terms is low. Index size is most times a lot
smaller than the original documents. If you also store the original doc
contents in the index, it get's bigger, but the time to access the same like
if they are normal files on the SAN.

This config would also run on my laptop :-) I think, the index will
completely be in memory after some time and so there is no difference
between SAN/local HDDs.
