Hi,

You can use the artifact from Hudson as Mike told, but the JAR file is not
compatible with Lucene 2.4 (because a new SortField constructor for sorting
against trie encoded fields and the new Superinterface FieldCache.Parser
leading to ClassNotFoundEx). If you want to use TrieRangeQuery/Filter, you
must also update Lucene to the trunk version (so best is to download the
whole snapshot build).

Keep me informed how it works for you! How many documents do you plan to
index using TrieUtils? The performance impact is immense for large indexes
(see my notes).
