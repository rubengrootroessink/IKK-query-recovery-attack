Exactly. Because of that NumberTools is deprecated as a warning, not to use
it for *new* developments. The numeric values are stored completely
different and can only be queried using NumericRangeQuery.

These deprecations needed for index compatibility are *not* removed in 3.0
(they are targeted for 4.0, when indexes < 3.0 cannot be read anymore). So
for performance reasons (if you do range queries on your numeric fields),
you should reindex.

Yes it is maintained, but you should get rid of deprecated APIs. And for the
numeric case, you cannot mix old/new API on the same field. Switch to the
new API in complete (reindex) or let it as it is.
