Fieldcache only support documents with one value per doc! So you are adding a multivalued field,
which is not supported!

> Hello all

> At startup, our apps look for the min and max value of some configured fields,

> 
> One of these apps has a field whose min value is stored/indexed while all other

> When looking for the min/max, StringIndexCache complains
