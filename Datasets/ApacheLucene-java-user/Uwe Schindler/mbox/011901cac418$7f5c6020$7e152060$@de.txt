I think you forgot to commit your changes in IndexWriter or have not closed it before creating
Searcher/IndexReader. So on the second run, the index is seen, because of the previous run,
which was committed on jvm exit.

If you are using NearRealtimeSearch (IndexWriter#getIndexReader), please tell as its different
here.
