Hits did exactly what you described before. It got as many results as needed
to show the nth page. To when showing the page for results 20 to 30, it
fetches at least 30 results.

In general Full Text Search engines are only scoring the top results. This
is e.g. one reason why Google limits the maximum page you can go to.

It supports it like 2.9, but not using the Hits API. As described above, to
show results 991 to 1000 request the top-1000 results and display the last
10 :-)
