This is not covered by the TermEnum and cannot be retrieved easily. If you
really need such functionality, you can e.g. use payloads. So index the
religion as a term and attach the dates as a binary payload. Then you can
enumerate over all religions like mentioned before, but filter the terms
using the TermPositions access methods. It may also be possible the other
way round (index dates and attach religion as payload).
