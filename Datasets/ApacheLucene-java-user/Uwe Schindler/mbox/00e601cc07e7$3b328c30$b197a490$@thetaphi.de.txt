SUBJECT: RE: Link to nightly build test reports on main Lucene site needs updating
DATE: 1 May 2011

I fixed the nightly docs, once the webserver mirrors them from SVN they should appear. The
developer-resources page was completely broken. It now also contains references to the stable
3.x branch as most users would prefer that one to fix latest bugs but donâ€™t want to have
a backwards-incompatible version.
