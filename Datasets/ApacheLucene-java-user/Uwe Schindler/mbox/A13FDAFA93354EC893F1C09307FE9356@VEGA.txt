SUBJECT: RE: RangeFilter performance problem using MultiReader
DATE: 11 Apr 2009

In addition to merging each month into one index instead of all in one
index, you could also do some additional optimization when using the Range
filter:
Just combine only those indexes needed to fulfil the range spec during
search. So if somebody want to filter Jan 15 to Feb 15, only create a
MultiReader of the indexes for Jan and Feb, this would speed up the whole
search (also for terms), as the filter would simply remove all documents
from the wrong months.

But the best would be to use TrieRange :)
