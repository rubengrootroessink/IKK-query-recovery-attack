Also in 2.9.2 and 3.0.1:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_2/api/all/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexRea
der.html#getUniqueTermCount()
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_1/api/all/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexRea
der.html#getUniqueTermCount()

Please note, this works only with SegmentReaders, so you have to first get
the getSequentialSubReaders() and you *may* sum up the number on them. But
this would not give the correct number, as segments may have (or in most
cases they have lots of) overlapping terms. For an optimized index
getSequentialSubReaders() returns one index and its unique term count is
correct.
