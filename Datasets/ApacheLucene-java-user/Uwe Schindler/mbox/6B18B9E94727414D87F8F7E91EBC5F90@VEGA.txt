SUBJECT: RE: Using the new tokenizer API from a jar file
DATE: 28 Dec 2009

I opened https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2182 about this
problem and already have a fix.

This is really a bug. The solution is simple because you have to load the
IMPL class using the same classloader as the passed in interface. The
default for Class.forName is the classloader of AttributeSource.class, which
is the wrong one.
