SUBJECT: RE: How do you Parse a query to convert numbers to strings
DATE: 29 Jul 2009

If you use Lucene 2.9 (you mentioned this), you can now use
NumericRangeQuery and NumericField for fast range queries. The only problem
is, that QueryParser does not support it (because we have no schema support
and so query parser has no idea which type the field is -- but the new one
maybe coming in contrib can be configured to do it for specific field
names). The queries are very fast, you must build them creating Query
instances via hand. But in most cases, for numeric queries, the user gets
separate input fields (like the Latitude/Longitude/date bounding box input
lines on http://www.pangaea.de/advanced/advsearch.php) and you can then
create a BooleanQuery, add the numeric contraints to it and also add a
parsed query.
