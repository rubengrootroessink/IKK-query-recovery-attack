DATE: 23 May 2010

Just look at the source code of PorterStemFilter.java and its corresponding
Analyzer in Lucene Java. Simply copy the code and replace the calls to stem
a String by the ones from this class. Depending on if your code
takes/returns String or char[], you have to modify the code a little bit
according to TermAttribute's Javadocs.
