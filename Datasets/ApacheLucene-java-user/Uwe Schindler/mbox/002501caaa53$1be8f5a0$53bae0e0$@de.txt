All of them, only rewrites are currently done on the top-level reader. IndexSearcher since
2.9 creates Scorers in separate for each segment and merges the results in its collector.
Because of that we have a modified Collector interface that has setNextReader() methods and
so on.

So you can assume that every Scorer uses a SegmentReader, but legacy code may behave different
(like if somebody instantiates a TermScorer and passes the top level reader to it). Also Solr
is not yet completely free of global readers (as far as I know).
