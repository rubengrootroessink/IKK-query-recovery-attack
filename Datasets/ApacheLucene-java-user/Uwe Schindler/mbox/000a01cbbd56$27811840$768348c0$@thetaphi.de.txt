Hi,

I don't know Mockito, but the javadocs explains everything:

http://docs.mockito.googlecode.com/hg/org/mockito/Mockito.html#spy(T)

IndexWriter is very sensitive to locking, so when the mocked implementation
does not lock on the real IndexWriter itself but instead on itself (because
the mock is synchronized on itself) you would violate this asserting. I also
expect that later (when assertions are disabled), your whole IndexWriter
will deadlock.

Why do you want to intercept calls to IW? The warning in the javadocs says
everything: " Partial mock usually means that the complexity has been moved
to a different method on the same object.
 In most cases, this is not the way you want to design your application.
However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy:  dealing with
code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of
legacy code etc.). However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new,
test-driven & well-designed code."

Does any of this apply to Lucene? It's open source, so you can look into
source code and even change it!

Uwe
