And we should also add the changes to the new CharStream/CharFilters
wrappers around java.io.Reader and the related offset correction to the list
for RC4. This were also some API changes, so anybody started to use
CharFilters or own Tokenizers have to change to use
Tokenizer.correctOffset(). But we fixed bugs in Solr (Highlighting) and
backwards compatibility with it.
