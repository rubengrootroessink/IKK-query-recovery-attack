SUBJECT: RE: NumericField indexing performance
DATE: 14 Apr 2010

Hi Tomislav,

indexing with NumericField takes longer (at least for the default precision step of 4, which
means out of 32 bit integers make 8 subterms with each 4 bits of the value). So you produce
8 times more terms during indexing that must be handled by the indexer. If you have lots of
documents, with distinct values the term index gets larger and larger, but search performance
increases dramatically (for NumericRangeQueries). So if you index *only* numeric fields and
nothing else, a 8 times slower indexing can be true. 

If you are not using NumericRangeQuery or you want tune indexing performance, try larger precision
Steps like 6 or 8. If you donâ€™t use NumericRangeQuery and only want to index the numeric
terms as *one* term, use precStep=Integer.MAX_VALUE. Also check your memory requirements,
as the indexer may need more memory and GC costs too much. Also the index size will increase,
so lots of more I/O is done. Without more details I cannot say anything about your configuration.
So please tell us, how many documents, how many fields and how many numeric fields in which
configuration do you use?

Uwe
