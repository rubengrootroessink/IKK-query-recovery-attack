Hi,

I just have a suggestion to your first idea of enumerating terms, which is
very fast if done right:

Much easier is to use IR.terms() but wrap a PrefixTermEnum around it (it's
in search package). Then you simply iterate (please don't forget that the
enum is already positioned on the first term!!! If no such term exists, the
enum's term() returns null). Just use a "if (enum.term() != null) do { }
while (enum.next()!=null && numberOfTermCollectex <= max)", with Lucene
trunk this is much better now, but with 3.x, you have to use this ugly
iteration.

Uwe
