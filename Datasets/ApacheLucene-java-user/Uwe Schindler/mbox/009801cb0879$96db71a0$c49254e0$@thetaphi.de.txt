You should use NumericField with precisionStep MAX_VALUE as field you sort
against (represent the date as an integer/long like got from
Date.getTime()). This costs much less memory, as its not sorted as strings,
but with native data types, so the FieldCache needs much less space. If you
also want to do RangeQueries on a numeric Range, use the default
precisionStep.

More information is the JavaDocs of NumericRangeQuery and NumericField.
