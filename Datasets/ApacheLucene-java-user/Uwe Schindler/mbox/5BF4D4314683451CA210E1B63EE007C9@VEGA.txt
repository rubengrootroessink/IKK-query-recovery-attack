SUBJECT: RE: Posting unicode data to lucene not working during searching/retreival!
DATE: 21 May 2009

Indexed data is coming out in the same way as put in. Lucene works with Java
Strings, so encoding is irrelevant. When you index your values, you must be
sure, to construct your index string/char arrays correctly using the UTF-8
encoding (e.g. by using a standard Java Reader, new String byte[], charset)
and so on. When you then print stored fields you must do the same in the
other direction. So the general rule: Always specify the correct charset
when converting to/from strings to bytes.
For searching: It roughly also depends also on the Analyzer used during
indexing and searching. Often analyzers written for specific languages
cannot correctly handle characters from foreign languages. But e.g.
StandardAnalyzer or WhitespaceAnalyzer does not modify the tokens in any way
(if making them lowercase is not a problem).
