Hi Wulf,

You should consider decompounding! There are filters based on dictionaries
that support decompounding german words. Its a TokenFilter to be put into
your analysis chain.
There is a simple Lucene-Rule: Whenever you need wildcards think about your
analysis, you probably did something wrong :-) Add stemming, decompounding,
synonyms,...
