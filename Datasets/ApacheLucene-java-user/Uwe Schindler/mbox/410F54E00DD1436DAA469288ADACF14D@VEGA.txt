The default API searcher.search works like this now. If you want to control,
the retrieval of scores, create a TopFieldCollector directly:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_0/api/all/org/apache/lucene/search/TopFiel
dCollector.html

The static create methods has many possibilities to control the behaviour of
the resulting Collector. Pass this collector to the corresponding search
engine. The topDocs() method returns the resulting TopDocs instance (its in
the superclass TopDocsCollector!!!). Some hints: mostly scoreDocsInOrder can
be false, if you need the maxScore set it true, you want to have scores, so
set also to true. Mosly you will not need the sorted field values (false).
