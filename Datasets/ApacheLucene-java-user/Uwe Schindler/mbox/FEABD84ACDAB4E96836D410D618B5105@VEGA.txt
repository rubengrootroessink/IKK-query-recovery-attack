Two possibilities:
a) instantiate the FSDirectory subclass yourself (e.g. MMapDirectory,
SimpleFSDirectory of NIOFSDirectory)
b) use FSDirectory.open() which chooses automatically depending on operating
system.

Read the Javadocs there is a hint how to fix. 

RangeFilter is now TermRangeFilter (if it should work on terms) or
NumericRangeFilter (if it should work on the new NumericField fields,
reindexing required!)

QueryFilter is replaced by QueryWrapperFilter and additionally a
CachingWrapperFilter.

Only the enumeration one is deprecated. Use the one returning a
List<Fieldable> getFields() and request an iterator().

This is also in the Javadocs.

All your questions are answered in the Javadocs, just open them and read!
