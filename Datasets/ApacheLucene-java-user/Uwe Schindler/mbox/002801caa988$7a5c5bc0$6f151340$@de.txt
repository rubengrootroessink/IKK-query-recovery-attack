Exactly, MultiEnums have their own attributes at the moment, there is no "Proxy" view on it.
For this to work, proxy AttributeImpls are needed and there is no support at the moment.

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2154

The problem behind is that when a consumer gets/adds an Attribute, all subreaders  must use
the same attribute or the MultiReader/DirectoryReader must proxy the attributes. For this
to work we need dynamic proxies or you also have to implement ProxyImpls: Attribute, AttributeImpl,
AttributeProxyImpl.

We have no progress for that at the moment, so I am sorry, we have no working support for
attributes in MultiReaders (which all DirectoryReaders are, because a index could consist
of more than one segment).

See above.

But attributes are the way to go for this extended posting/prox lists.
