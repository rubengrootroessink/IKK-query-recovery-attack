SUBJECT: RE: Help needed figuring out reason for maxClauseCount is set to 1024 error
DATE: 8 Oct 2009

I would propose to use NumericRangeQuery and NumericField supplied by Lucene
2.9. This has no such limitations. You can index your dates as numeric value
(e.g. Date.getTime()) and query downto the milliseconds.
