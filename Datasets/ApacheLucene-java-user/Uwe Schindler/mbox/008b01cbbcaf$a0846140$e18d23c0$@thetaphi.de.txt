You have to also pass the classpath to java runtime, not only to javac.

If you get this problem within Eclipse, have you tried to cleanup the
project, maybe not all files are compiled?

Are you also compiling Lucene from source? If yes, make sure that all Lucene
classes are compiled (see cleanup above, uncheck any options to compile only
used classes). Lucene uses reflection to load some additional classes not
referenced in the .java files directly (dynamic loading), so missing ones
would not be seen by javac? Also it may be the case that inside Eclipse you
are using the veeeeery old Eclipse-shipped lucene-core.jar that interferes
with your program.
