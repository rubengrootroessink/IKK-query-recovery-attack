DATE: 10 Jun 2009

This code snipplet would only work, if you want to iterate over e.g. the
first 20 documents (which is n in your code). If he wants to iterate over
all results, he should think about using a custom (Hit)Collector.

The code below will be very slow for large result sets (because retrieving
stored fields is not effective for a large number of documents, look into
the warning about the "inner search loop" in Wiki). To just retrieve e.g. a
Filename, it may really be better to use a FieldCache on the "FILE" field
and inside the HitCollector, use the doc number to get the filename from the
cache. I think the speed improve will be >>10 times as fast!
