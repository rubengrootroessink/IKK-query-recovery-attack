Hi Ivan,

We had this discussion some time ago on this list, too. I explained another
guy a possibility for TopDocs caching. Just search in the list archives!

> 2. User opens page 2 - we load as many results as the amount for page 1

> ...
> N. User opens page n - we load as many docs as the amount of all pages

> N-2 times etc).

> With Hits class this loading of documents of previous pages was avoided
