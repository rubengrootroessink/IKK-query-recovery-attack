Hi Yonik,

Can we do the same for Lucene, the problem is combining the rewritten
queries using the broken method in Query?

As far as I know, the problem is that e.g. MTQs rewrite *per searcher* so
each searcher uses a different rewritten query (with different terms). So
the scores are totally different even with a tf-idf patch (Fuzzy scores on
MultiSearcher and Solr are totally wrong because each shard uses another
rewritten query). To work around that, the Query class has a broken, broken,
broken, broken, broken method to combine queries, which violates DeMorgans
laws when there are e.g. negative clauses. And this method cannot be fixed
to work with all queries
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2756).
