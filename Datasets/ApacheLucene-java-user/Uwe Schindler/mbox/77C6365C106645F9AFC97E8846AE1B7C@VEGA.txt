SUBJECT: RE: Question wrt Lucene analyzer for different language
DATE: 14 May 2009

There are two problems:

a) Currently there is no such analyzer (I have the problem, too, I would
also like to autodetect the language from a text like M$ Word does and
switch the analyzers).
b) If such an autodetect analyzer exists, you will have a problem on the
searching side, because you should almost always use the same anylyzer on
the indexing and search side. The problem is that search queries are
normally very short and autodetection is hardly possible. If somebody now
enters something parsed by the query parser using this
auto-language-analyzer, the detection may fail and the wrongly-stemmed
analyzer tokens will hit no results.
