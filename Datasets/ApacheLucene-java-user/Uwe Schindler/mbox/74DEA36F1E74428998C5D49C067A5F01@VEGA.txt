No just use Field.Store.COMPRESS when adding to index and Document.get()
when fetching. The decompression is automatically done.

You may think, why not enable compression for all fields? The case is, that
this is an overhead for very small and short fields. So you should only use
it for large contents (it's the same like compressing very small files as
ZIP/GZIP: These files mostly get larger than without compression).
