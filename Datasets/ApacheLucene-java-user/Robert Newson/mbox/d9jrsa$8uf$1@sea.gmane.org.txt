As long as you use the same Searcher object, you shouldn't see document 
ids changing.

When you open a searcher you get a consistent view of the segments that 
existed at the time. Merging creates new segments which you won't see 
until you create a new searcher.

In short, retrieving hits while indexing and merging works correctly, no 
surprises.
