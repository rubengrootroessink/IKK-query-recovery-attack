I'm currently trying to figure how I could provide a Lucene-based search functionality to an
existing system. Though the application is hosted in multiple boxes, they do NOT share a SAN
where we can put the index directory. Each of the nodes need to update Lucene documents but
it's not going to be a common use case -- probably 100x a day from the 7-8M documents.

Has anyone here tried storing the Lucene index on top of DRBD? I'm curious to hear your experience
in setting up and maintaining such a solution. Were there any performance issues?

Thanks,
