SUBJECT: Text is not indexed when passed as a StringReader
DATE: 16 Sep 2005

Hello,

this question seems to have occured in the mailing list before but I 
wasn't able to find a satisfying answer. So please excuse if I'm asking 
something that has already been discussed.

My problem is as follows:
If I use the Field.Text(String,Reader) method to create an indexed, but 
unstored field and the passed in Reader happens to be a StringReader 
(e.g. when extracting Word documents using the Textmining library) the 
field is not indexed at all. That means Luke shows no terms for this 
field and, consequently, searches do not yield any result. For 
FileReaders, however, everything seems to work fine.

Of course, I could just convert the reader back into a string (e.g. with 
Jakarta Commons IO - IOTools.toString()) and use the 
Unstored(String,String) method but then again it wouldn't make sense to 
use a StringReader in the first place.

Thanks for your help,
Matthias
