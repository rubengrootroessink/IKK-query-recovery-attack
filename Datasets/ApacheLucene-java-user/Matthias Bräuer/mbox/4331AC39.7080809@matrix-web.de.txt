Hello,

Well, the variable FSDirectory.LOCK_DIR shows for both applications the 
same value (the temp directory in my home directory C:\Documents and 
Settings\Matthew\...).

But I do:

Caused by: java.io.IOException: Cannot delete _28.cfs
    at org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.create(FSDirectory.java:144)
    at org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.<init>(FSDirectory.java:128)
    at 
org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.getDirectory(FSDirectory.java:102)
    at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:193)

This happens, as explained, both when I try to reindex while the index 
is open in Luke and also when a Searcher of my web application is not 
closed yet.

There is no such file in my index directory. This might be the reason 
but how do I convince Lucene to create such a file?

Kind regards,
Matthias
