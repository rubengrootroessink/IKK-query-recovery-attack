Hallo,

I have documents that only have numeric values (and dates) and I want to
be able to do the following:

given e.g that the document represents a  Person
the fields are age,nr_of_children,last_login_date

I want to boost those with the oldest age to have a better score for
example but in conjunction with other criteria (therefore the new Sort
will not help I guess)

I can not set the boost at indexing time because I might want the ones
with less children for example to have a better score at searching time

what should be done to achieve this kind of search

thanks
