I've taken the liberty to update this code to handle multiple fields and use the new term
vector 
support in CVS so that retokenizing a document's text isn't necessary if you have a document
ID that 
has indexed and term vector supported fields. I've added the apache 2.0 license to the top
however 
if that isn't the licence you want this code to be released under let me know and I'll change
it 
immediately.
