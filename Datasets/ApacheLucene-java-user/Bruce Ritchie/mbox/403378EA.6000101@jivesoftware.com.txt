Actually, the analyzer should do that, shouldn't it? For example, I have stemming analyzers
for a 
variety of languages that both stem and remove stop words - it seems silly to me to duplicate
that 
functionality when it's so easily provided by the analyzer. Given that, I would suggest removing
the 
stop word functionality from this class as it is not needed and only confuses things.
