The highlighter code in sandbox can facilitate highlighting of text
*extracted* from the PDF, however it does nothing for you to highlight
search terms *inside* of the PDF. For that you will need some sort of tool
that can modify the PDF on the fly as the user views it. I know of no quick
and dirty tool that allows you to do this, though there is quite a few
projects and products which allow you to manipulate PDF files which likely
can be used to obtain the behavior you are looking for (with some effort on
your part).
