As far as I know it's not currently possible to get this information from a standard lucene
index.

I've been meaning to look into good ways to store token offset information to allow for very

efficient highlighting and I believe Mark may also be looking into improving the highlighter
via 
other means such as temporary ram indexes. Search the archives to get a background on some
of the 
idea's we've tossed around ('Dmitry's Term Vector stuff, plus some' and 'Demoting results'
come to 
mind as threads that touch this topic).
