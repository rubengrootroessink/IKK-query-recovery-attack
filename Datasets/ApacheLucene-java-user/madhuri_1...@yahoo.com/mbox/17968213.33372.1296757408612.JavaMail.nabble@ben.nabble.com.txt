SUBJECT: Regarding Search Performance
DATE: 3 Feb 2011

Hi,

I have searching fields from multiple indexes. I am using Boolean Query. Index Search is taking
nearly 20 sec for one query.

I have read that Query Filter have a feature of caching the inner Query search results. I
am not sure which Query is useful whether Query Filter or boolean query ?

Can you suggest me whether Multi-Index search (MultiSearch) or Filtered Search  can improve
performance ?

Thanks in Advance.
