SUBJECT: Multi Index Search Query
DATE: 14 Feb 2011

Hi,

I have two index files. I am searching id1 from Index A and id2 from Index B.
By using id1 (Index A) results , I am searching id2 from Index B. I stored these two index
files in local file system.
I am using filter as a result of Index A.
IndexSearcher.search(Query,filter,10000);

I am running queries individually. Is there any possibility that I can combine these two queries
into single query. Can I use Multi index search in this case ?
