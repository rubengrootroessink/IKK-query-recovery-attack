SUBJECT: [ANN] Lucene included in Out-of-the-Box Open Source distribution
DATE: 2 Jun 2003

Lucene is included in Out-of-the-Box 2.0, an intelligent distribution of
over 100 Open Source projects for Java developers on both Linux and Windows.

Its graphical installer provides selective and incremental installation and
uninstallation, automatic project dependency management, easy project
configuration, and a highly-organized built-in project knowledge base.  When
installation completes, the selected projects are installed, configured,
integrated, tested (with live JUnit/HttpUnit test reports to prove it all
worked), running, and ready to use.

You get 10 custom sample applications, including ones for JBoss that take
advantage of XDoclet, Middlegen, Hibernate, AspectJ, and more.
Out-of-the-Box comes with a 350 page user guide that contains tips, gotchas,
and workarounds for the major projects, along with a substantial section on
JBoss.

The free Community Edition is fully functional, does not expire, and does
not require registration.  It installs just over 25 of the 100+ projects,
including JBoss, MySQL, and Castor, and comes with the Castor sample project
and nearly all of the Enterprise Edition documentation.

Please visit http://www.ejbsolutions.com for details or to download the free
Community Edition.
