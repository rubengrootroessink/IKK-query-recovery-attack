I know this may be far fetched, but how about being able to index
.jsp's....I know this is a spindle thing, but It seems a lot of people
need this functionality.....


My suggestion

Subject: Lucene demo ideas?

I'm about to start some refactorings on the web application demo that 
ships with Lucene to show off its features and be usable more easily 
and cleanly out of the box - i.e. just drop into Tomcat's webapps 
directory and go.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what they'd like to see in the demo 
app?  Some of my ideas are:

- Eliminate the need to do a command-line indexing, let the web app do 
this upon command, allowing you to specify where the index lives (there 
will be a reasonable default like ~/lucenedemo/index perhaps) and what 
directory tree to index (perhaps defaulting to the root directory or 
c:\, or where instead?)

- Spin off a background indexing thread so the web app searching is 
immediately useful after kicking off the indexing process, and allow a 
status view of the indexing progress.

- Index text and HTML files.  Any others?  I don't want to get into 
putting too many dependencies in though - let's keep it relatively 
simple, although still demonstrative.  Allow search filtering by last 
modified date range and document type (extension).

- Perhaps allow you to specify the analyzer to use when indexing.

- Show the explanation of how scores are computed in the search results 
as an option.

I'm all ears to possibilities of improvements!  Send your wishlist.

Erik
