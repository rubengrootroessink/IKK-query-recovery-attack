SUBJECT: Why Hits is not serializable?
DATE: 13 Sep 2003

Hi, I was wondering why Hits is not serializable? It would have been
convenient for me to have it serializable, as the search action is performed
by a session bean in a context other than the one running the
web-application.

Which is your standard way to pass the matching documents between different
context?

For now, I'm going to create a Serializable object (a String[] or a
Collection) but I'm remaining for your reply.

Thanks,

Marco
