SUBJECT: Re: [NEWBIE] Creating context-relative URLs with Tomcat + Struts
DATE: 8 Sep 2003

Hi Jeff, DAMN!, two of the books I haven't got :) I bought Jakarta Struts
from O'reilly and another one on JSP/Servlets/Web programming.

I already wrote the user interfaces and the classes (I wrote a stateless EJB
which performs both the indexing and the researching of the result) to run
the search.

My problem is another: as you'll certainly know, as I'm running on Windows,
my Tomcat home path is something similar to:

D:\Tomcat\
