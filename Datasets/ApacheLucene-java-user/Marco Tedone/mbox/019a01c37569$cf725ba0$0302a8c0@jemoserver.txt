SUBJECT: [NEWBIE] Creating context-relative URLs with Tomcat + Struts
DATE: 7 Sep 2003

Hi all, this is my first post, so I hope not to bore you too much with my
questions:

Ok, let's say that I would like to translate system's specific URLs (i.e.
D:\Tomcat\webapps\foo\foo\bar.jsp and so on...) into  web-context specific
URLs (i.e. http://myServer/foo/foo/bar.jsp). Well, if I immagine to replace
D:\Tomcat\webapps with http://myServer things seem quite easy. My first
question is: is this the right way? As I am very new to Lucene, is there a
possibility to instruct the IndexWriter to replace system path with web path
(specified as argument) during index creation?

Secondly, this is for Struts users, a jsp page not necessarily can be
executed without passing from a Struts Action (i.e. an Action prepared some
data to display, and if we try to access the jsp directly we could have some
bad 5 minutes), so my question is: did anyone encountered this kind of
questions? Did you find any solution? For this second subject, I could think
to a sort of mapping file between JSPs and relevant actions, so that we can
assume that if the user clicks on a JSP link, instead the relevant action
for that JSP will be executed and then the JSP displayed. The mainteinance
for this solution seems CRAP.

Hope someone of you will help,

Marco
