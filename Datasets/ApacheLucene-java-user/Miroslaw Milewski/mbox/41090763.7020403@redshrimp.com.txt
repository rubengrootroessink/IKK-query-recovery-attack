  Yes, I am aware of that - this is the reason I picked pdfs containting 
only text, arranged in one column. Anwyay, there probably are lots of 
different factors to consider, so the whole benchmark thing was greatly 
simplified.
  All wanted to actually find out is whether the speed of extraction I 
encountered is 'standard' considering the system, the API version and my 
code. But then, considering the PDF structure and other factors, there 
may be no definitive answer.

  Oh, yes, I forgot to specify the version. It is 0.6.6. I'll give the 
previous one a try.
