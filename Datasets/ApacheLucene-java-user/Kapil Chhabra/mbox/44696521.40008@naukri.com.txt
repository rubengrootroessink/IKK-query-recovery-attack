SUBJECT: Re: Aggregating category hits
DATE: 16 May 2006

Even I am doing the same in my application.
Once in a day, all the filters [for different categories] are 
initialized. Each time a query is fired, the Query BitSet is ANDed with 
the BitSet of each filter. The cardinality obtained is the desired output.
@Eric: I would like to know more about the implementation with DocSet in 
place of Bitset.
