Hi,
If I have correctly understood your question, you want the terms in a 
field with the maximum number of occurences.
Try luke [www.getopt.org/*luke*/].
Or else in case you are not able to initialize graphical content on your 
system.
You may use the following script.
src/org/getopt/luke/HighFreqTerms.java
get it from the luke source code.
Regards,
