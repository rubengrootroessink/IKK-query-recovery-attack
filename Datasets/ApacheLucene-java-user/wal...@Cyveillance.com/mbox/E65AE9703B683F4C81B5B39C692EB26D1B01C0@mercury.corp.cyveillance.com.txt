r.html#DEFAULT_MAX_FIELD_LENGTH

maxFieldLength
public int maxFieldLengthThe maximum number of terms that will be indexed
for a single field in a document. This limits the amount of memory required
for indexing, so that collections with very large files will not crash the
indexing process by running out of memory.
Note that this effectively truncates large documents, excluding from the
index terms that occur further in the document. If you know your source
documents are large, be sure to set this value high enough to accomodate the
expected size. If you set it to Integer.MAX_VALUE, then the only limit is
your memory, but you should anticipate an OutOfMemoryError.

By default, no more than 10,000 terms will be indexed for a field.

Subject: Problem Indexing Large Document Field


I am trying to index a field in a Lucene document with about 90,000 
characters. The problem is that it only indexes part of the document. 
It seems to only index about 65,00 characters. So, if I search on terms 
that are at the beginning of the text, the search works, but it fails 
for terms that are at the end of the document.

Is there a limitation on how many characters can be stored in a 
document field? Any help would be appreciated, thanks....
