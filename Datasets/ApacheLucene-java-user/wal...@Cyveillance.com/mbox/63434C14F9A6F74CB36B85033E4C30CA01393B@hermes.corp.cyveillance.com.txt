It could also be that your disk space is filling up and the OS runs out of
swap room.

Subject: Very slow IndexReader.open() performance


Hi -- We have a large index (~4m documents, ~14gb) that we haven't been
able to optimize for some time, because the JVM throws OutOfMemory, after
climbing to the maximum we can throw at it, 2gb. 

In fact, the OutOfMemory condition occurred most recently during a segment 
merge operation. maxMergeDocs was set to the default, and we seem to have
gotten around this problem by setting it to some lower value, currently
100,000. The index is highly interactive so I took the hint from earlier
posts to set it to this value.

Good news! No more OutOfMemory conditions.

Bad news: now, calling IndexReader.open() is taking 20+ seconds, and it 
is killing performance.

I followed the design pattern in another earlier post from Doug. I take a
batch of deletes, open an IndexReader, perform the deletes, then close it.
Then I take a batch of adds, open an IndexWriter, perform the adds, then
close it. Then I get a new IndexSearcher for searching.

But because the index is so interactive, this sequence repeats itself all
the time. 

My question is, is there a better way? Performance was fine when I could
optimize. Can I hold onto singleton a IndexReader/IndexWriter/IndexSearcher
to avoid the overhead of the open?

Any help would be most gratefully received.
