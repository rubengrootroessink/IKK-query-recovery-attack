Make sure you close your indexwriter.

Subject: Rebuild after corruption


I have a problem periodically where the process updating my Lucene files
terminates abnormally. When I try to open the Lucene files afterward I get
an exception indicating that files are missing. Does anyone know how I can
recover at this point, without having to rebuild the whole index from
scratch?
