I also question whether it could handle extreme volume with such good query
speed.

Has anyone done numbers with  1+ million documents?

Stemming is still on the MySQL TODO list: 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Fulltext_TODO.html

Also, for most people it's easier to extend Lucene than MySQL (as MySQL is 
written in C(++?)) and there are more powerful queries in Lucene, e.g. 
fuzzy phrase search.
