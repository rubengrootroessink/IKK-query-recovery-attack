Use org.apache.lucene.analysis.PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper

Here is how I use it:

                PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper analyzer  = new
org.apache.lucene.analysis.PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper(new MyAnalyzer());
                analyzer.addAnalyzer("url", new NullAnalyzer());
                try 
                {
                        query = QueryParser.parse(searchQuery, "contents",
analyzer);

Subject: Problem with match on a non tokenized field.


I have a Lucene Document with a field named Code which is stored 
and indexed but not tokenized. The value of the field is ABC5-LB.
The only way I can match the field when searching is by entering 
Code:"ABC5-LB" because when I drop the quotes, every Analyzer I've tried
using breaks my
query into Code:ABC5 -Code:LB.
 
I need to be able to match this field by doing something like
Code:ABC5-L*, therefore always using quotes is not an option.
 
How would I go about writing my own analyzer that will not tokenize the
query ?
 
Thanks,
Polina
