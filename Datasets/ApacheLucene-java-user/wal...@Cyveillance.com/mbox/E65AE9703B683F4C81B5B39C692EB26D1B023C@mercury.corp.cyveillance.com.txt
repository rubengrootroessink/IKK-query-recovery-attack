SUBJECT: QueryParser and Keyword Fields
DATE: 25 Jun 2004

Can anyone give me advice on the best way to not have your keyword fields
analyzed by QueryParser?

Even though it seems like it would be a common problem, I have read the FAQ,
and found this relevant thread with no real answers.

"QueryParser has some nasty habits of analyzing everything."

Can't it be smart and not analyze fields that are keywords (aka not
tokenized by the analyzer?)

Thank you,
Will
