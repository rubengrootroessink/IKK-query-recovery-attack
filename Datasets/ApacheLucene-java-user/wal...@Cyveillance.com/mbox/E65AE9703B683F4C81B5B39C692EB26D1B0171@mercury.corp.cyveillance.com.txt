SUBJECT: Can documents be appended to?
DATE: 17 May 2004

Is it possible to append to an existing document?

Judging by my own tests and this thread, NO.
http://issues.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apac
he.org&msgNo=3971

Wouldn't it be possible to look up an individual document (based upon a uid
of sorts), then load the Fields off of the old one, delete it, then add the
new document.  Is there any hope of doing this efficiently?  This would run
into problems when merging indexes, you would get duplicates if they existed
on more than 1 of your original indexes.

Thank you,
Will
