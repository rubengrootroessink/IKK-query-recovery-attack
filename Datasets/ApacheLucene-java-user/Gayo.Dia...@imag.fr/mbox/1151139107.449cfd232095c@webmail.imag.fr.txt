SUBJECT: Multilangual indexing (in the same index)
DATE: 24 Jun 2006


Hi,

I wiss to index different set of multilingual documents in the same index. As
each document may contains several languages (currently English and French)
currently I'm using two Index (with the corresponding Analyzer for each part of
the document). The search is performed in one of the index depending to the
language specifyed in the Query.
I wish to use a single index with two differents Fields, An English field and an
French Field, both stemmed by the corresponding Ananlyzer. SO I need to
instanciate two IndexWriter. 
Is'it possible to do that, as to create and a new Index we need to instaciate
IndexWriter with the option true (lock) ?

Best regards

Gayo
