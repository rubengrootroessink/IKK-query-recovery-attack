Hi,
As per the Grouping discussion in the URL below:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/queryparsersyntax.html
(jakarta OR apache) AND website query means website must exist and either term jakarta or
apache may exist.

If we write query like (jakarta AND apache) OR website what happen?
Is it possible that we can get the document that contains 'jakarta' AND 'apache'. Also document
may contain 'website'?
Is it possible that if the document do not contains 'jakarta' AND 'apache', but contains 'website',
the search result will give the result for document that contains 'website'?

Another example:

If you search for "(a AND b)" it will return x results
If you search for "c" it will return y results
If you search for "(a and b) or c" the number of results cannot be less than the larger of
x or y. But this is not happening. Please help how should I proceed to implement this?

Any help or suggestion will be appreciated!!!
Thanks & Regards,
Ranjit Kumar
