Hi,
                Thanks for your replay!!!
                                Below is code I am using for search
                                                String line="sql server";
IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(FSDirectory.open(new File(indexpath)), true);   // contains
index file path
                Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(reader);
                Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT);
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, field, analyzer);
if (line != null) {
                line = line.trim();
                Query query = parser.parse(line);
                int n = 100;
                TopDocs docs = searcher.search(query, n);
                TermDocs termDocs = reader.termDocs(new Term(field, line. toLowerCase()));
                System.out.println("   " + docs.totalHits + " total matching documents\n");
                for (int i = 0; i < docs.scoreDocs.length; i++) {
                    int totalFreq = 0;
                    Document document = reader.document(docs.scoreDocs[i].doc);
                    termDocs.skipTo(i);
                    String path = document.get("path");
                    System.out.println("path>>" + path);
                    totalFreq = termDocs.freq();
   System.out.println("totalFreq >>" + totalFreq);
                    }

                }


Thanks & Regards,
Ranjit Kumar
