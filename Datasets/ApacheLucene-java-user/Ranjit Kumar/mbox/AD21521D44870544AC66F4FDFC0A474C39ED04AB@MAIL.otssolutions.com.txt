SUBJECT: lucene3.0.3 | get correct document in case of multiple Boolean query in search criteria
DATE: 18 Feb 2011

hi,

I am using query like

criteria = (sql OR sqlserver OR "sql server") AND java AND delphi .

In this case when i am using default parser as code mention below:

QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, field, analyzer);

Query query = parser.parse(criteria);

I am getting same number of document when i am using QueryParser.OR_OPERATOR in code below:

QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, field, analyzer); parser.setDefaultOperator(QueryParser.OR_OPERATOR);

Query query = parser.parse(criteria);

which is not correct. please! suggest me feasible solution.

how could get correct document in case of multiple Boolean query in search criteria?


Thanks & Regards,
Ranjit Kumar
