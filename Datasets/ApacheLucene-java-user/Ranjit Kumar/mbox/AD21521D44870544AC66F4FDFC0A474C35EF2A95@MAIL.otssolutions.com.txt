Hi Anshum,



Thanks for your replay..



Yes, I am agree with you.

As right now, I am using StandardAnalyzer it remove stop words, Puts text in lowercase and
do not create index for most common word in English.

        Searching on index created by StandardAnalyzer it gives result as discussed.



In case of SimpleAnalyzer while indexing it puts text in lowercase, also ignore stop words.

        Searching on index created by SimpleAnalyzer it gives result like StandardAnalyzer.
But, also give result for most common words.



While using WhitespaceAnalyzer for indexing it Splits tokens at whitespace.

        Searching on index created by WhitespaceAnalyzer it gives result better and do not
gives result for "sql. Resver"

But also do not gives result for "SQL Server 2005/2000/CE" which is not correct.



Can you suggest me analyzer that works properly with this condition.



Thanks & Regards,
Ranjit Kumar
