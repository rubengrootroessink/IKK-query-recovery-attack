SUBJECT: Re: lucene3.0.3 | get correct document in case of multiple Boolean query in search criteria
DATE: 22 Feb 2011

Hi,

As, mention above i am using query like:

criteria = (sql OR sqlserver OR "sql server") AND java AND delphi

In the above scenario i need hit(document) containing at least one occurrence of (sql OR sqlserver
OR "sql server"). Also java and delphi must present in document.

Still I have not got solution for that!!



but, if my query changes to:

criteria = sql OR sqlserver OR "sql server" AND java AND delphi

we can use MultiFieldQueryParser in this way ==>



String[] queree = {"sql ", "sqlserver ","sql server","java ","delphi"};

String[] fields = {"contents","contents","contents","contents","contents"};

BooleanClause.Occur[] flags={BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,BooleanClause.Occur.MUST,
BooleanClause.Occur.MUST};

Query query = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, queree, fields, flags, analyzer);

TopDocs docs = searcher.search(query, null, n);

System.out.println("Total document matched: "+docs.totalHits);



          **It gives correct document!!**

suggest me to get hit(document) in the context mention in my first query!!


Thanks & Regards,
Ranjit Kumar
