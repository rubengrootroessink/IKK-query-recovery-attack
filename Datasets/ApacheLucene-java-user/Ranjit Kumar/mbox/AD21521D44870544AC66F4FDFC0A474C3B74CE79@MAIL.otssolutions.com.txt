SUBJECT: Re: lucene3.0.3 | get correct document in case of multiple Boolean query in search criteria
DATE: 21 Feb 2011

Hi Ian;

As you told we can use explicitly specify ANDs and ORs operator set parser. Otherwise we can
use default parser to get hit(document) which is ORs. Do not gives correct hit(document)!!!

My question is that, Is there any parser we can use in case of multiple Boolean clause in
search string?

If not? Please suggest me how to get correct hit(document).



Your suggestion will be very helpful for me.

Thanks & Regards,
Ranjit Kumar
