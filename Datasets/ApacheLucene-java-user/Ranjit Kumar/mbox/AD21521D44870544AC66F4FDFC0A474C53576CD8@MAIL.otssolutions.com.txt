DATE: 27 Apr 2011

Hi,
while creating index with the help of  lucene standardAnalyzer, we cannot make difference
between c, c++ and c# as lucene do not create index for c++ and c#. To make the difference
between these term I need to change the grammar of lucene with the help of jFlex, it force
me to create my own custom analyzer.

While I am searching for single term like c# I get correct result (also in the case of c++)
So, lucene make index for C++ and c# . Also do not need to use any Parser. Hence,  jFlex doing
it work properly.
But, when I am trying to search for multiple Boolean query like c# AND .net  I need to use
 MultiFieldQueryParser to get correct result(document). Then Parser stripping off # but do
not dot(.) so query became c AND .net
Also, I have made changes for c#.net, vb.net, .net all these work properly with MultiFieldQueryParser
except c#

Thanks & Regards,
Ranjit Kumar
