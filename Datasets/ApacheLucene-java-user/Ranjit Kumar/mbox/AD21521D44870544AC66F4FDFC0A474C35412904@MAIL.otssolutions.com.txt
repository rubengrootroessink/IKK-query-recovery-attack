SUBJECT: lucene 3.0.3 | phrase query problem
DATE: 10 Feb 2011

Hi,

I am using SpanQuery and SpanNearQuery to get phrase query like "Sql Server".

In my text file in which I am searching, it is present like (sql. server) mean 'sql dot server'
 which is not a span like "Sql Server".

While searching for phrase query "Sql Server". It gives result for (sql. server) which is
not correct.

I am using StandardAnalyzer on both side while creating index or searching on files. While
creating index Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED  is used.



Please, give your suggestion !!!


Thanks & Regards,
