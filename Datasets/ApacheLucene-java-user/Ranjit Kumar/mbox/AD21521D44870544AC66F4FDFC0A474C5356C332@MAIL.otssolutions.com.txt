DATE: 26 Apr 2011

Hi,

I have created my own custom analyzer and uses jFlex to made search for c#, .net, c++ etc.

While I am trying to search c#, .net, c++ QueryParser parse .net to .net and C++ to C++. So
it works fine. But in case of C# QueryParser parse it to C which makes trouble for me.

Also tried to use MultiFieldQueryParser but it also do the same.

Any help or suggestion will be appreciated!!!


Thanks & Regards,
Ranjit Kumar
