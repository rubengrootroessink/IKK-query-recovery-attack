SUBJECT: lucene3.0.3 | Special character indexing
DATE: 14 Mar 2011

Hi,

I am creating index using Lucene 3.0.3 StandardAnalyzer.

when searching is made on index using query like C, C# or C++  it gives same result for all
these three term. As, I know while creating index analyzer ignore special character and do
not create index for same. I have tried KeywordAnalyzer but it do not fulfill my requirement.

Need to be able to differentiate between "C", "C#" and "C++"

I have to create my own analyzer?

Or I have to modify the JFlex grammar? http://osdir.com/ml/java-dev/2009-06/msg00208.html

please suggest me that, Is any existing analyzer will resolve this issue?

Any suggestion will be appreciated!!!


Thanks & Regards,
