SUBJECT: Re: get wordno, lineno, pageno for term/phrase
DATE: 4 Aug 2010

Thanks for your responses. In this case, retrieval time will be more
important than index size. Each document will be indexed separately,
and the data (wordno, lineno, pageno) will be extracted for certain
terms/phrases for each document and stored.

I define linebreak and pagebreak and add them to the text string.

int pageBreakAscii = 12;
String pageBreak = new Character ((char) pageBreakAscii).toString();
String lineBreak = System.getProperty("line.separator");

Thanks,
Arun
