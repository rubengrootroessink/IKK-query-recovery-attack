SUBJECT: get wordno, lineno, pageno for term/phrase
DATE: 3 Aug 2010

hi all,
            I am new to Lucene. I am trying to use Lucene to generate
data for a document classifier. I need to generate wordno, lineno,
pageno for each term/phrase. I was able to use SpanQuery/SpanNearQuery
to get the wordno (span.start()) for the term/phrase. To get pageno
and lineno, a custom Analyzer needs to be written ? Can the Analyzer
be made to recognize and newline and page feed characters and keep
track of lineno and pageno for the tokens ?

Is it possible with existing Lucene Analyzer ?

Thanks,
Arun
