SUBJECT: Wrong spelling
DATE: 24 Jul 2002

I would like to implement in my Lucene application a google's like 
feature like the "Did you mean" google's feature. So, when the user 
enters a wrong spelling of a word, the search engine automatically 
propose a similar better word. To implement such function in a Lucene 
application, I'm not sure of what method is the best (or it's correct to 
try to di this with a Lucene index). Is there anybody that could help-me 
for this?

Thanks.
