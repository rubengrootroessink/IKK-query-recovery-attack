SUBJECT: Query and Boost Factor
DATE: 23 Jul 2002

Hi all,

  I'm (now) using a BooleanQuery to construct my query, and to verify 
that my construction is correct, I use the toString() method to 
retrieves the 'human readable' query.
  Everything seems to be okay, but when I set a Boost Factor for a 
sub-query (or the main query itself), this factor doesn't appeard in the 
String as I was waiting for (with an '^' character). It seem normal that 
this construction doesn't use a '^' character to set a Boost Factor (due 
to the syntax limitation of this operator), but How could I check the 
Boost value other way than using the getBoost() method?

Thanks.
