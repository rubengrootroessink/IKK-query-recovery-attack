SUBJECT: Queries on dates...
DATE: 5 Jul 2002

Hi all.

I'm sorry if this question was already posted, but I didn't find one.

In order to be able to perform searches on dates, I'm thinking on how to 
design my application; what is the best to be able to search on dates, 
assuming the format is something like that "yyyy-mm-dd"?
Maybe add 3 differents fields in the Lucene's document for each part of 
the date? but after, how could I perform searches like files older than 
a date or else...
Or is it better to use external filters (something completly independant 
from the search engine)?

Thanks.
