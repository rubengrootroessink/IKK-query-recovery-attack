Thanks a mil erik, I tried to make my own filter class
with a modified bit method as per below:
if (doc == interestingDoc)
{
bits.set(doc); // set bit for hit		
}

but this baby continues to always return 1!

so then I looked at indexreader, like you said and
ended up with something like this, its probably a
messy way of doing it, but I am happy.

Term term = new Term("body", "mercedes");
IndexReader ir = IndexReader.open(indexPath);
TermDocs termdocs = ir.termDocs(term);

int id = hits.id(i);

while (termdocs.next())
{
	if (termdocs.doc() == id)
	{
		System.out.println(
"Document number "
	+ termdocs.doc()
	+ " Freq: "
	+ termdocs.freq());
	}

}

it only works for single words, but I reckon I just
send split up the query and then make multiple scans. 

cheers
