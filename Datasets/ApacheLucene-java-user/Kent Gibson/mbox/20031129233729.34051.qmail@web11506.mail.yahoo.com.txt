Dear All,

All I would like to know is how many times a query was
found in a particular document. I have no problems
getting the score from hits.score(). hits.length is
the number of times in total that the query was found,
however I want the the number of times the query was
found on a document by document basis. is this
possible? The only idea I have is to rerun the search,
but I can't even see how to run a search on only one
document! 

thanks any help would be grand

kent
