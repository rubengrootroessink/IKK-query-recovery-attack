Yes, it works correctly by using a straight term query.

Does this mean that whenever I want to do keyword searches, I must avoid
QueryParser?

Is it also the case that QueryParser is comparatively slow? I haven't done
any heavy-duty testing of this, and of course the use of the .NET platform
may not be helping, but that is my perception.
