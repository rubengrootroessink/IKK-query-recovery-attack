Daniel you are very clever! Your solution remind me this:
No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is 
faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but 
with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be 
able to endure it.
1 Corinthians 10:13 (New American Standard Version)

Well done Erik!

Something like this?

   String str = "Really bad query string: lots of evil stuff!";
   str = QueryParser.escape(str);
