Hey Paul,

Thanks for the quick reply. Excuse my ignorance, but what do I do with the
generated BitSet?

Also - we are using a pooling feature which contains a pool of
IndexSearchers that are used and tossed back each time we need to search.
I'd hate to have to work around this and open up an IndexReader for this
particular search, where all other searches use the pool. Suggestions?

Thanks,
Shawn.

You can use this as an example:

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/
search/DateFilter.java

(Just click view on the latest version to see the code).

and iteratate over you doc ids instead of over dates.
This will give you a filter for the doc ids you want to query.
