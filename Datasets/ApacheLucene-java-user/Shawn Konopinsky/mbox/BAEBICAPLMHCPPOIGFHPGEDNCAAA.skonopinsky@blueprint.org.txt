SUBJECT: Read locks on indexes
DATE: 7 Dec 2004

Hi,

I have a question regarding read locks on indexes. I have the situation 
where I have n applications (separated jvms) running queries. These 
applications are read-only, and never use an IndexWriter.

The index is only ever updated using rsync. The applications don't need 
up the minute updates, only the data from when the reader was created is 
fine.

My question is whether it's ok to disable read locks in this scenario? 
What are read locks protecting?

Best,
Shawn.
