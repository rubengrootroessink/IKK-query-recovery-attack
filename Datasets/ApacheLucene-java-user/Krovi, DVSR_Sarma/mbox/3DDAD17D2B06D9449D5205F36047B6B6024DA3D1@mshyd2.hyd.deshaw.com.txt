You can use text extractors for the document formats you mentioned.
Lucene as such does not deal with this text extraction process.
Following are the extractors we generally use:
PDF 		-> PDFBox: Java API to read PDF documents
http://www.pdfbox.org.
WORD		-> Antiword: http://www.winfield.demon.nl/
TXT		-> You can read the content using Java IO classes and
index them.
MSG		-> We currently using strings utility in Solaris that
reads printable characters from files.
XLS		-> Apache POI utils has classes to read Excel files. so
you can use that.
PPT/PPS	-> Apache POI's PowerPointExtractor
RTF		-> Java Swing has RTFEditorKit which we use to read RTF
documents.
