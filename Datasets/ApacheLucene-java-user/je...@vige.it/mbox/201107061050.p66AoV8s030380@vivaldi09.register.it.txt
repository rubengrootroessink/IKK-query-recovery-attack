SUBJECT: how are built the packages in the maven repository?
DATE: 6 Jul 2011

Hi.... I'm looking inside the jenkins maven repository. For example the package in https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-Solr-Maven-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/maven_artifacts/org/apache/lucene/lucene-misc/4.0-SNAPSHOT/lucene-misc-4.0-20110705.223250-1.jar
seems to be built with ant instead of maven. It is visible from the MANIFEST.MF

Is it correct? should not be built with maven? Actually maven has the OSGI support respect
to the ant version
