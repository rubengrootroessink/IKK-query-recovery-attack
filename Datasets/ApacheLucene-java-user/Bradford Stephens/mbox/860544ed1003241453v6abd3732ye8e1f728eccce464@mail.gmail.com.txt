Greetings,

Don't forget that the Hadoop/Scalability/NoSQL meetup is next
Wednesday, March 31st at 6:45pm! We're going to have a very exciting
guest: Jake Mannix from LinkedIn will talk about machine learning on
Hadoop. He's a well-decorated engineer across many disciplines, and
even knows quite a bit about distributed search with Lucene.

We may also hear form Sarah Killcoyne from Systems Biology. She'll be
talking about Big Data in the biology / research fields.

Check out the details here:

Hope to see you there!

Cheers,
Bradford
