Greetings,

It's time for another awesome Seattle Hadoop/Lucene/Scalability/NoSQL Meetup!

As always, it's at the University of Washington, Allen Computer
Science building, Room 303 at 6:45pm. You can find a map here:

Last month, we had a great talk from Steve McPherson of Razorfish on
their usage of Hadoop. This month, we'll have Richard Kreuter from
MongoDB talking about, well, MongoDB. As well as assorted discussion
on the Hadoop ecosystem.

If you can, please RSVP here (not required, but very nice):

My cell # is 904-415-3009 if you have questions/get lost.

Cheers,
Bradford
