Hey all,

I'm going to be speaking at OSCON about my company's experiences with
Hadoop and Friends, but I'm having a hard time coming up with a name
for the entire software ecosystem. I'm thinking of calling it the
"Apache CloudStack". Does this sound legit to you all? :) Is there
something more 'official'?

Cheers,
Bradford
