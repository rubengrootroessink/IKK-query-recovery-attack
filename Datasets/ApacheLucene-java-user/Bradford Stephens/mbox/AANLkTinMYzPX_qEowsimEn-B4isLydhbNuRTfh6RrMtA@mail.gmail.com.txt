Greetings,

The Seattle Scalability Meetup isn't slacking for the holidays. We've
got an awesome lineup for Wed, December 8 at 7pm:

http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Hadoop-HBase-NoSQL-Meetup/

-Jake Mannix from Twitter will talk about the Twitter Search
infrastructure (with distributed Lucene)
-Chris Nauroth from a Really Large Media Company will talk about how
they use Hadoop
-We may also have someone from Elastic MapReduce talk about their
really cool new stuff.

The meetup is at Amazon South Lake Union campus, and usually goes from
7pm-8:30pm. Drinks are at Fierabend afterward, at 422 Yale Ave N.
