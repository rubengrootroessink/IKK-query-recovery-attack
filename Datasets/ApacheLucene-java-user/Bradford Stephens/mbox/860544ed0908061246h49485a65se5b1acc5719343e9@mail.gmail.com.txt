SUBJECT: Language Detection for Analysis?
DATE: 6 Aug 2009

Hey there,

We're trying to add foreign language support into our new search
engine -- languages like Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu (that don't work with
standard analyzers). But our data source doesn't tell us which
languages we're actually collecting -- we just get blocks of text. Has
anyone here worked on language detection so we can figure out what
analyzers to use? Are there commercial solutions?

Much appreciated!
