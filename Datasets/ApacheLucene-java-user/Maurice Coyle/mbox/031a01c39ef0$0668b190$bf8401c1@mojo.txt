SUBJECT: MultiFieldQueryParser default operator
DATE: 30 Oct 2003

are there any plans to implement some sort of
MultiFieldQueryParser.setOperator(int) method so folk can search using AND
by default?

or has anyone worked around the lack of such a method and managed to search
over multiple fields using a default-AND query?
