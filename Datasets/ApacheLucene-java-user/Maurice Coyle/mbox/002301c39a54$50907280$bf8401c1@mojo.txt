SUBJECT: large index query time
DATE: 24 Oct 2003

hi,
i recently merged a whole lot of indexes into one big index for testing
purposes.  however, now the programs i use to search the index are taking
much longer.  this may be a stupid question (or very simple) and please tell
me if it is, but should this be the case?  i mean, i realise it'll take
longer to search over a larger collection, but it's taking an order of
magnitude longer.  this is the reaosn i'm asking, since if lucene is capable
of handling large-scale search apps presumably it's set up to search large
collections rapidly.

maybe there's some steps i can take to speed things up (i optimised the big
index when it was finished being created) or something i'm missing?  if i
can give any information which will help the diagnosis of this problem
please specify it.

thanks,
maurice
