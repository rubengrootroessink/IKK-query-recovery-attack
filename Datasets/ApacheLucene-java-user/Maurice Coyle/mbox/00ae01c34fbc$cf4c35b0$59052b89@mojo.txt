SUBJECT: problems extracting documents using Terms
DATE: 21 Jul 2003

hi all,

i'm trying to extract a document number from my lucene index using (where
read is an IndexReader)
TermDocs td = read.termDocs(new Term("url", someurl));

This call never returns any results, despite the fact that i definitely know
that a document with the url field equal to someurl exists in the index
(because i know the document in the index's document number and the code:

Document d=read.document(docnum);
System.out.println(d.get("url"));

outputs the String someurl).

i don't know what's going on, hopefully i've included enough information for
someone to spot what's up.

thanks very much,
maurice
