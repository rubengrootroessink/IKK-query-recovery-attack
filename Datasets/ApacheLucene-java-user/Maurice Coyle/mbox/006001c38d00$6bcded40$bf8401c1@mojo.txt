SUBJECT: Document-Document similarity
DATE: 7 Oct 2003

hi,

does anyone know of a way to get the similarity between two documents as
opposed to between a document and a query?  at the moment, i'm forced to
make a term-frequency vector for each document and get the cosine of the
angle between them, but i was hoping there was a more elegant way of doing
this using either the lucene api (although from my study of it it doesnt
look like this is the case) or some other class library that another lucene
user has created.

any help much appreciated.

maurice
