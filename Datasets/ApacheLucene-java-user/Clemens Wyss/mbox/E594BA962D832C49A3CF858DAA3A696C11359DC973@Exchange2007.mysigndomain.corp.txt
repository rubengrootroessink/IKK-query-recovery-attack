SUBJECT: GermanFilter, Analyzer cutting off letters...
DATE: 12 Apr 2011

-- hopefully not a double post, I retried sending this post after  5h --
 
I try to apply German*Filter and or Analyzer on my index. 
My index contains wine names such as "Petite Arvine" ( I know, that's french ;) ).
Whenever one oft he German*Filter or German*Analyzer is in play the terms
for "Petite Arvine" are reduced to
"Petit"
 and
"Arvin"
Why so? Where have the e's gone?

Thanks for your help
Clemens
