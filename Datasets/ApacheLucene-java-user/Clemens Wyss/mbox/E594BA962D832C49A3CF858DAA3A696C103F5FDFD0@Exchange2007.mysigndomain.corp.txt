SUBJECT: Best practices for multiple languages?
DATE: 18 Jan 2011

What is the "best practice" to support multiple languages, i.e. Lucene-Documents that have
multiple language content/fields? 
Should
a) each language be indexed in a seperate index/directory or should
b) the Documents (in a single directory) hold the diverse localized fields?

We most often will be searching "language dependent" which (at least performance wise) mandates
one-directory-per-language...

Any (lucene specific) white papers on this topic?

Thx in advance
Clemens
