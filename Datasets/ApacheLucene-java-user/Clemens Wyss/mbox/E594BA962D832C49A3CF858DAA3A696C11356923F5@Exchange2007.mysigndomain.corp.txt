SUBJECT: Suggest search terms
DATE: 21 Feb 2011

I'd like to suggest search terms to my users. My naÃ¯ve approach would have been:
After at least n characters have been typed (asynchronously) find terms in IndexReader.terms()
 which "match"

Is there a (even) more straight forward (and possible faster) approach to get "search term
suggestions"?
Could/Should the terms "per se" be indexed in an own index?
Isn't this a common desire, hence shouldn't/doesn't Lucene support this out-oif-the-box? -->
Collection<String> IndexReader.termsMatching(String term)

Hope to get some real-life feedback

Thx in advance
Clemens
