SUBJECT: AW: Higher scoring if term is at the beginning of a field/document
DATE: 4 May 2011

I try to be more specific:

Given the three documents below.
When I search for "moon", I'd like to get the follwoing order of my search result:

moon
The moon is bright
This is a moon

i.e. the "leftmost hit" of my search term should be rated highest/best...

How should I analyze/search my documents to get this search/rating behavior?
