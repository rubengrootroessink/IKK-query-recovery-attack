SUBJECT: Higher scoring if term is at the beginning of a field/document
DATE: 4 May 2011

Given the I have 3 documents with exactly one field and the fields have the following contents:
This is a moon
The moon is bright
moon

If I analyze these documents they all hit on "moon". But how do I need to analyze/search my
index in order to have the following "sort order":
moon
The moon is bright
This is a moon

i.e. the earlier the term appears the higher the score.

Thx
Clemens
