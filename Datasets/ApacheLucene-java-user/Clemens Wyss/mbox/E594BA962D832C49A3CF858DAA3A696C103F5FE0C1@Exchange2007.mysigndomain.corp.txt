SUBJECT: Paging with Lucene
DATE: 20 Jan 2011

(thanks fort he many answers to my initial lucene question "Best practices for multiple languages?")

We shall be confronted with the followong problem:
due to the very dynamic access rules on our content, we shall not be able to formulate these
in/as Filter(s). 
Hence we need to first search and then apply the access rules (i.e. security filter). 
What is the best approach to implement paging in this situation? Not to forget, the "overall
context" is a web app ;-)

Thx for your advices
- Clemens
