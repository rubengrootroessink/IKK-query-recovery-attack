SUBJECT: implicit closing of an IndexWriter
DATE: 26 Jul 2011

Under which circumstances is an IndexWriter "implcitly" closed?

I have an IndexWriter member in one of my helper classes which ist openened in the constructor.
I never ever close this member explicitly. Nevertheless I encounter AlreadyClosedException's
when writing through the IndexWriter ... 

Side note: I am using threads when writing and theses threads are (by design) interrupted
(from time to time)

Any help appreciated
Clemens
