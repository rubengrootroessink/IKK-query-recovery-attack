SUBJECT: German*Filter, Analyzer "cutting" off letters from (french) words...
DATE: 12 Apr 2011

I try to apply German*Filter and or Analyzer on my index. My index contains wine names such
as "Petite Arvine" ( I know, that's french ;) ). Whenever  one oft he German*Filter or German*Analyzer
is in play the terms for "Petite Arvine" are reduced to
"Petit"
and
"Arvin"
Why so? Where have the e's gone?

Thanks for your help
Clemens
