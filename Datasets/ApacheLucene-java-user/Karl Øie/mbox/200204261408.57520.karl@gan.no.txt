DATE: 26 Apr 2002

there are some strange problems with FSDirectory, i have found that building 
chuncks in a RAMDirectory and then merge these into a FSDirectory is more 
stable than indexing directly into the FSDirectory, i ran into your problem 
and the dreaded "too many open files" problems when indexing large documents 
with many fields....

using a RAMDir as a middle man solved my problems...
