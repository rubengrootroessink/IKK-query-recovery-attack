Hi, i have experimented with prefixing all Field values with the letter "A" to 
allow wildcards * and ? to be positioned first in the a query term.

What i would like to do next is to prefix all the terms produced by the 
QueryParser with the letter "A" so the hack is transparent to the user. Is 
there a simple way to do this as the Query's subclasses dosn't allow you to 
modify the term it holds. Secondly i can not find any way to get al sub 
queries of a query. Does anyone here know something really smart i can do 
short of learning to program JavaCC ?!?

And in the end: is there a reason why lucene doesn't use java interfaces for 
eh. interfaces like the Query class?

mvh karl øie
