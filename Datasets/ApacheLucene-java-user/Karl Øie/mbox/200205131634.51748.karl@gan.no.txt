AND and + does the same, so:

	+(Australia AND tagname:country) +(20020415 AND tagname:date)

should return a set with documents everything are mached, basicly the same as:

	Australia AND tagname:country AND 20020415 AND tagname:date

	(Austalia AND 20020415) (HongKong AND 20020315)

	+(Austalia AND 20020415) -(HongKong AND 20020315)

for the date you should use the Field.Date field type, but i don't think here 
is a shortcut to also filter with subscribers without doing something weird 
like adding say 3000 years to all dates that has been subscribed and then 
search for dates between 30020102 -> 30020330....

if you don't think this is a good idea (chances are that your system is not 
going to be used for more than a millenia) you can just use a SUBSCRIBED 
field to the index and seach for things that maches date AND subscribe=???.
lucene is quite fast even for large indexes so it should performe good 
anyhow....


happy hacking!
