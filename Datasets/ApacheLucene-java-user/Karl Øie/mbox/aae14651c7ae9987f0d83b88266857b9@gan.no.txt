SUBJECT: Re: Urgent, please help Index/Search in UTF-8 ???

If you use a servlet and a HTML Form to feed queries to the QueryParser 
take good care of all configurations around the servlet container. If 
you, like me, use tomcat you might have to recode the query into 
internal java form (utf-8) before you pass it to lucene.


read this:

then in your receiving servlet:

String query_string = request.getParameter("query");

String query_string = new 
String(query_string.getBytes(),request.getCharacterEncoding());

then pass query_string to lucene. This ensures that the string fetched 
by getParameter() is encoded by the right encoding.

Hope this helps!
