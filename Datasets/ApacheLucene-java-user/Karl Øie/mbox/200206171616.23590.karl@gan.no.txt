one of the reasons to use stopwords is to reduce indexsize, so an analyzer 
that doesnt stop words, but stop you from searching on them would give the 
worst of both worlds i think... if size reduction is the reason for wanting 
stopwords it is somewhat contradicting the idea of phase searches...

if you accepts som losses a phases search could still be usefull if the query 
also are passed into the same stopanalyzer.

orgtxt : "nearly all the kings men" stripped for the stopword "the" and "all" 
would perhaps still match a phrase search for "nearly all the kings" if the 
samewords was stripped out of the query as well... i havent tested but it 
sounds logical....
