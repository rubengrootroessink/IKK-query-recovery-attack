you can store the index in blob-fields, but thats about it so far....

the implementation for lucene is pretty straight forward, take a look at the 
contributed GermanAnalyzer. Inside the implementing class you implement 
stopwords, language dependent case switching etc...

When it comes to the english and german analyzers they also perform stemming 
(making "computers" match "computer" and "histories" match "history" etc). 
This requires to create a program that can understand the plurals/singulars 
of Italian. A good start might be to look at http://snowball.sourceforge.net 
as they have a italian stemmer allready.

As lucene works with only the text content for a doc you will have to create a 
spider that retrieves a url, extracts the text and feeds it to lucene, then 
extract the links and process each of these links in the same manner. for 
this you will need a html parser..


happy hacking!
