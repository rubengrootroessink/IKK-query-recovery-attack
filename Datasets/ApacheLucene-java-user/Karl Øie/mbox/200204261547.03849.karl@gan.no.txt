forgot this:

its a bit hard to determine a good number of balance while indexing XML 
documents because the internal relations of a DOM can make a XML document 
become nearly 21 times as big in memory compared to disk (i am not lying, i 
have seen it my self)...

also the RAMDir must be kept in memory while indexing and merging, so checking 
the systems free memory is easier that trying to calculate memoryusage....
