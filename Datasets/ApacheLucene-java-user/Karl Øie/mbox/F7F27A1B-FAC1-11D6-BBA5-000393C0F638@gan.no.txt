SUBJECT: Re: Indexing of documents in memory
DATE: 18 Nov 2002

The org.apache.lucene.store.InputStream is not a _stream_ per see as it 
requires a seek() function and it is therefore not compatible with the 
java.io.InputStream consept, however you can quite easily create a 
java.io.InputStream by grabbing hold of the byte content of a 
org.apache.lucene.store.InputStream and stuff it into a 
java.io.ByteArrayInputStream.

This doesn't make any sense anyhow because the raw bytestream from a 
RAMDirectory will not make any real sense to a HTML parser because the 
content of the RAMDir is an binary index. If you want to store the 
input HTML documents you should store them into a byte or char array in 
a file or database.
