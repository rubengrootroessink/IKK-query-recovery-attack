oh, sorry.. i was perhaps not making me self clear here...

you will have to use the crawler to retrieve the content and store it  
locally for indexing, so you will have to set up your crawler to fetch  
a site and store every html page's content to disk, then run Lucene on  
the locally stored html pages and afterwards delete the html pages...  
you will also need a way to get the original url from the crawler and  
store that in Lucene as well as a keyword field.

a much more efficient way is to get the crawler to get one page, store  
it in memory, run Lucene on it, and then discard the buffer and then  
keep on to the next page.

if you want to take a look at a real lucene+ crawler implementation you  
can check out the Cocoon project at  
http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/index.html :

Lucene integration:

Crawler implementation:

cocoon/components/crawler/

This impl is indexing XML, but the principe is the same...
