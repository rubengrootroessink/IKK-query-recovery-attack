SUBJECT: Re: Get the total term frequency vector of a specific field from the hit results
DATE: 10 Apr 2007

Hello Sengly

First of all you have to make sure, that you create new Fields, which 
you add to a Document, with the appropriate constructor. You have to 
specify the usage of term vectors (Field.TermVector.YES):

new Field("text", "your text...", Field.Store.YES, 
Field.Index.TOKENIZED,Field.TermVector.YES));

Without the explicit storage of the term vectors it is not possible to 
get the term vectors during searching.

Once you build the index, you can use the suggested method 
getTermFreqVector().

To get the top n keywords from the hits object you can iterate over the 
first results.
Here is an example:

            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                int docNumber = hits.id(i);
                TermFreqVector[] termsV = 
ir.getTermFreqVectors(docNumber); //return an array of term frequency 
vectors for the specified document.
                for (int xy = 0; xy < termsV.length; xy++) { //loop over 
all terms-vectors in the current document
                    String[] terms = termsV[xy].getTerms();
                    for (int termsInArray = 0;    termsInArray < 
terms.length; termsInArray++) {                                 
                            //toDo: count the occurrence of the terms
                    }

                }
            }

Hope this helps.
Thomas
