You can adapt the source code of StopAnalyzer.java in the analysis 
package, or I suppose you can use the default constructor with a empty 
stop word list (but please check this).

If you don't know "Luke" use this small tool to display your index and 
verify your index process.

Stop words affect the performance. The seize of the index without stop 
words is much small ( up to 40%), because they occur soo often.
