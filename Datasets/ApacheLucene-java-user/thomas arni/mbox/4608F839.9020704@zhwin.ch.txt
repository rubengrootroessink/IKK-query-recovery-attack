Write your own analyzer, which calls the appropriate Filter in the 
method "tokenStream".
In the method "tokenStream" you can define, how the input should be 
analyzed and parsed.

Your analyzer must extend the abstract class Analyzer. The easiest way 
is to create a new class (Analyzer), which is a simple copy of the 
StandardAnalyzer, and expand it with the appropriate Filter in the 
method "tokenStream".

Hope this helps...
