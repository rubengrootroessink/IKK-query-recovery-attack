I did that, and the benchmark indicates FVH is 10x faster than 
Highlighter now.  I ran with a subset of the wikipedia data since I 
didn't want to deal with the whole thing.  I'm trying to reconcile these 
weirdly varying results.  One difference is that the benchmark doesn't 
use PhraseQueries - I added those and it did make FVH slightly slower, 
but not all that much.  I'll keep digging.
