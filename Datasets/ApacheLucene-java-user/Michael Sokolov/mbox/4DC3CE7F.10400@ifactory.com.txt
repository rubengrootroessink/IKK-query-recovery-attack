I believe creating a large number of fields is not a good match w/the 
underlying architecture, and you'd be better off w/a large number of 
documents/small number of fields, where the same field occurs in every 
document.  There is some discussion here:

 Or do I create only one doc object and reuse it?  With so many Doc/Token pairs, won't searching
the index take a lot more time?
