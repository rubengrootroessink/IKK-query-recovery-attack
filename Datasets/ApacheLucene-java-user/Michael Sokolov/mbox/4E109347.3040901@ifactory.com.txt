You should take a look at org.apache.solr.analysis.MappingCharFilter, 
which provides a generic table-based approach for use with solr.  There 
are also a lot of other interesting CharFilters in the same package.  
For lucene-only use, there's 
org.apache.lucene.analysis.icu.ICUFoldingFilter, which looks very 
promising, and I'm sure there are others I don't know about.
