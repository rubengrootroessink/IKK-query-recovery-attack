So the trick we application developers have learned, is that, at least 
for field-sorted result sets, you can achieve the same effect as deep 
pagination by adding a range filter to your query.  That is, you can't 
page to result number 10000 quickly, but you *can* page quickly to 
results sorting after "M" in a very large alpha-sorted list (for 
example), which is usually better for users anyway.
