I'm not sure, but I'd try

author:dean AND date:[ 20110623 TO 99999999]

the first query, wouldn't it???  I mean it is asking for the same date inclusive and more...why
does Collector.collect never get called like nothing matches....stepping through the Lucene
code, Scorer is null for some reason and it skips collecting everything because of that. 
Any ideas?
