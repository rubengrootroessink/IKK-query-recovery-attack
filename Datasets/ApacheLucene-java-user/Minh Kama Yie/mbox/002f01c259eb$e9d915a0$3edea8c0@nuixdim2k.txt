Dave,

Unfortunately using the "NOT" operator with a single term does not work as
explained in http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html

If you need to do this, create a global index that has the same value for
all documents and use the not operator in addition to this index when
searching.

Subject: Is just "-foo" a valid query?



How do I find all the docs without single term e.g. "what docs do not
mention the word 'foo'".

The query "+foo" returns all docs w/ foo, and one would think that a
search on "-foo" would do the
job, however I get zero docs back when searching like this.
I'm using 1.2.
Is there something wrong w/ the query execution?
