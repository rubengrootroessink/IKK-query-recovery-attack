SUBJECT: Re: Use of explain() vs search()
DATE: 13 Sep 2004

Thanks for the reply Erik.
Sorry about the lateness of this reply; I was out of the office last 
week and it took me a bit to create a stand alone test case today.

I should prefix my statements by saying that I've discovered the problem 
I'm having is with 1.3, and it appears fixed in 1.4.
I also undestand that it is kind of illogical to "explain" a query that 
for a document that isn't returned by the query but nonetheless
I'm looking for confirmation that this is a bug and what can be done to 
fix it in 1.3
In doing so I hope to understand the main differences between explain() 
and search().

The test case is attached in the file LuceneTest.java

Notice that if you search for "currently classifies" in the content 
field and "9" in the id field, you will get 0 hits, but the explanation 
returns a value greater than 0.

Thanks in advance guys,

Minh
