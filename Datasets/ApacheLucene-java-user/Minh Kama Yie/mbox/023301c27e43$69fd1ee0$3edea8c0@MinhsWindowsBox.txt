SUBJECT: Parsing email addresses with StandardTokenizer.
DATE: 28 Oct 2002

Hi all,

Please forgive me if this question has been asked elsewhere but I can't seem to find an answer
for this in the documentation. The code for StandardTokenizer is a little too deep to go into
right now :), so I thought I    'd post to the list first.

If I'm using the standard analyzer, which in turn uses StandardTokenizer, how would the following
email addresses be parsed?

- tom.jones@abc.com
- sheryl@abc.com

If I did a search for "abc.com", which entries should turn up? 
Right now I'm only getting tom.jones@abc.com, and if this is correct then what are the standard
tokenizing rules regarding the "@" sign, and where can I read up on this without looking at
the hexedecimal values in StandardTokenizer? 

I've basically been asked why the document for sheryl@abc.com doesn't turn up in the search
results for "abc.com".

Thanks in advance.

Regards,

Minh Kama Yie
