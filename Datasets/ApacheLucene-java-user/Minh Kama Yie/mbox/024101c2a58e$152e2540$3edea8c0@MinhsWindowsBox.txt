Thanks for that Peter.

Unfortunately I'm not looking for "all" documents but rather documents where
the fields can be empty.
Hence using the universal field wouldn't quite work.
The "empty:true" approach is interesting however it effectively doubles the
number of indexable fields for a document.

Need to assess whether or not we want to support this feature I guess.

Currently, considering Lucene's architecture this feature needs to be
inherently supported rather than worked around with various fields I think
for it to be used/done properly...

Would anyone be able to point me in the general direction of where to look
in the Lucene code to attempt this?
Hopefully this way I can give a proper cost/benefit analysis as to whether
or not to support this feature...and if all goes well, release something
back for the great work you guys do....
