SUBJECT: using NOT in queries and searching using more than one filter
DATE: 9 Aug 2002

Hi guys,

Not to be annoying but I'm still stuck on my problem with "NOT".
It seems that I get a set of (n-2) results for a Query (where 'n' is the total number of documents
indexed) but when I inverse that query, but either:

- putting "NOT " in front of the query and running it through QueryParser OR
- manually creating a BooleanQuery with prohibited as true and required as false.

These actions dont seem to return the "2" documents I'm looking for. They return nothing.

I was wondering if anyone else has come across this problem or can point me in the right direction?

Also, I was wondering if anyone has ever searched using more than one filter at a time to
do searching via IndexSearcher?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,

Minh Kama Yie
