Hi Nader,

Thanks for the quick reply!

Yeah, I read that in the javadoc, but the FAQ seems to say otherwise (it
says to set both prohibited AND required flags).

I have also tried setting only the prohibited flag (as you are suggesting)
but that doesn't return any results either. I have also tried using
QueryParser. I simply added "NOT " in front of my term. That didn't work
either.

I am correct in assuming that my intended NOT query will return 5 rows?

Thanks again.
