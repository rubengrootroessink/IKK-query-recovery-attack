SUBJECT: performing NOT queries

Hi all,

I'm relatively new to Lucene so this question may seem a little obvious but I'm having some
problems which may be a result of a misunderstanding on my part.

A description of my problem is as follows:

I have indexed 30 documents and then create a BooleanQuery as follows:

BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
query.add(QueryParser.parse("myValue", myFieldName, myAnalyzer), true, false);

I then execute it against the indexes and receive 25 documents back.

So I was to then execute the a boolean query constructed like:

BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
query.add(QueryParser.parse("myValue", mFieldName, myAnalyzer), true, true);

I _should_ get the other 5 right?

Am I missing something here?

Thanks in advance guys, you guys do awesome work.

Regards,

Minh Kama Yie
