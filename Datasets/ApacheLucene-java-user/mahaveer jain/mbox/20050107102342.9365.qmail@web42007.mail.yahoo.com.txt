SUBJECT: Duplicate Id
DATE: 7 Jan 2005

Hi,
 
I have a application where I know I will have duplicate ID's. When I search these duplicate
ID's will it search content in both the files ?
 
For Example :
 
Id = Mahaveer, Content = Jain India
Id = Mahaveer, Content = Lucene Test
 
Now when I search for India Test will it return both the columns ? Also can I display unique
results ?
 
Mahaveer
