SUBJECT: Using lucene in Tomcat
DATE: 28 Sep 2004

Hi all,
 
I have implemented lucene search for my documents and db successfully.
 
Now my problem is, the index i created is indexing to my local disk, i want the index to be
created with reference to my server.
 
Right now I index C:/tomcat/webapps/jetspeed/document, but I want to index wrt,  /jetspped/document.
 
Let me know if some one
