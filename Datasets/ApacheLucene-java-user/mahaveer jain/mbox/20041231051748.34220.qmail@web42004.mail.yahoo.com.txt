SUBJECT: Re: Deleting index for DB indexing
DATE: 31 Dec 2004

Thanks Paul,
 
You idea seems to be good. I ll try that. I have one more question. Should the new key what
I create have to be keyword ? or Can it be just a column in the index ?

you need to create your own global ID, I had the same problem (but I
used a MD5 hashvalue). One solution ist to give each of your tables an
internal number and when creating your lucene-documents you add an
additional field with something like "dbInternalId*100+dbNumber" so
that db-record 5 in table 3 results in 503. when documents from your
DB are deleted and you need to update the index you simple create a
term which's value is calculated the same way and delete the document
with the IndexReader.delete(Term)
Instead of calculating you can do string concatenating as well :)
