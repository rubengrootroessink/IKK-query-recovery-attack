SUBJECT: query formulation
DATE: 14 Dec 2010

Hello,
I'm wondering if there is a way to configure the query in lucene to use 
the logical operation ?
In fact, I would like to force retrieval of documents which contain 
obligatory a given keyword or do not contain an other one. I can do that 
by a preprocessing (filter the documents which contain the keyword) but 
I would like to that in the query formulation.
Many thanks
