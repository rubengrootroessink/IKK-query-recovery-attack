Performance varies a lot, and depends upon the number of indexes, the
number of fields, and the CPU/memory configuration.  For myself, a 65Gb
source indexed to 1Gb (or so) returns single term queries (oh yeah, the
query makeup also matters a lot) in sub seconds on a Intel dual
processor (each is 3.6Ghz I think.)  I frankly haven't tested out
scalability yet.

Subject: search performance benchmarks

Hi,
 
I'm evaluating Lucene right now to use as a base for one open source
project. I found some _indexing_ benchmarks on the lucene website
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/benchmarks.html), but, after a short
browsing, couldn't find any 'runtime' performance benchmarks (Query
speed). Only one of the benchmarks contained some reference to the query
execution... Is there any other source of benchmarks I can refer to? Or
probably some heruistic rule that can help to estimate query execution
time?
 
Thanks.
 
Vlad
 
PS: let me know if details of the searched data will help in evaluation
- I'll be able to provide what I know at this point...
