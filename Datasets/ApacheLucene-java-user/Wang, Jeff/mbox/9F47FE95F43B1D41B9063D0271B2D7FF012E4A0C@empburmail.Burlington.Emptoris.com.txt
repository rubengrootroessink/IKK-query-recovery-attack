Heh, you said it better than I.  I was just about to reply with the
witty "Nutch is Lucene, isn't it?"

Asking if Nutch is better then Lucene is like asking if a Truck is
better
then a Combustion Engine -- you can't compare them.  A truck is a
vehicle
tht does stuff, and it gets it's power from a Combustion Engine, but the
engine itself could actually be used to power a great many other things
(not just vehicles)

Lucene is a Java IR Library or a "search library" if you will -- Nutch
uses the Lucene library to power the searching it does, but there is a
lot
of other stuff going on in Butch (crawling for example) ... if you wnat
a
"search engine" then Nutch is your man, if you want a "search library"
then use Lucene directly.
