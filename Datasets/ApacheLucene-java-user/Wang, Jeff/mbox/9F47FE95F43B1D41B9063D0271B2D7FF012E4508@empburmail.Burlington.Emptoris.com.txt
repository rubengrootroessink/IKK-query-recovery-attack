I have a clustered environment, with a load-balancer in the front
assigning connections.  Is it better to have one of the cluster running
a searcher as a webservice (to be accessed by the other machines in the
cluster) or to have a IndexReader/Searcher for each machine in the
cluster?

Also: you should generally try to have a single IndexReader (and 
IndexSearcher using it) that's shared across all "things" that need to 
run searches.
