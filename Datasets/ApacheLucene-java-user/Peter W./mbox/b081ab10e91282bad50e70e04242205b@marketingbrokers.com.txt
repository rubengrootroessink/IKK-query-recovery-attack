Jason,

Thanks, but changing it to '05' or '05L' in the code didn't seem to 
work,
hits.length() still returns 0 when the document should be found.

If you make just one change in the example:

       Hits hits = searcher.search(query);
       //Hits hits = searcher.search(fq);

IndexSearcher finds a match and populates the hits object. The issue 
seems to be in the
filter (which is built using RangeFilter.Less) and the FilteredQuery.

In the RangeFilter class, using 'Less' or 'More' gives you matches 
lower or higher than a set boundary:

Filter filter=RangeFilter.Less("num",NumberTools.longToString(10L));   
// field num < 10
...
FilteredQuery fq = new FilteredQuery(query,filter);

The NumberTools.longToString() method is supposed to replace padding 
leading 0's eliminating string comparison issues.

Hopefully, someone can help.

Peter W.
