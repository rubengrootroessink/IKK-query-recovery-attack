Cool!

The quality of first LIA really shined even for
those familiar with Java but new to assertions
and unit tests. Can't wait to buy LIA2...

Please accept the request to include FieldSelector,
QueryWrapperFilter, Lucli, MemoryIndex, MoreLikeThis,
Payload, ScoreDoc, TermDocs, ValueSourceQuery, facets,
boosting, duplicates, span queries and highlighting stuff.

Even Luke and the other Lucene related projects.

Thanks,

Peter W.
