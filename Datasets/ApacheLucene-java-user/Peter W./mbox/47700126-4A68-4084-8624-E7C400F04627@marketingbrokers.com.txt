Hello,

This is not currently in Lucene.

Sounds like you are looking for a voting
system to generate float scores that would be
inserted as a sortable field at index time.

Gathering user feedback on search results is
hard because you need to introduce a layer
which logs the click then redirects to the
destination.

Try this: Encode your search results with a
unique id which also points to a another app.
Log votes w/app then deliver actual results.

Set a user cookie with each vote and id,
including application logic to help prevent
abuse and/or duplicates.

Next, use your logs to see what was clicked
and generate a float score tally. Prepare a
sortable String, suitable for Lucene indexing
using Numbertools or Numberutils in Solr.

Finally, index all documents with a field
named "votes" and your converted scores.

When it comes to searching, build your
regular query, adding a Sort Object and
passing in an array of SortFields with
"votes" as type SortField.STRING first.

Precedence of sort order kicks in and
your docs with more clicks rank higher.

If everything goes well you will have
results ordered by user generated
scoring.

Regards,

Peter W.
