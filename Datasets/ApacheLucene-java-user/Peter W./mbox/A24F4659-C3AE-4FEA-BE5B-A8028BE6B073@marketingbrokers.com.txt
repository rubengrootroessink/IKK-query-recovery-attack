Xiong,

You have made an excellent point!

It's a choice determined by how you use Sort,
if you need most suitable results pass in:

SortField.FIELD_SCORE
first...

Otherwise, generate all your scores and convert them
to sortable Strings at index time on your  "votes" field.

Then, use this for searches:

Sort srt=new Sort(new SortField[]
{new SortField("votes",SortField.STRING,true),SortField.FIELD_SCORE});

Hits hits=searcher.search(query,srt);

Keep in mind that only presentation level sorting, not Lucene scoring
is changed so results still depend on and are unique for each query.

Utilizing "user feedback to improve search results"  with clickstream
data could be a sub-project in itself. It moves into future areas of
personalization and would be a cool add-on to Lucene.

Hope that helps,

Peter W.
