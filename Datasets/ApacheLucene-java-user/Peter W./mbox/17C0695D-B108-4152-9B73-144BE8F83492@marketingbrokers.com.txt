Dan,

I agree Lucene users are repeatedly solving the same
problems of reading, writing and creating indexes,
building queries, scaling, parsing docs etc.

There's a 'HowTo' section on the Wiki made
for sharing tips and best practices:
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/HowTo

but few new additions are posted...

Regarding 'indexation' Lucene is a text search
engine but not an application server with concepts
of state management or pooling. Tomcat as
a front end might best suit your needs here.

Using regular JSP or servlets you can authenticate
group users and direct their input to appropriate
indexes. This avoids pairing ids to individual
IndexSearcher, IndexReader, IndexWriter
instances yourself.

No stacks, queues or linked hashmaps, just:
authenticate > group id > create session.

Contents of the url string or cookie-based session object
determine which Lucene index user data is written to.

Another option to consider is Solr.

Regards,

Peter W.
