Hello,

This snippet may help to understand TopDocs:

http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-general/200508.mbox/% 
3C430CD197.6080609@apache.org%3E

Also, paging through Lucene results is 'do-it-yourself' exercise using
hits.length() until someone contributes a good implementation.

Oversimplifying, if you want 10 hits per page:

hitsperpage equals ten;

-if hits length is less than ten, you have one page
-else if hits length/hitsperpage modulos is 0, that's your pagecount
-else hits length/hitsperpage is your pagecount, modulos is for your  
last page

You will also need a variable to keep track of which page you are on  
and a static
method which returns min/max values to be included in your iteration  
loop.

You can also see my previous attempt at solving this:
