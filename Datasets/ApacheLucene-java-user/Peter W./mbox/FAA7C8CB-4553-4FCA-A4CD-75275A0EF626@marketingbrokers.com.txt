Hello,

Lucene gives the best documents for a given query and PageRank uses  
citation
analysis with similar results but requires a large set of metadata to  
complete.

Scoring in Lucene delivers pure search while PageRank attempts to  
establish source authority.
I''m not strong in math, those who are can find an explanation of the  
latter here:
