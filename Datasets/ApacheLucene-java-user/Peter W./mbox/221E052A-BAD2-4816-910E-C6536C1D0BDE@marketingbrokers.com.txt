Hoss,

My Lucene scaling strategy involves creating
numerous indexes, so I was looking for a way
to read them in together for quickness.

For those interested, your suggestion of using a
single IndexSearcher on a MultiReader works well
by itself.

Or, you can still place in memory like this:

IndexReader[] indexr_a=
            {
            IndexReader.open(new RAMDirectory(index_one_path)),
            IndexReader.open(new RAMDirectory(index_two_path)),
            IndexReader.open(new RAMDirectory(index_three_path)),
            IndexReader.open(new RAMDirectory(index_n_path))
            };

          MultiReader mr=new MultiReader(indexr_a);
          IndexSearcher is=new IndexSearcher(mr);

Regards,

Peter W.
