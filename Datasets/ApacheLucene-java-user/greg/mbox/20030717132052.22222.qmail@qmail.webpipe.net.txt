SUBJECT: interesting phrase query issue
DATE: 17 Jul 2003

I have several document sections that are being indexed via the 
StandardAnalyzer.  One of these documents has the line "access, the 
manager".  When searching for the phrase "access manager", this document is 
being returned.  I understand why (at least i think i do), because a stop 
word is "the" and the "," is being removed by the tokenizer, my question is 
is there any way I can avoid having this returned in the results?  My 
thoughts were to create a new analyzer that indexes the word "the" (blick to 
many of those), or index the "," in some way (also not good).  Any 
suggestions? 

Thanks, 

Greg T Robertson
