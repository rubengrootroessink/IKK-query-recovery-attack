Steve, 

This is great stuff.  IMHO this should be the default behaviour - especially 
coming from someone who is new to Lucene.  I can not tell you how surprised 
i was when someone searched for a phrase and it was returned  but did not 
exist in the document except as "access, the manager".  Your patch really 
did the job. 

Thanks again, 

Greg T Robertson
