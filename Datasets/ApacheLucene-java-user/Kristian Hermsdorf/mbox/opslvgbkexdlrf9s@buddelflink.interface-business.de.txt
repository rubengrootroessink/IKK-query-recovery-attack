pdftotext is able to produce html output which contains these metadata as well.
Conversion from pdf to html and parsing html is (with our tests) still twice as fast as PDFBox.

That's courious beacause we experienced that pdftotext was able to convert 33% more pdf documents
than PDFBox.

That's good. Out application supports alternative conversion pipelines that provide fallback
mechanims. If the first converter cannot convert a document a second converter is called.
So PDFBox is our fallback converter.
