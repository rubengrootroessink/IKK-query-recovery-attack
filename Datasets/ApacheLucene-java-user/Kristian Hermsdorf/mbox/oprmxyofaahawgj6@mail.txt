SUBJECT: Re: Problems on massive indexing
DATE: 1 Apr 2003

Hi
 
I also got the IndexOutOfBoundException while optimizing the index (index- 
size about 1GB, 50 Docs with 25 fields each).
(optimizing was called via merging of RamDirectoy to FSDirectory).
The problem was that the FieldsReader tried to read more fields than 
existed ... .I've no glue how to fix it ...
 
bye
 
Kristian
