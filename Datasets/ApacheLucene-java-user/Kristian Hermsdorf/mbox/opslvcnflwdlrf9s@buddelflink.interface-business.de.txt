you've got to read the processes stdout and stderr while the process is running. If you don't
read those streams the process will block after it wrote some (about 8k) bytes to ist's stdout/stderr.

We're using pdftotext as well, because PDFbox ist really slow. If your application should
work under Windows you will probably experiance some mystic Java-VM crashes while executing
external processes in batch-mode. (This is because of a bug in Windows-VM... we implemented
out own Process with JNI to compensate this bug).

Greetings,
Kristian
