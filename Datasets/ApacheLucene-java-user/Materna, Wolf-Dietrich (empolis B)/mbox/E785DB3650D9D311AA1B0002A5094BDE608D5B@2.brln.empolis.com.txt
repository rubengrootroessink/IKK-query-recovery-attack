You can use the IndexReader to access all terms or documents. It is used
by the IndexSearcher to read the index.
You should change the QueryParser to allow * as Wildcard-Query and extend
the IndexSearcher to return all documents for this special query.

You can also try to create a RangeQuery with lowest and highest term as
bound,
e.g. [0 zzzzzzz], but this is probaly slower.
