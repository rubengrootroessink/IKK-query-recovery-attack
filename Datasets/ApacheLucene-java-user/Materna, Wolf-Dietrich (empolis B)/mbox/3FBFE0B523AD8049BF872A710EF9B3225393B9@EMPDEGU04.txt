Wildcards at the beginning of a term are not supported. Lucene use the first
characters to speedup the search for matching terms (== words). So the query
parser doesn't accept you query. (Afterwise lucene has to examine all terms
and this would be very slow).
You may use a second field to store the url as invered string, e.g.
invurl: moc.halb.www and search for invurl:moc.halb.* instead.
Checkout the archives for both mailing lists (lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org
and lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org). IRC there are other proposals discussed
serveral time ago to workaround this limit.
