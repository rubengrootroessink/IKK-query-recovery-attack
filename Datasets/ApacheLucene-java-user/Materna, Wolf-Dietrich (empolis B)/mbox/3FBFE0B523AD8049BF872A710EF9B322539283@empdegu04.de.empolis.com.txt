This is very slow in most cases. Imagine: lucene has to copy all documents
after the deleted one to a new segment (= partial index). All data are
stored
on hard disk, so this requires a lot of times for larger indexes.

Looping  0 to maxDoc() and use IndexReader.isDeleted(int docID) to check,
if the document is deleted, is a better solution.
