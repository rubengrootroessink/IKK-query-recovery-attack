Did you read the manual
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html ?
It doesn't explain all details, but you can also create a small test index
and try it out.

No, it matches only "23". If you want to get all numbers starting with "23"
append a *.

Same answer. You will get only results containing "toast", but not
"toaster".
Beware if you use an analyzer with a stemmer, then the analyzer will handle
"toasted", "toasting" and other forms as "toast".
The StandardAnalyzer doesn't perform stemming, so you'll get, what you need.
