SUBJECT: Match all documents with non empty field
DATE: 2 Jul 2008

Hi,

Can't seem to wrap my head around how to go about it.

I want to retrieve all documents where a certain field in not empty.

What would be the best way to do it?

Should I search with a MatchAllDocQuery and a Filter?

Should I go through all terms in the field and create a TermQuery with it?

Many thanks.

Patrick
