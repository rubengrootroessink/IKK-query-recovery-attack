SUBJECT: Calculating term and document frequency for multiple word terms
DATE: 10 Apr 2006

Hi,
I was wondering how I can get the document frequency and term
frequency of a phrase in a corpus. I am currently  using


IndexReader rd = IndexReader.open("C:\\Documents and
Settings\\Owner\\My Documents\\Thesis\\luceneTest\\index");
Term t1 = new Term("contents","\"increases aesthetic\"");
TermDocs  tdTest2= rd.termDocs(t1);
while(tdTest2.next() )
		{

		System.out.println(tdTest2.freq()  ) ;		
		}	
		



This seems to work for a single word term such as "increases", but not
for multiple word terms such as "increases aesthetic".

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.


Kind Regards
Vishal Bathija
