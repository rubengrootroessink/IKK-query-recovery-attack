SUBJECT: Build Lucene maven artifacts
DATE: 14 Mar 2008

Hi,

I've looked around (mailing lists, jira) and I can't seem to find
information about how to generate maven artifacts, especially for
contrib.

I mean, I can get lucene from the maven repo, and I know I have to
build the contrib for myself.
But I kind of hoped I would be able to deploy contrib locally without
having to create all the pom.xml files.

Another way to put my question (not being sure it is clear) is : what
should the "generate-maven-artifacts" ant task be used for? And where
can I get the latest version of the *.pom.template files?

Many thanks.

Patrick
