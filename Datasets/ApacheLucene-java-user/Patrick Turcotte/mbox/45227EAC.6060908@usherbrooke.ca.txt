SUBJECT: QueryParser syntax French Operator
DATE: 3 Oct 2006

Hi,

Is there a way to add / replace the text for the boolean operators used
by the query parser?

We would like to replace (or even better, add), "AND", "OR" and "NOT" by
"ET", "OU" and "SAUF".

Is there a way to configure the QueryParser to do it?

We know we could always modify QueryParser.jj to add them to the list,
but we'd rather like not to have to recompile/rejar each time there is a
new version of Lucene.

Thanks
