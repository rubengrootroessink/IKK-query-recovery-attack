Of course, it depends on the kind of query you are doing, but (I did
find the query parser in the mean time)

MultiFieldQueryParser mfqp = new MultiFieldQueryParser(useFields,
analyzer, boosts);
where analyzer can be a PerFieldAnalyzer
followed by
Query query = mfqp.parse(queryString);
would do the trick quite simply.
