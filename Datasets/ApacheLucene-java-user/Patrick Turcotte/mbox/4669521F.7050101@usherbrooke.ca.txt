SUBJECT: Re: How to implement AJAX search~Lucene Search part?
DATE: 8 Jun 2007

Hi,

What we did was this:

1) When you application starts, it scans the index for terms values and
store them in a map or something.

2) When you receive "ajax requests", you compare with the map data and
return the relevant part. Works quite fast for us, without round trips
to Lucene.
