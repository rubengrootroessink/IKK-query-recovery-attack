SUBJECT: Basic searching doubt
DATE: 31 Oct 2009

Hi,

If I search for string "A B" (i.e. A followed by a space followed by B) and I get 20 hits,
then is it correct to expect that if I search for "A" (i.e. only A), I will get at least 20
hit or more? Similarly for if I search for B, I will get 20 hits or more?
