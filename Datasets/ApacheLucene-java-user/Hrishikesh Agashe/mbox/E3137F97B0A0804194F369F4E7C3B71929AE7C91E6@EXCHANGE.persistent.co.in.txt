Thanks Jake. 

I have around 75 TB data to be indexed. So even though I do the sharding, individual index
file size might still be pretty high. And that's why I wanted to find out whether there is
any limit as such. And obviously whether such a huge index files can be searched at all.

>From your response it appears that 1 TB of 1 index file is too much. Is there any guideline
to what kind of hardware will be required to handle (10GB, 50GB, 100GB, 500GB etc) size of
index file (with sensible search times)

Leaving aside the question of hardware or JVM limits on monstrous files,
this question (can you search this file) is easier: if you've got say, a ten
billion documents in one index, and you have a query which is going to hit
maybe even just 0.1% of the documents, you'll need to do scoring of 10
million hits in the course of that query.  To do this in under a second
means you only have 100 nanoseconds to look at each document.  If your query
hits 1% of your documents, you're down to 10 ns per document.  I've never
tried searching a 1TB index, but I'd say that's pushing it.

Is there a reason you can't shard your index, and instead put maybe 20
shards of 50GB (or better - 100 shards of 10GB) each on a variety of
machines, and just merge results?
