Simon and Eric, thanks for the reply.

I want to create multiple indexes depending on the data present. Like if month of record is
Nov, I want to add it in index for November. If it's October, add it in index for October.
I don't want to open and close indexes so many times so just maintaining IndexWriters for
months in HashMap.
Is there better way of doing this?

In general you should only use one single writer and use it with
multiple threads. IndexWriter is optimized for concurrency and fully
thread-safe. Is that what you trying to achieve?

otherwise I would 100% agree with eric not knowing of a use-case.
