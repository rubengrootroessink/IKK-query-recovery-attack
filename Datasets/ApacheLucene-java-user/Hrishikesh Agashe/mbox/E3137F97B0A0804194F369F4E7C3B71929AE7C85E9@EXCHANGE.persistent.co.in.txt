SUBJECT: Maximum index file size
DATE: 22 Oct 2009

Hi,

I am running Ubuntu 9.04 on 64 bit machine with NAS of 100 TB capacity. JVM is running with
2.5 GB Xmx.

Can I create an index file with very large size, like 1 TB or so? Is there any limit on how
large index file one can create? Also, will I be able to search on this 1 TB index file at
all?

TIA,
--Hrishi
