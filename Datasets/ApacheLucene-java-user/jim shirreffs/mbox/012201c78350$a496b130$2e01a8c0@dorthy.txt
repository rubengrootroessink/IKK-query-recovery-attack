SUBJECT: Can indexing logic on one host update an index on another host?

Can indexing logic on one host update an index on another host?

In my application the files I wish to index/search live in distributed 
vaults on "safe" hosts in the intranet. Accessing those files is strictly 
controller by application logic in a (Tomcat) servlet.

Crawling the vaults is not an option.

Now what would be nice is if I could have the servlet that manages a vault 
index new files as they are added to the vault. Unfortunately the index 
lives on the main application server not the vault. So some how I need to be 
able to index files on the vault host as they are added but update the 
master index on the main application host.

I read blurbs about merge and think maybe I might be able to do something 
with that, but I am unsure how that would work or if there is another way.

Any ideas, suggestions would be very much appreciated.
