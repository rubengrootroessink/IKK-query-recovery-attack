Thanks for the advice, I just don't see where in the Lucene code I should 
plug OOParcer into Lucene.

I've walked the code in LIUS and Nutch (moving on to Solr) trying to find 
common objects. If I can find common objects in Lucene and Nutch I'll know 
where to plug in.


Lucene Objects looks like this

IndexWriter
                        Analyzer
                            StandardAnalyzer
                        Document
                            Reader
                                FileReader
                                StringReader
                        DocumentWriter


But when I search thru the Nutch or LIUS code I can not find these objects. 
LIUS uses reflection so I'm not going to find anything in the code, but 
unforturnately the liusConfig.xml is incomplete and I can not find the class 
names for the OpenOffice stuff in it.

This is all very frustrating since it should be a realatively easy to add 
support for unsupported formats. The Lucene code is very nice, lius code 
less so. Seems Lucene is setup to drop in new file formats I just do not 
know where to drop it in or what kind of objects need to be dropped in.

Oh well guess I will code up a Reader the just spites out "Here I am" a few 
hundred times and see what happens. LOL.


thank you for the reply and advice.
