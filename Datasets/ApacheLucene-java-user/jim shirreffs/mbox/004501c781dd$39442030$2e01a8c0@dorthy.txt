Hi, I have been using Lucene "out of the box" since 1.4.3, wonderful full 
text engine, I love it.

But I can't use it "out of the box" any more, I am going to have to write 
some code (Oh no! Mr Bill.). I am fairly certain that the code needed will 
be trivial, but I am unfamiliar with Lucene's API and certainly could use 
some good advice. Maybe even a few sample lines of code J

The documents I am indexing into Lucene all have an integer unique ID 
(21345). This ID is not and will not be in the document context. But I need 
to the able to retrieve from Lucene the document ID. I know the document ID 
at index time so I can tell the indexer what the ID is except I do not know 
how to do that. Reading faq/wiki it seems that I can define a field called 
documentID and add that to the index but I can not find any sample code to 
do this that I could use as a guide. If some could show me how to use fields 
add/retrieve (assuming that is the correct way to go) I would greatly 
appreciate it.



thanks in advance jim s
