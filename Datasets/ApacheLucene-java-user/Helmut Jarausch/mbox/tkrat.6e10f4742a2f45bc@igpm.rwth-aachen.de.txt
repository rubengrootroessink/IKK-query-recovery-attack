SUBJECT: highlighter with PhraseQuery = limitation?
DATE: 14 Dec 2007

Hi,

When highlighting a phrase query like
"Erik Hatcher"
all instances of "Eric" as well as all instances
of "Hatcher" are highlighted even if they are
not next to each other.

Is this a limitation of highlighting with Lucene?

Many thanks for an explanation,
Helmut.
