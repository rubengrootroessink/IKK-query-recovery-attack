SUBJECT: Query.rewrite - help me to understand it
DATE: 13 Dec 2007

Hi,

since I need highlighting, I need to 'rewrite' a query.
Query.rewrite  takes an object of type IndexReader

But what for?

As I understand it, rewrite transforms a possibly complicated
query into an simplified (internal?) form which is (unfortunately)
needed by QueryScorer which is in turn need by Highlighter.

What does Query.rewrite do and why does it need access to the
index?

Many thanks for an explanation,
Helmut.
