SUBJECT: How to say Thank You ?
DATE: 17 Dec 2007

Hi,

I have got invaluable help from several people of this list.
Unfortunately I couldn't guess the email of some of you.

So, many thanks to all who have helped me.
Merry Christmas and a Hapy New Year to you all.

(Perhaps someone comes up with a means to say 'thank you'
without 'polluting' the list for that and without
sacrificing privacy of the email addresses.)

Helmut.
