Hi all,

I am having issues building Lucene and Solr from svn checkout. I had this
problem earlier but I was able to figure out the combination of ant and
maven-ant-tasks that worked. Last few months I've been building with Ant
1.8.1 and maven-ant-tasks 2.1.1 (I had always has ant 1.8.1 but an old
version of maven ant tasks and it would not build. I would get errors about
it not finding poms and those errors went away with the right version of ant
tasks).

Similar problem is occurring today (generate-maven-artifacts specifically)
and I suspect it has to do with this combination. I checked the hudson
report to see that Lucene build uses Ant 1.7.0. A short answer could
possibly solve this problem. What's the maven ant tasks version it is
using?

Could we please publish this information somewhere? Because it is clear that
"any" ant version higher than 1.6.3 is not the solution. And it sure needs a
specific version of maven ant tasks to work.

Thanks,
Pradeep
