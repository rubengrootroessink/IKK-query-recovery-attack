Dominique, look at LUCENE-400 issue in JIRA, that will help.  It will be in Lucene 2.4.

Subject: Use Lucene in order to generate tag cloud

Hi,

 

Does anybody know an implementation of Lucene in order to generate tag
clouds.

 

The idea is to index some documents in a temporary index in order to
 find
most frequent 1-term, 2-terms and 3-terms sequences.

 

Stop word list will eliminate common words.

Ideally, terms like “driver”, “drivers” will generate only on
 term in the
cloud. 

Snowball Analyzer may help, but how get back the best original term for
 a
stem ?

 

Thank for your idea

 

Dominique
