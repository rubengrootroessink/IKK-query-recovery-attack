Vivek - exactly, all of those are good reasons for index partitioning.  In addition, think
about how much of a huge index will be able to fit in RAM/FS buffers of a single server? 
At some point you'll have to spread your index over N servers.

Thanks 
Otis 
for 
your 
response. 
I've 
few 
more 
questions,

1) 
Is 
it 
recommended 
to 
do 
index 
partitioning 
for 
large 
indexes?
  
  
  
 
- 
We 
index 
around 
35 
fields 
(storing 
only 
two 
of 
them 
- 
simple 
ids)
  
  
  
 
- 
Each 
document 
is 
around 
200 
bytes
  
  
  
 
- 
Our 
index 
grows 
to 
around 
50G 
a 
week

2) 
The 
reason 
I 
could 
think 
for 
partitioning 
would 
be,
  
  
  
- 
optimization 
would 
be 
faster 
on 
smaller 
indexes
  
  
  
- 
search 
would 
be 
faster 
if 
I 
have 
to 
search 
only 
on 
specific 
partition
  
  
  
- 
I 
would 
be 
able 
to 
archive 
old 
partitions
  
  
  
- 
Even 
if 
a 
partition 
gets 
corrupt 
I 
wouldn't 
lose 
all 
data

  
  
Is 
this 
correct? 
Are 
there 
any 
other 
reasons?

Thanks,
-vivek

You

a

if 
that

what 
you

But 
you

weekly 
indices)

one

archive 
the 
one
