George,

You may want to subscribe to java-dev or just look through the java-dev archives to see how
Lucene releases come about.  Let me try re-enacting it.

dev 1: What do people think about a X.Y release?
group: Sure, why not, looks like we have enough changes, some bug fixes, some performance
improvements, ok, let's
dev 1: Ok, I'll make a release in the next few days....

dev 1 then does the svn branching, updating the version number in build.xml, compiling, jaring,
signing, pushing to appropriate machines, etc., announces on java-dev, waits for the mirrors
to get a copy of the new release, and finally announces it on java-user.

The point is that releases are not planned ahead of time, so we can never tell which files
that have been modified between, say, X.Y and X.Y.Z release.  We know that only when the release
is made.  In short, if you don't want to or can't port in "real-time", you have to wait for
the release to be made, and then start work on your new release.

Otis

Hi Steven and all,

(Sorry for the late response.)

This is all fine, but here is my problem with not having a way of knowing
what makes up 2.0.1.

I have ported 2.0 from Java to C#.  I used the packaged (ZIP download) of
Lucene 2.0 as my port point.  Now, it's time for me to port 2.0.1 to C#.  To
do so, I need to run a diff between 2.0 and 2.0.1 -- how do I go about doing
the diff when I don't know what makes up 2.0.1?  Can I get the list of files
that make up 2.0.1 from SVN?  If so, how?  Is what's in the trunk of Lucene
makes up 2.0.1 or 2.1?  (Sorry, I am not fluent with SVN.)

Regards,

-- George

I think the idea is that 2.0.1 would be a patch-fix release from the branch
created at 2.0 release. This release would incorporate only back-ported
high-impact patches, where "high-impact" is defined by the community.
Certainly security vulnerabilities would be included. As Otis said, to date,
nobody seems to have raised any issues to that level.

2.1 will include all the patches and new features that have been committed
since 2.0; there've been a number of these. But releases are done pretty ad
hoc at this point and there hasn't been anyone that has expressed strong
interest in (i.e., lobbied for) a release.

There was a little discussion on this topic at the ApacheCon BOF. For a
number of reasons, the Lucene Java trunk has been kept "pretty stable", with
a relatively few number of large changes. This makes it relatively safe for
people to grab a snapshot of the trunk with less concern about latent bugs.
I don't know how many people/projects are doing this rather than sticking
with 2.0.

Keeping the trunk stable doesn't provide an obvious place to start working
on things that people may want to work on and share but at the same time
want to allow to percolate for a while. I think the concern is that if we
start doing this stuff on trunk now, people that are accustomed to snapping
from the trunk might be surprised, and not in a good way. Nobody wants that.

So releases can be about both what people want (getting features out) and
allowing a bit more instability in trunk. That is, if the community wants
that.

Food for thought and/or discussion?

Thanks for the reply Otis.

I looked at the CHANGES.txt file and saw quit a bit of changes.  For my port
from Java to C#, I can't rely on the trunk code as it is (to my
knowledge)
changes on a monthly basic if not weekly.  What I need is an official
release so that I can use it as the port point.

Regards,

I'd have to check CHANGES.txt, but I don't think that many bugs have been
fixed and not that many new features added that anyone is itching for a new
release.

Hi folks,

Sorry for reposting this question (see original email below) and this time
to both mailing list.

If anyone can tell me what is the plan for Lucene 2.0.1 release, I would
appreciate it very much.

As some of you may know, I am the porter of Lucene to Lucene.Net knowing
when 2.0.1 will be released will help me plan things out.

Regards,

-- George Aroush
