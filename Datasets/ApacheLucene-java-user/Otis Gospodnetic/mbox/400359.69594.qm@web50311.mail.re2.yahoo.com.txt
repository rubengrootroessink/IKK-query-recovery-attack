Hi,

Have a look at MoreLikeThis:

[otis@localhost trunk]$ ff \*MoreLikeThis\*.java
./contrib/queries/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/similar/MoreLikeThisQuery.java
./contrib/queries/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/similar/MoreLikeThis.java


I think that or something a lot like it is what you are after.
