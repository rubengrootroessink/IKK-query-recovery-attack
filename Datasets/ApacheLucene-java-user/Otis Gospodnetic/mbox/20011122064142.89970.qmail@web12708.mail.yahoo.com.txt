SUBJECT: Efficient document spooling and indexing

Hello,

This is from a thread from about 2 weeks ago.
What is the answer to this question?
If data is written to disk only when IndexWriter's close() is called,
wouldn't the sample code below be as efficient as the sample code that
uses RAMDirectory, further down?

Thanks,
Otis

When using the FSWriter, the actual file io doesn't occur until I close
the writer, right?  So wouldn't it be just as efficient to do the
following:

IndexWriter fsWriter = new IndexWriter(new File(...), analyzer, false);
  while (... more docs to index...)
    ... add 100,000 docs to fsWriter ...
  }
  fsWriter.optimize();
  fsWriter.close();

Well, I don't know if there's an archive of the list, so this what Doug

  fsWriter.close();
