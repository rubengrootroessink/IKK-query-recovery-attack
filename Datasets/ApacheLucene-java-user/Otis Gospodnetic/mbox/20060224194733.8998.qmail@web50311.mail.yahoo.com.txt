Hi Revati,

If you have Lucene in Action, look at Chapter 2, ection 2.7 - http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=index+performance+control
If you don't have LIA, look at IndexWriter class and its mergeFactor and maxBufferedDocs parameters.
 You can also look for my article about indexing with Lucene (link in the Wiki), which includes
code for playing with various parameters and explains what's going on, etc.

Indexing performance incase of large file structure.?
