For the Lucene book I wrote some test cases that compare FSDirectory
and RAMDirectory.  What I found was that with certain settings
FSDirectory was almost as fast as RAMDirectory.  Personally, I would
push FSDirectory and hope that the OS and the Filesystem do their share
of work and caching for me before looking for ways to optimize my code.
