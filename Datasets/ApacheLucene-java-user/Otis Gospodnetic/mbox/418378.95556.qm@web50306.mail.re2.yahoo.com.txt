I think those doc-oriented DBs tend to be distributed, with replication built-in and such,
but yes, in some way the schemaless DB with docs and fields (whether they are pumped in as
JSON or XML or Java objects) feels the same.  I saw something from Grant about 2 months ago
how Lucene is "nosql-ish".
