SUBJECT: Re: Performance difference between 1.2 and 1.3?
DATE: 29 Jan 2004

Hello,

This is not a known problem.
The mention of Cocoon makes me think XML.
What format are your documents in?
If they are in XML, the first place to look for performance-related
problems is the XML parser.  It looks like you got a new version of
Cocoon, so maybe this new version includes a different (version of a)
XML parser.
