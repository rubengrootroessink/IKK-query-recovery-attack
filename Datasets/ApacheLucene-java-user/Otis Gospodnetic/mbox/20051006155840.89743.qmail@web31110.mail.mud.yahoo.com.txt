This is a question for java-user@ list, not java-dev@

Hello Shadab,

You need to make your application perform the "primary key"-like logic.
 It can, for instance, look in the index first, before adding a
document, using a field designated to be the PK.  If it finds an
existing document, delete it before re-adding it.
