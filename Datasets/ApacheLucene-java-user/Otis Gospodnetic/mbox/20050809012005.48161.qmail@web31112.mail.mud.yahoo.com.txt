Yes, that would be handy, as lots of people have applications that use
both Lucene and a RDBMS and use various tricks to keep the two in sync.
 If an application uses Hibernate, then one can make use of various
Hibernate interceptors and use them to trigger operations on an
external Lucene index.  I know at least one application that does
something similar (see my .signature).
