Hello Ebrahim,

Like Erik said, the book about Lucene is coming soon.  Although it
won't be free, Erik, I, and a few other people already shared some of
our knowledge about Lucene in several articles about Lucene.  There is
a page on the Lucene Wiki that has links to all known Lucene articles. 
I suggest you take a look at those while we finish Lucene in Action.

Otis
