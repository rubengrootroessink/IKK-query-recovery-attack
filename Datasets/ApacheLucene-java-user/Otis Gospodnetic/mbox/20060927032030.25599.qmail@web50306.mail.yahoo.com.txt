The code works with Lucene 2.0, I've used it.  However, it did change slightly.  If you look
in JIRA you'll find some comments about it.  If I recall correctly, some changes I made to
LuceneDictionary(?) class now require the index directory to exist....I think.

Does anyone have sample code on how to build a dictionary?

I found this article online and but it uses version 1.4.3 and it doesn't seem to work on 2.0.0:
 http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/08/09/didyoumean.html?page=1

Here's the code I have:

indexReader = IndexReader.open(originalIndexDirectory);
Dictionary dictionary = new LuceneDictionary(indexReader, "experience_desired");
SpellChecker spellChckr = new SpellChecker(spellIndexDirectory);
spellChckr.indexDictionary(dictionary);
I'm getting a null pointer exception when I call indexDirectory().  
Here's how I index the field "experience_desired": 
doc.add(new Field("experience_desired", value, Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
Is there another way I should do it so there is a way to build a dictionary on that field?

Thanks
