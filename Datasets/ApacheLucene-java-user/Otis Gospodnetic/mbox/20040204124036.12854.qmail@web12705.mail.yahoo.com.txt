SUBJECT: RE: weblogic cluster, index on NFS and locking problem
DATE: 4 Feb 2004

The best way to submit contributions is via Bugzilla.
For instance, here is the current queue of contributed code, patches,
etc.:
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&email1=&emailtype1=substring&emailassigned_to1=1&email2=&emailtype2=substring&emailreporter2=1&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&changedin=&votes=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&product=Lucene&short_desc=%5BPATCH%5D&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&long_desc=&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&keywords=&keywords_type=anywords&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=&cmdtype=doit&order=%27Importance%27

The process consists of:
- opening a Bugzilla account
- Opening a 'bug' in Bugzilla with the Subject that starts with
"[PATCH]"
- Attaching the contribution (as ZIP of patches or as diff -u style
patch, if it's a smaller patch)

Thanks,
Otis
