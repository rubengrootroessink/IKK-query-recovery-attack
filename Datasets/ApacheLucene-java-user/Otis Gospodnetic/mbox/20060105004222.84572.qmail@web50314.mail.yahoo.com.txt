Jeff, look at Nutch.  I believe somebody contributed a piece of code that does this and documented

Subject: Lucene and geo queries

I'm very interested in incorporating smart geographic querying capabilities
(distance calcs are just scratching the surface) into Lucene and came across
this whitepaper:

Just curious, has anyone ventured down this path?

cheers,
j
