Increase maxBufferedDocs as much as you can (the more RAM the better).
Increase max heap for the JVM (-Xmx).
If you are on UNIX, increase the max open file descriptors limits and then increase mergeFactor
somewhat, say 100.
User -server mode for the JVM.
Don't worry about RAMDir, those guys who wrote Lucene in Action were smoking something when
they wrote that section. ;)
Don't tokenize fields if you don't have to.
Don't store term vectors if you don't need them.

I never got to index all the data but it is too slow. 
I got 3 million in 2,5 hours.

As suggested in Lucene in Action, I use ramDir and after I write 5000
documents I merge them to the fsDir.

The merge factor is now 100 I tried other variations but didn't make much
difference.

Hi Alice,

Can you define slow (hours, days, months and on what hardware)?  Have  
you done any profiling, etc. to see where the bottlenecks are?  What  
size documents are you talking about here?  What are your merge  
factors, etc.?

Thanks,
Grant
