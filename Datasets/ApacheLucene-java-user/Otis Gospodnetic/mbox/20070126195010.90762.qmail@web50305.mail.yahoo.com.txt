Funny, I was looking to do the same thing the other day and gave up thinking it wasn't possible,
not being aware of setOmitNorms().  Yeah, a javadoc patch would be welcome.

Thanks! I wasn't aware of this method. It's exactly what I needed.

I never thought of trying to modify the Field after construction...
Perhaps the NO_NORMS javadoc should refer to setOmitNorms()? (Or I should
learn to search the documentation better :-)).
