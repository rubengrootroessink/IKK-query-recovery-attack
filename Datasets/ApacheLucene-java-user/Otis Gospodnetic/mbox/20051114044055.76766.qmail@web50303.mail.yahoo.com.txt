Largest index?  Who knows! :)
Lucene's internal limit is the size of the doc Id (max Integer).

People typically roll their indices when they reach a certain size, but
if you don't need your queries to be fast and always need all the data,
then this may not make sense for you (well, it still may, as you can
distribute such indices over multiple machines and query them in
parallel, aggregating the results).

What to expect?  Slower queries, longer optimization, more disk space,
higher memory usage (larget .tii read in memory), the usual stuff.
