Bok Igor,

For the first use case, you are really looking for what's called a
Forward Index.  If my memory serves me well, there was a project that
used Lucene at MIT called Haystack, and its author developed code that
worked with Lucene and created forward indices.  I never actually tried
it.

If that doesn't do it for you, see this:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#getTermFreqVectors(int)

For the second use case - well, that is precisely what Lucene does. :)

It sounds like you are going in the right direction.  I suggest reading
a few Lucene articles (links on the Lucene Wiki) to get started.
