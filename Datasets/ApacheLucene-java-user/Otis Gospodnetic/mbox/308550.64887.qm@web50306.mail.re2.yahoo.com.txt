SUBJECT: Re: TermsFilter instead of "should" TermQueries
DATE: 9 May 2010

I think what Tomislav was trying to ask is:

Can filters replace only strictly boolean clauses (i.e. only MUST and MUST_NOT), such as:
+gender:F, -rating:xxx)?
Or can filters also replace SHOULD clauses, such as: food:banana (which is neither absolutely
required or strictly prohibited)?

If this doesn't speak to your question, can you ask for
