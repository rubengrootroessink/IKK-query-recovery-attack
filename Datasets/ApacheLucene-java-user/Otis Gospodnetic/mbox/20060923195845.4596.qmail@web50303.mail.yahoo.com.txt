: I'm pretty sure you have to count them yourself, but that's made pretty easy
: by the TermEnum, TermFreqVector etc. classes. I have only used a few of
: these, so I can't be much help. But these sure seem like what you're looking
: for.

TermEnum has a docFreq member .. so you can iterate over it and record the
terms with the N highest docFreq using something like a PriorityQueue
