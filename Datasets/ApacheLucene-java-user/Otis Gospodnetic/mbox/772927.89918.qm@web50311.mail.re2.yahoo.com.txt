Trust Yonik, and trust me when I say this, please.

I, too, would guess that you'll need more than 1 machine (that's what Yonik meant by distributed
search) to handle search against a 2B doc index, even if docs are small.

Hm, 2 billion small docs are not so much.
Why do I need distributed search and what exactly do you means with
distributed search? Multiple IndexSearchers? Multiple processes? Multiple
machines?
