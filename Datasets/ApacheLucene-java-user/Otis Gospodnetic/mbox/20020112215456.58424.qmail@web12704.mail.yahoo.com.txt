Hello,

You could write an XML parser (see http://xml.apache.org/ for some XML
tools) and store XML elements as Fields in Lucene Documents.
To search for 'Hello' and 'Hello Mr. President!' you can store the
whole article body as a Text (or maybe UnStored) Field.
You can also look on www.mail-archive.com and search this list's
archive for some related discussions.  Try searching for Philip Ogren
(I think I got the name right), he sent some code that lets you go from
XML -> Lucene Document quickly, I think.
