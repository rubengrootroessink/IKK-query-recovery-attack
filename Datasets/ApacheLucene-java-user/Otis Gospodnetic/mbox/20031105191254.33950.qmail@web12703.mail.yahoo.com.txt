SUBJECT: Re: best way of reusing IndexSearcher objects
DATE: 5 Nov 2003

Use a single instance of IndexSearcher.
When you detect that the index has changed, through that instance (see
javadoc for the exact method name, I don't recall its exact name now),
discard that instance, and make a new one.
Do this check before every query or every X <unit of time> if you don't
care about the newest index entries appearing in search results
immediately.
