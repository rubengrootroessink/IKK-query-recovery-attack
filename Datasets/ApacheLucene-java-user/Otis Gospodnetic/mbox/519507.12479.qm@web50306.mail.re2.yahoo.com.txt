Hi Glen,

Aha, good to see the benefit of multiple IndexReaders/Searchers so clearly.  Makes me think
we'll want to add a config setting for this in Solr... :)

As for why 4 is the best choice, I think it's because of those 4 cores that you've got.  My
guess is that you'll see slightly better performance with 5 threads and then the performance
will slowly deteriorate with more readers/searchers.... let's see it!
