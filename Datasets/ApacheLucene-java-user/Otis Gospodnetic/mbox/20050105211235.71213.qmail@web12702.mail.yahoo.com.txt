SUBJECT: Re: 1.4.3 breaks 1.4.1 QueryParser functionality
DATE: 5 Jan 2005

Hello Bill,

"I feel your pain" ;)
But seriously, there was a QueryParser mess-up in the recent minor
releases.  I think this is the first time we've messed up the backward
compatibility in the last ~4 years, I believe.  Lucene public API is
very 'narrow', and typically very stable.  What we did with QueryParser
was the result of 'overeagerness', but is really out of character for
Lucene.
