I have not tried the compression yet, but in my experience a good way
to reduce the costs of document reads from a disk is by reading them
in document number order whenever possible. In this way one saves
on the disk head seeks.
Compression should actually help reducing the costs of disk head seeks
even more.

OG: Does this really help in a multi-user environment where there are multiple parallel queries
hitting the index and reading data from all over the index and the disk?  They will all share
the same disk head, so the head will still have to jump around to service all these requests,
even if each request is being careful to read documents in docId order, no?
