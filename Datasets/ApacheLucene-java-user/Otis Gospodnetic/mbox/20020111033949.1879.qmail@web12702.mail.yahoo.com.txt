SUBJECT: Re: Limit on number of characters before wildcard?
DATE: 11 Jan 2002

Hello,

I haven't tested this like you did, but from looking at the query
parser (QueryParser.jj file in the Lucene distribution)
it seems that only a single character is required before '*' or '?':

...
| <WILDTERM:  <_TERM_START_CHAR> 
              (<_TERM_CHAR> | ( [ "*", "?" ] ))* >
...

_TERM_START_CHAR is defined as:
[ "a"-"z", "A"-"Z", "_", "\u0080"-"\uFFFE" ]

and as you can see from the first definition above this character can
be followed by either zero or more _TERM_CHAR or "*" or "?".

This also answers your question about using an asterisk as the very
first character in the query.

It would be great if Doug or Brian Goetz could confirm or dispute this,
so that I can add it to the Lucene FAQ at jGuru.com.
