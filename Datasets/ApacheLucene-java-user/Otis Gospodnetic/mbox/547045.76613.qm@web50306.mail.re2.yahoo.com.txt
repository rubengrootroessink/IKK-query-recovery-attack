SUBJECT: Indexing Wikipedia dumps
DATE: 12 Dec 2007

Hi,

I need to index a Wikipedia dump.  I know there is code in contrib/benchmark for indexing
*English* Wikipedia for benchmarking purposes.  However, I'd like to index a non-English dump,
and I actually don't need it for benchmarking, I just want to end up with a Lucene index.

Any suggestions where I should start?  That is, can anything in contrib/benchmark already
do this, or is there anything there that I should use as a starting point?  As opposed to
writing my own Wikipedia XML dump parser+indexer.

Thanks,
Otis
