For simpy.com I store the full text of web pages in Lucene, in order to
provide full-text web searches.  Nutch (nutch.org) does the same.  You
can set the maximal number of tokens you want indexed via IndexWriter. 
You can also compress fields in the newest version of Lucene (or maybe
just the one in CVS), which may help you if you are considered about
disk space, although I wouldn't want to have to uncompress each hit's
200 pages worth of text in order to create a summary with KWIC. :)

Oh, and you asked about highlighter and field/query matching.  I
_think_ it won't help you with that, but I'm a bit behind on the
highlighter, so you should check the version in CVS and see if it's
capable of this.
