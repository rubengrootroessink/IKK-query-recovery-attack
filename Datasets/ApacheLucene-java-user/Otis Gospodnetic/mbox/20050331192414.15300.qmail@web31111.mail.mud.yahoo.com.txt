It's as easy as replacing a Jar, if you are upgrading from a Lucene
version with compatible index format.  Some versions changed the index
format.  See
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/jakarta-lucene/CHANGES.txt?rev=1.96.2.6
for index format change information.

If the index format changed, you will need to replace the Jar and
rebuild your index(es) with the new Jar.
