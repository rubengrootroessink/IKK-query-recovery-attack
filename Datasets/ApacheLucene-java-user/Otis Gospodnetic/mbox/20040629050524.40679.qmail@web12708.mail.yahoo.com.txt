We haven't discussed this yet.  Probably not until the Fall.

Probably no more examples than there are now, unless somebody
contributes them.  However, there will be a Lucene book in the Fall.

Lucene's releases are not tied to Java releases in any way.

I would suggest you just use 1.4RC3 for now.  The API is not likely to
change between RC3 and the final release, and the code is pretty stable
and bug-free (that is - same bugs are in 1.3, nothing new that I can
recall at the moment).
