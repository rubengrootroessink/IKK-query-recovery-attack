Amit,

Field.Text method is long gone from Lucene.  I think that was in version 1.4.3 of Lucene,
maybe 1.9*, but we are in 2.* now.
The place to look at the new Field API is here:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_2_0/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html

Subject: Cannot get Field.Text to work

Hi

I am new to Lucene and trying out the example code. But when I try to insert
values using Field.Text the compiler does not recognize the Text as a method
of Field. The code looks like this

contactDocument.add(Field.Text("name", contact.getName()));

I wanted to know if the version 2.2 does not have this method anymore, or do
I have to access it in another way.
Any help appreciated.


Regards,

Amit
