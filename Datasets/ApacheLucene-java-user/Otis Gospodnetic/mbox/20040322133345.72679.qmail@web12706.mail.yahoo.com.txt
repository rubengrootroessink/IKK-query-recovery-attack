Re-directing to lucene-user list.

One way of doing this is by writing a custom Analyzer that throws away
words you don't want to index (see an example of custom Analyzer in
jGuru FAQ).  Another way would be to just re-use the existing Analyzers
and add words you don't want indexed to the Analyzer's stop list.
