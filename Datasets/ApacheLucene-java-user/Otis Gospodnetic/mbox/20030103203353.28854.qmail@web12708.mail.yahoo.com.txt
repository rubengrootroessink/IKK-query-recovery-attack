SUBJECT: Re: Query grouping
DATE: 3 Jan 2003

Does the '... AND -.....' part even make sense?
Why not just .... -.... ?
Also, .... AND +.... doesn't make sense, does it?
+<field>:<term> means the term has to be in the result, so AND is not
really needed, is it?
I am not sure if spaces after 'SEARCH_NAME:' make a difference or not

Also, field:term1 field:term2 implies term1 OR term2, so no need for OR
there, especially with +, I think.
