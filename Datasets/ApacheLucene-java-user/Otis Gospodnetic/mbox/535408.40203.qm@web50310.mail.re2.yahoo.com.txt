Hi Andreas,

There are two important parts here:
1) Index updates will impact search - just think about the disk IO.
2) You will further slow down the search speed by re-opening the index after detecting a change,
as each new re-opening of IndexReader will have to read some of the index data.

So:
1) If you can buffer updates and do them in batch, that will be more efficient.
2) If you can delay the re-opening of the IndexReader, that will help, too.  Note that not
re-opening the index means the searchers will not see additions/updates done after the index
was last opened.

Hi

We have an index of several GB in size which is updated very
frequently-about every 2 seconds.

Though it is desired to have changes updated to the index as soon as
possible I wonder if this frequent updates can have negative affect on
the search and data retrieval performance.

Would it make more sense to limit the updates to times of lesser usage
(night) or is this something that does not affect Lucene and I should
not worry?

I see performance problems and would like to figure out if this frequent
updates can have an impact on search.

Andreas
