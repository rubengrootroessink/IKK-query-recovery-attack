I didn't see the answer to this question.  This is Windows-specific.  I'm not a Windows user,
so I never had this problem, but I believe we've had code to work around this issue in Java
Lucene for years now.  It could be that Lucene.Net doesn't have that.  In any case, it would
be best to check on the Lucene.Net list.

Sorry for any duplicate posts.

Actually I'm using the latest "final" Lucene.Net and I hope this problem is
not unique to this version.
The OS is windows, FS - NTFS.


Here's an example of what I do in each process (which may reside on a
different computer):



            writer = new IndexWriter(fi, new StandardAnalyzer(
threadData.stopwords), true);



            while (currentFile < threadData.files.Length)

            {

                //Add document

                AddDocument(threadData.files[currentFile], writer);



               writer.Close();



               currentFile++;

            }

The error I get is (each time it's a different file):

"The process cannot access the file
'D:\\Temp\\xml\\Lucene\\R3MTIndex\\_1.fdt' because it is being used by
another process."
"   at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String
maybeFullPath)\r\n   at System.IO.File.Delete(String path)\r\n   at

Thanks.


=============================================
You'll get more meaningful answers if you provide some details:

Things that come to mind:



op system (windows? *nix?)



file system (NFS? local? NTFS?)



An example of the error you receive (a stack trace would be good).



The code you're executing when you get the error.



Imagine you're trying to advise someone else and think about what you'd find
useful and try to provide that, please.



Best
