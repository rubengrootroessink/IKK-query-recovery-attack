Nada,

Scores and norms are two different things.  If you look for the Lucene class called DefaultSimilarity
you will see how norms are computed:

  public float computeNorm(String field, FieldInvertState state) {
    final int numTerms;
    if (discountOverlaps)
      numTerms = state.getLength() - state.getNumOverlap();
    else
      numTerms = state.getLength();
    return (float) (state.getBoost() * lengthNorm(field, numTerms));
  }


So that's how two different fields can still have the same norms value.
