DATE: 8 Mar 2010

Hi Erick,

For what it's worth, we are considering indexing JIRA comments over on http://search-lucene.com/
, though I'm not entirely convinced searching in comments would be super valuable.  Would
it?

But note that JIRA (and LucidFind) already do that.  For example, go to http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2061
and search for "Attached first cut python script nrtBench.py."~10 (it's in that issue's comments)
and JIRA will find that issue.

What exactly are you lokoing to do/build?
