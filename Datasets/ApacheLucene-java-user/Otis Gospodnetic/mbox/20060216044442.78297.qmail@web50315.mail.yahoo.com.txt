Here are a few bits:

The Wiki and the FAQ also have some information about indexing numbers/dates.
Basically, you want them small (ints, faster sorting, if you need sorting), and you don't
want them too fine, if you'll be expanding them into Boolean OR query.

Hi,

What is the best way to index numeric decimal fields, like experience, when
I want to use a range search on this field?

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Regards,

Shivani
