Uddam,

I can't tell with certainty whether you are aware of Snowball Analyzers
for Lucene or not.  Take a look at Lucene Sandbox:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/lucene-sandbox/.  You will see
Snowball Stemmers for Lucene contribution there.

That includes the French stemmer, so you shouldn't need to write any
new code.
