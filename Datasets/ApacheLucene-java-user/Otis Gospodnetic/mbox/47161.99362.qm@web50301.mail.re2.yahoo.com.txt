That's what the MemoryIndex in Lucene's contrib/ does.  I tested it with a very fast incoming
document stream (live blog posts from around the planet) and it held up well in my limited
testing.

Verity, autonomy, whatever, has a what they call a reverse query system
 
called profilenet. A profile is just a query (or I guess more than one 
query?) and you can setup a bunch of them. Then you supply the document
 
and you will get the matching queries as well as a score. They say its 
the opposite of doing a search with a query and getting back docs. 
Instead you do a search with a doc and get back these queries. They 
claim it can be used for things like taxonomy/classification among
 other 
things. I don't know how true this is to a real reverse query system as
 
that would seem to be kind of slow -- my guess is its a bit of an 
approximation.
