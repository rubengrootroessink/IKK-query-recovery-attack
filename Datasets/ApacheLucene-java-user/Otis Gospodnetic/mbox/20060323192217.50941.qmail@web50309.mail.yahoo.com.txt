The place to start would be to look at the DefaultSimilarity, and the norms method there. 
Perhaps you want to create your own Similarity implementation that returns either a constant
1 or something else that will favour longer text.  Somebody else with more experience in this
area may have better or more precise suggestions.

Hi,
At present lucene seems to rank very short documents over longer documents 
where the phrase occurs more regularily for instance which the search term 
"cat"

"the cat went home"

ranks higher than

"the black cat when home past some other cats, on cat street"

Is there anyway I can change luicene to rank longer documents with more 
phrase occurences higher

Many thanks

Leon
