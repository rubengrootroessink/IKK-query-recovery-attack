Jonathan,

That's most likely caused by StandardAnalyzer, which you are probably
using.  'in' is listed as one of the stop words:

    public static final String[] STOP_WORDS = {
        "a", "and", "are", "as", "at", "be", "but", "by",
        "for", "if", "in", "into", "is", "it",
        "no", "not", "of", "on", "or", "s", "such",
        "t", "that", "the", "their", "then", "there", "these",
        "they", "this", "to", "was", "will", "with"
    };

Try searching for state:or
It should yield no matches.

But, StandardAnalyzer is no longer final (get the latest build) and you
can write a class that subclasses it and calls this StandardAnalyser
constructor:

    /** Builds an analyzer with the given stop words. */
    public StandardAnalyzer(String[] stopWords) {
        stopTable = StopFilter.makeStopTable(stopWords);
    }

Pass it your own list of stop words and you are done.
If you've already indexed some data you have to be careful which words
you choose as stop words.  I suggest sticking with the above list
(minus 'in', 'or', etc.) for now.
Once you have your class use it instead of StandardAnalyzer.
