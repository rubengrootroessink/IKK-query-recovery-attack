Which Analyzer did you use for indexing, and which one are you using
for searching?  You have to make sure that neither of them discards
that ";" character.

Use Luke to double-check that fields in your index still have that ";"
character, and then make sure that the Analyzer you are passing to
QueryParser doesn't throw away ";" characters.
