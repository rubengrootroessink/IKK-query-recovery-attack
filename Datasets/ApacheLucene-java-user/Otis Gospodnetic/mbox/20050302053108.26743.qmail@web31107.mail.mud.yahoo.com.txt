Ben,

You do need to use a separate instance of those 3 classes for each
index yes.  But this is really something like:

IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(....);

So it's normal code-writing process.... you don't really have to create
anything new, just use existing Lucene API.  As for locking, again you
don't need to create anything.  Lucene does have a locking mechanism,
but most of it should be completely invisible to you if you follow the
concurrency rules.

I hope this helps.
