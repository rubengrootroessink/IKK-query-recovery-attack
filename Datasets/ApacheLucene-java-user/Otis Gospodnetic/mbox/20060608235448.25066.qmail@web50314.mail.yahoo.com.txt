Hi Sven,

Somebody asked about the same thing a few weeks back and opened a JIRA issue.  It looks like
the push to ibiblio servers did not happen, even though I added notes about that to the release
HOWTO doc on the Wiki.  My notes might be incorrect, so I commented on that JIRA issues asking
for clarifications, as people there seemed to know how new releases should get pushed out
for ibiblio.  Nobody responded yet, I'm afraid.  If you know how that's done, let me know,
I'll gladly push the release files wherever they need to get pushed.

Otis

Hello, 

Nice job, thanks.
Question : When will it be available on Maven2 repositories ?
Thanks
