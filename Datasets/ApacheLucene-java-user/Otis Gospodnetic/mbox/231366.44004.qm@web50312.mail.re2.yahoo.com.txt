Aha, I see.  I wasn't referring to character-encoding-based lang ID.  That is probably good
enough if you need to know if the text is English or if it's Chinese or Japanese or Korean
or Russian Cyrillic or Arabic or...

I think there is a bit missing in your statement about training.  You can't just train on,
say "English".  There are all kinds of "English" out there.  The distribution of terms in
WSJ is probably a lot different from what you might find in some corpus of medical texts or
botany tests or contemporary art.

As for not everyone having access to a corpus, I've come to love Wikipedia for exactly this
thing. :)  For an NLP class I took recently we used Croatian Wikipedia while developing an
unsupervised morphological analyzer for highly inflected languages (Croatian being one of
them - 7 cases, a pile of case/number/gender-dependent suffixes...).  The analyzer ended up
matching the state-of-the-art results. :)
