SUBJECT: Re: Indexing Strategy for 20 million documents
DATE: 8 Oct 2004

Jeff,

These questions are difficult to answer, because the answer depends on
a number of factors, such as:
- hardware (memory, disk speed, number of disks...)
- index complexity and size (number of fields and their size)
- number of queries/second
- complexity of queries
etc.

I would try putting everything in a single index first, and split it up
only if I see performance issues.  Going from 1 index to N indices is
not a lot of work (not a lot of Lucene-related code).  If searching 1
big index is too slow, split your index, put each index on a separate
disk, and use ParallelMultiSearcher
(http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/ParallelMultiSearcher.html)
to search your indices.
