Yes, if you think about how blogs and Technorati work (new blog post -> ping -> ping
server -> technorati -> index ==> searchable blog post), Adam is correct.  Since
Doug's implementation we (Technorati) have changed our clusters a LOT (think major rewrites).
 I can't talk about the details, obviously, but the first paragraph in Mark's email sounds
like what we have.

Biggy will want to provide more details about how they want things to work (e.g. how quickly
do changes need to be visible to searchers?  Is this a write + read system, or are there deletes?
...) before others can make useful suggestions.

Hello, 

I saw that Doug Cutting had an interesting solution for his Technorati website: 
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg12709.html

It sounds like it's a single-writer, many readers type of system, but quite robust and efficient.

Cheers, 

Adam
