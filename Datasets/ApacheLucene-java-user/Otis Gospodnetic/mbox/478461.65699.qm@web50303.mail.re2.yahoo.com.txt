SUBJECT: Re: Loading an index into memory
DATE: 23 Jul 2009

I haven't verified this myself, but I remember talking to somebody who tried MMapDirectory
and compared it to simply using tmpfs (RAM FS).  The result was that MMapDirectory had some
memory overhead, so putting the index on tmpfs was more memory-efficient.  I guess this person
had read-only indices, so tmpfs was an option.
