SUBJECT: Re: which lock belong to which index?
DATE: 2 Oct 2003

I cannot remember the answer I got, but I asked the same question after
the code was changed to put locks in java.io.tmpdir.
Because I have an application that deals with a lot of indices
simultaneously, I felt like this will make things more difficult in
cases where you have stale locks, etc.
Try the archive, though, as I seem to recall that somebody, Doug or
Scott gave me the answer.
