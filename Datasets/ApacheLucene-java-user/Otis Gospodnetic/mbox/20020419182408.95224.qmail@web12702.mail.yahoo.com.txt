DATE: 19 Apr 2002

Did the change that you mentioned below really work for you?
I wrote this class:
http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/showattachment.cgi?attach_id=1638

and it looks like the bug is not in QueryParser, but in some Java class
(could it be WildcardTermEnum?), since the class does not make use of
QueryParser and still demonstrates that WildcardQuery doesn't work
properly.

Thanks,
Otis
