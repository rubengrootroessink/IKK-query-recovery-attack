I would like to know how's the performance during indexing and searching of
results on a large index files would be like.

OG: It depends ;)
- on your hardware (fast disk?  lots of RAM?  multi-CPU?  multi-core?)
- on the size of data you're indexing (one field with 1KB of data or 10 fields with 10KB each?)
- on field indexing options (indexing? tokenizing? storing? compressing? term vectors enabled?
payloads?)

Who was is that mentioned a DB server that can insert 1000 rows/second the other day?  Sounds
rather high. :)
