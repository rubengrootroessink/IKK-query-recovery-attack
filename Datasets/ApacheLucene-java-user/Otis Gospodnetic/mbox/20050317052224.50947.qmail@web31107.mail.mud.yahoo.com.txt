This is not really the right place to ask these types of questions,
but...  robots at mccmedia.com may be a better place to ask, or one of
those forums where people who track things phenomena such as Google
Dances exchange information.

What you described is doable.  You will have to detect Googlebot user
agent, and feed it indexable text, while redirecting real users to the
protected area.

Using Lucene is an overkill, though.  You can easily remove stop words
with a simple Perl script, for example.  Another thing you could do is
just shuffle the words around.  The current generation of search
engines typically doesn't care (make use of) the word order, while a
human will be lost if you shuffle the words.
