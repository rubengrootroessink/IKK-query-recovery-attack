SUBJECT: Re: Stop-word in phrase (BUG?)
DATE: 27 Jan 2003

My first guess would be that you didn't use the same Analyzer for
indexing that particular text and processing your query.
The one used for indexing filtered out stop words, and the one used for
querying does not.  Or maybe they have 2 different sets of stop words,
one with 'and' and one without.

Or maybe it's a bug :)
A self-sufficient junit test case would be helpful.
