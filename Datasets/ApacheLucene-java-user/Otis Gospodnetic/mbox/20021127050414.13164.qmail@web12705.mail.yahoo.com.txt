This should answer your a) or b) question:

[otis@linux2 java]$ pwd
/mnt/disk2/cvs-repositories/jakarta/jakarta-lucene/src/java

[otis@linux2 java]$ which ffjg
alias ffjg='find . -type f -name \*.java|xargs grep'
        /usr/bin/find
        /usr/bin/xargs

[otis@linux2 java]$ ffjg Thread
./org/apache/lucene/store/Lock.java:       
Thread.sleep(sleepInterval);
[otis@linux2 java]$


Unoptimized index is not a problem for document additions, they take
constant time, regardless of the size of the index and regardless of
whether the index is optimized or not.
Searches of unoptimized index take longer than searches of an optimized
index.
Here's a test:
Write a class that indexes X documents where X is a substantial number.
Them make a copy of that index X and call it Y.  Optimize index Y.
Then do a search against one, and against the other index, and time it.
Then let us know which one is faster and by how much.

Good luck,
Otis
