Tom,

Not sure which one would be better for you.  It would be easy for you
to test that, though.  My guess would be that a single index will work
better.

To merge indices, create a new instance of FSDirectory.
  Directory dir = new FSDirectory("/path/to/new/index");

Then create an array of your 27 indices (something like the above, but
add it to an array of Directory[] type, and use a different path for
each of your 27 dirs in the ctor above) and pass it to addIndexes
method, like this:
  dir.addIndexes(yourDirectoryArray);

The 'dir' is the 'dir' from above.
