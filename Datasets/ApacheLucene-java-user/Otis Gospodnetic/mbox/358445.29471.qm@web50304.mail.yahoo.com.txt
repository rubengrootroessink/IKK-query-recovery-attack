Sounds vaguely familiar... and I think this was fixed a while back.  Running HEAD or at least
2.0.0?

P.S. At one point I tried doing an in-memory index using the
RAMDirectory and then merging it with an on-disk index and it didn't
work.  The RAMDirectory never flushed to disk... leaving me with an
empty index.
Only when the number of documents is greather than the maxBufferedDocs
properties.
What I have to do?
