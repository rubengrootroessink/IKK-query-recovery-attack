DATE: 21 Oct 2007

Hi,

Has anyone tried running Lucene (indexing+searching) on top of KFS ( http://kosmosfs.sourceforge.net/
)?  From reading about KFS it makes me think it would not be great for searching for the same
reason HDFS is not the best place to keep your searchable Lucene indices, but maybe somebody
has tried it with Lucene and has some more concrete observations?

Thanks,
Otis
