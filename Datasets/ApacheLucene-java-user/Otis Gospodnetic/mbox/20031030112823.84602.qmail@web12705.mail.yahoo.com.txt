SUBJECT: Re: lucene indexing and searching engine performance
DATE: 30 Oct 2003

Look at the Benchmarks page on Lucene's site.
It is not complete (heh, it can never be complete), but it will give
you some ideas about Lucene's performance.
Feel free to submit your benchmarks, using this template:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/benchmarktemplate.xml

Thank you,
Otis
