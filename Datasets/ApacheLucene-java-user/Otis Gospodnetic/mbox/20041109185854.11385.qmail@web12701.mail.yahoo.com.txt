It is difficult to give a general answer.  You can certainly store the
whole XML in the Lucene index, just don't tokenize it.  The HEAD
version of Lucene even has some compression that you may find handy. 
On the other hand, storing XML in the FS would allow you to store XML
files wherever you wanted, even on separate disk(s).  If these are lots
of parallel searches/reads, this can be handy.  If you want to be able
to see XML files without going through the index, this can also be
handy.  So, it depends on how you like it, but both approaches are
doable.
