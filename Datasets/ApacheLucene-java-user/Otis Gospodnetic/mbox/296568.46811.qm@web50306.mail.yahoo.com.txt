A single index with an id field sounds like a fine approach here.

Subject: lucense index/document architecture


Hi,

I'm setting up lucene to work with our webapp to index a database. My db
holds files which can belong to a user or a company or both. I want the
option for my users to search across all content, but also search within the
files for one user or company. What is the best architecture approach for
this? Do you add a field to the document with the parentId's, do you make a
different index for each user/company (can be 1000's) or is there a
different solution all together?

Thank you,
Joost
