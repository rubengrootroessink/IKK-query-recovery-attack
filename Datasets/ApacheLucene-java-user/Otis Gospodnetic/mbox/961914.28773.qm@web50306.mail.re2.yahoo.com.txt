Kevin,
CLucene is behind Lucene Java in terms of
 functionality and index format, thus you'd have to be careful about which version of CLucene
and Lucene Java you use.  A better place to ask is the CLucene mailing list, as Ben &
Co. know exactly which Lucene Java version they are compatible with.

You've got some giant image in your signature....

I am have a question 
concerning interop between CLucene and Lucene. It is possible to have a C++ 
Application using CLucene acting as an IndexWriter, and then have a Web 
Applicaltion using Lucene to query the index. Could there be issues with locking 
under load for example.
 
I have done some 
basic test where I can write/read to/from index using Clucene and 
Lucene.
