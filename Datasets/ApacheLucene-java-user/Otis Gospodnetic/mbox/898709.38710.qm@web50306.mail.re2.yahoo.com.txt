Hello,

Of course, if you actually want the last 7 days rolling effect and not the this 
week vs. previous week, then you could go with smaller indices, say daily ones.
Then you'd always add new docs to the latest index and removing the oldest index 
completely every 24 hours.

You could go hourly, too, depending on your exact needs.
