SUBJECT: BarCampNYC: Lucene presentations
DATE: 12 Jan 2006

Hi,

For those in or near New York, this coming weekend there will be a geeky event called BarCampNYC:
  http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampNYC

A few people will be presenting Lucene, Ferret, and related stuff.
I'll be giving away a few copies of Lucene in Action and also presenting Simpy at http://www.simpy.com

Some Lucene people here might be interested.

Otis
