Subject: Lucene Index Stored on Database instead of FileSystem

Hi,

By default, Lucene create a directory for index on FileSystem. Is there a
plugin or support provided by Lucene to store the index in Databse instead
of FileSystem, where:-
1) Directory can be equal to table in DB .
2) Each file in the index directory represents one row in that table.
3) Data in the file can be stored as BLOB in each row.

If such a plugin exist, are there any concurreny issues or any limitation on
the size of the index that can be stored?

Thanks
-Nikhil
