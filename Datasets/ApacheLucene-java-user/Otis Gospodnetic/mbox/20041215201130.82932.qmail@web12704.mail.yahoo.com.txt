SUBJECT: Re: A question about scoring function in Lucene
DATE: 15 Dec 2004

There is one case that I can think of where this 'constant' scoring
would be useful, and I think Chuck already mentioned this 1-2 months
ago.  For instace, having such scores would allow one to create alert
applications where queries run by some scheduler would trigger an alert
whenever the score is > X.  So that is where the absolue value of the
score would be useful.

I believe Chuck submitted some code that fixes this, which also helps
with MultiSearcher, where you have to have this contant score in order
to properly order hits from different Searchers, but I didn't dare to
touch that code without further studying, for which I didn't have time.
