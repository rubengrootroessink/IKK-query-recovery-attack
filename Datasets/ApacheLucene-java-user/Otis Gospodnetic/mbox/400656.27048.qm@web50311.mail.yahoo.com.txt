Hard to tell without seeing any code.  Perhaps numbers are being removed from the query string
during search.
Make sure the same or at least "compatible" Analyzer is used during both indexing and querying.
Grab the code from Lucene in Action .... hm, lucenebook.com may be down at the moment, but
that's where you can get the code normally.  The code includes some classes that let you run
a query string through a set of Analyzers and see how each of them behaves and what it does
to a query.

Subject: Problem with a search engine


Hi, I recently started an internship and I've been asked to fix their
search engine so numbers are searched. At first, I thought it was the
Analyzer that wasn't working right, but we're using StandardAnalyzer and
the numbers are indexed (I checked with Lukeall). Then I thought they
are not tokenized during the search, but they are. They just seem to be
ignored for some reason. Did anyone experienced something similar ? If
so, how can I fix this ? It's probably something that would jump in my
face if it was alive, but I just can't see it. Can anyone help me ? It
would be very much appreciated.
