Subject: experiences with lingpipe

hi all,

does anybody have practical experiences with Ling Pipes Spellchecker
(http://www.alias-i.com/lingpipe/demos/tutorial/querySpellChecker/read-me.html)?

With lucenes spellcheck contribution I am not really satisfied because
the Index has some (many?) mispelled words, so the did you mean class
(from the jave.net example) is good in finding similar mispelled words.
With the similarWords  Function the correct word is only around Position
2-5  - though it should be more frequent in the index.

OG: You can modify that code and exclude low-frequency words (probably misspellings) from
your spellchecker index.

So for know I am thinking of switching to lingpipe, but I have a couple
of questions:

Is it better than lucenes  spell-check contribution?
What about performance?
What about the quality of suggestions?

OG: Lucene's spellchecker is pretty basic.  Check LingPipe mailing list.  A few weeks ago,
I asked Bob to describe why/how LingPipe spellchecker is better than Lucene's, and he provided
a detailed answer.
Note that LingPipe is not free.

Otis


Does anybody have a good idea how to find typos in the index.
