Sachin,
A lof of the questions you are asking are covered either in the FAQ or on the Lucene site
somewhere, or in various Lucene articles or in LIA.  You should check those places first (the
traffic on java-user is already high!), you'll save yourself a lot of time.  For this particular
question, have a look at the File Formats page on Lucene's site.

Subject: Spanned indexes

Hi all,

Is it possible in Lucene for an index to span multiple files?  If so
what is the recommendation in this case?  Is it better to span after the
index reaches a particular size?  Furthermore, does Lucene ever span a
single record between two or more index files in this case or does it
ensure that a single record will only appear in one spanned file?

Many thanks for your advice

Sachin
