This looks nice.
However, what happens if you have two Java processes that work on the
same index, and give it different lock directories?
They'll mess up the index.

Should we try to prevent this by not offering this option, or should we
offer it, document it well, and leave it up to the user to play by the
rules or not?

I'm leaning towards the latter, but I think some Lucene developers
would be more conservative.
