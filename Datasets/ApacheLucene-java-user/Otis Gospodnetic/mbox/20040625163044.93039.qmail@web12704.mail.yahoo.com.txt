SUBJECT: Re: best mergeFactor for merging 100 Indexes
DATE: 25 Jun 2004

If this is an option, use compund index format
(writer.setUseCompound(true)).  ulimit -a in some UNIX shells will tell
you the max number of open files allowed.  If you can, increase that
number as high as you can.  Of course, how high you can go also depends
on your RAM.  Finally, don't forget there is a minMergeDocs parameter
you can use to tune things, too.
