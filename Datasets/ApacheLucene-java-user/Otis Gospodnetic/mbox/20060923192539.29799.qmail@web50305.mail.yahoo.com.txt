Yes, I think it's the same thing - word segmentation - http://www.google.com/search?q=word+segmentation

You may get the same ad(word) as I did - Basistech folks from Cambridge, MA have various interesting
products, some stuff that deals with CJK (not sure if they actually do word segmentation or
just n-gram the input).  Guess who their biggest customer is?  Hint: starts with the letter
G.

Conceptually, how different is the problem of decompounding German  
from tokenizing languages such as Thai and Japanese, where "words"  
are not separated by spaces and may consist of multiple characters?
