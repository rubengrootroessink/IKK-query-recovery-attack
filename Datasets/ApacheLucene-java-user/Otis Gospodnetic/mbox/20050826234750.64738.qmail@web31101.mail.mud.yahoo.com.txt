I think Lucene version 1.2 was mentioned simply because it worked with
an earlier JDK that must be shipped on some PDA.  Perhaps the JDK (I
J2ME) on that PDA can be upgraded instead?

If not, Karl should run the current version of Lucene on that device
and provide a list of errors... want to do that, Karl?

  So, the real goal is to get Lucene working on that PDA
