It's really just a matter of putting the Jars in the appropriate directory on the appropriate
machine, I think.
Maybe CC-ed people know which dir/machine that is.
The issue is: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-551

Hello Otis,

I unfortunately don't master enough maven yet to know how to push a library on maven public
repositories.

<off-topic>
 However i just found this eBook that looks interesting http://www.mergere.com/m2book_download.jsp
</off-topic>

Waiting for a maven guru to release lucene 2.0 on a public repo, i'll
just put the lib on a local one
Thanks and have a nice day.

OG> Nobody responded yet, I'm afraid.  If you know how that's done,
