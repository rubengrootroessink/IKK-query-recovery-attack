SUBJECT: Re: QueryParser with stop/key words inside quotes
DATE: 14 Apr 2003

The place to look is QueryParser.jj, method getFieldQuery, but it looks
like the code doesn't figure out it's parsing a phrase query until
after it passes the query string through the Analyzer.

However, would you even want to do something like that?
If you use the same Analyzer, with the same list of stop words for both
indexing and searching, and then you don't strip stop words from phrase
queries, no phrase query with a stop word will yield you any results.
