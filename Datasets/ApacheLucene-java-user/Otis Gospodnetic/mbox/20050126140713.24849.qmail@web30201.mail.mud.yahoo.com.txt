SUBJECT: Re: Lucene in Action hits desk in UK
DATE: 26 Jan 2005

Publisher -> Amazon information feed seems to be a fairly manual
process, and Amazon takes a while to update book information on their
site, including prices.

I contacted both the US and UK Amazon sites and asked them to fix my
last name (the last character in my name has a little slash (not an
accent) above it), but they never bothered to fix it nor email me back.

Anyhow, enjoy Lucene in Action!
