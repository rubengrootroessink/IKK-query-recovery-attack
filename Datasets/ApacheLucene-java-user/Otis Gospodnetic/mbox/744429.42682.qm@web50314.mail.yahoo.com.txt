The value of the word - the word itself, should be your unique identifier.

Thanks for the reply....I guess my concern is that I
want to ensure that 
I don't accidentally delete other words than the
intended word. Example, 
if I build a custom index, I can delete a word not
based on the term 
itself, though in the term I can include a "unique"
identifier as well. 
Can the same be done for the spell checker index?

Thanks in advance,
Josh

so you can delete documents/words from it the same way
you delete documents from any Lucene index - using
IndexReader's delete(...) methods.  You can pass that
delete method a Term where the field name is "word"
and the value is the mizpelt word.
