Karl, you might want to have a look at Zoe (the email app from several years ago that uses
Lucene as its storage).
Also, there is DbDirectory for Lucene, which should have XA support.  Andi will know.

Subject: Lucene as primary object storage

Until recently I have only used Lucene as an index. I'm very  
interested to hear what you people have to say about using Lucene as  
the primary and only persistance layer in an application.

I would feel much safer if I had a transactionlog for crash recovery.  
So I might get me one of those. Are there more things I should worry  
about?
