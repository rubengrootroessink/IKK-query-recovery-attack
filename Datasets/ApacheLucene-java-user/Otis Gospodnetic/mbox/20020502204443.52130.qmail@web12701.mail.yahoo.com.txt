Yes, this is a FAQ.
Go to http://www.jguru.com/faq/Lucene, search for 'database', and check
the results.
Incidentally jguru.com uses Lucene, and the results you see were
originally stored in the database.
You can also check the mailing list archives (link is on Jakarta site),
which will give you a lot of information on this subject.
