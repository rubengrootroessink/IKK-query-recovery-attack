Hi,

I'm not aware of anything in LingPipe that would do the Q&A part, though LP (and GATE)
may have the building blocks for what you need.  For example, they both must have sentence
boundary detection/sentence chunking, which might be one of the first sub-tasks you'd need
to do to begin finding/evaluating questions and answers.
