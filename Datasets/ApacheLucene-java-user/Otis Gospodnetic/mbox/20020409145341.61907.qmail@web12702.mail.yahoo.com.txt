SUBJECT: RE: too many open files in system
DATE: 9 Apr 2002

I've indexed 250,000 items (database rows, not files) with Lucene on a
system like this:

[otis@kyle blink]$ ulimit
unlimited
[otis@kyle blink]$ tcsh
> limit
cputime 	unlimited
filesize 	unlimited
datasize 	unlimited
stacksize 	8192 kbytes
coredumpsize 	1000000 kbytes
memoryuse 	unlimited
descriptors 	1024 
memorylocked 	unlimited
maxproc 	8192 
openfiles 	1024


I didn't encounter the 'too many open files' error.
You could change your code to optimize index after adding every X
documents to the index.
If you add Documents to a RAMDirectory-based IndexWriter, and them use
IndexWriter's addIndexes method, you will have an optimized index after
calling addIndexes method, plus you'll speed up indexing.
