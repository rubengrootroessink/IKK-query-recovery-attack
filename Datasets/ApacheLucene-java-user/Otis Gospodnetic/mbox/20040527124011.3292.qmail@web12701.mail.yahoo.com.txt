See http://www.nutch.org/
It may make sense to join Nutch, contribute patches that help you, etc.
instead of building your own crawler from scratch.

Lucene does not care about files and is not limited to indexing files. 
It sounds like you tried the Lucene demo that indexes files in the file
system.

However, indexing in batch instead of as you crawl may be a more
scalable and cleaner, more manageable approach.  Nutch uses that
approach for a reason. :)

No constraints.

Not a good idea.  Keep your Lucene index directory clean, and use it
only as an index directory.  Write your files elsewhere, I would
suggest.

That is up to you and your application.  I just suggest you keep that
outside the index directory, in order to keep things clean, well
organized, and such.

Lucene ranks search result items.  Look at Similarity and
DefaultSimilarity classes.  It sounds like you may benefit from having
a custom Similarity that is aware of your categories.

It this is really a pet project, perhaps joining Nutch will also be fun
for you.  Some recent Nutch contributors are also Lucene users.
