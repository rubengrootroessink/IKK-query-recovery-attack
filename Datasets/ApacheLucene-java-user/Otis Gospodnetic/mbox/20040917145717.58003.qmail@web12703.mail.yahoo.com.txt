Sorry about the 'bad' link (my bookmark index can't be searched by
those without Simpy accounts).  So you can see 'similar' and Term
Vectors in action here:

http://www.simpy.com/simpy/Authenticate.do?username=demo&password=demo&rememberme=-1

If you then search for 'blog' (
http://www.simpy.com/simpy/Search.do?q=blog ) you can hit 'similar'
next to the first search result hit, and you'll find web pages similar
to Erik Hatcher's blog.  The 'similarity' threshold is set pretty low
currently, but that can be tuned.
