Hello Luan,

I think you are looking for facets and faceted search.  In short, it means 
storing the category for a document (web page) in the Document Field in Lucene 
index .  Then, at search time, you count how many matches were in which 
category.  You can implement this yourself or you can use Solr, which has this 
functionality built-in.  If you want to stick with Lucene and don't want Solr, 
you can use Bobo Browse with Lucene - Lucene in Action 2 has a case study about 
Bobo Browse, where you can learn how this is done.  Slick stuff.

Thanks for using http://search-lucene.com :)
