SUBJECT: Re: Efficient document spooling and indexing
DATE: 22 Nov 2001

Yes, I think that you are correct, since I see my index directory
growing as I add documents to the index, even though I don't call
close() until I'm finished adding all documents.
Hm, I wonder what exactly gets written to the disk between add and
close.
I shall rewrite my stuff to use RAMDirectory then.  I like efficient
code and hate wasting any kind of resources, not just computing ones.

Thanks,
Otis
