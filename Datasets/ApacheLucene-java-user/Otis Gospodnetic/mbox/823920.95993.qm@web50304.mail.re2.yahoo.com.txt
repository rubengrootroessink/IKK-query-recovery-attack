Sounds useful.  I suppose this means one would have custom function for within-bucket-reordering?
e.g. for a web search you might reorder based on the URL length if you think shorter URLs
are an indicator of higher quality.  It also sounds like something that can easily sit outside
Lucene....or do you have something else in mind, such as a mechanism to pass a reordering
function in Lucene?

True, although function query tends to bring more overhead ...

While we're on the subject of complex scoring - I read an interesting 
paper (I don't have a link now), which discussed a so called bucketed 
scoring. The idea is that if your basic scoring is good enough to
 ensure 
that top-N results are highly relevant, then you can split these
 results 
into buckets of k documents (let's say 10 ;) ), and within each bucket 
apply arbitrary re-ranking function, which is then very inexpensive to 
perform because of the limited number of documents.

Example: you have a large corpus of web pages, and you want home pages 
to appear first, even if they score somewhat lower - and it doesn't pay
 
off to modify the base scoring, because of overfitting, i.e. the
 scoring 
would be good for home pages but poor for other relevant documents.
