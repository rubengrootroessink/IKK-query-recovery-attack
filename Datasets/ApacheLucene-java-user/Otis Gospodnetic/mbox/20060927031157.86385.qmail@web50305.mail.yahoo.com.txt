Heh, I have to try the obvious - two reader.delete(term) calls?

Subject: Multiple Terms, Delete From Index

Hi All,

I need to delete from the index where 2 terms are
matching, rather than 
just one term.
For example,

IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(dir);
Term[] terms = new Term[2];
terms[0] = new Term("city","city1");
terms[1] = new Term("state","state1");
reader.delete(terms);
reader.close();

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,
Josh
