Redirecting to java-user (-dev is for developers of Lucene).
@daffodildb.com, interesting :)

It really depends on a number of factors:
- types of Fields in your Documents
- number of indexed Fields
- types of queries
- state of the index (optimized vs. unoptimized)
- amount of RAM (can your index fit into RAM?) and speed of disk
- desired response time
- etc.

So, the best way is to create a fake index with 3M documents on your
server and see what happens.
