SUBJECT: large index -> slow optimize()
DATE: 22 Nov 2002

Hello,

I am building an index with a few 1M documents, and every X documents
added to the index I call optimize() on the IndexWriter.
I have noticed that as the index grows this calls takes more and more
time, even though the number of new segments that need to be merged is
the same between every optimize() call.
I suspect this is normal and not a bug, but is there no way around
that?  Do you know which part is the part that takes longer and longer
as the index grows?

Thanks,
Otis
