Dmitry once contributed a nice beefy patch that added Term Vector
support to Lucene.  While we never integrated the changes (for no good
reason), I do recall that the patch was nice and elegant, because it
allowed one to turn Term Vector support on/off at indexing time.

If turned on, Lucene would collect information about terms and document
that allows building of term vectors.  If turned off, Lucene created
only its normal index files.

If you can provide something like that, I bet a lot of people would be
interested.  I have a feeling this won't get done unless you do it,
though.
