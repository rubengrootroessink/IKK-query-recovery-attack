Bhavin,

Tags are just (key)words/tokens, nothing Lucene-specific.  Are you asking how to extract appropriate
tags from a chunk of text?  If so, you could tokenize and count words, pulling out the most
popular ones.  You could look or nouns only, or even proper nouns.  Tags that come with blog
posts (rel=tag stuff) are typically not automatically extracted like that, but rather entered
by bloggers.
