Is it possible that your 'date' field is empty in some documents you
indexed?  If so, you should specify your sort field type explicitly. 
Look at the Javadoc for SortField class.

Default sorting is by rank/score.

There are links to a few Lucene articles on Lucene's Wiki.  There is
also a link to the Lucene book (Lucene in Action) on the same page. 
Another good source of information about how to use the Lucene API are
Lucene's unit tests.
