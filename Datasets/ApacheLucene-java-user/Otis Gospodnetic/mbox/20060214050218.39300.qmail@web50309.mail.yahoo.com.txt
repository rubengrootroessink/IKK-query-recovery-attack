 Hi Paul, 
 
  Yes, that is exactly what I was trying to say in my earlier example of acessing documents
in a chronologically sorted order (which might be the same as index insert order).  Thanks
for confirming it.

IndexReader.doc(docId) for more than 2 docs is normally best done with  
increasing docId. This reduces disk head movement, since the stored docs  
are in that order.  
When Hits() its used, it is tempting to retrieve docs in scoring order via   
the Hits.doc() method, but that is probably not the best order for retrieval  
speed.
