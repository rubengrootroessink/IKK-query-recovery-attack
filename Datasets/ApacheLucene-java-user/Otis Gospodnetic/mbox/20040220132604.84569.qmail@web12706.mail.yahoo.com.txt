You should be okay.  When new documents are added, they are added to
new segments.  A 'table of contents' of all valid segments is in
'segments' file.  Even if you copy extra segments, your index will
still work, it's just that your searches may not search newly created
segments, whose existence was not registered in segments file, when you
copied the index.

This is related to the answer under 1.  New documents are not seen with
an old IndexSearcher, because the old IndexSearcher is not aware of new
segments.
It would have to re-read the segments file and read any new segments
found, in order to become aware of new segments and documents in them.
