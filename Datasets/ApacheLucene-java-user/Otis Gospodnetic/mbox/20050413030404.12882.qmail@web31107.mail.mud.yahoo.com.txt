FROM: Otis Gospodnetic <otis_gospodne...@yahoo.com>
SUBJECT: A9 (search-related jobs)
DATE: 13 Apr 2005

Hello,

A9 (Amazon's subsidiary) is looking for people, and since they are in
the information/search business people on java-user@lucene may be
interested in this, even though it's not Lucene-specific.

Here is an example job description:

Senior Manager and Technical Team Leader  Search Infrastructure

A9 is looking for an experienced technical leader to help drive the
development of leading edge search technology. You will have extensive
experience with all facets of the software development lifecycle and
will provide technical leadership in driving the design and
implementation of extremely large distributed systems. You should be an
experienced hands-on manager with an innovative spirit who loves
technology and can wear many hats, including development manager,
architect, and product manager. You must possess strong communication
skills and should be comfortable with C++ and Java in a Unix
environment as well as internet and middleware technologies such as
Perl, SOAP, SQL, HTML and XML. You must display a deep understanding of
the theory of distributed computing, object oriented analysis and
design, and networking protocols.

Candidates should have at least 10 years industry experience and 5
years experience managing software development.


They are also looking for less senior geeks.  Anyhow, if working for
Udi Manber (A9's CEO) sounds like fun, send your resume to Ms.
"Margaret Moore" <margaretpm@yahoo.com>.  I believe this work is in the
Palo Alto area.

Otis
