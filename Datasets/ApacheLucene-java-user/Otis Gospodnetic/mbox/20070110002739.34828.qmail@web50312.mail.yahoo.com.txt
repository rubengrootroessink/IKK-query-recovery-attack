Hi,
Got this thought while eating noodles yesterday...

Couldn't one convert a non NO_NORMS field to a genuine NO_NORMS field by:
1. expanding an index to a multi-file index (if the index was a .cfs one)
2. removing the appropriate .fN file from the index directory
3. switching that omitNorms bit in FieldInfo

I'm not sure how possible or how hard 3. is, but I see this omitNorms bit in FieldInfo.read(IndexInput)
and FieldInfo.write(IndexOutput).

Maybe something like:

  public void change(IndexInput input, IndexOutput output, boolean omitNorms) throws IOException
{
    int size = input.readVInt();//read in the size
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      String name = input.readString().intern();
      byte bits = input.readByte();
      boolean isIndexed = (bits & IS_INDEXED) != 0;
      boolean storeTermVector = (bits & STORE_TERMVECTOR) != 0;
      boolean storePositionsWithTermVector = (bits & STORE_POSITIONS_WITH_TERMVECTOR)
!= 0;
      boolean storeOffsetWithTermVector = (bits & STORE_OFFSET_WITH_TERMVECTOR) != 0;
      // ignore what's in the index, use what the caller says it wants
      //boolean omitNorms = (bits & OMIT_NORMS) != 0;
      
      addInternal(name, isIndexed, storeTermVector, storePositionsWithTermVector, storeOffsetWithTermVector,
omitNorms);

      write(output);
    }

I didn't try this, of course, but I'm curious if this general approach would work, at least
in case of norms.  If it works for norms, maybe it would also work for other field attributes,
if their data is stoerd in separate files and easily detachable from the other index files.

Thanks,
Otis

Correct.  As with many index changes, reindexing from scratch is the
best way to go.
