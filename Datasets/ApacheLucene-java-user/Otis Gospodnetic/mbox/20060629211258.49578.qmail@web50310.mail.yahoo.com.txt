Try using HitCollector and break out of it when you collect enough documents.  My guess is
that if you are not doing anything crazy with Hits (like looping through the all) this won't
be that much faster than using Hits.

Hy,
how can I limit the result-count of a query in order to save time? I searched 
the web but didn't find a solution.

Thanks
Dominik
