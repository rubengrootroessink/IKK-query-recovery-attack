Hi Luke,

That's not hard with RangeQuery (supported by QueryParser), take a look
at this:
  http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=date+range

The grayed-out text has the section name and page number, so you can
quickly locate this stuff in your ebook.

P.S.
Do you know if Indigo/Chapters has Lucene in Action on their book
shelves yet?
