Hello,

Yes, Lucene in Action has been listed on Amazon for a while now (I
think I recorded this in my blog some time back).  The publish date is,
I believe, the date provided by publishers, but things almost always
take longer than predicted, so 31.12.2004 may be a bit off. :( 
However, the ebook should be out any time now, as Erik already
mentioned.  It's cheaper, saves trees, and doesn't consume precious
horizontal surfaces in your home (I live in New York City, where large
living spaces are hard to find unless you live in a former warehouse or
pay big money).

just like lots of software
