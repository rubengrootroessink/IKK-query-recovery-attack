SUBJECT: Re: similarity matrix - more clear
DATE: 30 Nov 2004

Hello,

I don't think Lucene can spit out the similarity matrix for you, but
perhaps you can use Lucene's Term Vector support to help you build the
matrix yourself:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/TermFreqVector.html

The other relevant sections of the Lucene API to look at are:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#getTermFreqVectors(int)
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html#Text(java.lang.String,%20java.io.Reader,%20boolean)
...

This should let you tell Lucene to compute and store term vectors
during indexing, and then you will be able to retrieve a Term Vector
for each Document in the index/collection.  Armed with this data you
should be able to compute similarities between Documents with TV dot
products/cosines, which should be enough for you to build your
similarity matrix.

This sounds like something that would be nice to have in the Lucene
Sandbox, so if you end up with some code that you are allowed to share,
please contribute it back to Lucene.
