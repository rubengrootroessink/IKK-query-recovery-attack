SUBJECT: Re: Lucene 1.4 RC 3 issue with temp directory
DATE: 18 May 2004

People frequently have problems when using Lucene with Tomcat.  I
recall somebody mentioning some security policy.  I use Jetty and don't
have such issues.
Regarding creating lock dir if it doesn't exist - sure.  I think we
have a bug open in Bugzilla for that issue.
