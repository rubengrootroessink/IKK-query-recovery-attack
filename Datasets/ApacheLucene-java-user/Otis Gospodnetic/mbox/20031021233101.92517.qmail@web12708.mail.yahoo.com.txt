So "phone boy" would match documents containing "phone the boy"?  That
doesn't sound right to me, as it assumes what the user is trying to do.
 Wouldn't it be better to allow the user to decide what he wants?
(i.e. "phone boy" returns documents with that _exact_ phrase.  "phone
boy"~2 also returns documents containing "phone the boy").

Sorry if I'm misunderstanding something, long day, plus 1:30 AM.
