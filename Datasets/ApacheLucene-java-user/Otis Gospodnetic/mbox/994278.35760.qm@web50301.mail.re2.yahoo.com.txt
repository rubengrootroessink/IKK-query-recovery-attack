I don't think there is anything more efficient than that....but I could be wrong.
If you can, consider grouping > 10 values in a small and discrete set of buckets (that
you can then OR), if you are concerned with a large disjunction query.

Subject: Query for "Bigger then" specific term

Hi,

What's the best way to query Lucene for a "bigger then" term, for example "
value > 10".

I know there's a range query where I can use a large upper bound but maybe
there's something more efficient (instead of Lucene transfrom to query to
thousands of OR queries).

Thanks,
Eran.
