You could do it with a custom HitCollector, no?

Subject: How to remove duplicate records from result

Hi,

I searched the index and i found say 1000 records but out of that 1000 records i want to filter
duplicate records based on value of one field.

is there any way except looping through whole Hit object ?
Because it wont work when number of hit is too large...

Thanks.
Bhavin pandya
