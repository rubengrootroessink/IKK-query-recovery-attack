Email java-user, not java-dev.

If those characters are in the index and your query doesn't get them, maybe they are getting
stripped from your query.
Print the query.  Try creating the query programmatically (not via QueryParser).

Hi All,
       I am trying to query for the Symbols(like @,#,%,&...) in Lucene
Index, but not giving any results, though the symbols are there in the
document. 
      Can anybody give a solution for the problem.

Regards
Sajid
