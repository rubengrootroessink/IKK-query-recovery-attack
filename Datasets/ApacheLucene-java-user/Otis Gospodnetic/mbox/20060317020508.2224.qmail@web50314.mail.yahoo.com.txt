Hello,

Somebody asked me if I knew any good Lucene people who'd be interested in some work that involves
a good amount of Lucene...

Here is some info.
The company is in New York City.  Full-time of contractors.  Ideally local, but remote work
with good candidates may be ok, too.
Work involves Lucene, fetching/crawling stuff from the Web, probably some feed fetching/parsing/indexing.
Their app touches (not sure how deeply at the moment) on Data Mining, NLP, etc.  There is
Named Entity recognition, content classification, very likely sentiment detection, etc.

It's a small company, and the CEO has a very good track record when it comes to career success.

If you're interested, send some resumes over.
