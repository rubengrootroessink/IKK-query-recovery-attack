This was the ooooold behaviour in Lucene.  You may want to check the ML archives to see why
the lock was moved to temp dir by default, I remember there being some discussion around that.
This might have been....2 years ago?

Sorry if this is a bit of a side-track, but it's about locking and this 
thread reminded me of it.

Would it be possible to have the lock file inside the text index 
directory itself?  I'd rather have my locks right next to the actual 
text index, so that even if a user is accessing it over a network it 
would still lock other users from writing to it.

I guess the system property could be set right before opening the index, 
but that isn't the best thread safety I could imagine.
