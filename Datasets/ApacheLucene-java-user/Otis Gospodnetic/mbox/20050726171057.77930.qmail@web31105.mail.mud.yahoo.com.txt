SUBJECT: Re: Analyzer or QueryParser problem?
DATE: 26 Jul 2005

You can use Luke to see what got indexed.  This will tell you what the
Analyzer did.
You can then use QueryParser from the command line (it's got a main
method), give it your input, and see what it returns.  This will tell
you what QueryParser+Analyzer did.  Oh, you use MFQP.  It may have a
main method, too, I'd have to check... To simplify, try getting it
working with the regular QueryParser first.
