SUBJECT: Re: Question about Boosting Fields in a Query
DATE: 27 Apr 2005

Hi Sven,

http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=search+boost+field
(hm, I was hoping to find something better)

You can use setBoost at search time: Query class has setBoost(float)
method, which you can use if you construct queries in the code, and
QueryParser supports ^float syntax, which puts the power in the hands
of people entering queries.
