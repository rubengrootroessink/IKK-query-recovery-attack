Nicolas,

That SF page is out of date now.
The best way to learn about different features right now is by reading
articles about Lucene (links on the site) or browsing the Javadocs
(also linked on the site).

Erik Hatcher and I are finishing up a book about Lucene.
Once published, this will be the most comprehensive and up to date
documentation about Lucene.
