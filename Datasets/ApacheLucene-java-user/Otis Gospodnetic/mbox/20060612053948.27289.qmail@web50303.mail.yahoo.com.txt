One (ugly) way might be to insert artificial begin/end markers at both index and search time.

Hi,

I have a small query here.

 

How do I do an exact match on the value of a field and also assert that the
value must match the entire content of that field?

For E.g., I want that only the documents with 'Product Lifecycle' as the
value of a given field must be selected and even documents with 'Product
Lifecycle Management' as the field value must not be selected.

 

Thanks in Advance.

 

Shivani
