As far as I know, the secondary sort really kicks in only when there is a tie caused by the
primary sort, so the secondary sort should not be affecting the primary sort.

Subject: Sorting by multiple fields (conditions influencing each other?!)

I'm sorting the search result using multiple fields. Some of them are 
"real" fields, within the index, but one is a "pseudo" field, a custom 
sort field, implemented by using a custom SortComparatorSource. I end
 up 
with the sorting conditions in exact this order:

1. Sort by score generate by custom SortComparatorSource 
(SortField.FLOAT, ascending, score is either 0.0 or 0.1), it's like a 
grouping
2. Sort by real index field (SortField.AUTO, descending, value ranges 
from 0 to 6)

Is it guaranteed, that the 2nd sorting condition, does not influence
 the 
1st one in any way, and that the results are everytime "grouped" by the
 
1st condition?

It's like that high values of the real index field used in the 2nd 
condition are sometimes have an impact on the grouping of condition
 one.

Any suggestions?

Tobias
