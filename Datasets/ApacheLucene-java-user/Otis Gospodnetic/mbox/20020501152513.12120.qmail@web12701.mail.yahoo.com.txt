There was not much/any discussion about this functionality, so one can
draw a conclusion from that easily :)

Commission in what sense?  The $en$e?
I think payment is out of question, but I would encourage you to take
the current Lucene snapshot, or maybe the next release, which is
imminent, and add this functionality to Lucene.
It sounds like if Lucene doesn't have this functionality you'll have to
spend a good amount of dollars anyway.
Damn, I'm not a very good salesman :)

I can't help with that, but maybe somebody else can.
