"Huge" is not very specific, and capacity also depends on hardware and
several other factors.  3 million documents (and yours would be small),
is easy for Lucene.

Sounds like you just need to limit queries to Boolean operators: AND OR
and NOT.  You can do that by creating queries manually, or changing the
QueryParser to allow only such queries.

No problem.  See Lucene's Field class.

I am not sure.  RDMBS are the tool to use for queries that use Boolean
logic.  You still could use Lucene to index your data by converting
each row in your database to a Lucene Document.
