SUBJECT: Re: numDocs method of IndexReader
DATE: 20 Apr 2005

Hello,

Yes, there is a limit, but it's pretty high:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#MAX_VALUE

Iterating the index like that is ok, but each call do
reader.document(int) pulls the entire Document off the disk, which can
get expensive.

The link to list archives should be on lucene.apache.org.
