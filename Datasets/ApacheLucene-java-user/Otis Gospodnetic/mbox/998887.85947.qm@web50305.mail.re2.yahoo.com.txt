I think others will have more thoughts on this, esp. for Numeric* questions... but I'll try
answering...

Yes, assuming the filter will be reused.  I think there is not a lot of value in using a filter
(vs. just a regular query) if that filter will not be reused.  This is why in Solr "fq"s (filtered
queries) are cached in a special filter cache.  I *think* the only other benefit of using
a filter query vs., say, TermQuery, is that the former will not spend any time/CPU on computing
the score for the filter part.

I think so.  See above.

I *think* it matters.  I think the more docs a filter matches, the higher the benefit from
reusing a filter.

I'm not sure...

If the cache hit rate is low, why waste memory on caching is what I would think is the logic
to apply here.
If you have 3 queries, and each uses a different date range query, then you will not see benefits
from caching..
If 2 of those 3 queries use the exact same date range query, then you will see caching benefits.

I'm not sure, but I'd be happy to add specific advice to Javadoc when the answer is clear.
