SUBJECT: Re: Indexing a large number of DB records
DATE: 15 Dec 2004

Hello,

There are a few things you can do:

1) Don't just pull all rows from the DB at once.  Do that in batches.

2) If you can get a Reader from your SqlDataReader, consider this:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html#Text(java.lang.String,%20java.io.Reader)

3) Give the JVM more memory to play with by using -Xms and -Xmx JVM
parameters

4) See IndexWriter's minMergeDocs parameter.

5) Are you calling optimize() at some point by any chance?  Leave that
call for the end.

1500 documents with 30 columns of short String/number values is not a
lot.  You may be doing something else not Lucene related that's slowing
things down.
