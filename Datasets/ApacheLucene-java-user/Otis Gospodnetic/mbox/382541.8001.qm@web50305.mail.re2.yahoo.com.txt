Hi,

If mergeFactor is set to 2 and no optimize() is ever done on the index,
what is the impact on

1) the number opened files during indexing

OG: it will grow a little, but frequently go down as Lucene merges segments automatically
during indexing.  The pattern is increase slowly-reduce rapidly, increase slowly-reduce rapidly,
etc.

2) the number of opened files during searching

OG: the trend will follow the trend for the number of files from 1)

2) the search speed

OG: fast

3) the indexing speed

OG: slower than if you increased the mergeFactor, as with mergeFactor set to only 2, Lucene
will merge segments pretty frequently.
