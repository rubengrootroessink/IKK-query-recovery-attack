Actually, this can be done by writing your own custom Analyzer.
Check this:
./org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardAnalyzer.java
./org/apache/lucene/analysis/Analyzer.java
./org/apache/lucene/analysis/de/GermanAnalyzer.java
./org/apache/lucene/analysis/SimpleAnalyzer.java
./org/apache/lucene/analysis/StopAnalyzer.java
./org/apache/lucene/analysis/WhitespaceAnalyzer.java

Maybe this last one is what you are looking for.
