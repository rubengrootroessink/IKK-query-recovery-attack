The easiest first step to try is to go from multi-file index structure to the compound one.

Subject: Lucene and Tomcat, too many open files

Hi,

What's the best way to manage the number of open files used by Lucene
when it's running under Tomcat?  I have a indexing application running
as a web app and I index a huge number of mail messages (upwards of
40000 in some cases).  Lucene's merging routine always craps out
eventually with the "too many open files" regardless of how large I set
ulimit to.  lsof tells me they are all "deleted" but they still seem to
count as open files.  I don't want to set ulimit to some enormous value
just to solve this (because it will never be large enough).  What's the
best strategy here?

I have tried setting various parameters on the IndexWriter such as the
MergeFactor, MaxMergeDocs and MaxBufferedDocs but they seem to only
affect the merge timing algorithm wrt memory usage.  The number of files
used seems to be unaffected by anything I can set on the IndexWriter.

Any hints much appreciated.

Cheers,

Nick.
