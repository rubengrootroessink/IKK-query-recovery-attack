Eric, you said you aren't using any Field.Index.NO_NORMS fields, but SegmentReader.ones should
only be used if you do use NO_NORMS, so things don't add up here.

Each indexed field has a norm array that is the product of it's
index-time boost and the length normalization factor.  If you don't
need either, you can omit the norms (as it looks like you already have
on some fields given that "ones" is the fake norms used in place of
the "real" norms).
