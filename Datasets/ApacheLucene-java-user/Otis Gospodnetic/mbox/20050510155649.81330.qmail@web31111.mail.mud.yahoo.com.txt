Hi Kai,

You could use HitCollector for this:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/HitCollector.html

Here are some bits about HitCollector:
http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=hitcollector+score
A custom HitCollector comes with the book, and you can download the
sources from the site, so help yourself. :)
