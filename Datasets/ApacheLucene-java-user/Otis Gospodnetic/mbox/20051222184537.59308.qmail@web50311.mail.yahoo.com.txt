moving this to java-user.

Hello,

Is anyone using ParallelReader the way Chuck is describing his scenario?  I remember looking
at the ParallelReader a few months ago and asking myself the same question: how can I update
only one of the parallel indices and still keep the documents in two indices in sync?

Thanks,
Otis

I also need the ability to achieve rapid updates.  ParallelReader is
attractive because my content naturally segments into a set of large and
small stored fields where the small fields need to be accessed quickly,
plus stable and mutable indexed fields where the mutable fields need to
be updated quickly.  Fortunately all the large fields are stable. 
Doug's comments in parallel reader seem to indicate it is designed to
solve this type of problem, but it is not clear how to perform the
update on only the mutable field index while keeping all indices
synchronized.

Is there a reason the update contrib cited below was not pursued; it
seems Otis had some interest in it initially?  It seems that integrating
this contrib with ParallelReader might be a good approach.  I'm going to
explore that and other approaches to this problem.  Any relevant
background or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Chuck
