SUBJECT: Re: Indexing HTML files give following message
DATE: 12 Dec 2004

Hello,

This is probably due to some bad HTML.  The application you are using
is just a demo, and uses a JavaCC-based HTML parser, which may not be
resilient to invalid HTML.  For Lucene in Action we developed a little
extensible indexing framework, and for HTML indexing we used 2 tools to
handle HTML parsing: JTidy and NekoHTML.  Since the code for the book
is freely available....... http://www.manning.com.  NekoHTML knows how
to deal with some bad HTML, that's why I'm suggesting this.
The indexing framework could come handy for those working on various
'desktop search' applications (Roosster, LDesktop (if that's really
happening), Lucidity, etc.)
