Hello,

If you search for India OR Test, you will find both, if you use AND,
you will find none.  Lucene can search any text, not just files.  It
sounds like you are using Lucene's demo as a real application (not a
good practise).  I suggest you take a look at the Resources page on the
Lucene Wiki to get a better idea about what Lucene is and how it can be
used.
