Either store it as a Keyword Field, which does not get Analyzed, or use
that per-field Analyzer wrapper class.
Your problem is most likely that you are using something like
StandardAnalyzer that, I believe, throws out numbers from its input
before indexing (i.e. your numbers are not getting indexed in the first
place).  Try with Field.Keyword.
