Jumping in at this point and not having read other responses, I think the function that Vangelis
is looking for is coord method in Similarity - that's for document terms/query terms overlap,
I believe.

I just did the same thing. If you search the list you'll find the thread 
where Hoss gave me the info you need. It really comes down to makeing a 
FakeNormsIndexReader. The problem you are having is a result of the 
field size normalization.
