SUBJECT: Re: Need for periodic full indexing?
DATE: 30 Nov 2004

You won't need to reindex everything, unless you change something about
your indexing.  For instance, if you change your Analyzer, or boost
fields/documents during indexing.  You will want to optimize your index
once in a while, that's all.
