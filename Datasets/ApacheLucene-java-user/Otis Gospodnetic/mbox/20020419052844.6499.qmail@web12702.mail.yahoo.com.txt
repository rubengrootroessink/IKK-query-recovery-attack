SUBJECT: HTML parser
DATE: 19 Apr 2002

Hello,

I need to select an HTML parser for the application that I'm writing
and I'm not sure what to choose.
The HTML parser included with Lucene looks flimsy, JTidy looks like a
hack and an overkill, using classes written for Swing
(javax.swing.text.html.parser) seems wrong, and I haven't tried David
McNicol's parser (included with Spindle).

Somebody on this list must have done some research on this subject.
Can anyone share some experiences?
Have you found a better HTML parser than any of those I listed above?
If your application deals with HTML, what do you use for parsing it?

Thanks,
Otis
