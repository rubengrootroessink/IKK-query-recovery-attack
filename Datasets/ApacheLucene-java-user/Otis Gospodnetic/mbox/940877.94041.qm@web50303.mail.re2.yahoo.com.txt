2.3 is in the process of being released.  Give it another week to 10 days and it will be out.

Thanks for yours suggestions.

I'm sorry I didn't know but I would want to know what Do you mean with
 "SAN"
and "FC"?

Another thing, I have visited the lucene home page and there is not
 released
the 2.3 version, could you tell me where is the download link ?

Thanks in advance.
Ariel
