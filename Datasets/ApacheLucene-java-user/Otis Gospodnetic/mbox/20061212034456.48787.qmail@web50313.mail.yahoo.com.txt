Nuno,

If you stop or block all operations that can change the index (e.g. deletes and additions),
you can safely copy the whole index directory.  If you do it from Java, you can use Lucene's
own Lock class to lock index for modifications, copy the index directory, and unlock the index.

Subject: dump/backup fs index catalog without stop it

Hi,

I have one java service that uses lucene as it's text search engine. This is 
working perfectly, but I don't know how to dump/backup it's filesystem index 
catalog.
Can I simply do a hot copy, without stoping the service and with index open?

Thanks in advance.
