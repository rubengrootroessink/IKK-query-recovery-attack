Subject: Max size of index (FSDirectory )

Hi,

is there any maximum size for an index?

OG: There is: doc IDs are currently integers, so max int size dictates the max number of documents
per index.  However, you are a lot more likely to be limited by hardware.

Are there any recommendations for a useful max size?

OG: it really depends on the size of documents, number of fields, hardware specs, the required
query latency, and so on.

I want to index in parallel. So I have to create multiple indexes.
Shall I merge them together or shall I let them as they are using
(Parallel)MultiSearcher?

OG: again, it depends.  If the index you'd get by merging is of manageable size, then merge
your indices.  Otherwise, use remote flavour of PMS and spread your indices over multiple
search servers.
