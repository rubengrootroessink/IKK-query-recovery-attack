No, you're not missing anything. :)
That JavaMail API is good for getting the whole email, but you then need to chop it up with
your EmailAnalyzer, so you're doing the right thing.

i dont see where i can break an email address into simpler pieces for 
tokens.  i use javamail when parsing the message and then pulling the 
email using InternetAddress.  I don't see where I can break an email 
address like john@foo.com into "john@foo.com", "john", "foo.com", "foo" 
and "com" without splitting it.  Am I missing something?

Thanks!
Michael
