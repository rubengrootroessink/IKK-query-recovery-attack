What typically makes searches case insensitive are Analyzers that
lowercase/normalize tokens, perhaps with LowerCaseTokenizers.  Since
Field.Keyword doesn't get analyzed, you'd have to manually
normalize/lowercase field values before indexing, or just add the raw +
the normalized value under the same field name.  It looks like you'll
have to reindex.
