Ivane,

Yes, you can use Lucene for this.  10 mil. documents is not much, if
you use adequate hardware.  You can use boost individual documents
(check the javadocs for Document and Field classes).

Are you aware of Nutch, though?  It sounds like you are not, and Nutch
is probably the best tool for the job (and it uses Lucene under the
hood). www.nutch.org
