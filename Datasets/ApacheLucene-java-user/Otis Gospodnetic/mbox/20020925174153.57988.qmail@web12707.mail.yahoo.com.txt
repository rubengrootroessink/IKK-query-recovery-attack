I don't see any mention of using Ant, in your email, so I assume you're
not using Ant to compile Lucene.  The first place to look then is
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/.
Read about it, download and install it, and then go to the directory
where you unpacked Lucene and type: ant jar

That will vreate a Lucene jar for you.

Note that you will also need to download and install JavaCC.
