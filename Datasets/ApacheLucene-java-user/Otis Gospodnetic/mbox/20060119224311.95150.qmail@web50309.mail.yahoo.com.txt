Hello,
For the first problem (indexing different types of documents), you can use the mini-framework
for doing just that.  Just get the source code that comes with Lucene in Action, and play
- http://www.lucenebook.com/

For the Analyzers, look what Snowball provides (do a search at lucenebook.com or google.com).
 I imagine only Dutch is supported, and I imagine you may be able to find a Bulgarian Analyzer
somewhere, but the other two languages may be harder ...

Subject: languages &  files 

Hi,

I begin working with lucene and need few explanations to do what i want,
thanks for your helpful answers.

I have to add lucene into a java application and I have two targets:

- To enable search throw different types of files, like MS Word, PDF or
Excel files. 
I read that each type of document must be indexed with the appropriate
indexer. So how can I do it easily? I found an API called Lius which
seem to index different types of documents directly, is anyone know this
product? Other ones?

- Secondly, the search system must work with different like Dutch,
Turkish, Bulgarian and tomorrow Tha√Ø or Chinese. 
The lucene documentation talks about using different Analyzer for none
ISO languages. Lucene's sandbox is quite empty, and I do not understand
which kind of treatment much be done to read correctly data. I think I
still have problem searching into indexed documents with accents. So how
should I work on the languages particularity?

Thanks

A
