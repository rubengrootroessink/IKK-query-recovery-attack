Hi,

If you want highlighting like this:
  http://simpy.com/simpy/User.do?username=otis&q=lucene
or like this:
  http://lucenebook.com/search?query=highlighter

Then you'll want to pull Lucene directly from SVN, and look in the
contrib/ directory, where you'll find classes for highlighter.  You can
then build a Jar for the highlighter and use it in your app.  The API
is simple (you can download the code from the Lucene book and see how
it's done).
