Shakti,

I think you provided the answer:
"sign* NOT Machine"
or
"sign* -Machine"

Hi all,

     I am using StandardAnalyzer() to index the data.

Actual data is: "signals by magnets of different strength"

I want to search for "sign* NOT Machine".....how can I do that??

I am using QueryParser.

Please help on this issue.

Thanks
Shakti Sareen
