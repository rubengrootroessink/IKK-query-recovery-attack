"title:Lucene author:Otis^2.0" for example.

You can also call setBoost(float) on the query object (see http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=setBoost
for some examples).

Hi List,

I'd like to have a query consisting of different keywords on different
fields, e.g. "title:Lucene" "author:Otis" with the second part having
boosted value of 2.

Assuming I use the same Analyzer for both parts of the query then how should
i compose my query ?

Thanks a lot.

Ng
