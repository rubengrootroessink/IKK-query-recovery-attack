Also, this question may be better for one of the Eclipse groups, because Eclipse already uses
Lucene for indexing (of help? code?), so they will be able to tell you how to integrate Eclipse
and Lucene.

First off: i've changed the reply to be the java-user@lucene list ... that
is the appropriate place to ask questions about using the Lucene APIs.

Second: once you have a test index built, and you can do some test
searches to verify it contains what you think it does (take a look at Luke
to be sure) read up on the IndexReader.terms method and the TermEnum class
-- it's the easiest way to get a list of every term in your index.  Then
takes a look at IndexReader.termDocs and the TermDocs class -- that's how
you can get a list of every document that matches a particular term

:
: Hi, I want to create a back-of-book type index for Eclipse help (not
: available by default). This index will list all indexed terms such that the
: indexed term may be clicked and the original document displayed (as in MS
: style help systems).
:
: Where should I begin? The first thing I suppose would be, how do I access
: the indexed terms (using Lucene's API) and have them e.g. display on a HTML
: page with hyperlinks to the original doc.
:
: Any help appreciated.
