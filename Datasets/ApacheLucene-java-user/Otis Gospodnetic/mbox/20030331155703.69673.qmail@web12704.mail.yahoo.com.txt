Amit,

When you emailed me privately I suggested using lucene-user list, not
lucene-dev.  I'm moving this thread to lucene-user.

My guess is that your problem has nothing to do with index size (40 MB
is not very big), but that the index got corrupt.
You didn't provide much information (e.g. Does the directory in
question even exist? What's the contents of it? etc.).
