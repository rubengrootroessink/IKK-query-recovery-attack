I think I recall somebody sending an email with that same Verify error
(but not relating to PDFBox), and I believe the person said it had to
do with a corrupt Jar.

In your case the error is also not in PDFBox, but rather Log4J.

That line 57 of PDFParser.java should probably look like this:

<access modifiers + optional final/static> Logger <var> =
Logger.getLogger(PDFParser.class);

If you have the source of that class, make sure it looks like that.
