Hi Sharad,

I've done this on Simpy.com.  You can see it in action if you create some Watchlists and Watchlists
Filters in Simpy.
The neighbourhood is pulled from the DB, and the search uses a MultiSearcher to search that
neighbourhood.

Subject: searching in social networks

I am using lucene for simple flat searches. Now I have a requirement to 
do searches based on the object's connectivity with other objects. The 
way the searches are done in "social networks". Lets say I want to 
search for a query in only those objects which are within 3 degrees of 
connectivity to a given object.

Has any body tried this kind of feature with lucene? Any pointers will 
be appreciated.

thanks
sharad
