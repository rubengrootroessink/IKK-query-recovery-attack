Hi,
If some mispellings are very common, you could also turn them into synonyms.  I have not tried
finding any information about this, but I *think* Google may be doing that.  I run a social
service called Simpy at simpy.com and have Google Alerts for "simpy", but those alerts often
contain matches on "simply".  So Google must account for people often misspelling the word
"simply" as "simpy" and using synonyms is one way to handle this.  Look at the synonym stuff
in Lucene in Action or even Solr for for to implement this type of stuff.

It would probably be very expensive to analyze each query token and  
decompose it using some word list or index.

If "apple computer" is a phrase that is common in your query, then you
  
can create a new field with chained tokens: "think diffrent apple  
computer" -> "thinkdiffrent diffrentapple applecomputer". This would  
at least allow you to search for such typos. You might want to set  
some threadholds like min/max token size and such in your TokenFilter.
