There is no API for that.  You could look at the modification time of
index files, but this is a hack-ish approach, and is not always correct
(index files get modified for other reasons, too, such as deletion).  I
think that the index version (IndexReader class) is actually a time
stamp of last modification, but again this is not for document addition
only.

This is so easy to add to an application that uses Lucene.  Why not
just keep track of last add date in your app?
