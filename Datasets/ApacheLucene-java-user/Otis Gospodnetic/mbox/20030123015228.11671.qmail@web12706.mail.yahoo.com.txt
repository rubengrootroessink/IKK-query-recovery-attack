This question is more appropriate for lucene-user.
You may also get more help there.

While locking is disabled with a global system property, you normally
set properties with -D command line options when invoking java.  If you
do want locks, don't use -D.
I am assuming that you are not mixing indices that need locking and
those that should not be locked in the same invocation of your Java
application.

There is also nothing in the code that disables locks forever - only
during the Java invocation with -DdisableLuceneLocks=true.
If you subsequently start your application without that -D.... business
the locks will be used again.
