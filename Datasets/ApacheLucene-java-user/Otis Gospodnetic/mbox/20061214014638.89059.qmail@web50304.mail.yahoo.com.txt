Hi,

But isn't "coord" + TFIDF pretty intuitive?  Independently, they are both useful and contribute
to the final score for the match.

Hello Paul,

thank you for providing the link to that paper. I read it again, and you are right. I discovered
the following text part:

"In normal term co-ordination matches, if a request and document have a frequent term in common,
this counts for as much as a non-frequent one; so if a request and document share three common
terms, the document is retrieved at the same level as another one sharing three rare terms
with the request. But it seems we should treat matches on non-frequent terms as more valuable
than ones on frequent terms, without disregarding the latter altogether. The natural solution
is to correlate a term's matching value with its collection frequency."

If I do not misunderstand that extract, I would say it suggests the  combination of coordination
level matching with IDF. I am interested in your view and those who read this? 

Are there any other papers that regard the combination of coordination level matching and
TFxIDF as advantageous?  

Cheers,
Karl
