Hi Klaus,
If you use a single instance of IndexWriter, you can call addDocument(...) on it without synchronizing
(things are thread safe inside the call).  If you are opening/closing IndexWriters yourself,
then you have to make sure you have only 1 IndexWriter open at a time.
If you have Lucene in Action, check out section 2.9.1 - http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=concurrency+rules

Hi 
I'm using Lucene in a web application. Every time a new object is added to
the system the index will be updated. May there be any problems, if two
objects were created at the same moment? I know Lucene has some locking
mechanism. 

Thx

Thank you so much for your reply.

I know that you answered this question before. I just
wanted to post the question to receive more feedbacks
and share the information.

Thanks again.
