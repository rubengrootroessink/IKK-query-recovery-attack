Mike,

Do you really want to tokenize your emails?  StandardAnalyzer may in fact recognize email
addresses and leave them as one token, but it would probably be better practice to make that
email field UN_TOKENIZED.

Most of the time when people have trouble finding a Document they _know_ is in the index,
the problem involves Analyzers, and sometimes the QueryParser+Analyzer combination.  Grab
Lucene in Action code and run the app that will take your input and pass it through various
Analyzers to get an idea what's happening with your test field.

Subject: Lucene query question

I am new to Lucene, but the behavior that I am seeing does not seem to
make sense to me.  I am using the latest version of Lucene (1.9.1) and
executing the following code below which creates an index with a
single document and only one field (named "test") with a value of
"richmondmike@gmail.com".

If I use Luke to search through this newly created index using a query such as:
"test:richmondmike@gmail.com" I do not get any matches.  However, if
using Luke I browse to the document and click the "Reconstruct & Edit"
button then without making any changes save the document I can then
rerun the same query and it will find the document!

Is this normal?  The only thing I can think of is that the index was
created with Lucene 1.9.1 and is being searched using Luke (which was
probably written using an older version of Lucene).  Any help would be
greatly appreciated.


Thanks in advance,

Mike

iw.close();
