Uh, this is a very broad question.
A number of things could be wrong.
Look at your Tomcat log files.
Write a class that you can run from the command line, not as a servlet,
that may be easier to debug.  You can use one of the demo ones to get
started.
Log things, don't catch exceptions and ignore them, etc.
Check that your index directory exists, that it is readable by the user
doing the searchs, etc. etc.
