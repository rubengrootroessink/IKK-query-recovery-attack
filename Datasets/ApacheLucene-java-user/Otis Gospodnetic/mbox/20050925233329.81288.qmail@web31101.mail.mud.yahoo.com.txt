For dealing with parsing + indexing RTF, see chapter 7 of Lucene in
Action.

For indexing text that has multiple languages.... I don't know what to
recommend.  Well, I do - try the StandardAnalyzer and see if that
produces satisfactory results, but you'd really need a smart analyzer
that knows how to properly tokenize and filter words from multiple
languages, and I haven't heard of anyone doing that here.
