How up-to-date do these searches have to be?  If they don't have to be
exactly up to date you could periodically re-create the IndexSearcher,
instead of checking for a ne ndex version on every search.  I think 
person from Moreover.com posted some code that may be relevant.  Maybe
3-4 months ago, maybe 6...it had to do with re-reading the index in the
background for sorting purposes, if I recall correctly.
