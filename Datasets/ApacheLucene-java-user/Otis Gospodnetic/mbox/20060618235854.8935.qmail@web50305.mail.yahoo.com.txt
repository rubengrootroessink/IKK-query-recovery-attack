Andreas,

Not a problem.  As a matter of fact, when I first saw Splunk months ago, I thought to myself
"Are they using Lucene for this?"  I've had the same idea a looong time back, but of course
that's just one of many ideas I didn't have time for.

Subject: Lucene as syslog storage

Hello,

I would like to write a application to browse around and search the log
files of linux machines, like www.splunk.org does.

Would lucene be the right db to store such text information ?
Because the log info should be stored in the db continuously and not as
batch, this would create many thousand small documents. Is this a problem
for lucene ?

Bye
Andreas
