Siegfried,

My guess is that the '.' is accidental and there is nothing special
about '.'.  I've used PDFBox+Lucene and it worked well.  Are you aware
of Lucene-specific classes included in the PDFBox distribution?  You
may be able to use those classes, or you could at least look at their
source, to make sure you're using both PDFBox and Lucene API correctly.

Also, how long is the extracted text?
See this:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#maxFieldLength
Maybe that's the problem.
