Hello Ard,

What you are after is a higher mergeFactor and probably also a higher maxBufferedDocs.  Is
indexing performance the concern?
Don't go crazy with setting a super high (e.g. 100+) mergeFactor, unless you really have the
number of open files on your server(s) set to a solid/high number. maxBufferedDocs can be
set to a much higher number, typically, depending on the size of the documents you are trying
to index and the amount of heap the JVM has to work with.  There is also a new API for explicit
flushes of in-memory documents while indexing to control memory consumption.

Correction: 10 for the smallest (just created) segments of course, because obviously merged
segments are likely to contain many more documents
