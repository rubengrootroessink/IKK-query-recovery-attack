SUBJECT: Re: Creating a complete Lucene distribution
DATE: 26 Jan 2003

Hello Jeff,

Thanks for offering your help.
My take on this is that those who are new to Lucene need to get
acquainted with the core Lucene first before they start needing things
like stemmers for different languages, a web crawler, etc.

Then as long as we make it easy for people to read and learn about each
Sandbox project and make it easy for them to download their JARs, we
will make it simple for them to start using those projects.

Currently only Indyo and LARM projects include overview/tutorial-like
documentation, but they do not provide pre-built JARs - the only way to
get them is from CVS directly, which is a bit more of a pain.
Snowball stemmers don't have any docs (do they even need them?), but
the project includes a link to the JAR, which makes it easy for a
developer to include it in their projects.

SearchBean is buried completely, and so are all other Sandbox
contributions and projects (circa 10 of them).

If you want to help I think it would be nice to expose some of those
contributions/projects the same way LARM, Indyo, and Snowball Stemmers
are.
I'm not sure if you feel like doing that, as it's not the most exciting
work :)

Thanks,
Otis
P.S.
This thread may be more suitable for lucene-dev - lucene-user
subscribers probably don't care about this type of decisions much.
