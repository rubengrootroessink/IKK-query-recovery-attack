Hello Chetan,

The code that comes with the Lucene book contains a little framework
for indexing rich-text documents.  It sounds like you may be able to
use it as-is, and extending it with a parser for Excel files, which we
didn't include in the code (whould we include it in the next edition?).
 While PDFBox comes with that handy Lucene-specific class that you are
using, it may be better for you to be in control of how exactly you
construct your Lucene documents.
