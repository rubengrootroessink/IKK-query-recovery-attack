Parag,

I'm not sure if I understood your question correctly, but it seems like
you want to create a Field that holds the path information (e.g.
TEST/subdir1 or TEST/subdir2, and so on), and then include that in the
query based on which path(s) you want to search.
You could use TEST to search just TEST, TEST/subdir1 to search just
TEST/subdir1, or TEST* to search everything under TEST.
