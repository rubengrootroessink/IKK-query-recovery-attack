I am not sure if I understood you 100%, but it sounds like you might be looking for KeywordAnalyzer:

Could
someone let me know the best Analyzer to use to get an exact match on a Unix
filename when it is inserted into an untokened field. 


Filenames
obviously contain spaces and forward slashes along with other characters. I am using
a WhitespaceAnalyzer but when the query is parsed it is
chopped into different keywords as such: 


I have
tried several different Analyzers but I canâ€™t seem to get what I want.






Filename:
/repository/Administration/780 IT Support/filegate.txt 
Query:URL:/repository/Administration/780
URL:IT URL:Support/filegate.txt






I am
assuming that this would be in common usage with Lucene but there does not seem
to be an easy way to do it.
