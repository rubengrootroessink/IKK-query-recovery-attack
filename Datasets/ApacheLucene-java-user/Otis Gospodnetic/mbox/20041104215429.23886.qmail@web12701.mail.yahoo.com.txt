SUBJECT: Re: Is there an easy way to have indexing ignore a CVS subdirectory in the index directory?
DATE: 4 Nov 2004

Hm, as far as I know, a CVS sub-directory in an index directory should
not bother Lucene.  As a matter of fact, I tested this (I used a file,
not a directory) for Lucene in Action.  What error are you getting?

I know there is -I CVS option for ignoring files; perhaps it works with
directories, too.
