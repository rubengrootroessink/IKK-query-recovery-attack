Luke probably uses Lucene's TermEnum class, which is the class you, too, can use to get the
list of terms.

I note that Luke is able to create and display a list of all words in 
the dictionary in descending order of frequency, but I would like to be 
able to get a simple list of all words in the dictionary, preferably in 
a file.  I can clearly modify Luke to do this, but i hoped that someone 
else had already done something similar.

thank you.
