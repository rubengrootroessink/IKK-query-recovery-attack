Rob,

Here are some ideas.

1. Which version of Lucene are you using?  HEAD from CVS?  If so,
FSDirectory was patched recently (renameSomething method), make sure
there is no bug in it.

2. IndexReader/IndexWriter allow you to set the stream for logging 
(can't remember the method name now).  Those classes will then print
out what they are doing to that stream.

3. Write a simple class that opens your index before any queries are
made and prints out the number of documents, the number of terms, etc.
Then run your queries, and run the application again and see if the
numbers are different.

4. Do as in 3, but run 1 single query.  Observe difference between pre
and post-query numbers.  Run another query.  Observe the difference in
numbers again.  Is there a pattern?

5. To make sure it's not some background process adding documents, run
your application (from 3.) twice, but without querying the index, just
waiting some time between runs.
