Tobias,

The question is a little too open, I think.  Perhaps start by saying what you've tried, what
doesn't work, what you think won't work, the actual rate of change, the size of your index
and, very importantly, how quickly you need to see index changes (adds, deletes, updates).

How about this for the boostrap question: just update (delete+add) the whole Document and
reopen the IndexSeearcher every N minutes.  Would that work for you?

Does only the stored data change or also searchable data?  If the former, you could choose
to store that in the external data store (e.g. RDBMS, BDB...)

Subject: Integrating dynamic data into Lucene search/ranking

I have a more architectural question, which is maybe sort of off topic,
 but as I want to implement it using Java  and Lucene, it's the right
 forum however:

I'm thinking of an approach to design a system that integrates dynamic
 information into a search (and a ranking) functionality using Lucene.
 With dynamic data I mean, data which changes very often within the
 typical index rebuild cycle, i.e. transactional data.

A good example is the sorting of products in an online store by product
 availability.

Does anybody know good reading resources (approaches, whitepapers,
 books etc.) for integrating such dynamic information into a search/ranking
 functionality?

(I already searched at Google, but couldn't find anything useful
 though.)

Thanks in advance!
