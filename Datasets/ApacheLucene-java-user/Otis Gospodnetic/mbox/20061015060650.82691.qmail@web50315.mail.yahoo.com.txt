The javadoc is right. :)

Hi guys,
I am a newbee so excuse me if this is a repost. From the javadoc it seems
Reader.deleteDocuments deletes only documents that have the provided term,
but the implementation examples that I have seen and from the behaviour of
my own app, deleteDocuments(term) deletes documents that don't have the
given term. Can someone clarify this for me?

Thanks
Edmond Kemokai.
