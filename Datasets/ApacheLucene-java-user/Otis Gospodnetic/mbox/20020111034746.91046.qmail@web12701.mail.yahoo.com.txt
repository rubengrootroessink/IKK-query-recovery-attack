Hello,

Funny, I was just wondering how Lucene compares to Texis the other day.
Yes, I guess Lucene doesn't have any caching.  Perhaps this could
easily be added by making use of one of many caching projects that seem
to be popping up under Jakarta (jakarta.apache.org).

Winston, if appropriate, could you share some of the changes you made
to Lucene to support the query rate that you mentioned?

Thanks,
Otis
