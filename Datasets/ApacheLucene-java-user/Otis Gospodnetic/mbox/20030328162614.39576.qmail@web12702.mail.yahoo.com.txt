SUBJECT: Re: I: incremental index
DATE: 28 Mar 2003

Adding a new document does not immediately modify an index, so the time
it takes to add a new document to an existing index is not proportional
to the index size.  It is constant.  The execution time of optimize()
is proportional to the index size, so you want to do that only if you
really need it.  The Lucene article on http://www.onjava.com/ from
March 5th describes this in more detail.
