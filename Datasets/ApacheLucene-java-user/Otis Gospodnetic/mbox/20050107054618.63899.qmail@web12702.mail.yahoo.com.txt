DATE: 7 Jan 2005

Hi John,

There is no API for this, but I recall somebody talking about adding
support for this a few months back.  I even think that somebody might
have contributed a patch for this.  I am not certain about this, but
check the patch queue (link on Lucene site).  If there is a patch
there, even if the patch no longer applies cleanly, you'll be able to
borrow the code for your own patch.  Also note that the CVS version has
support for field compression, which should help with performance if
you are working with large fields.
