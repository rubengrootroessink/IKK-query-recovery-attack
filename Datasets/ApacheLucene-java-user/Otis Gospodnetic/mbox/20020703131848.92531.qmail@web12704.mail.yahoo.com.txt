There is nothing special to it, really.
With Struts or with anything else you'll use Lucene in pretty much the
same way.  With Struts you should write your business logic classes,
JavaBeans or whatever, and call them from your own Struts Action
classes (from perform()).  In those business logic classes write the
code that uses Lucene.  See the user guide, the included demo, etc. for
code samples.

As for indexing RTF, PDF, M$ Word files, etc., that is covered by an
entry in Lucene's FAQ on jGuru.  Why do people never check FAQs before
asking?  Hm, this is probably a FAQ, too.
