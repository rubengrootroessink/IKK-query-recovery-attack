Hi Doron,

Yes, this was great help, thanks!  I've got my:
1. MatchTask (just like ReadTask, but with searcher.match(Query, new MatchCollector() ....))
2. SearchMatchTask (just like SearchTask, but extends MatchTask), so I was able to use "SearchMatch"
in the alg file where "Search" was before.

I need to compare search with HitCollector to matching with MatchCollector, and leave both
of their their collect(...) methods empty in order to see how much time, if any, is shaved
off with Paul's patch that simply skips scoring.  Thus, I've modified ReadTask locally to
use the search method with HitCollector instead of the one that returns Hits.

I'll put both the new benchmark Tasks and my results in LUCENE-584 once I have something (tomorrow,
most likely).

Otis

Hi Otis, you could use the byTask package - add your-type-of-search-task.
Suffix the new task class name by "Task" - e.g. NewNameTask - and then you
can use the 'command' "NewName" in an alg file.

I am not sure you can extend/reuse the existing ReadTask for this, because
its implementation of search/retrieve/traverse assumes using certain
Lucene's API's.

Does this make sense?

Regards,
Doron
