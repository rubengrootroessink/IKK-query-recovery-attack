I won't flame, but you just hijacked somebody else's thread.... baaad

No need to be afraid of Lucene nor SAX.  Have you got a copy of Lucene
in Action?  If not, consider getting at least a PDF version (cheaper)
and peeking at its code (free) - see http://lucenebook.com/ .  If you
look at chapter 7, you'll get most of the code you need for indexing
XML.

I'm not sure what you are trying to do.... take look at LIA code.  If
that doesn't help, start a new thread, show the code, and somebody may
be able to provide some advice.
