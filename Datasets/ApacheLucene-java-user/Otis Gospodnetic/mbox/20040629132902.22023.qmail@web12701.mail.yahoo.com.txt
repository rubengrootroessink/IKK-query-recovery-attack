Steve,

Answer to your last question: that's right.
Lucene does not know what field you use as your PK (unique document
identifier), so it cannot merge hits and remove duplicates.

As for converting Vector to Set.... HashSet set = new HashSet();
set.addAll(YourVectorInstance);
Does that work for you?  Vector isA Collection.
