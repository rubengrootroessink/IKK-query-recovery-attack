Hi Simon,

You can index an empty field ("" value), but there is no point in doing that, really.
If you index am empty string, you will not be able to find documents that had that field empty.
You will not be able to do a WHERE foo IS NULL type of query, unless you detect an empty field
during indexing, and put a dummy value it in instead of am empty string.

Hi Otis,

well if i have to such a query I need a "dummy" value. To point that
out a bit more in detail...
A xml document has "n" mandatory elements described by a schema or
dtd. Some of the could have empty values. Would it make any difference
to the index / searching  if I just index an empty string?! Well I
guess not, to index an empty string feels good for me to have all
fields in every document. This tiny little disc space does not matter
I guess.

Is that true so far?!

regards Simon

you'll actually have to stuff a "dummy" value when no real value for field F is present. 
If you have an index schema, perhaps that's a good place to add a 'defaultValue'-type attribute
with that dummy value.  Perhaps Solr already has something like this, I'm not sure.
