Jayant,

That is not possible, as far as I know.
Have you tried using HitCollector (see
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/HitCollector.html)?
I have not used it much, but it may be a tiny bit faster.  If you are
re-running the same query, you may also benefit from
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/CachingWrapperFilter.html
