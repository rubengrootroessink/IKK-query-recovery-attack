I thought this was the case.  I believe there was a bug in one of the
recent Lucene releases that caused old CFS files not to be removed when
they should be removed.  This resulted in your index directory
containing a bunch of old CFS files consuming your disk space.

Try getting a recent nightly build and see if using that takes car eof
your problem.
