Hi Feng,

That's a question for java-user, not java-dev.
Borrow the code from Lucene in Action - www.lucenebook.com - it has what you need.

Subject: index local file system by lucene

Hi there,

I wonder how difficult to implement lucene to index the local file system,
such as, word file or pdf file. I know conceptually, it should work with
lucene.

Any existing package does the similar effort?

thanks,

Feng Ji
