It really all depends....right Erik?
On the hardware you are using, complexity of queries, query concurrency, query latency you
are willing to live with, the size of the index, etc.  A few million sounds small even for
average/cheap hw.  I have several multi-million document indices that are constantly hammered
over on Simpy.com and we use Lucene at Technorati to index "the blogosphere", so you can imagine
those numbers.  To handle that much data things needs to be heavily distributed, of course.

Subject: How many documents in the biggest Lucene index to date?

I have used Lucene to index a small collection - only a few hundred  
documents.  I have a potential client who wants to index a collection  
which will start at about a million documents and could easily grow  
to two million.

Has anyone used Lucene with an index that large?

Thank you very much.
