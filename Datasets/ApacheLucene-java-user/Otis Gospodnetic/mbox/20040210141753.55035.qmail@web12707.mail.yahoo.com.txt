I didn't really measure anything, I only observed this, as my focus was
something else, not performance measurements.
It is true that every time an insert/add triggers a merge operation,
things will slow down, but from what I recall (and this was about 1
year ago), the overall performance was steady as the index grew.

Documents were articifially created from random dictionary words.
Their size was variable, but not by a lot.
