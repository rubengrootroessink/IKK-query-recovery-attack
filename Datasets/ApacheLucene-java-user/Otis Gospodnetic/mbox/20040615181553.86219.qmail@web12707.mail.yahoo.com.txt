SUBJECT: Re: indexing with 1.4-rc3 only yields single .cfs file
DATE: 15 Jun 2004

We switched from multi-file to compound index structure in one of the
recent RCs.  This should be mentioned in CHANGES.txt file.  The change
was made to make it more difficult for people to reach 'Too many open
files' situations.
