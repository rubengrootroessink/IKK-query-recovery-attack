That sounds a little low.  I'll assume that you profiled your whole
application, which leaves room for something else slowing things down,
and I'll suggest you write a standalone application whose only task is
to index documents as quickly as possible.  Hm, this reminds me that
I've written stuff like that twice, once for O'Reilly's OnJava site:
http://www.onjava.com/lpt/a/3273 and once for Lucene in Action.  Both
contain free code, which should help you figure out if it's really
Lucene or your other code.

If you write something that's standalone I could run it on my machine
and report the results.

Oh, and check this: http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/benchmarks.html
