DATE: 28 Mar 2003

I believe it takes constant time to add a new document to an index
because when adding a new document a new segment is created on the
disk, 'separate' from the other, existing, index segments.
The size of the index may come into play when this new segment has to
be merged with the existing segments, which happens every mergeFactor
documents, so to speak.
I have built indices with several hundred thousand documents, but never
notices the increase in time to add a new document to an index.  Maybe
the difference was too small to notice.  I don't have sufficient
knowledge of Lucene to be able to stand behind this 100% and I could
certainly be wrong :(.
