Hi,

Some things that could be different:
- thread scheduling (shouldn't make too much of a difference though)

--- I would also play with disk IO schedulers, if you can.  CentOS is based on RedHat, I believe,
and RedHat (ext3, really) now has about 4 different IO schedulers that, according to articles
I recently read, can have an impact on disk read/write performance.  These schedules can be
specified at mount time, I believe, and maybe at boot time (kernel line in Grub/LILO).
