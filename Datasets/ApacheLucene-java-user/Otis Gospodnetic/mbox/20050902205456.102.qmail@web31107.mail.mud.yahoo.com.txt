Hello,

Valmir, I'm replying to java-user@ list, as it's better for this type
of questions.

Lucene has no built-in security features.  Some people use Lucene's
Filters to accomplish show/hide-type security.  If you have a copy of
the Lucene book, you'll see that covered in section 5.5.3 (
http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=security+filter )

Basically, you can create an index that has field(s) with a set of
different values.  Then, you create (and probably cache) a Filter for
documents that have a given value (e.g. a Filter for all documents that
have the security field value of "admin", another Filter for all
documents that have the security field value of "guest", etc.).  Then,
when you search, you can use this Filter to show only one set of
documents.  

You can download Lucene in Action code and look at:
./src/lia/advsearching/SecurityFilterTest.java
