No, using the same IndexWriter is the way to go.  If you want things to be written to disk
more frequently, lower the maxBufferedDocs setting.  Go down to 1, if you want.  You'll use
less memory (RAM), Documents will be written to disk without getting buffered in RAM, but
the indexing process will be slower.

Thanks Otis.  All the documents were written in a using the same 
IndexWriter, without ever closing it.  Is this what could be responsible for 
the documents not being in the segmens file, or is this bad practice?  Maybe 
I should use a writer for a batch of documents (1000 or so maybe?), and then 
discard it and start with a fresh one.  Would this help?
