Leonard,

Make sure the "key" or "id" fields are not analyzed and that should solve your problems.
You are using some older version of Lucene?

> documentkey  - alphanumeric field which is stored as TEXT
> contents - text of document which is stored as TEXT

> When I changed index to define documentKey as KEYWORD the updates started to

> However, search for documentKey using StandardAnalyzer stopped working.

> It appears that lucene is using keywordAnalyzer for searching for the term

> The sample values that are stored in documentKeys are: "L2222FAHBHMF", 
> "L2222FAHBHAS".
> I noticed if documentKey is numeric value, both KeywordAnalyzer and 
> StandardAnalyzer can find the documents by it without any problem thus reader

> get both to work.
> Any help is appreciated.
