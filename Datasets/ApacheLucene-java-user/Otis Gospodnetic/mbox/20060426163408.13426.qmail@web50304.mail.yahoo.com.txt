SUBJECT: Lucene search benchmark/stress test tool
DATE: 26 Apr 2006

Hi,

I'm about to write a little command-line Lucene search benchmark tool.  I'm interested in
benchmarking search performance and the ability to specify concurrency level (# of parallel
search threads) and response timing, so I can calculate min, max, average, and mean times.
 Something like 'ab' (Apache Benchmark) tool, but for Lucene.

Has anyone already written something like this?

Thanks,
Otis
