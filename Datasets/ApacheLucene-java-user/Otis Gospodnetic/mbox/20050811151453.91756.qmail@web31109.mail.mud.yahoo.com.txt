And if you look at the size of your JVM, does it really use all 512 MB?
If it does not, maybe you can try this:

  java -Xms256m -Xmx512m -jar Suchmaschine.jar

If that doesn't help, it would be good to run this under a profiler and
see what eats your memory.

P.S.
I recall reading that using the same amount for Xms and Xmx results in
better performance.  Also, consider using -server option (Hotspot), if
you are using Sun's JVM.
