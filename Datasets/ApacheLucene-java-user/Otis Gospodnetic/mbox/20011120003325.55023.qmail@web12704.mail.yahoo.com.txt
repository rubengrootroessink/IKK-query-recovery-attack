SUBJECT: Re: Html documents parsing
DATE: 20 Nov 2001

This is a question similar to the Meta-Tags question posted to the list
earlier today (or was it yesterday?).  Lucene distribution includes a
few simple applications that demonstrate what Lucene is capable of and
how it can be used.  But those demos are not relaly a part of Lucene
code.
It is up to you to write the application around Lucene, which in your
case would include HTML parsing.

Perhaps JTidy (http://jtidy.sf.net/) could come handy here...
