SUBJECT: Re: Search Question - not returning desired results
DATE: 25 Nov 2003

You have to look at Analyzers.
Figure out which one you are using and why, and see if you should be
using a different one or even write your own.
Some of the Analyzers break input on certain tokens (e.g. . or _ or
...), which sounds like the problem is here.

I think Erik's java.net article about Lucene may explain some of these
things.
You could also look at Lucene's unit tests to understand Analyzers
better.
