Uma,

I think the problem is that in order for one to help you get started
with Lucene, one would have to also help you with servlet containers,
etc.  If you learn how to write a simple servlet, and how to deploy it
into your servlet container, then you will know how to deploy something
that uses Lucene, too.
Do you know how to write a simple servlet and how to deploy it?
