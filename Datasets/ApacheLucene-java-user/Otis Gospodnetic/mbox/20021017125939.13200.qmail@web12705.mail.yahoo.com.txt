SUBJECT: Re: Integrating the PDF Extract With Lucene!!!!
DATE: 17 Oct 2002

Once you extract the content of the PDF and have it in your String
variables, you can create Fields with them, then create Documents with
Fields, and finally add those Documents to IndexWriter, which indexes
them.

Please look at the demo code that comes with Lucene first.
