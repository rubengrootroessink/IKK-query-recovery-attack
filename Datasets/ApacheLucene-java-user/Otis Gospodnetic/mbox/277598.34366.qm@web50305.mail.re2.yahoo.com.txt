Is that 1GB heap or 1GB RAM?

These days 3GB of RAM is very little even for a laptop. :)

The more you hit the machine, the more resources it needs.  The more resource intensive the
queries (e.g. sorting?  fuzzy?  wildcard?), the more resources they'll need.

One instance of Lucene/Solr I looked at today has an index with < 5M not very large documents,
but high query rates and relatively expensive queries hitting a 20GB index.  Each of 10 servers
has 8 cores that were only about 30% idle.  This is just an example.  Each case is different.

I don't think so.  When an app hits OOM, I think it doesn't have much control over its destiny.
