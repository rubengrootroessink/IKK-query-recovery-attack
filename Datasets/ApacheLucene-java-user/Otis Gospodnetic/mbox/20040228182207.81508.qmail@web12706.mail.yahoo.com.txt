I'm not sure what happens on Windows, but this should work just fine
under UNIX.  The files still really do exist on disk, I believe, they
are just not visible after you delete them, and under UNIX the process
will still have a references to deleted index files (inodes is the
proper term in this context, I think) even after optimization, so
IndexSearcher will work.
This is easy to test.
