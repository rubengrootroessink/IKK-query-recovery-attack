I think:
- Get the number of documents from IndexReader.
- Go from 0 to that number.
- If reader.deleted(docId) == false
    get doc
    output doc fields' content

Hi,
I'm going to attempt to output several thousand documents from a 3+ million document collection
into a csv file. 
What is the most efficient method of retrieving all the text from the fields of each document
one by one? Please help!
 
Thanks,
Malcolm
