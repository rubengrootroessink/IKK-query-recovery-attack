I don't fully understand what you mean by increasing the maximum string
size.  Are you referring to the length of terms in the field, so now
your field can contain terms whose text/string value can have the
size/length of 10,000 bytes?

If that is so, I believe there is an internal (to Lucene) maximal term
length limit, which could be changed.
