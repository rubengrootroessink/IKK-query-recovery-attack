Hi Patrick,

If I were trying to do this, I'd modify QueryParser.jj to construct the grammar for boolean
operators based on something like Locale (or LANG env. variable?).  I'd try adding code a
la:
en_AND = AND
en_OR = OR
en_NOT = NOT
fr_AND = ET
fr_OR = OU
fr_NOT = SAUF

And then:
if (locale is 'fr')
 // construct the grammar with fr_*
...

Something like that.

Hi,

Is there a way to add / replace the text for the boolean operators used
by the query parser?

We would like to replace (or even better, add), "AND", "OR" and "NOT" by
"ET", "OU" and "SAUF".

Is there a way to configure the QueryParser to do it?

We know we could always modify QueryParser.jj to add them to the list,
but we'd rather like not to have to recompile/rejar each time there is a
new version of Lucene.

Thanks
