Hello and quick answers:

See IndexWriter javadoc and in particular mergeFactor, minMergeDocs,
and maxMergeDocs.  This will let you control the size of your segments,
the frequency of segment merges, the amount of buffered Documents in
RAM between segment merges and such.  Also, you ask about calling
optimize periodically - no need, Lucene should already merge segments
once in a while for you.  Optimize at the end.  You can also experiment
with different JVM args for various GC algorithms.
