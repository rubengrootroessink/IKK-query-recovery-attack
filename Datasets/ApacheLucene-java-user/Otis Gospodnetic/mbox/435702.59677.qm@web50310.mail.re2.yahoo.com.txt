Why not just design your system to roll over to a new index on a weekly a basis (new IndexWriter
on a new index dir, roughly speaking)?  You can't partition a single Document, if that is
what you are asking.  But you can create multiple smaller (e.g. weekly indices) instead one
large one, and then every 2 weeks archive the one > 2 weeks old.

Subject: Archiving Index using partitions

Hi,

 As a requirement I need to be able to archive any indexes older than
2 weeks (due to space and performance reasons). That means I would
need to maintain weekly indexes. Here are my questions,

1) What's the best way to partition indexes using Lucene?
2) Is there a way I can partition documents, but not indexes? I don't
want each partitioned index to be a full index, as that would be waste
of space. We collect over 10K new documents per min (with each
document around 250 bytes).
3) Is ParallelMultiSearcher the way to go for partitioned indexes? Do
I ever have to merge these partitioned indexes?
4) I'm hoping I can reload the archived indexes in future if needed.

Not sure if there is a standard way to archive the indexes using
 Lucene.

Thanks,
