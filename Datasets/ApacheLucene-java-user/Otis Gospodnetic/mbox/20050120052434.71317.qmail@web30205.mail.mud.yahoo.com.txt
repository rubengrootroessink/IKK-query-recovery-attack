Going for the segments file like that is not a recommended practise, or
at least not something I'd recommend.  'segments' file is really
something that a caller should not know anything about.  Once day
Lucene may choose to rename the segments file or some such, and the
code that uses this trick will break.

To answer the original question, yes, I think it would be handy to have
this method back.  Perhaps we should revive it/them, ha?
