I spoke to one person whose company runs searches over 300 indices with
either MutliSearcher or ParallelMultiSearcher, and apparently this is
not an issue.  I never had to search so many indices at once.  The
person is on this list, so maybe he will speak up and share more of his
experience with this setup.
