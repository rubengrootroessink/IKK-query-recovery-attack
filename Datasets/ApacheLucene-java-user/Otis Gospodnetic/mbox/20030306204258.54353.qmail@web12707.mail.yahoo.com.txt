Hello,

I changed the Subject line for obvious reasons.

I'm in the same boat as Tatu, as I didn't understand all your
points...and I still don't :(  But some other things became more clear
from this email, so I'll comment on those.

I don't follow the indexing part, but you can certainly perform
distributed searches.  They are not parallelized currently, so searches
will run one after the other, but...

If I understand you correctly, then maybe you are not aware of
RemoteSearchable in Lucene.
This is from CHANGES.txt:

   9. Added class RemoteSearchable, providing support for remote
      searching via RMI.  The test class RemoteSearchableTest.java
      provides an example of how this can be used.  (cutting)

This is the point that's more clear to me now.  There is confusion
about what Lucene is and what it is not.  Lucene does not even try to
be what those services you mentioned are.  Their goals are different,
they are a different set of tools.  Lucene's focus is on indexing text
and searching it.  It is not a tool to query other existing search
engines and parse returned HTML, etc.  It is also not a tool that wants
to have a built-in web crawler, and so on.  It's small and simple on
purpose, and comparing it with SavvySearch (still exists??), Harvest,
Dogpile, etc. would be like comparing apples and oranges.

Not sure I follow.  I certainly don't think of Lucene as a CMS.  Just a
text indexing and searching library.
