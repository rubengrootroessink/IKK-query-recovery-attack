Yes, 2GB files are a common problem.
I think the answer to your question is negative.  However, in case you
are using Linux please note that the newer kernels have support for
very large files (i.e. files over 2GB).
Also, FreeBSD and 64-bit OSs don't have that limit either.

This is an OS, not Java limitation.

Some people have reported that they have successfully created indices
over 2GB in size, but they were probably running one of the operating
systems that don't suffer from this limitation.
