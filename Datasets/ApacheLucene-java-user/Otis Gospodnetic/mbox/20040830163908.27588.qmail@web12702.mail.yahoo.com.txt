Ernesto,

Don't add "no" as a stop word, that's not going to solve your problem.
My suggestion would be to use
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Explanation.html
to see what's making that short document have a higher score.

The higher ranking is probably due to this method:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html#lengthNorm(java.lang.String,%20int)

The solution for this is to create your own Similarity sub-class and
override that lengthNorm method.  Perhaps you want it to return 1.0.

See the top of Similarity javadocs for how to set your own Similarity
subclass.
