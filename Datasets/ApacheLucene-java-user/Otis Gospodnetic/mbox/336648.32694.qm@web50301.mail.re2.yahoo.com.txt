Scoring cannot be turned off, currently.  I once thought it is possible to skip scoring with
the patch in LUCENE-584 JIRA issue, but I was wrong.

Subject: How to ignore scoring for a Query?

Hi,

I have two different use-cases for my queries. For the first,
performance is not too critical
and I want to sort the results by relevance (score). The second however,
is performance critical,
but the score for each result is not interesting. I guess, if it was
possible to disable scoring
for the query, I could improve performance (note that omitNorms on a
Field is not an option, due
to the first use case).

Is there a straightforward way to disable scoring for a query (its a
BooleanQuery btw with some
clauses, which can be any other query).

Thanks,
Ben
