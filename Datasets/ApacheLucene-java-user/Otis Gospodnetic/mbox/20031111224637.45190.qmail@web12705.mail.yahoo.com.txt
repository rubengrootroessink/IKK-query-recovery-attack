No.  You should close IndexWriter first, then open IndexReader, then
call delete, then close IndexReader, and then open a new IndexWriter.

No, it is not safe.  You should close the IndexWriter, then delete the
document and close IndexReader, and then get a new IndexWriter and
continue writing.

Incidentally, I just wrote a section about concurrency issues and about
locking in Lucene for the upcoming Lucene book.
