There is also an impl in Lucene's own contrib/miscellaneous.  You can optionally specify the
field you want to limit terms to.

To answer my own question; I've just found the HighFreqTerms class in

Hopefully this a straight forward question, but what's the recommended
approach for finding the most frequent terms in an index?  Should this

Paul.
