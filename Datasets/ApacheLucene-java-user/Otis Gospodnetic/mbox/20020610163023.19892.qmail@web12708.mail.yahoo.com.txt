Hello,

I'm sending this to lucene-user list, as that seems more appropriate.
I haven't used Lucene's slop feature, but it looks like both
QueryParser and PhraseQuery have support for slop.  I am not sure what
the syntax for it is, but if nothign else you should be able to call
setSlop(int) method on an instance of PhraseQuery.

Oh, it looks like you missed it in the Query Parser Syntax document:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html
