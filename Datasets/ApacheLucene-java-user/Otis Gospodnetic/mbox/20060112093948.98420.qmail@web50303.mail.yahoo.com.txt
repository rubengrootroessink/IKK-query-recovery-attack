I don't think so.  It's still a single segment.  Close the reader, and you still have only
one segment.  You only have gaps from deleted docs, but I think that doesn't make the index
unoptimized, even though optimizing such an index will remove the gaps.

Do we need to check if any documents are marked for deletion?
