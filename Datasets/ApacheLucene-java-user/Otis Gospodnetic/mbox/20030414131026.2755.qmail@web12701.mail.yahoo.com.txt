But if you use the same Analyzer with the same stop words for both
indexing and searching, then queries like "apples and oranges" _will_
find matches, even if "and" is included in the stop word list.
This will work because "and" will be dropped from both indexed text
_and_ from the query string.
However, "apples and oranges" will also find documents that contain
"apples XXX oranges", where XXX is any of your stop words.

As for your query, I don't know, try it and see.  The computer will
tell you :)
