Marvin,
I wrote my Lucene search benchmarker, but will have to check with my employer about contributing
it to Lucene.  It's rather simple - I used Java 1.5 concurrency package's ThreadedPoolExecutor
for executing N parallel search requests, measured elaphsed time for each request, and then
when all searches were done, I calculated min/max/median/percentile/etc.

I'm about to.  The predecessor to the indexing benchmarker tests I  
recently published results for was enormously helpful while  
streamlining the indexing process.  Now that I'm considering  
modifications to search logic and file format which may have a  
substantial impact on search-time performance, I'll need a search  
benchmarker to complement the indexing benchmarker.  I'll be writing  
a both a Perl/KinoSearch and a Java Lucene version, and they will use  
the Reuters corpus.

Where are you at with your app?
