SUBJECT: Case studies for Lucene in Action 2nd edition
DATE: 12 Aug 2008

Hello,

We are working on Lucene in Action 2nd edition.  One of the well received chapters from LIA
#1 was the Case Studies chapter.  Case studies in this chapter are from external LIA contributors
who were willing to share information about how they use Lucene.

We want to refresh this chapter for LIA #2.  It's time for some new case studies.  If you
are using Lucene in some clever or unusual way and are willing to share this information,
please get in touch.  Feel free to respond on the list or reply to me directly.

Thanks!

Otis
