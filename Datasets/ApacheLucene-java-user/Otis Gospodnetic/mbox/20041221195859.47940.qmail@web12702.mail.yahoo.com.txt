Hello,

I think some of these questions maaaay be answered in the jGuru FAQ

Only if lots of documents are being added/deleted, and you end up with
a lot of index segments.

Are not optimized indices causing you any problems (e.g. slow searches,
high number of open file handles)?  If no, then you don't even need to
optimize until those issues become... issues.

Possibly, see my answer above.
