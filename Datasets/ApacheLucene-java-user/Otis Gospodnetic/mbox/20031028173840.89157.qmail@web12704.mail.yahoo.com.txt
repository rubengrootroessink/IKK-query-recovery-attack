SUBJECT: A book about Lucene coming soon to a book store near you
DATE: 28 Oct 2003

Hello,

Erik Hatcher and I are in the process of writing a book about Lucene.

Among other things, we would like to include 'Lucene Patterns' /
'Lucene Best Practices' type of material in the book.

If you feel that you have observed and/or implemented Lucene usage
patterns that look like they represent good Lucene usage, please feel
free to write to either Erik or me, or to lucene-user list.

Similarly, as Erik already mentioned in an earlier email, we will be
including some case studies in this book.  If you have developed an
application that uses Lucene, and uses it in a clever, innovative, or
interesting way, and would like to contribute a short case-study,
please let Erik or me know, so we can learn about what you have done
with Lucene.

We welcome any other suggestions for the book.  If you have any, please
email us directly, so we don't polute the mailing list.

Thanks,
Otis
