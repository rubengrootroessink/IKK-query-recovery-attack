Lucene in Action (print and ebook/PDF) cover Lucene 1.4.3.  Most of what's described in LIA
still applies to Lucene 2.0 and even the development version, although some APIs have changed
(the concepts are mostly the same).  There will be LIA2, and Erik might send a relevant email
in a few hours.

1.4,  Is the book updated with Lucene 2.0? I don't have any information
about it.
Appreciate your help
