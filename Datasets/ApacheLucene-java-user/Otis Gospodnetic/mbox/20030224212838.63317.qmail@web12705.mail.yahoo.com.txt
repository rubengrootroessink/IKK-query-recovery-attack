SUBJECT: Re: Indexing Tips and Hints
DATE: 24 Feb 2003

Things to consider:
- disk speed and whether it is busy satisfying other processes'
requests
- CPU speed
- amount or free RAM in the machine and amount of RAM given to your JVM
- the bottleneck - could be a slow XML parser, for instance, profile it

I'm about to submit another Lucene article to Onjava.com.  It talks
about the performance of indexing.  I don't know when exactly it will
be published, but when it does I'll send the URL to the list.
