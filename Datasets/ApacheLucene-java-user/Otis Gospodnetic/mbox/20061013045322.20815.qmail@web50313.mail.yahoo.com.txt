Gecko? ;)
My advice: stay away from EJBs as much as you can.  They are too complicated and too heavy
for most systems.  Servlet containers like Jetty, Tomcat, or Resin are often perfectly suitable
for the job and a lot simpler.

Subject: a design question

Hello,

This is a design question: For Lucene to be able to process a million
documents and in the purpose for the search application to be scalable
and still have a good response time do we need to use an EJB container
such as Weblogic or is a Servlet container such as Tomcat sufficient to
do the job? This design should take into consideration remote searching.

Thanks,
Mohamed
