Hi Ratnesh,

1. There is no need to use that many question marks, really.
2. Use java-user list, not java-dev
3. You cannot delete using negative criteria.  You can delete 1 Document using its document
ID, or you can delete 1 or more Documents using a Term where you specify a field name and
a value.  So, you can delete all Documents that have a field X with value Y, but you cannot
delete Documents that do *not* have a value Y in field X.

This must be in the FAQ, is it not?

Subject: IndexReader.deleteDocuement(); How to use it with our code??


HI,
I have written a plugin which finds out "object" tags url and store it in
the index with "objects" fields.
I am intrested in getting only those url's which has "object" tag but
instead I get all the urls to be indexed.

So what I want is to delete some unwanted urls which don't have "object"
tag.

So how shall I do it??

Can nybody help me resolving this issue???
