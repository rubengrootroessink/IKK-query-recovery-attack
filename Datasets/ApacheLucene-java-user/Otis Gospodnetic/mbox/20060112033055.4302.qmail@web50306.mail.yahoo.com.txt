Kan,

Some (all?) of what you described will typically be handled for you by the file system.  Yes,
the JVM would blow up with a OOM error if the index is too big to fit in RAM.

Subject: Cache index in RAMDirectory and evict

Hi, there, 

In "Lucene in action", it mentions in Section 3.2.3
"reading indexes into memory" that, 

"...RAMDirectory's constructor can be used to read a
file system-based index into memory, allowing the
application that accesses it to benefit from the
superior speed of the RAM:

   RAMDirectory ramDir = new RAMDirectory(dir)"

Some questions here need help,

1. Suppose the content in the FSDirectory index is
read-only, but since it is so big that it exceeds the
capacity of the JVM heap space. When constructing a
RAMDirectory to cache the entire FSDirectory, will it
blow the JVM?

2. How to cache into the RAMDirectory with the most
frequently used index parts from the FSDirectory?

   The purpose is that to serve search query, first of
all, search it in the RAMDirectory, if missed, goto
FSDirectory. 

   My question is how to implement this
RAMDirectory-based cache. I assume it takes 3 steps.
Is it an appropriate workflow?

   a) Search in the RAMDirectory. 
   b) If missed, search in the FSDirectory
   c) Add the documents from the FSDirectory to
RAMDirectory, 
      and remove some less frequently used document
from the RAMDirectory to save memory consumption. 


3. To make the cache mechanism more powerful, we can
count the frequency of the usage of every document in
the RAMDirectory, and evict those less frequently used
documents. 

   How to implement the eviction? In details, is it
good enough by counting the usage of each documents in
the index, and delete those documents not used very
often? Any better idea?


thanks,
Kan
