increase the mergeFactor (how much depends on what the limit of open file descriptors is on
your machine)
increase maxBufferedDocs (how much depend son how much RAM you've got and how big is your
JVM heap)

I covered this in a Lucene article on onjava.com in 2003, I think.

How could I optimize my index creation?
        // setUseCompoundFile(?);
        // setMaxBufferedDocs(?);
        // setMergeFactor(?);
 
How could I reduce the disk access because I work with more than 1000000
documents?
Thanks
