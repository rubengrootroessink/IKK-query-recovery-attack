There are actually several distributed indexing or searching projects in Lucene (the top-level
ASF Lucene project, not Lucene Java), and it's time to start thinking about the possibility
of bringing them together, finding commonalities, etc.

Here is the summary:
- Lucene - distributed search via ParallelMultiSearcher.  How you split indices/shards is
up to you.
- Solr - distributed indexing via SOLR-303 (see DistributedSearch on its Wiki).  How you split
indices/shards is up to you.
- Nutch - see its org.apache.nutch.ipc (I think).  How you split indices/segments is up to
you.
- Nutch - see the bottom of http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/Nutch2Architecture

There is also Hadoop:
- Using MapReduce + HDFS to build a single Lucene index in a distributed fashion (see contrib/
in Hadoop)

There is also GridLucene project somewhere on the web...
