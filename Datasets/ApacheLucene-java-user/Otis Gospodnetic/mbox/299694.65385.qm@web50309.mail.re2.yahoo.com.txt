Questions like these are always hard to answer well.  Actually, no, they are easy, right Erik:
"It depends" ;)

Just kidding...partially.  Anyhow, you should ask a few more questions then:

- what is the response latency? (average, median, Nth percentile...)
- are stored fields involved, if so how many and how big are they?
- what kind of queries are involves (some are costlier than others)
- what is the search rate?

Hi,

I have some question about the index size on a single machine:

What is your biggest index you use in production?
Do you use MultiReader/Searcher?
What hardware do you need to serve it?
What kind of application is it?

Thank you.
