Maybe it's Lucene.Net-specific - you are on java-user mailing list.

Hi,
I saw that article and it tells me that increasing the mergeFactor speeds up
the indexing. But the reverse had happened in my case.
To be more specific I had conducted some experiments for 1000 documents. The
time taken is quite large, due to pdf file indexing. I had changed the
indexwriter's parameters.

MergeFactor  default(10)
minMergeDocs  default(10)
Time taken  690 sec

MergeFactor  50
minMergeDocs  default(10)
Time taken  765 sec
MergeFactor  default(10)
minMergeDocs  100
Time taken  670 sec

MergeFactor 100
minMergeDocs  100
Time taken  738 sec
Increasing the mergeFactor did not speed up, but increasing the minMergeDocs
had improved. I am using Lucene.Net.
Can you explain the behavior. I am confused
