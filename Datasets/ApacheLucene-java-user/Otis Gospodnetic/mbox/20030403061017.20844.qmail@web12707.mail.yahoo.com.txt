Amit,

Please don't mail both lucene-user and lucene-dev.  This is a message
suitable for lucene-user.
If people are not answering your message, try providing more
information, different information, not re-sending the same message.

I'm not a big Windows user, so I don't know how you can increase the
limit for the maximum number of open files on Windows.  It looks like
that is at least a part of the problem.
What's the current number of open files on your machine?
Don't ask how to find that out, I don't know, that would be a Windows
question.

Otis
