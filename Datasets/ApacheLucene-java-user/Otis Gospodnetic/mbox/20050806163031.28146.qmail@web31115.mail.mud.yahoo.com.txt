If you store only IDs in Lucene, you won't be able to search using
keywords (text).

It's up to you to pick the route.  Going to PG-only route probably
means less powerful searching.  Going PG+Lucene route means you have to
maintain PG and Lucene data in sync.  In my experience, doing the
latter is not very hard.  Another option to consider is talking to PG
people and exposing them to Lucene4c, which they may want to embed in
PostgreSQL.  That way you get PG+Lucene in a single package.
