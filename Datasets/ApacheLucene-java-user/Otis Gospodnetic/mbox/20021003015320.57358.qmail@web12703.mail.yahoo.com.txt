SUBJECT: Re: 1.2 source jar incomplete?
DATE: 3 Oct 2002

Judging from a very cursory look at build.xml I'd say it's probably due
to how the source build process is set up.

Target package-tgz-src depends on package-src, which in turn depends on
jar-src, which creates that jar, that then gets packages in a .tar.gz
file by the first target.
