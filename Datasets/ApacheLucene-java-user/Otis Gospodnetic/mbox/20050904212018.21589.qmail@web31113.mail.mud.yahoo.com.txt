Hi Jeff,

This is a tough question to answer, because there is no universal
answer.  The choice of Analyzer depends on what/how you are trying to
index/search.  I've used analyzers from the Lucene distributions, but
have also written specialized ones.  My suggestion for you is to start
with the StandardAnalyzer, as it covers most users' needs.  Then, if
you encounter problems, come back with the description of the problem,
and we'll try helping.
