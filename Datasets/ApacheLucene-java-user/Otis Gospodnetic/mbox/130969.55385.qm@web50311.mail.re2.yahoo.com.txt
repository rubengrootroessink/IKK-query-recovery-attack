Hi Stefan,

While not directly th source of your problem, I have a feeling you are optimizing too frequently
(and wasting time/CPU by doing so).  Is there a reason you optimize so often?  Try optimizing
only at the end, when you know you won't be adding any more documents to the index for a while.

I'm also wondering why you close/open the IndeWriter, as it looks like you are doing batch
indexing.
