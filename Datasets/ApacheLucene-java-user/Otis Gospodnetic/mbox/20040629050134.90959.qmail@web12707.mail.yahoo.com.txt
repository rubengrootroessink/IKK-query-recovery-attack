Mark,

Tough situation.  I hate when things like this happen on production :(.
 You are not mentioning what you are using for various IndexWriter
parameters.  You may be able to get this working by tweaking them (see
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#field_summary).
Hm, now that I think about it, I am not sure if those are considered
during index optimization.  I'll try checking the sources later.
