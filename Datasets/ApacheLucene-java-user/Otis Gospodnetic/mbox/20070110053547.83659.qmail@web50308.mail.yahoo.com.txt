Hi,

I agree.  I wrote a custom class and it actually works in the 1, 3, 2 order below.  I changed
FieldInfos to non-final, but I think that's it.
Actually, my class doesn't do 1 yet.  This used to work:

        // unpack cfs
        writer = new IndexWriter("/tmp/fnm", new SimpleAnalyzer(), false);
        writer.setUseCompoundFile(false);
        writer.optimize();
        writer.close();

But this doesn't seem to work any more.  I think now one has to modify the index ... holllly,
nice conditional in optimize()! :)

Would adding forceOptimize() to IndexWriter be a good thing?

  public synchronized void forceOptimize() throws IOException {
      flushRamSegments();
      int minSegment = segmentInfos.size() - mergeFactor;
      mergeSegments(minSegment < 0 ? 0 : minSegment);      
  }

Then the above cfs unpacking with writer.forceOptimize() call works.

Yes, that would work for some custom code.  Step (2) might even be
done for you if you do step 3 first and then do an optimize.

This stuff seems more like the exception than the norm :-) though, so
I think it might not be worth the burden of supporting it in the
public API.
