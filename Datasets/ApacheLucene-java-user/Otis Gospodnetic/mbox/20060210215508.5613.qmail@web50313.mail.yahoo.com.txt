SUBJECT: Performance and FS block size
DATE: 10 Feb 2006

Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone has tested Lucene indexing/search performance with different file
system block sizes?

I just realized one of the servers where I run a lot of Lucene indexing and searching has
an FS with blocks of only 1K in size (typically they are 4k or 8k, I believe), so I started
wondering what's better for Lucene - smaller or larger blocks?  I have a feeling 1K is too
small, although I don't know enough to back up this feeling. :(

Thanks,
Otis
