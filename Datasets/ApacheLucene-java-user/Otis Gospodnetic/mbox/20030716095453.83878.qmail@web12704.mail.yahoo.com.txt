Michel,

Regarding file uploads, I am not sure, but you should really ask that
elsewhere.  I am not sure where.
Regarding indexing only updated files, that is easy.  When indexing
your files, store the last modified date in a field in your index. 
Then, when re-indexing the files, get their last modified date from the
file system, and compare them to the date stored in the index.
