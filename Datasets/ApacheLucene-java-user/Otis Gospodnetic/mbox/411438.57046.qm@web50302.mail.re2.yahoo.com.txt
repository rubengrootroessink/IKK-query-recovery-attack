SUBJECT: Re: Typical Indexing performance
DATE: 3 Jun 2008

There i really no "typical".  I'm playing with Hadoop (HDFS) and Solr at the moment, for example,
and I'm seeing indexing rate of cca 70 docs/second.  However, the bottleneck there is not
indexing, it is reading data from HDFS (over the network).


I've also seen 500+ docs/second.

It depends on many factors:
how fast reading your data source is, how complex your analysis is, the size of documents
and number of fields, whether fields are stored or only indexed, the IndexWriter settings
for segment merging and memory usage, of course, there is hardware, etc.
