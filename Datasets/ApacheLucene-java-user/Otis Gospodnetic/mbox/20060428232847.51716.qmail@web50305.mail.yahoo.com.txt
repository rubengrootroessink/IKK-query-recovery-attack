SUBJECT: Scoring without floating point calculations
DATE: 28 Apr 2006

Hello,

Apparently Sun's Niagara servers have a weak FPU, and I don't need my matches to contain floating
point scores, so I would like to avoid floating point calculations when scoring, if possible.

Doing a quick `grep -R ' float ' *` in the source tree shows a number of places where floats
are used: various *Score and *Scorer classes, various Query classes, Similarity, etc.

What would be the easiest way to plug in my own non-float scoring?

Thanks,
Otis
