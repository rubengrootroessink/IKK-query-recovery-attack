SUBJECT: Re: clean up html before indexing or add tags to ignore list
DATE: 13 May 2004

Clean up seems cleaner.  Just extract the textual information from HTML
using NekoHTML or JTidy or HTMLParser (.sf.net) or some such.

You can also get fancy and preserve the 'structural' information (e.g.
H1 text is more important that H2, which is more important than BODY,
which is more important that DIV, etc.) and combine it with field
boosting at index time.
