Richard,

WhitespaceTokenizer (the tokenizer that WhitespaceAnalyzer uses) really just tokenizes on
space characters:

  /** Collects only characters which do not satisfy
   * {@link Character#isWhitespace(char)}.*/
  protected boolean isTokenChar(char c) {
    return !Character.isWhitespace(c);
  }

Subject: Phrase Query query


Hi

I'm using PhraseQuery in conjunction with WhiteSpaceAnalyzer but it's
giving me slightly unusual results. If I have a text file containing the
text (quotes are just for clarity):

"Hello this is some text"

I don't find any results when I search.

But if I put spaces before and after the phrase:

" Hello this is some text "

then it does work. I'm breaking the phrase down into Terms, and setting the
slop to '0' by the way.

I'm kind of see that this makes sense, given the name: WhiteSpaceAnalyzer.
But aren't newlines, carriage-returns etc also treated as whitespace?

Thanks for your help!

Regards
