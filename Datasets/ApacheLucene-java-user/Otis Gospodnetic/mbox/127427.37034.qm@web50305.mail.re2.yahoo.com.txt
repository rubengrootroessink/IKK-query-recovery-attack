Couldn't you construct a phrase query with ngrams a la "fo oo ob ba ar", augmented with individual
ngrams that are required, a la:
"fo oo ob ba ar" fo oo ob ba ar

If there are ORs between terms, missing ngrams won't prevent a match.

I am using ngrams and I need to force that a group of them are together, but
if any of them fails, I need that the document is also scored. Perhaps you
could help me to find the solution or give me a reference of which changes I
must do. I am using SpanNearQuery, because the ngrams must be in order.
Thanks for your answer.
