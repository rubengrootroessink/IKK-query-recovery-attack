For what it's worth Mark (Miller), there *is* a need for "just highlight the query terms without
trying to get excerpts" functionality - something a la Google cache (different colours...mmm,
nice).  I've had people ask me for this before, and I know I could use this functionality,
too.  Please contrib to contrib/ if you end up working on this.

No doubt. I certainly am not suggesting you ditch fragments and I have 
no evidence more people just want to highlight a doc...it's just the 
impression that I get from the mailing list is that most people just 
want to highlight the returned doc...I am sure plenty of people need 
google style results too, but my experience with Lucene has not often 
been in the area of web search engines. I bet a lot of users would 
benefit from a highlighter that highlights actual hits and doesn't 
summarize though (both would be great). I wouln't claim to be an 
authority on any of this though...take my opinion for what its worth -- 
very little.

I have some code that you wrote that seems to turn almost any query into 
a series of spans. Perhaps it is not as robust as my limited testing 
made it seem.

Non of them seem to do full span highlighting...again based on my 
limited investigation.

thanks for the tip.

I appreciate your response Mark. I will continue to look at your span 
extractor...I thought that it alone was enough to what I wanted, but 
your comments seem to suggest maybe I'll need more. I hope not <g> If I 
do manage something I will be sure to post my results.
