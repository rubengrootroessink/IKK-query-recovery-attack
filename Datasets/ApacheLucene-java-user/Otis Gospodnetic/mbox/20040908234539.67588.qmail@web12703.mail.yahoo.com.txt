Dave,

I haven't tried this, but I think this would be messy.  Lucene needs to
keep index files open, so that when you pull a Document from Hits, it
can read this stuff from those files.  If you close index files, you
are likely to get some NPEs or some such.

I don't think you'll find a ready to use API for this use case in
Lucene.  Instead, my guess is that you will have to manually keep track
of your IndexSearcher's status (open/closed), and allow searches to
return results only if status == open.
