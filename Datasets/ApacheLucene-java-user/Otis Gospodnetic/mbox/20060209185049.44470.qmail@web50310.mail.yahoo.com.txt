Daniel,
If you end up trying all 3 options here, please report your findings (speed/memory).  I'm
about to rework some of the Lucene stuff behind Simpy.com, and am looking at Filters used
this way (+ sort by date or some int) more and more.

Thanks,
Otis

: I think that overriding getFieldQuery would work, yeah... you're right.
:    It's just a matter of comparing efficienty of this:
:
:      BooleanQuery of (TermQuery, FilteredQuery of (AllDocsQuery, Filter))
:
: to the efficiency of this:
:
:      FilteredQuery of (TermQuery, Filter)

the third option is as easy to impliment as the first, and probably close
to being as efficient as the second...

       BooleanQuery of (TermQuery, ConstantScoreQuery(Filter))
