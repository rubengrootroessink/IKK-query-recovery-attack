Look for File Formats page on the left side of Lucene's home page.  Some of that is also in
Appendix B of Lucene in Action, but the web version is more up to date.

hi, when i try to view my index with luke i get the loading error: "No 
sub-file with id _18.f0 found".

any ideas what could be causing this?

im using IndexWriter.setUseCompoundFile(true)

in the past it has worked fine without any problems, im on win xp with java 
1.5
