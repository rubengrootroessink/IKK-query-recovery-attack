There is no direct support for that.  However, if one of your documents
contains _only_: "brown fox", won't a search for "brown fox" give that
document the highest score, as it is the closest match, allowing you to
just pop the first hit?  It's no guarantee that the first hit is the
exact match (what if there are no exact matches in the index), but
that's a simple check to perform in your application.
