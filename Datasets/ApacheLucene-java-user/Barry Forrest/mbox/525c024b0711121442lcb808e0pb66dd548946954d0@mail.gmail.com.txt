OK here are some of the details of one index directory.  The number of
indexed documents is approximately 1.5million.

$ ls -1 |wc -l
29542

$ du -hs .
90G     .

$ // Show space used (in GB) by file extension.
$ for filetype in `ls -1 | sed -r "s/.*\.(.*)/\1/" | sort -u` ;\
  do echo -n "filetype=$filetype: " ; (echo -n "scale=2; \
  (" ; (for size in `ls -l *.$filetype| cut -c 24-34`; do \
  echo -n "$size+"; done) ; echo "0)/10^9") | bc; done

filetype=fdt: .44
filetype=fdx: .01
filetype=fnm: .01
filetype=frq: 15.95
filetype=lock: 0
filetype=nrm: .03
filetype=prx: 70.94
filetype=tii: .12
filetype=tis: 8.79


So most of the space is occupied with .prx files.

Thanks
