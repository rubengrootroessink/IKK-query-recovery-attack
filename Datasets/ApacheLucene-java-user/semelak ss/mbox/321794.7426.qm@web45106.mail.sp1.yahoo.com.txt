When using Luke,, searching for the followings gives me hits now:
"insurer storm"
The synatx of the query as parsed by Luke is :
word:"insurer storm"

The code I am using is as follows:
----------------------
_searcher = new IndexSearcher(INDEX_DIR);
_parser = new QueryParser("word", new WhitespaceAnalyzer());
Query q = _parser.parse(query);
System.out.println(q.toString()); // this outputs ->  word:"insurer storm"
TopDocs vv= _searcher.search(q, 1);
Hits tmph = _searcher.search(q);
---------------------------------

both vv and tmph give no results (their size is 0)
