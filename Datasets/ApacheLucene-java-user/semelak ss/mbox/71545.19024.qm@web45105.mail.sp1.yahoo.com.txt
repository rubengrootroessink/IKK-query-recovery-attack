SUBJECT: Exact Phrase Query
DATE: 31 Oct 2008

I have documents containing multiple words in the the field "word"
for example, one of the documents contain in the field "word" the following:
homeowners work

When searching for single words (i.e. homewoners ) I get hits.

However, searching for the exact phrase "homeowners work" gives me no hits!! I use the double
quotes when searching for exact phrases.

Any idea why ??
