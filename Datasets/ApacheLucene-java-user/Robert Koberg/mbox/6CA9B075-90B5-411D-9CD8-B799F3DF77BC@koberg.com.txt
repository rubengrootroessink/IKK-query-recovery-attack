SUBJECT: best way to compare Documents
DATE: 31 Jan 2010

Hi,

Just coming back to Lucene after a few years.

Is there some convenient way to compare Lucene Documents?

I want to check if I should update a document based on whether field values have changed and
whether fields have been added or removed. 

Is it as simple as:

newDoc.equals(oldDoc)

?

I don't need to create the newDoc first, so I could compare by field. I am creating Fields
like so:

new Field("modified", modified, Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED)

So, would it be better to:
* check oldDoc's fields count against the to be created documents desired fields count, and
* loop through the fields and compare values

?

Is there a better way to create Fields and/or Documents for this type of thing?

thanks,
-Rob
