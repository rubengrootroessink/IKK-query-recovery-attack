I think it is a valid option to have, at least for my needs.

I do it for a website hierarchy. Hopefully, a website will not have a 
very deep hierarchy :) Basically, it is presented to the user in a 
right+click context menu on a nav tree.

You /could/ use the wildcard query with the hope that the user has 
drilled down as far as possible. Or you could just search a directory 
and not go any deeper (by not including the wildcard char -- presented 
to the user as a search option).

best,
-Rob
