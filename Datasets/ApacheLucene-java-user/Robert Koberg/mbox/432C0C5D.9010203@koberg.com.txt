SUBJECT: query with wildcard in field name?
DATE: 17 Sep 2005

Hi,

Is there a Query that will allow wildcards in the field name?

For example, lets say I have documents with the following fields:

Field Name   =   Field Value

- Doc 1
/faq/question/a = foo

- Doc 2
/article/section/p/a = foo

Is there a way to build a query like:

QueryParser.parse(
   "foo",
   "/*/a",
   myAnalyzer
);

Is this possible with lucene now?

(is svn.apache.org down? I can't seem to connect to the repository 
server to get the latest source.)

Is having a wildcard in a field name something that is even feasible?

If feasible, any suggestions on how to add this feature to lucene?

thanks,
-Rob
