Oops, I meant to write DateField.timeToString which I use when querying. 
If I use DateField.dateToString when indexing but timeToString when 
searching is that a bad practice? I do only need month, day and year. So 
should I be indexing with timeToString?

How would you do it if the above is still a bad practice?

Sorry for the basic questions...
