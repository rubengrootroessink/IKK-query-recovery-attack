SUBJECT: Storing a serialized object ?
DATE: 3 Jul 2009

I want to store in the index a data structure and load it back at search
time.

Is it safe to serialize the java object store it and load it back later ?
Presumably I need to store it binary, right ?

Otherwise I need to create my own store & load methods, waste of time.
