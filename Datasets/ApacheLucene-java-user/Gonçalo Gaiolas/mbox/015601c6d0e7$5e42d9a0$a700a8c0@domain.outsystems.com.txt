Hi Karl,

Thanks for the super quick response!

One question - should this boosting occur during index time or at query
time? I'm a bit confused as to where should I apply this boost in order to
affect the results of a search query.

Once again thanks a lot!

Gonçalo

Indeed you want to stay off the scoring algorithm if you can. It is
probably much eaiser for you to just boost the document based on the
values you have:

tml#setBoost(float)

Yes, in most cases that would be the way to go.
