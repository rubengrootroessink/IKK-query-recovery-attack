DATE: 4 May 2009


Hi

I've tryed this with MultiPhraseQuery, but it always returns me all
documents of the index, no matter what expression I use. 

I've read that adding a set of terms wich their values are all the entered
query (e.g. "str"), the search works as the symbol "*" (e.g. "str*"), so I
tryed that.

My code is like this:

// prompt the user
System.out.println("Enter query: ");

String line = in.readLine(); //if I put "str", I want all matches like
"string", "strong", "astray"....

line = line.trim();
	      
//I thought this would be ok...
MultiPhraseQuery mpquery = new MultiPhraseQuery();
TermEnum te = reader.terms(new Term("contents",line));

/*Home-made conversion from TermEnum to Term[]... I get just 200 matches, I
don't want my
   machine busy...*/
Term[] terms = new Term[200];
int j=0;
	      
while(te.next() && j<200){
    terms[j] = te.term();
    j++;
}
	      
mpquery.add(terms);
	      
Query query = parser.parse(line);
System.out.println("Searching for: " + query.toString(field));

Date start = new Date();

Hits hits = searcher.search(mpquery);
for(int k = 0; k<100; k++){
    //when I print the results of the search, none of the values match with
the query...
    System.out.println(hits.doc(k).getField("contents").stringValue());
}
