SUBJECT: Missing RegexQuery class
DATE: 5 May 2009


Hi,

Does anybody know why at lucene API documentation you can find the package
regex and its classes (RegexQuery, RegexTermEnum, SpanRegexQuery...), but
they don't exist in the jar (so you can't use them)?

Can I find them somewhere?

Thank you so much!
