SUBJECT: Too many results with RegexQuery
DATE: 18 May 2009


Hi,

I am using RegexQuery aiming to get a list of records from a regular
expression, but in some cases the search returns too many results, and for
that my program throws an Exception.

How could I customize the query or the searcher to, for example, get just a
set of results?

Thank you so much!!
