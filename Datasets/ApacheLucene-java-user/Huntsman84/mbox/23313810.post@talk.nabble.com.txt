SUBJECT: Searching for partial matches
DATE: 30 Apr 2009


Hello, 

 

I am new to Lucene, and I don't know if it is possible to obtain results
providing part of the keyword. 

 

For example, if I try to search "in", it should return all matches with
"string", "meaning", "trinity"... 

 

Am I expecting too much? 

 

Thank you so much!
