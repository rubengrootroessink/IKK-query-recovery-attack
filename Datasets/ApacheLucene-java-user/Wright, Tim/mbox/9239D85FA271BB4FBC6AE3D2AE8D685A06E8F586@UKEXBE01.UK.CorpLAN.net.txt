SUBJECT: Preventing short documents from being boosted
DATE: 8 Sep 2006

Hi all, 

We have an issue where around 10-20% of our documents are much shorter
(only a paragraph or so of text) than all the rest. Because Lucene
considers document length when indexing, most of the time these shorter
documents end up being scored higher than the longer ones. 

We'd prefer it if we could remove the length factor, or at least reduce
the weight of it so that we returned a mixture of long and short
documents. Is there a simple way of doing this? I've considered applying
a document boost based on length, but I'm not quite sure of the equation
I'd have to use to "counter" the innate prioritisation of short
documents.

Cheers,

Tim.
