SUBJECT: index other document types

Dear all,
 
 I learned from Lucene FAQ that if we want to index other document types, we need to provide
a parser or extractor for every document type. I know there are some tools available which
can convert other document types to txt format. Is the converter a parser or extractor at
all?
 
 Thank you for your kind assistance in advance.
 
 Best regards
