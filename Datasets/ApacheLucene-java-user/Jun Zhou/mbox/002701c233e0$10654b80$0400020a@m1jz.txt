Dear all,

I learned from Lucene FAQ that if we want to index other document types, we need to provide
a parser or extractor for every document type. I know there are some tools available which
can convert other document types to txt format. Is the converter a parser or extractor at
all?

Thank you for your kind assistance in advance.

Best regards
Jun Zhou
