Hello everybody,

I have an enquiry about StandardAnalyzer. Can I use it for other  
languages except from English? I give the right list of stop words at  
initialization. Is there anything else inside the class that is by  
default set in English?
I've found the Analyzers for other languages too but they where seem  
to be deprecated.. Moreover I use english and other languages, all  
together in my project so I would like to ask if there is a way to use  
either the same class analyzer for all of them, or analyzers of the  
same functionality for all the languages. Thanks in advance!

Best regards,
Vicky
