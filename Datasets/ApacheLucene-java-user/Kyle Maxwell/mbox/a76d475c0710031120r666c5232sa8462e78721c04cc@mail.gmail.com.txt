SUBJECT: Subset match query?
DATE: 3 Oct 2007

I'm indexing a dataset with lots of short fields.  I have determined that it
would be useful to highly boost matches where every term in this field is
represented in the query. i.e.:
Query: lucene field matches
Field: lucene field
but not
Field: lucene has a field ...
Field: lucene field foo...

I'm finding this to be very difficult to implement.  I believe that I could
write a query to count the term matches in a field, but I'm not sure how, in
a subclass of query, it would be possible to efficiently count the total
number of terms in the field.  Any advice would be welcome!
