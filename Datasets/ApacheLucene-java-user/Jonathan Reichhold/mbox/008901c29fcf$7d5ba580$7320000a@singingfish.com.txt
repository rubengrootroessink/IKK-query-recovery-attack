I agree with Otis on this.  In your application that is indexing, save
the last time you started indexing.  Then next time you index, read the
previous time in and just index file modified since this date.  This
doesn't deal with deletes, but that would require a bit more work....

That's an application specific behaviour that you need to add to your
indexing app.
