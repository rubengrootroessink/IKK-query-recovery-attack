SUBJECT: Allow non letter characters in tokens
DATE: 29 Jul 2004

Hi there,

my question is a pretty short one!

How can I prevent Lucene from cutting out special characters (i.e. the 
"_") during tokenization of a text? It's quite essential for me to have 
some non letter chars in my index.

Regards
Marcus
