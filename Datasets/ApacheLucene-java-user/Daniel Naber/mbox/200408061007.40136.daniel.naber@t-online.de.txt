That should be possible, but it will be slow if you have many terms. Another 
idea is to additionally index the word in reverse order: bergbahn -> 
nhabgreb, then a query for nhab* will find all words that end with bahn (you 
can use a prefix query then, which is not as slow as a WildcardQuery but 
still slow).
