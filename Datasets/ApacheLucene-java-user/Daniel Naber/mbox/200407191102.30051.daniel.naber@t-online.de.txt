I haven't tried it but I guess you need to change the getXXXQuery() methods so 
they return a BooleanQuery. For example, getFieldQuery currently might return 
a TermQuery; you'll need to change that so it returns a BooleanQuery with two 
TermQuerys. These two queries would have the same term, but a different 
field.

Another approach is to leave QueryParser alone and modify the query after it 
has been parsed by recursively iterating over the parsed query, replacing 
e.g. TermQuerys with BooleanQuerys (just like described above).

 Daniel
