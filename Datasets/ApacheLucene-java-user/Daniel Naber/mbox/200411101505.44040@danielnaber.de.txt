I don't know of any existing solutions, but it's not so difficult to write 
one: Extract the ZIP file using Java's built-in ZIP classes and parse 
content.xml and meta.xml. I'm not sure if whitespace issues might become 
tricky, e.g. two paragraphs could be in the file as 
"<p>one</p><p>two</p>", but for indexing a whitespace needs to be
inserted 
between them ("<p>" was just an example, I don't know what OpenOffice.org 
actually uses).

 Daniel
