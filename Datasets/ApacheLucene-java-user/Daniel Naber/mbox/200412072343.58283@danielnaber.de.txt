SUBJECT: [ANNOUNCE] Lucene 1.4.3 released
DATE: 7 Dec 2004


I'd like to officially announce Lucene 1.4.3. This release fixes two bugs, 
the list of changes is so short that I will simply paste it here:

 1. The JSP demo page (src/jsp/results.jsp) now properly escapes error
    messages which might contain user input (e.g. error messages about 
    query parsing). If you used that page as a starting point for your
    own code please make sure your code also properly escapes HTML
    characters from user input in order to avoid so-called cross site
    scripting attacks.
  
  2. QueryParser changes in 1.4.2 broke the QueryParser API. Now the old 
     API is supported again.

The source code and binaries can be downloaded from

 Daniel
