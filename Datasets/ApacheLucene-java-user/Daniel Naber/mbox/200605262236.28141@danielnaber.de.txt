From the API docs:

The field must be indexed, but should not be tokenized, and does not need 
to be stored (unless you happen to want it back with the rest of your 
document data). In other words: 
document.add (new Field ("byNumber", Integer.toString(x), Field.Store.NO, 
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
