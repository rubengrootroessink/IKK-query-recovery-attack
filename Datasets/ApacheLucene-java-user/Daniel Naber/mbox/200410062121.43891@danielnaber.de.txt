It seems even in this case some documents are lost. Do you maybe ignore 
exceptions? Could you build a self-contained test case that shows the 
problem? The interesting question is of course *which* documents are lost 
and if the behaviour is reproducible. The test case will either help you 
to fix the bug in your code, or it will help us fix the bug in Lucene, if 
there is any.
