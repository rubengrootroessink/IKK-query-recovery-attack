This is called "Fugenelement" and there are more characters than just the 
"s", although it might be enough to remove the "s" when trying to detect 
compounds. There are also cases where characters are removed (Wolle + 
Decke => Wolldecke).

Also see http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugenelement and 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis (which emphasises pronunciation, 
but that's not a good explanation for the existence of these characters in 
German).

 Daniel
