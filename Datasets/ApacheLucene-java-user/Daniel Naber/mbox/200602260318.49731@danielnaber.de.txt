Yes, I can reproduce this with the Lucene demo on a much smaller index of 
2000 documents. It (partly?) seems to be caused by my patch here:

http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.java?rev=372350&r1=216236&r2=372350&diff_format=h

This tries to fix an off-by-one bug with setMaxBufferedDocs, but it changes 
the way segments are merged, i.e. merging becomes slower. I guess this 
needs to be reverted. Maybe you can try doing that locally and see how it 
affects your performance.

Regards
 Daniel
