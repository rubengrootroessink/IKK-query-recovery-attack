QueryParser indeed doesn't know about IndexSearchers and IndexReaders, so 
you either have to do the work outside (whereever you have an 
IndexSearcher, it lets you access the IndexReader) and hand the results 
over to your QueryParser via e.g. its constructor. Or you hand over the 
IndexReader to your QueryParser. That's not really elegant but I don't 
know a better solution.
