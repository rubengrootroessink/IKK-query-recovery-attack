That seems to be the old version that doesn't implement getFieldQuery. The 
new version (which you pasted in an email on 2004-10-27) doesn't seem to 
work with e.g. prefix queries. I call it like this:

    String[] fields = new String[2];
    fields[0] = "title";
    fields[1] = "body";
    NewMultiFieldQueryParser qp = new NewMultiFieldQueryParser(fields, new
        WhitespaceAnalyzer());
    Query q = qp.parse("+gut* +test");
    System.out.println(q);  

I get:

+%%:gut* +(title:test body:test)

Or am I mixing up the versions?

 Daniel
