You should store the date as a number, e.g. "days since 1970" (or weeks if 
that is precise enough) and then tell the sort that it's an integer. 
DateField always stores the date in milliseconds which leads to a large 
number of terms, it also turns the date into a string, both makes searching 
and especially sorting slower.
