Are you sure you close all Lucene IndexReaders/Writers/Searchers? It's best 
to close them in a finally block so they get closed even when an exception 
is thrown. The number of files shouldn't be the problem. Although you 
could of course try with the compound index if your are not using that 
already (IndexWriter.setUsecompoundFile()).
