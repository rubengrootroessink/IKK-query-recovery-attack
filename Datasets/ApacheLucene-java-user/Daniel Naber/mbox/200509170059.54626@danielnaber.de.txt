There must have been a different problem. Lucene indexes should be 
system-independent, i.e. it should be possible to index on e.g. Windows 
and upload to Unix or vice versa. Maybe the fields where different in your 
searcher than the ones in the index (see the FAQ at 
http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/LuceneFAQ#head-3558e5121806fb4fce80fc022d889484a9248b71).
