That's not the way MultiFieldQueryParser will rewrite your query. To get this 
kind of query you have to parse it with QueryParser and then iterate 
recursivly (in case of BooleanQuery) over it, using Java's "instanceof". Each 
term needs to be replaced with a BooleanQuery over all the fields you want to 
search in.
