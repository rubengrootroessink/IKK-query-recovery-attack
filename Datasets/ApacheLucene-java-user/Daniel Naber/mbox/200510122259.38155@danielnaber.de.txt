I don't think you need to iterate at all, you can easily expand the terms 
of a query:

    QueryParser qp = new QueryParser("f", new StandardAnalyzer());
    Query q = qp.parse("e*");
    IndexReader ir = IndexReader.open("/tmp/index");
    System.out.println(q.rewrite(ir));

This will expand e* to all of your indice's words that start with "e". Same 
for wildcard queries.

I'll leave the guessing about performance to others. Why not just give it a 
try when it's so easy?

Regards
 Daniel
