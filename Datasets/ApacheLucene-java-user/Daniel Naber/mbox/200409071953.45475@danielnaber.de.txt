Here are some changes from around that day:

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/SegmentMerger.java
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/SegmentReader.java
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.java

Could you check which of those might have caused the problem? I guess 
there's not much the developers can do without the problem being 
reproducible.

regards
 Daniel
