There are two different issues: first, reorder the query so that those 
terms with less matches appear first, because as soon as the first term 
with 0 matches occurs, search stops. There will probably be a 
non-so-difficult implementation for that, but this will have more overhead 
than it saves time I guess.

The other thing is that prefix queries get expanded first, then the search 
happens. And that TooManyQueries exception happens when expanding the 
query, not during search. I'm not sure, but I think that's difficult to 
change, at least in a clean way.

 Daniel
