SUBJECT: live update of index used by Tomcat
DATE: 19 Sep 2005

Hi,

I need to merge two indexes into one which is accessed by a Searcher in 
Tomcat. Tomcat keeps the searcher (or reader) open for good performance. 
However, on Windows you cannot delete a file when it's opened for reading, 
so I cannot do the merge while Tomcat is running and the reader is open. 
But I don't want to shut down Tomcat or close the reader (not even for 10 
seconds) because the search needs to be up all the time. Does anybody have 
a clever solution for this problem?

Regards
 Daniel
