Yes: I assume your document should be found both with "strasse" and with 
"mainstrasse". You will then need to put main, strasse, and mainstrasse at 
the same position (setPositionIncrement(0)). If you don't do that, phrase 
queries will not work anymore as expected. Thus you need an analyzer, 
modifying the string before they are put in Lucene is not enough.
