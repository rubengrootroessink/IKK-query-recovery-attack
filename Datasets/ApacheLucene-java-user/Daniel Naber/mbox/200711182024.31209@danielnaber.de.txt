You don't have to, but it helps improving recall.

It depends on the dictionary. Some dictionary authors use the ispell 
flagging system just to save space, others use it in a way so that it 
really expresses the linguistic relation between a base form 
(e.g. "house") and its text forms (e.g. "houses"). Only in the later case, 
you could expand the dictionary to a "text form -> base form" mapping and 
use it.

Some dictionaries are GPL, so they cannot be part of Lucene. But you can 
use them anyway. So the reason that there are no more advanced 
(dictionary-based) analyzers for Lucene are mostly because nobody has 
developed and published them. Of course, an increased recall often comes 
with a decrease in precision.
