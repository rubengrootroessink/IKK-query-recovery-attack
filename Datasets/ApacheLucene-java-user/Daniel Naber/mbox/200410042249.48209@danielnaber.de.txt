It should be very easy. The API is described here: 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html
I think in your case all methods (except one) that return a float can just 
return 1.0f. The one that doesn't return 1 then returns a value that 
represents the difference to the "perfect" value (well, more like 
1/difference).

If you implement the method mentioned above so that it always ranks some 
field higher than another, that should be possible.

But it you've only got 1000 documents (and that number won't increase) you 
could also just search for HP:cargo, put all matches in your own "Match" 
objects and then sort these via your own implementation of Java's 
compareTo().
