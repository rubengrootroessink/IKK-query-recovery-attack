This is the code that throws the exception (from FieldCacheImpl.java):

  TermEnum termEnum = reader.terms (new Term (field, ""));
  (...)
  if (termEnum.term() == null) {
      throw new RuntimeException ("no terms in field " + field);
  }

The problem is that a TermEnum always returns all terms after a given one, 
not only terms in the same field. So the check is incomplete. If one 
changes the if like this, one will always get an exception if there are no 
terms in the field, as the exception claims:

  if (termEnum.term() == null || !termEnum.term().field().equals(field)) {

The other issue is that you probably expect to not get an exception at all, 
as there are no matches. Lucene doesn't first search and then sort, these 
tasks are parallel I think. So this is not that easy to fix (and I doubt 
if one should try).

Could you open a bug report for the problem with the exception that seems 
to occur only sometimes? The change suggested above needs to be tested 
before it can be committed and a bug report is useful for that.

Regards
 Daniel
