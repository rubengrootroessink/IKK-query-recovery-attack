After fixing this I can reproduce the problem with a local index that 
contains about 220.000 documents (700MB). Fetching the first document 
takes for example 30ms, fetching the last one takes >100ms. Of course I 
tested this with a query that returns many results (about 50.000). 
Actually it happens even with the default sorting, no need to sort by some 
specific field.
