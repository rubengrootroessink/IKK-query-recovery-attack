Fetching documents means that per document about 2 disk seeks are needed to 
access the document. For 200 documents, that's not possible in 16ms on a 
common hard disk, unless everything is chached by the operating system. 
Your copy operation seems to clear that cache and search times get slower. 
A solution might be to re-warm the cache after each copy process.
