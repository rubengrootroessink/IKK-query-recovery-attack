As Lucene does not have the concept of a "warning" I think it should throw 
exceptions when someone tries to do something that doesn't make sense 
(even if it's technically possible). And sorting on a field that doesn't 
exist doesn't seem to make sense.

Well, searching on a field that doesn't exist won't give you an exception 
either. For debugging it would be useful if you'd get an exception instead 
of no results.
