Lucene works on its own index files. So the usual way is to index the data 
in the database with Lucene and then query Lucene. Parsing the database 
results during search time with Lucene doesn't seem to be possible/useful. 
The only thing one might want to use at runtime when the database does the 
actual query is maybe the query parser (in order to build an SQL query 
from the user's input).
