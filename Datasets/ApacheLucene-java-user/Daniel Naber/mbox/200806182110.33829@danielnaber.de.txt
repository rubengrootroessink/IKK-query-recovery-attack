Lucene works well with more documents (currently using it with 9 million). 
but the fuzzy query requires iteration over all terms which makes this 
query slow. This can be avoid by setting the prefixLength parameter of the 
FuzzyQuery constructor to 1 or 2. Or maybe you should use an n-gram index, 
see the spellchecker in the contrib area.
