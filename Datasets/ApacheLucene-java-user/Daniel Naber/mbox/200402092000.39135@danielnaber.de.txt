You can use a RAMDirectory for indexing so nothing needs to be written to 
disk. This should be quite fast.

Yes, you need to recursively iterate over all parts of the query. For 
example, a boolean query may consist of other boolean queries. You need to 
go down until you've got a TermQuery, which holds the term itself (or you 
could use rewrite() to make this easier).
