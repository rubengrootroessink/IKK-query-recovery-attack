Your database will need a "last modified" column. Then you can select those 
rows that have been modified since the last update and for each row check if 
it's in the Lucene index. If it is, delete it there and re-add the new 
version. If it's not, add it. To delete documents you will probably need to 
iterate over all your IDs in the Lucene index and check if they are still in 
the database. If that's too inefficient you could check if you can do it the 
way the file system indexer (IndexHTML in Lucene's demo) does it.

BTW, please don't cross-post to both lists.

 Daniel
