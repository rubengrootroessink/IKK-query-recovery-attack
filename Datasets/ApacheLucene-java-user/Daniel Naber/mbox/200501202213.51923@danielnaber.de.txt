Use q1 OR q2, where q1 is the query parsed with the analyzer for language 
1, q2 is the query parsed with the analyzer for language 2 (and so on). If 
there are conflicts you could also add a required term query to each 
subquery, like "language:en^0" so that, for example, the English analyzer 
query only searches on documents that have been identified as English.
