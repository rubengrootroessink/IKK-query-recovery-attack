Not quite, as the normalization only refers to the length of the document. 
But the fact that "hello hello hello" contains the searched term three 
times makes it have a larger score no matter if normalization is set.

However, for this example, both docs have the same score with
f.setOmitNorms(true) when searching for "hello":

doc[0] <text: hello foo foo>
doc[1] <text: hello>
