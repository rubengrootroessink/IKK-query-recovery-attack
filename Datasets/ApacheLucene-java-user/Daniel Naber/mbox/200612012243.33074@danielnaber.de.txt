What do the fields really look like? If they contain non-numbers, Lucene 
probably sorts non-numerically (i.e. 1, 10, 11, 12, ..., 2). Also, there 
might be strange behavior if you sort on fields that are tokenized (not 
sure if that gives an exception). Not sure if anybody can help you unless 
you post a real self-contained testcase that either creates the index 
itself or put up a small index somewhere to reproduce the issue.

 Daniel
