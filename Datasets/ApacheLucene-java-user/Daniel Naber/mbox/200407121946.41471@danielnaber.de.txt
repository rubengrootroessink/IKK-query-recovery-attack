If your title isn't tokenized the "^" is implicit, I think. As usual, if 
your title is tokenized you can easily add another field with the same 
value as title, but in untokenized form.

Lucene 1.4 added an IndexSearcher.search() method that takes a Sort() 
object which lets you sort by any field. Your date field can be used for 
that, as it has the correct format (because sorting it alphabetically will 
give you the right order already).
