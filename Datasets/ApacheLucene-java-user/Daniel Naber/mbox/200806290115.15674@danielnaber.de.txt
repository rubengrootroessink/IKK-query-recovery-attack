Is this copy operation initiated by your java code and does it require a 
lot of RAM? If so, this could be caused by the JVM garbage collection. 
There are options to start the JVM so it prints out garbage collection 
progress information. Also, are you sure the copy operation is finished? 
Maybe data is still in the cache of the operating system and the disk is 
still busy writing it?
