It's a list of terms with optional flags. For example:

walk/xy

In a different file, the flag "x" would then be defined as "append 'ed'" 
and y as "append 'ing'" so that the expanded version is:

walk
walked
walking

The term in the dictionary does not have to be a real word. So in this 
example, if normalization from "walking" and "walked" to "walk" is what 
you want, you could use ispell. It just won't work for irregualar forms 
(e.g. went -> go)
