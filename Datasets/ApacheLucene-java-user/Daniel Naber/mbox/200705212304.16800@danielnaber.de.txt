"strasse" will match "mainstrasse" but the phrase query "schöne strasse" 
will not match "schöne mainstrasse". However, this could be considered a 
feature. Aynway, it will be difficult to use features that rely on the 
term list, e.g. the spellchecker. It will not be able to suggest 
"mainstrasse", as that's not in the index.
