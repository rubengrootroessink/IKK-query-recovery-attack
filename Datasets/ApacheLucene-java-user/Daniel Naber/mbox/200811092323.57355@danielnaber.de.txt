This was removed between 1.9 and 2.0. The plan was that users upgrade to 
1.9, fix the deprecation warnings and only then go to 2.0. Thus no every 
method is mentioned in the change log. It just says "Several methods and 
fields have been deprecated. The API documentation contains information 
about the recommended replacements. It is planned that most of the 
deprecated methods and fields will be removed in Lucene 2.0."

 Daniel
