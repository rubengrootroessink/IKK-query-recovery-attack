SUBJECT: Japanese word segmentation

Hi,

does anybody know a (more or less) ready-to-use free Japanese analyzer? I 
know I can use CJKAnalyzer but I need one that puts only real words into 
the index (no just n-grams). There seem to be a lot of papers on the Web 
and there's also "Juma", but I'm looking for a Java-based solution.

Regards
 Daniel
