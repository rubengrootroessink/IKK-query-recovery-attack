This will not match documents that contain only "I love" in the title and 
"lucene" in the body. Doesn't seem like a problem for this example, as it 
looks like a phrase query, but I don't think that this is Google's 
behavior. I worked around that by prepending the title to the body field. 
Let me know if someone has a better solution.

The "correct" query would have to look something like this (leavon out the 
boosting):

+(title:i body:i) +(title:love body:love) +(title:lucene body:lucene)
