Something like this should work:

BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
PrefixQuery pq = new PrefixQuery(...);
bq.add(pq, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
TermQuery tq = new TermQuery(new Term("type", "sequence"));
bq.add(tq, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);

bq is now the query you can use for searching. BooleanClause.Occur.MUST 
basically means "AND". So unless you want your users to access the 
features of Lucene's QueryParser (e.g. AND, OR, NOT, fuzzy queries etc) 
there's no need to use it.
