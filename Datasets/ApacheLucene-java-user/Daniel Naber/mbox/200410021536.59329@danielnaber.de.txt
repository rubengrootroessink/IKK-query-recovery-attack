That's possible with Lucene, you'll need to parse the XML files and put the 
required data into the Lucene index. Then you can search with a query like 
this:

+model:cargo^0 +hp:[50000 TO 60000] hp:55000^10

This will match all document which contain "cargo" in the model field and a 
value of 50000 to 60000 in the hp field. Matches with hp 55000 will be 
boosted so they appear on top. However, matches 50000 to 54999 and 50001 
to 60000 will have the same ranking. To change that you will need to 
implement your own variation of Lucene's Similarity class.
