This is only an issue if your index has permission information and you 
modify the user's query so that only parts of the index are visible to 
him. For example, if you add "+permission:user" to the query the user 
might add something like "OR permission:admin" to get access to more 
documents. This is also why you should add new parts to the query 
programmatically (BooleanQuery) to avoid the use of QueryParser.
