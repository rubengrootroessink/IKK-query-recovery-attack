That's not supported AFAIK. You will need to iterate over the query 
(recursively if it's an instance of BooleanQuery) and create a new query 
where all parts are of type FuzzyQuery.

I suggest you only do this if the user clicks on a kind of "make query 
fuzzy" link, or at least display clearly that the query is fuzzy now. 
Everything else could cause confusion. You might also want to consider 
using the spell checker.
