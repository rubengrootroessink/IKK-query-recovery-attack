It is, however, difficult to get right for German. On the one hand there are 
compounds in German with more than two parts, on the other hand there are 
extra characters in the middle of some compound words (e.g. Arbeit + Aufwand 
= ArbeitSaufwand). Also, the compounds have their inflectional endings, e.g. 
the plural of Bergbahn is Bergbahnen. At http://lemmi.intrafind.org you can 
see a demo that deals with almost all cases, even things like "dazugekauftes" 
(but it's not freely available).

 Daniel
