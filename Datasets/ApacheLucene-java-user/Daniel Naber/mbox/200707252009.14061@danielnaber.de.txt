The Lucene QueryParser class can parse the format descriped at 
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html. To adapt it to 
other formats, the javacc grammar needs to be modified. To output in yet 
another format, either the Java code would need to be modified or you'd 
need to write some new Java code that iterates over the object produced by 
the QueryParser. In other words: this is not what Lucene's QueryParser was 
made for and it's not too simple unless you're already familiar with 
javacc.
