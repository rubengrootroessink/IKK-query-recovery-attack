There are two things to consider: queries will get more complicated and 
thus slower and the implementation isn't that easy:  while stemming can be 
done with a simple algorithm (for English), you'll need a dictionary with 
at least part-of-speech information for adding suffixes. That's because 
you cannot just add "ing" to any word, otherwise you'd end up with car + 
ing  = caring. (But once you have this dictionary the quality of your 
solution can be better than that of a stemmer, as stemmers also suffer 
form over-stemming, i.e. mapping two non-related words to the same form).
