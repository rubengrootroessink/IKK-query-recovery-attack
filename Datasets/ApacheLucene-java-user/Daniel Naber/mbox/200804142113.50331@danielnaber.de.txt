If your text is tokenized, this is not supported by QueryParser but you can 
create such queries using MultiPhraseQuery. If you don't tokenize a text 
like "java development" at whitespace characters, it's just like a single 
term for Lucene. A query like "java de*" should work then, just make sure 
you don't tokenize the search query either.
