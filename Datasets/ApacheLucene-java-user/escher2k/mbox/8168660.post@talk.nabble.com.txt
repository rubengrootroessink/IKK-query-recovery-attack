SUBJECT: Hence Similarity to pass in fieldName...
DATE: 4 Jan 2007


Hi, 
  I am trying to create a linear function  to influence the similarity
computation. For example - 
  if tf = 4, f(tf) = 150 * 1 + 150 * 0.3 
                     = 195 

The first occurrence is multiplied by 150. The next three occurrences are
mulitplied by 150 and 
divided by 10 (3/10). 

However, we don't have access to the field name in the function public float
tf(float freq). 
Is there any way out ? I would think passing the field name along with the
freq to
create public float tf(float freq, String fieldName) would be useful -
unless there is a better way.

Thanks.
