Thanks Hoss. Suppose, I go ahead and modify Similarity.java from 
static {
    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++)
      NORM_TABLE[i] = SmallFloat.byte315ToFloat((byte)i);
  }
TO
static {
    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++)
      NORM_TABLE[i] = (float) i  * 100.0 /256.0;
  } 

Should this work ?

Thanks.

P.S. This is a very custom implementation. For the specific problem that I
have, the lengthNorm
is set to 1 (independent of numTerms).
