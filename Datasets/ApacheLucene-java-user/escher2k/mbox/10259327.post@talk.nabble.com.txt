SUBJECT: Modifying norms...
DATE: 30 Apr 2007


I want to modify the norms to only include values between 0 and 100.
Currently, I have a custom implementation of the default similarity. Is it
sufficient to override the encodeNorm and decodeNorm methods from the base
implementation in my custom Similarity class ? Please let me know if there
are any performance implications to this.
