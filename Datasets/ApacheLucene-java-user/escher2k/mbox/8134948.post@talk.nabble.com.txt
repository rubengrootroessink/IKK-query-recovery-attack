SUBJECT: Customize scoring for additive effect...
DATE: 3 Jan 2007


I am trying to build a scoring function which is additive across multiple
fields that are searched.
For instance, if a user searches for "Web PHP", I want the search to happen
over fld1, fld2
and then compute the score as,
   score = similarity score(fld1) + similarity score(fld2) + <some system
constant>

I think I have figured out how to customize the similarity for the fields,
but I still don't know
how to get this additive effect. I didn't see any direct way to plug in a
custom scorer. 

Thanks.
