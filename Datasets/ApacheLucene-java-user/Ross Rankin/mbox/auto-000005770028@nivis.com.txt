I agree.  My site is all dynamic pages created from the database.  Right
now, I have to have a process create dummy pages, index them with Lucene,
then translate the Lucene results into meaningful links.  It actually works
better than it sounds, however it could be easier.

If I could just give Lucene a query result (i.e. a list of rows) and then
have Lucene send me back say the primary key of the rows that match and the
other Lucene goodness: ranking, number of hits, etc. 

Could be pretty powerful and simplify the deployment for database driven
applications.

Talking of which, did anyone contemplated the possibility of a 
<gasp>JDBC</gasp> adaptor of sort for Lucene?
