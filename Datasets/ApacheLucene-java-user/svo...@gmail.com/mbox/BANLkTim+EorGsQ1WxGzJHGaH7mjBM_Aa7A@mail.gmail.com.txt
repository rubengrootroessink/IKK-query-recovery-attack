SUBJECT: document with parent-child relationship
DATE: 29 Apr 2011

Hello,

I need an advice on how to create an document that has parent-child
relationship. Here is an example:

"low pressure" -> "engine"
                      -> "wheel"
                      -> ....

"low pressure" string is the parent and "engine" and "wheel" are
children. I'd like to be able to search strings such as "low pressure
in engine" or just "low" or "engine" and the result should be an ID of
the parent. How do I create fields in the lucene document to express
this relationship?

Any advice appreciated.
