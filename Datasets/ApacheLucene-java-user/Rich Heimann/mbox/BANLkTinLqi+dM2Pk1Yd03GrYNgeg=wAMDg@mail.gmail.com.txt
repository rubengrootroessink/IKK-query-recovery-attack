Thanks Paul,

I do not know what duplicates are in this case and it is the denominator of
the TF that bothers me more than the numerator of the TF (if that is in fact
what you are suggesting).

What have been the effects of ignoring the IDF? When is it appropriate. It
would seem that by doing so rare terms have less (no) weight. Thoughts?

Thanks again,
Rich
