SUBJECT: Please help me with a basic question...
DATE: 18 May 2011

Hello all,

This is my first time on the list and my first question...forgive me it this
has been hacked out in the past.

We have set up Lucene/Solr and are getting somewhat spurious results. It
appears to be a result of heterogeneous document sizes. In other words, the
top results are sometimes (at least when the user is using typical search
terms) monopolized by a distinct type of document, which is otherwise small
(in number of terms). It appears that TF/IDF even with the cosine similarity
is sensitive to document size. I have run some tests and it in fact does
appear to be the case.

(Number of times the term appears in a document)/(Total Number of terms in
that document) * Log10(Number of total documents/Number of times search term
appears in all documents)

Are there any suggestions or best practices to deal with the intrinsic
heterogeneity in a corpus.

Thank you,
Rich
