Bingo. That appears to be the essence of the problem, which makes sense
given TF/IDF.

I stumbled upon the 'Explain' function yesterday though it returns a crowded
message using debug in SOLR admin. Is there another method or interface
which returns more or cleaner info?

I feel uncomfortable with omitting the normalization factor at this point. I
like the idea that it accounts for the size of the document. In other words,
I would expect to find the search term where there are many terms.
Normalization (as you know) controls for document size. It does however
(appears) lead to inflated values.

SeetSpotSimilarity looks promising. Does it not favor shorter docs by not
normalizing or does it make some attempt to standardized.

Thank you Doron...

Regards,
Rich
