Thanks for the suggestions. 

I'm using the Lucene packaged with Gate, which is lucene-1.3-final.jar
(ancient I suppose).

I am now seeing the threading problems with GATE, and although I was
hoping to stay with Gate in case we need some of it's capabilities,
although with the current design we could go with something like Lius.  

Regards,
Keith
