Actually it would be "The the apple is green" since only one token is 
spit out if it's already lower-cased.

Ahh, right.  *case-insensitive phrase searches* won't work, but 
single word searches --case insensitive or not, and case-sensitive 
phrase searches should work.  It would be nice if case sensitivity 
was something handled by lucene itself to get around this limitation 
of the phrase search.  The other ideas (separate fields for case 
sensitive versions) is a bit heavyweight since there's so much 
redundant info.
