Ahh, I take back my last comment about renaming close() to 
dispose().  If the IndexReader simply had a bunch of in-memory data, 
then dispose() would be appropriate.  If it holds onto resources 
outside of the VM (typical examples are Window objects, file streams, 
network sockets, etc. then close() should be one of those mandatory 
methods to be invoked when done with it.  In general one should *not* 
/rely/ on the GC to clean up external resources.  That's an important 
lesson repeated in various articles and books and testimonials I've 
learned over years of Java development.

This might clear up the issues some people have been having with not 
having enough file handles available on their OS.
