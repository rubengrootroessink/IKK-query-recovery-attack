Maybe I'm just not with it right now... but that matrix doesn't seem 
to make sense to me.  From my understanding, two write requests 
cannot happen concurrently, yet there's a "Y" in that box on the 
matrix.  Also, /shouldn't/ the matrix be symmetric?  It isn't.  If it 
is intended to me, I think only half of the matrix should be there as 
to not be confusing.
