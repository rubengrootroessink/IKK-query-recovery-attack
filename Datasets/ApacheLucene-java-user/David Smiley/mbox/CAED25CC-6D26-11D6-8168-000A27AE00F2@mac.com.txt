Yes.  Check out how Date support is implemented.  As a quick 
workaround... you could piggy-back on Lucene's existing date support 
by creating a Date via milliseconds that is the number your are 
trying to put in the index.

Note that internally, a bit-vector is created that is the same size 
as the index which might cause performance problems depending on the 
size of your index and typical queries you will have in your 
environment.
