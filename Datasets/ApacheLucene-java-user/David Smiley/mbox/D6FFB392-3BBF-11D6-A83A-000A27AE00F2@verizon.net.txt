Hmmm, ok.  So this next()-method design pattern that Lucene is using 
here is not the same as how Enumeration/Iterator/ResultSet works... 
ok; water under the bridge.  I used the "find usages" feature of my 
IDE ("IDEA" by IntelliJ/Netbrains) on the TermEnum.next() method just 
now to see how other callers work with this method.  Your findings 
are correct.  I did find one caller that appears to not call it 
correctly however: TermInfosReader.readIndex() line 111.  If it is 
calling it correctly in this case for some obscure exceptional reason 
then there is documentation missing to explain why.

Anyway, the reason I first thought that this was a bug was because 
term() returned null and DateFilter.bits() was expecting it not to.  
It thus seems that that a bug does remain, and it is that 
DateFilter.bits() does not handle cases in which there are no terms 
to iterate over.
