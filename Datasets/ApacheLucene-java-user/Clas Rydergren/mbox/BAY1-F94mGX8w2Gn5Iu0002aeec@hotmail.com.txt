SUBJECT: Re: Modify the StandardAnalyzer
DATE: 6 Sep 2003



Sorry, I found the Lucene-1.3-rc1-src files, which compiles perfectly well 
;-) and I "resolved" the original problem by including "." as a whitespace 
character in the queryParser.jj-file. This is maybe not the best solution, 
but it solved my problems for now.

Thanks
