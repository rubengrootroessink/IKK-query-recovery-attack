SUBJECT: Re: Concurrent read and write
DATE: 21 Jan 2005

Hi,

My limited experience shows that reading/searching in a servlet at the
"same" time as writing to the index from an application (e.g. by a
scheduled script) works very well.

The only thing that has caused me problems is applications (e.g. cron
started) writing to the index that "crash" while the write-lock is in
effect. (The "crash" is in my case often cause by bad socket
programming, and has nothing to do with Lucene.) The following
scheduled applications will then, of cause, not be able to update the
index.
