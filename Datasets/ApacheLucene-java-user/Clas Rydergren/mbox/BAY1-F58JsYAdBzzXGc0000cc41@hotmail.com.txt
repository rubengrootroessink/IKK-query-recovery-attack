SUBJECT: Modify the StandardAnalyzer
DATE: 5 Sep 2003

Hi,

I have been experimenting with Lucene for a few hours, and now I'm looking 
for a solution to this:

When using the SimpleAnalyzer for indexing text, data like www.hotmail.com 
seem to be indexed as www, hotmail and com which mean that a search for 
"hotmail" will return a record. This is the behavior I am looking for! 
However, since SimpleAnalyzer do not index numbers by default, I would like 
to use the StandardAnalyzer. But, Standardanalyzer do not split the input 
stream at ".".

Ideally I should propably make my own analyser, but that seems to be a bit 
complicated to me :(. Which is the simplest possible modification that I 
need to make to the Lucene source to make the StandardAnalyzer split, for 
example web-addresses, at "." into separately indexed words?

Can this be made by modifications to the StandardTokenizer.jj? How? What is 
the easiest way of getting such modification into the "compiled" Lucene? Is 
there a need for recompiling everything?

Appreciate all help!

regards
clas
