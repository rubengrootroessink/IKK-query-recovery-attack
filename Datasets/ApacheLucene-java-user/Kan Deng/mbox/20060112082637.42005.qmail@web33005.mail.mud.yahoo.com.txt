I have similar problem about the internal indexing
data structure

According to Paolo Ferragina of Univ Pisa, B+tree with
cluster is best for sorting. However, referring to the
implementation of
org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearch, it looks like
the impl doesn't take B+tree, never mention cluster. 

Can anyone explain this issue in more depth?

thanks,
Kan
