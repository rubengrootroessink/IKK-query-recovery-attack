After reading into the source code, I think Lucene
doeesn't use B+tree or other tree structure for index.


A possible reason is that, since Lucene aims at
handling gigabytes  , it has to be cautious about the
index file's size. B+tree may grow rapidly when the
number of leaves grows. Hence, B+tree doesn't scale
well with gigabytes data. 

Seems to me Lucene's search is implemented by
"hopping" along the sorted index. 

For example, suppose there is a field "first name"
whose values are the first names of all California
residents. Those values are listed sequentially but
sorted. Given a certain query, the search can start
from the first name, if the first name is smaller than
the query, hop to the 10'th one, if still smaller,
continue hop forward, otherwise, hop back. so on. 

By this, we don't need B+tree. Of course, there are
tricks to improve the hopping algorithm. However, my
doubt is that the search performance may not so
competitive as B+tree. 

Is my understanding correct?
