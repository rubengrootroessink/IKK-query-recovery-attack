(first excuse me for my english)

hi people..

we are programming a few tests battery to see how lucene creates the scores in 
a search into a very simple and controllable documents.

but we don't understand why the results looks not ok for us..

i am going to try to explain, the details of the tests described at botton..

if you look the tests you will see:

in test 1)
query: info:house
lucene returns a 50.00 score for this document
id      info
-----   ------
house2	house noise noise noise

and the same score for this document:
id      info
-----   ------
house3	house noise noise noise noise


in test 2)
query: info:house

lucene returns more score for this document:
id      info
-----   ------
house3	noise noiseso noise noiseso noise noiseso house house house house

than for this one:
id      info
-----   ------
house5	noise noiseso noise noiseso noise noiseso house house house house house 
house



i have seen lucene's algoritm for creating this scores, i don't understand all 
but i 
think the results of these searches are not ok for me.. 

i need comments, or urls to study and improve my search method


thanks for all
d2clon
