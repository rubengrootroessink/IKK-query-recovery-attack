SUBJECT: problems search number range
DATE: 18 Nov 2004

(excuse me for my english)

hi people:
i am trying to do a search between two numbers.. 
at the very beginning it was all right, 
for example: when i had the number 20 and i searched between 10 and 30

query= 'number:[10 TO 30]'

then lucene found it.. but..

if i change the range numbers: 5 and 130 i started to have problems..
lucene didn't find the number 20 yetÂ¡

i solved this changing the format of the numbers and putting this: 
number to look for: "020"
range: "005", "130"
query= 'number:[005 TO 030]

up to this point all correct.. 

but then another problem starts:
i need to use negative numbers and then all becomes crazy for me...

i need to solve this search:
number: -10
range: -50 TO 5

i need help.. 
i dont find anything using google.. 

thanks
d2clon
