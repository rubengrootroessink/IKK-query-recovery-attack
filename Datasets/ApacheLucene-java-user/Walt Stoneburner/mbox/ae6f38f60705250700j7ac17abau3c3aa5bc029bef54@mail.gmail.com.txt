SUBJECT: Re: Scoring on Number of Unique Terms Hit, Not Term Frequency Counts
DATE: 25 May 2007

In reading the math for scoring at the bottom of:
http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html

It appears that if I can make tf() and idf(), term frequency and
inverse document frequency respectively, both return 1, then coord(),
which is now the primary factor of the product, is what I'm looking
for.

Would anyone have enough knowledge to confirm / deny?
