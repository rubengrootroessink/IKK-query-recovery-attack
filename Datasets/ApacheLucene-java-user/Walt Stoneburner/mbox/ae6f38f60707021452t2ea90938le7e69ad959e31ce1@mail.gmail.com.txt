SUBJECT: Reusing Document Objects (was Auto Slop)
DATE: 2 Jul 2007

If I create a Document object, can I pass it to multiple index writers
without harm?

Or, does the process of being handed to an Index Writer somehow mutate the
state of the Document object, say during tokenizing, that would cause it's
re-use with a totally separate index to cause problems ...such as I'm seeing
with slop?
