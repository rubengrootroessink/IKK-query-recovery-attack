SUBJECT: Lucene search fails for japanese characters in URL
DATE: 17 Sep 2008


Hi ,

I am facing below problem. Please help me in this.

I have integrated CJK Analyzer for Japanese characters. I am able to save 
japanese double byte characters in mysql database in UTF-8 format without
issues. I could that data is getted indexed. Now when i search the Japanese
characters which were indexed using the URL below , returns empty results.
 
http://xml.demo.myaol.jp:8082/portal/gallery-search?first=1&max=100&cap=言語 
 
Noticed that the above url gets converted to the following URL having some
HTML encoded strings in search.
 
http://xml.demo.myaol.jp:8082/portal/gallery-search?first=1&max=100&cap=%E8%A8%80%E8%AA%9E
 
This does not match with the existing lucene indexes henceforth returns
empty results.  How do i solve this lucene search issue having japanese
words in URLs.? Is there any way to convert such characters back to Japanese
words??? 

Any help/suggestions in this regards is highly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance.

Regards,
Anand
