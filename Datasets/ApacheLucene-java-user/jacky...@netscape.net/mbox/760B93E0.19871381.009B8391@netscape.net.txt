Hi All

I am new to the web development area.  
I will simply explain the functionality I want to use. 
I am developing a site in WebObjects. In my site  the users can enter their information such
as name , place , and address etc .
Also I have provided an option for searching their details.

Please tell me what all things I have to follow to develop the search.
I will be storing the informations in an Openbase database.
I want to store the indexes also in the OpenBase database.
Any body can track me in this...

how can I use Lucene for this search.

Jack
