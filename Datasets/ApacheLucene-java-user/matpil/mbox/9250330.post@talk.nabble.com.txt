SUBJECT: retrieve term positions in query
DATE: 1 Mar 2007


Hi!
My problem is to retrieve the term positions in a "general" query with more
than one terms.
It seems that with the phrase query it's possible (with SpanQuery) but with
"AND" and "OR" query I can't get the position for each document I search.
I'm looking for a high level implementation because I don't want to use low
level lucene API (I'm a lucene newbie...) 

Thanx in advance,
Mat
