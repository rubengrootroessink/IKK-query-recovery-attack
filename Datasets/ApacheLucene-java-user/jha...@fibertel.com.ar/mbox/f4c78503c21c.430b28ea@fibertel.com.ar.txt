SUBJECT: QueryParser not thread-safe
DATE: 23 Aug 2005

Hi! I've been having problems with lucene's QueryParser, apparently it is not thread-safe.


That means I can't parse queries in threads where the queryparser object is created once and
reused for each query. If I do, the resulting queries may have all kinds of weird problems,
for example missing terms, duplicate terms, etc. 

I don't like the idea of creating a new queryparser for each query, so I am looking for alternatives.
Any ideas?

Thanks!
