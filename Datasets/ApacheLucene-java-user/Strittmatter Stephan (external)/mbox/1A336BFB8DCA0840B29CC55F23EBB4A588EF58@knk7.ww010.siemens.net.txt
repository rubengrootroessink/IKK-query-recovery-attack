SUBJECT: Automatically determin Language of document
DATE: 23 Nov 2001

Hi,

has anyone done anything to autodetect Language of an
HTML-Document which will be indexed by Lucene?

I will use Lucene to index an multilingual Portal
and want to filter the hits by language.

Thanks for any ideas,

Stephan
