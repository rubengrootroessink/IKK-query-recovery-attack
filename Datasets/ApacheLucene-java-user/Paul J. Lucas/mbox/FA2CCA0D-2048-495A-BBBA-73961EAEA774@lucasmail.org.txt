SUBJECT: All the values of a particular field
DATE: 19 Mar 2009

The Lucene FAQ has a Q, "How do I retrieve all the values of a  
particular field that exists within an index, across all documents?"  
and gives some code.  However, it looks like that code returns only  
unique values.  How does one get all values including duplicates?
