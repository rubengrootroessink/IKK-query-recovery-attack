FYI: I personally can't reproduce this; only a coworker can and even  
then it's sporadic, so it could take a little while.

That raises a few questions:

1. Should I lower my mergeFactor?

2. Is there any way to insist that only one merger runs?

3. Is there any way to insist that all merges happen synchronously,  
i.e., on IndexWriter.close() only and not to use a separate merge  
thread?
