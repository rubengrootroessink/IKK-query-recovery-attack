The latter.

I don't know, but the answer is probably either 0 or 1.  I forgot if I  
mentioned this before, but there is exactly 1 client for my server.   
Most of the time, the number of queries is 0 because the client is  
quiescent.  A query only happens when the user (using the client)  
manually initiates a query.  (I don't work on the client code, so I'm  
not totally sure, but the client may also initiate several queries at  
once when getting information for all the files in a directory.  But  
even then, we're talking only about a handful of threads.)

The exception always happens when I call close() after unindexing the  
contents of a directory.
