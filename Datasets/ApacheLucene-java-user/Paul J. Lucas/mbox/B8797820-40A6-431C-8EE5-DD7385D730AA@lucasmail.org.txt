SUBJECT: IndexWriter.deleteDocuments(Term) and Field.Store.YES
DATE: 20 Jul 2009

If I have a field:

	Field f = new Field( "F", "foo", Field.Store.YES,  
Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED );

can I later do:

	Term t = new Term( "F", "foo" );
	myIndexWriter.deleteDocuments( t );

and have it work even though the field is Field.Store.YES ?  Does the  
YES/NO make any difference as to whether the delete will work?

If YES means the delete won't work, then does that mean that I have to  
have two fields, one with YES and another with NO?

I need it to be YES since I display the value of the field, but the  
delete doesn't seem to work.
