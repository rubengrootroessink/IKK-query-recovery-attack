SUBJECT: Deleting documents using "starts with"
DATE: 27 Oct 2009

I currently have code that looks like:

     Term[] terms = new Term[]{
         new Term( key1, value1 ),
         new Term( key2, value2 )
     };
     writer.deleteDocuments( terms );

I want to change things such that it will delete all documents having  
key2's value start with value2, i.e., if value2 were "foo" then I want  
all documents to be deleted where key2's value starts with  
"foo" (i.e., "foo*").

I still want key1's value to match value1 exactly, however.

What's the simplest way to do do what I want?  Thanks.

- Paul
