what up g.

trying to use the lucene-core.2.0.0.jar that is in the maven  
repository at

http://www.ibiblio.org/maven2/org/apache/lucene/lucene-core/2.0.0/

my classes won't compile against this jar as it doesn't contain any  
class files. there is a pom in the manifest directory.

was this intentional? is there some magical way to use an empty jar  
with a pom file in maven? all the other jars i've pulled off there  
have class files in them.

anyway, thought i'd point this out before i assumed this was a  
mistake and  stuck the regular jar  in my local repository.

thanks
Scott.
