SUBJECT: About query parser
DATE: 15 Mar 2011

Hi,


 I used parser in my app.


 For example, i wanna search for 'great sum', and 'great sum', 'greater sum', ... may be found,
and sum great must not be found. It means I need not only exact word, but also prefix search
(or some other search criteria like fuzzy...). In my app, I used "great* sum*", but it does
not work.


 So what is the correct code?


Thx
