SUBJECT: Some Problem with Lucene in Java
DATE: 3 Feb 2011

Hi,


I am developing an advanced pdf search engine in java by using pdfbox and lucene. And I must
display the context of each keyword in the user interface, but i cannot find a method to do
so. Most of the methods provided are used to deal with documents with whole content in the
specified field, and i just need the context of each keyword (i.e. some specified part of
the contents in the specified field). 


Are there any ways to do so???


Thx.
