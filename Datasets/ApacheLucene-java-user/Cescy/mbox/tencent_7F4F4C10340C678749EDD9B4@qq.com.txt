SUBJECT: About ComplexPhraseQueryParser highlight prob
DATE: 15 Mar 2011

hi


My app can find the document but cannot highlight the keywords.


  ComplexPhraseQueryParser parser = new ComplexPhraseQueryParser(Version.LUCENE_30, "contents",
analyzer);
  Query query = parser.parse("\"(great~) sum*\"");
  QueryScorer scorer = new QueryScorer(query);


Looks like its because the query coming in is a ComplexPhraseQuery and the Highlighter doesn't
current know how to handle that type. 


So how to fix the problem???
