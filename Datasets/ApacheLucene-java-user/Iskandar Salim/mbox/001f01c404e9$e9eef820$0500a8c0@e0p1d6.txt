DATE: 8 Mar 2004

Hi,

I've worked on a bit on the taglib and added an "index" and "field" tag for
basic indexing capability, though I don't think it's really useful, apart
from, in my case quick prototyping of web applications. What do you guys
think? I'm new to Lucene and taglibs so I may have missed out lots of
things.

For the curious, you see the 'in progress' examples and docs at
http://www.javaxp.net/lucene-examples/ and http://www.javaxp.net/lucene-doc/
resp.
or download the distribution
http://www.javaxp.net/lucene-taglib/lucene-taglib.zip or
http://www.javaxp.net/lucene-taglib/lucene-taglib.tar.gz

Erik, is there any requirements for the java package names? e.g. ... to be
named as org.apache.lucene.taglib etc.
BTW, I've included the ASL 2.0 license in the source files.

Regards,
Iskandar
