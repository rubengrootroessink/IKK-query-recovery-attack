SUBJECT: Access Denied in opening IndexSearcher
DATE: 22 Mar 2008

Hi,

This is my first post to this group.
I'm using Lucene 2.3 on XP machine. I've an index of 3000 pages in a dir 
named 'wcrawl', that I want to search through.

In the code, when i'm trying to open IndexSearcher at a specific 
'Directory' location, it gives error of
FileNotFound: c:\raw\wcrawl\segments (Access Denied )

There are no software running in background (like antivirus etc.).

Please help
Thanks
Jeet Singh
