Hiya

Given that I have two high level business entities, catalog (containing
product information) and contract (containing filter criteria about which
products are available for sale and which are not), what is a better
approach?

1. To have two different indices and query them separately.
OR
2. Have only one physical index with two different types of document, one
for catalog and the other contract?

Thanks
Sid
