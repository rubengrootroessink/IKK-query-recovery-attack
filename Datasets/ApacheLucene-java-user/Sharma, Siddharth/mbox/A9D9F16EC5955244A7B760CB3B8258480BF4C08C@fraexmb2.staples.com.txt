Place the lucene jar file in the WEB-INF/lib directory of your web
application prior to creating its war.

If your ISP inspects the war and removes all jar files within it, then I
suppose you might just have to place all the lucene classes under
WEB-INF/classes of your web application as 'loose classes'.

But this is not a lucene related problem. You might be better served to ask
this question in a Java/J2EE forum.

Subject: lucene jar and war

Hello,

My provider only allows to upload war files. My problem is I make a war 
archive out of the lucene-1.4.3.jar file and my jsp webpages based on 
lucene. And this does not work. I hava one solution to solve my problem: 
I have to unpack the lucene-1.4.3.jar file and pack it again with my 
.jsp webpages in a war file. My question is: Is there any better solution?

Thank you in advance

Gaston
