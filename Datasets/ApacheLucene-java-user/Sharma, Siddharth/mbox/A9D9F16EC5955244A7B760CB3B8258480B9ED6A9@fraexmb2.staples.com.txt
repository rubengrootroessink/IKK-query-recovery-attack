Hi
I have an instance (each) of IndexSearcher and StandardAnalyzer housed in a
Singleton and I intend to use this one single instance (of Searcher and
Analyzer) for multiple concurrent search requests.
I vaguely remember reading that I (as a client) do not have to synchronize.
Lucene internals takes care of it.
Is this true?
Thx
Sid
