SUBJECT: JDK version with lucene 1.4.3
DATE: 2 Nov 2005

I have downloaded Lucene 1.4.3
I am trying to narrow down on the JRE version to use.
We have the flexibility to use 1.3.1 up.
Which JVM will be the best for running Lucene?
I saw a note on the FAQ that said that Lucene will run on 1.3.1 but will
require 1.4 to compile. 
Why would anyone want to compile the source on one version and run on
another?
