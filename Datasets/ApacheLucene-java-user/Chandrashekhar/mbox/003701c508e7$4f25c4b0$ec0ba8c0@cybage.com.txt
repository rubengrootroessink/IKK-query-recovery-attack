Hi,
If you r working on some CMS or similar app and want to  have user rights
module then you can use metadata for rights information and add this
metadata into index information then you can search on this metadata.

Subject: User Rights Management in Lucene


Hi,

I'm new to Lucene and want to know, whether Lucene has the capability of
displaying the search results based the Users Rights.

For Example:

There are suppose some resources, like :

Resource 1
Resource 2
Resource 3
Resource 4

And there are say 2 users with

User 1 having access to Resource 1, Resource 2 and Resource 4; and User
2 having access to Resource 1 and Resource 3

So when User 1 searches the database, then he should get results from
Resource 1, 2 and 4, but

When User 2 searches the databse, then he should get results from
Resource 1 and 3.

Regards
Atul Verma
