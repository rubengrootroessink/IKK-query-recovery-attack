Hi All,
I am using java lucene 1.3 to index content repository and want to use
clucene 0.8.10 for merge and search on these index files. search works well
but while merging two index files i am getting "term out of order"
exception.
So just wanted to know is there any difference between file formats of java
lucene and clucene? Also does clucene lib is reliable?


Regards,
Chandra
