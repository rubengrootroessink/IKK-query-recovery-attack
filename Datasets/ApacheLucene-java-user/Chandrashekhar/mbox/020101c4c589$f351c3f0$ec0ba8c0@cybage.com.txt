Hi,
I have query regarding index file portability of lucene 1.4 and clucene 0.8.12.
I have created index file in Java  - lucene 1.4  and now want to search some term in the same
index file by using clucene.
I am not getting results if i do that. 
So just wanted to make sure, does it support such kind of interportability?
