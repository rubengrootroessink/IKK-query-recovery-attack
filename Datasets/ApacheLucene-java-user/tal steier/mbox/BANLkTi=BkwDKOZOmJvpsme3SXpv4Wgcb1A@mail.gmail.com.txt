SUBJECT: finding the first document created since 3 weeks ago - Numeric Field
DATE: 5 Apr 2011

Hi,
I'm indexing a time stamp for every document, using a Numeric Field.
Was wandering if there's a correct way to find the first document newer then
a specific date (say 3 weeks ago).

I know I can perform a range search for a range starting 3 weeks ago and
ending now, but was wandering if there is a more efficient way.

Thank you,
Tal Steier
