I'm acutely interrested by this issue too, as I'm working on distributed 
architecture of Lucene. I'm only at the very beginning of my study so 
that I can't help you much, but Hadoop maybe could fit to your 
requirements. It's a sub-project of Lucene aiming to parallelise Lucene.
See http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/about.html but I don't know wether 
it scales well to very small clusters...

About your attached, I couldn't access it, it was only a "Partie 1.2" 
file containing this text:
