SUBJECT: Luke faster + Index Searcher is slow
DATE: 28 Jun 2007

I  have an index in one file that has a size of abt 18GB of data
When i run some queries on Luke the response comes in < 40 ms but the same
when I use IndexSearcher gives me in 300ms -600 ms
Any suggestions ?
The code i use is
                   File indexFile = new File(fileName);
                    FSDirectory dir = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexFile);
                    indexSearcher =new IndexSearcher(dir);
                   hits = indexSearcher.search(query);
