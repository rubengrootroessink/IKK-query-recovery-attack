I've had to deal with exactly this same scenario and, from what I know,
there is no equivalent in Lucene to a SQL != kind of query. So, you have to
have some way to select "everything" (whatever that means in your scenario)
and then remove the stuff that you don't want (the NOT portion). For my
application, I have a user permission field that I can use to select
everything that a user has access to and then I can "NOT out" the stuff
specified by the != portion of the query. These, of course, are two queries
that I AND together with a BooleanQuery.
