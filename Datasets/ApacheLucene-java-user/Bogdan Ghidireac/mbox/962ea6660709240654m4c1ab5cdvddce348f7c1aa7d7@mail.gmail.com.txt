thanks, that worked smoothly ..


Why do you want to transform the index from compound to non compound form?


My index is quite large (14GB) and this is because I use stored fields. The
requirements of the project force me to have a response time below 500ms and
I cannot do this at this moment (the tp99.9 is 700ms).

What I am planning to do is to use the standard format so I can move all
relevant files except .fdt and .fdx to a memory disk. After conversion the
.fdt + .fdx files have around 11.5GB.

I don't think there is an index reader that supports two locations (one for
index data and another one for stored data) but I will modify an existing
one and check the results.
