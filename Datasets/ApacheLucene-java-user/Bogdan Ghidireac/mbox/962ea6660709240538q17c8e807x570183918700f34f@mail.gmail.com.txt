Hi,

I have an optimized compound index and I want to transform it to standard
format. I tried to optimize using the standard format but I had no luck.. Is
there another way ? I don't want to re-index because it will take several
days.

IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(args[0], new StandardAnalyzer(),
false);
writer.setUseCompoundFile(false);
writer.setMaxBufferedDocs(10000);
writer.optimize();
writer.close();

Regards,
Bogdan
