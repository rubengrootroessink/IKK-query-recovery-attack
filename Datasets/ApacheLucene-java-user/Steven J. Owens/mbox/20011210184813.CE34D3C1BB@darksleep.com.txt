     I kind of agree with both sides here.  While it's a bit wasteful
to distribute the various tools as part of the Lucene checkout, I know
that I find it quite annoying to check a project out and then have to
go and find, download and install all of the other pieces, tools and
utilities.

     What would perhaps make more sense would be an optional checkout
of the necessary tools.  It would make even more sense to have a
site-wide jakarta tools checkout as well as a project-specific
optional checkout, but one st at a time.
