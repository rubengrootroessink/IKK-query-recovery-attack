     Lucene is a search engine API, not a search engine application.
Lucene provides all of the tools that a java programmer needs to build
a full-text search index.  It does not include a finished application
for end-user use.

     If your application doesn't include meta tags, it's because
whoever developed it didn't put in code to parse the meta tags and
store them in the lucene index.  To make it do so, get any basically
competent java programmer to extend your application by adding code to
parse the meta tags from the presumably HTML documents and store them
as an extra field in the Lucene documents your application generates.
It should not be a big deal, in terms of development, but it is not
the sort of thing you can do by just flipping a configuration switch.
