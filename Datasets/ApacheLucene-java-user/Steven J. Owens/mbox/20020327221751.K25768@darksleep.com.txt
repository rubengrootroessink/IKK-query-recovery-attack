     I meant to add, here, that many applications that do searching
and filtering will display the hits only a chunk at a time (typical
web search interface).  This is another situation where it would make
a lot more sense to filter after the search, since you'd only have to
filter a relatively small portion of the hits for each page of results
the user asks for. On top of that, the user may in fact get what they
were looking for in the first page or two of results.
