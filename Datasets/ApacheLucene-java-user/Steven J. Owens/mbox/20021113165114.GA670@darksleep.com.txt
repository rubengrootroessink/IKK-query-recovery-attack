     It's possible, but you'll need to write code to select and parse
the jsp files.  There may be code in the sandbox area at
jakarta.apache.org/lucene for doing this, though I don't see it.

     Nope, lucene stores search data in its own files.  You can easily
use lucene to build a search engine for data that's stored in a
database, but you don't need a database.
