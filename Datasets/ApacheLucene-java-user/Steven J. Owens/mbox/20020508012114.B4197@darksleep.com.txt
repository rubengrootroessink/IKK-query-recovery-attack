SUBJECT: List Archives?
DATE: 8 May 2002

Hey folks,

     I just tried to look something up in the list archives... and
found that I couldn't find the list archives.  The old geocrawler
archives appear to only have the old sourceforge list traffic.
Mail-archive.com isn't answering.  Google searching for "lucene-users"
just turns up geocrawler.  I see bulk hosting of the archive files at
http://jakarta.apache.org/mail/lucene-user/ but nothing searchable.  I
could swear I saw an eyebrowse archive running somewhere, or maybe
that was for some other jakarta project...
