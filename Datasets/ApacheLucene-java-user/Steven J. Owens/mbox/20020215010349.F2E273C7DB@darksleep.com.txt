     It also says:

"Lucene runs with JDK 1.1 and later.  However, if you're going to work
 with the development version of Lucene, we recommend you stick with
 the most current version of Java (at the time of this writing, JDK
 1.3).  Also, note that if you're working with the Lucene source,
 you'll need to use Ant (see below) and Ant requires at least JDK 1.1
 (and in the future will likely move to requiring JDK 1.2, according to
 the Ant install docs)."

     Hm, this was something that Doug specifically said to leave out
of the readme.  At the time, javaCC was included in the lucene lib
directory.

     Can you clarify what problems you had with build.properties?
