     I've been meaning to build something like this for a searchable,
annotatable mailing list archive, for years and years.  It's what got
me interested in lucene to begin with, then I got sidetracked into using
lucene for work purposes :-).  

     I actually started thinking about tackling this again, just this
week.  The main questions are generally where/how to store the
annotations, and whether I want to use lucene for the mail store or
use an adjacent sql database.

     This is the part that's always fascinated me - the idea of giving
a community of users the ability to add metadata to the archive and
facilitate the evolution of new ways of using/looking at the data.
