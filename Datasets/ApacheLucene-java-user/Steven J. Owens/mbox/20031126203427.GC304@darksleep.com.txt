     I've actually worked on a system that bundled GroupLens.  I think
it was Vignette StoryServer.  The Vignette docs were incredibly dense
with MarketingNewSpeak, so I could never quite figure out what they
said GroupLens actually *did* (not at a web-capable terminal right
now, or I'd just google it).

     Collaborative filtering in general is a topic I'm interested in,
and is why I first got into Lucene.  I wanted and still want to build
a collaborative filtering search engine for mailing lists and the
like.

     I do remember that FireFly's engine was supposed to graph all of
the users' ratings on a topic in an N-dimensional space, and then find
users "close" to the same user in that N-dimensional space, and
suggest topics that they'd liked, but that the current user hadn't
rated.

     I'm interested in more of a "free market" sort of approach than
in statistical analysis; I want to build a system that helps usrs
express their opinions, then nurture an emerging consensus.  My
experience has been that systems that systems/technologies that try to
facilitate the way users already do things, instead of replacing them
with new ways of doing things, tend to work better.
