     Java often has misleading error messages.  For example, on
solaris machines the default ulimit used to be 24 - that's 24 open
file handles!  Yeesh. This will cause an OutOfMemoryError.  So don't
assume it's actually a memory problem, particularly if a memory
problem doesn't particularly make sense.  Just a thought.
