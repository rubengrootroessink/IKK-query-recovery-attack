     This sounds about right.  It's a question of the applet sandbox,
not of lucene itself.

     I've done a little applet work in the past; my general advice is
that a "site-grabber with offline search functionality" is not
compatible with the constraints an applet must run under.
Specifically applets have no access to the local file system, and
applets may only open network connections back to the server they were
downloaded from.

     I strongly suggest you ditch the applet aspect entirely, and
maybe look into sun's Java Web Start, which attempts to give you a
good combination of the features of an applet and an application.

     What you say in this sentence could be rewritten more correctly
as, "it is only possible to access an existing index stored on a disk
by using one of three classes that access the disk."  Do you see the
tautology there?

     You do bring up one interesting possibility, which is that
perhaps Lucene should have some option to retrieve an index file from
a URL.  I'm not sure how wise this would be - if you're retrieving the
index file from a URL, why not just run the search at that URL? - but
it's something to consider.  You should think carefully about what
your goal is, and whether such an approach would help, and do a little
experimentation with the lucene code - after all, you have the source,
so you can create a new class to load an index from some remote
location.  If you have good results, maybe post the code here.
