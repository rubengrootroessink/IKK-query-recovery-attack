     That's "used to be", I think it's larger on newer machines.  I
don't think there's a java command line option to set this, it's a
system limit.  The solaris command to check it is "ulimit".  To set it
for a given login process (assuming sufficient privileges) use "ulimit
number" (i.e.  "ulimit 128").  "ulimit -a" prints out all limits.
