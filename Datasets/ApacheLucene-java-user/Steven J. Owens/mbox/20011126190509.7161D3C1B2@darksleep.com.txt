     Have you tested that with an applet and a non-lucene file?  It
looks a little weird to me, but, I've never tried to run an applet
locally and access the local disk, so I don't know.

     Regardless, this part of the discussion is in the area of applet
stuff, not lucene stuff, so it's inappropriate for this mailing list.

     Based on 2) above, you're saving the index to the local
directory, so why not just load it from the local directory?

     As I said last message, it shouldn't be difficult to modify your
lucene source to load from a URL.  Then you could post your changes
here, and Doug might decide to incorporate them into lucene in
general.  I'm still not really sure why you want to do it that way,
but give it a try.
