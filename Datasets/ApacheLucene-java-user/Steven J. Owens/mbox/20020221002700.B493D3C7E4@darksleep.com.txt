     Lucene doesn't do any crawling for you - it's your responsibility
to write the code that "crawls" your website, i.e. selects the data
sources to be indexed, chooses how to convert them to Lucene
Documents, and adds them to the indexes.  I suspect you're assuming
you would use the demo application.  That would not be appropriate for
your project.

     Instead, what you should do is:

1) write some java code that walks through your data source - i.e. if
your data source is a database, it would select each row in the
appropriate table - and composes a Lucene Document, and adds it to
your index.

2) write some servlets/jsps that do the search, and when it gets to
the point where you would redirect the user's browser off to the
appropriate HTML page, you either:

     a) invoke the appropriate JSP in your site with appropriate
        arguments

     or

     b) compose a page dynamically, roughly the same way the JSP page
        would compose it, and return it to the user.

     or

     c) redirect the user to a new JSP page, which you will have to
        write, which looks much like your old JSP page, but is
        designed to be invoked with an argument specifying what
        data to load.

     You may find http://darksleep.com/puff/lucene/lucene.html useful
in further clarifying this.  There is also a "getting started" article
at http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html that may be of
some use.
