     Frankly, I'm pretty much convinced that technical support for
commercial software products is a myth.  I sat down to make a list,
once, of the companies that provided really good support.  Then I
realized that they all made hardware (adtrans, cisco, sun).  

     I haven't dealt with major commercial software companies very
often, maybe a dozen times or more, though I have done some corporate
consulting where they paid for the red carpet treatment.  The support
never really seemed to be there - it always boiled down to "Oh yeah,
that's a known bug" or "Search the knowledge base at our website" or
"we'd have to send some $200/hour consultants down to figure that out
for you." (pal, I got news for you, if you're willing to spend
$200/hour for support of open source software I am *sure* the core
open source developers for the necessary software will be willing to
cut you a deal :-).

     I agree.  In general the open source community is always very
supportive and helpful, but generally you have ot be willing to do
your homework before asking the question, learn to ask intelligent
questions, and follow up on the advice and information you recieve.
This isn't to say you have to be a genius to get any respect; but you
do have to be willing to hold up your end (see
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
