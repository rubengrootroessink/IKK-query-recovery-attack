     In general, Doug has stated and people have found Lucene to be
thread safe.  Specifically, the index searcher is thread safe and the
index writer is thread safe.  The query parser is *not* thread safe
(so each thread using the index should have its own query parser).

     The index writer is thread safe, so you can update the index
while people are searching it.  However, you then have to make sure
that the threads with open index searchers close them and open new
ones, to get the newly updated data.
