SUBJECT: TR: How to search on all fields with one query ?
DATE: 18 Dec 2008

Hi,

I'm beginner on Lucene. I'm working on a Poc Lucene project at Generali
France company.

I have 40 fields (max ten words by field) in my index of about 6
millions documents.
I need to search a word in all fields.

Must I create a field "content" with all the informations of the others
fields ?
Do you have another way ?

Many thanks,
Guillaume
