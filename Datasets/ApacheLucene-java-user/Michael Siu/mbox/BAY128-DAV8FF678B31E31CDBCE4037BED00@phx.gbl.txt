The # of documents that we are going to index could be potentially more than
2G. So I guess I have to split the index file into multiple of files with
each contain up to 2G files. Any other suggestion?

Thanks.

Integer.MAX_VALUE

Multiple indices joined in a single MultiWhatNot is still limited to 
that number.

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ?

It should not be that difficult to upgrade int to longs, but it is a 
rather large job.

How many documents do you have? You might want to consider alternative 
ways to represent your corpus in the index so it takes less documents.
