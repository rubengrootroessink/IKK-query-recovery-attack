SUBJECT: RE: How to make a query that associates 2 index files
DATE: 6 May 2008

My problem is: the [content] value can be huge. Duplicating it in more than
one index document waste disk space (and search time?). In additions, when
new documents are added to the second index, it will be faster to just index
the linked [content] once (in first index file) and any subsequent reference
to the same [content] will not need to re-index.

In fact, I do not really need to physically separate the indices into 2
files because Lucene supports Heterogeneous documents in an index file. I
have no idea of how that work in a search. Does anyone know?

Thanks in advance.

You don't. You really have to roll your own solution here, there's
no "inter-index" awareness that I know of in Lucene.

Typically, people either do a half-half solution (that is, put the
text search in Lucene and leave the DB parts in the DB) or
de-normalize the data in a Lucene index so you don't have
to even try to do things cross-index.

And then there's Marcelo Ochoa (I may have the spelling wrong) who's
put together some way to embed Lucene in an Oracle database, but
that's magic to me.

Why do you want to arrange your index this way in the first place?
Perhaps there's a more specific answer waiting out there...

Best
Erick
