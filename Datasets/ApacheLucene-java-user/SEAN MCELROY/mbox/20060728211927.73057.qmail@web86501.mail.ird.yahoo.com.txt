  Hi,

Please change the "url" to "path" in the result JSP file. coz the field

Hello,

I am trying to use the luceneweb application that is shipped with the
lucene installation. I have followed the installation instructions and
the luceneweb application has been successfully deployed using Tomcat
5.5.9. However all the results returned point to
http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/null. The version of lucene I am
using is 2.0.0, I have had to change the following code in results.jsp
to get the example to work

Original code
//query = QueryParser.parse(queryString, "contents", analyzer);
//parse the 

//Replaced code - found this on the net
QueryParser qp = new QueryParser("contents", analyzer); 
query = qp.parse(queryString); 

Can anyone shed some light on this problem?

Thanks.
