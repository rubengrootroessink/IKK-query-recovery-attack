Peter,

Check out Compass:
http://compass.sourceforge.net/

It is a layer that can integrate Hibernate and Lucene for you...

Thanks,
Zach

Subject: Lucene + Persistence

Hi,
First off, I would just like to thank everyone who has contributed to
the gem we all know was Lucene.

I am thinking of using Lucene purely for text indexing and using a
persistence mechanism like hibernate to search structured data. Would it
be a good idea to use filters that do hibernate queries as criteria with
Lucene queries?

Thanks,
Peter Gelderbloem
