SUBJECT: Best practice setup in multi server environment?
DATE: 17 Mar 2006


Hi,

I am currently working on switching from MySQL fulltext search to Lucene.
The indexing and searching already works pretty well. I have the following
environment:
1 web server running PHP
1 MySQL server (which will still be used, but not for fulltext queries)
1 server running Lucene
The Lucene index will be created out of the MySQL data.

My question: How can I send a query from the webserver using PHP to the
Lucene server and get my list of result IDs back? 
I suppose one needs some kind of daemon?
Or would if be feasible to setup a Tomcat webserver on the Lucene server
that handles the queries?

Best regards,
Jens
