SUBJECT: Lucene and Geographic Searching
DATE: 9 Oct 2002

Hi,

I'm very interested in migrating our current search engine to use Lucene.  
After evaluating Lucene, I have become very impressed and have been telling 
lots of people about it.  One requirement that we have is to be able to 
search our documents by specifying a geographical boundary.  I searched 
everything I could find on Lucene but I barely found any mention of anyone 
using it for such a purpose.  My XML documents contain both temporal and 
spatial information that I would like my users to be able to search on.  Does 
such a thing exist for Lucene?  Is there an easy way to do this with Lucene?  
Is there interest in adding this type of functionality to Lucene if it 
doesn't exist?  Could something like GeoTools or some other Java toolkit be 
integrated into Lucene.  I would even offer my help to make it so, if there 
is a need.
