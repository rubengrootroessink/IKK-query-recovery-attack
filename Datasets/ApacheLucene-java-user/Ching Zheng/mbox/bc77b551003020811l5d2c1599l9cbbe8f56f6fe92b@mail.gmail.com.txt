SUBJECT: Help wanted with Indexing PDF Documents
DATE: 2 Mar 2010

Hi,
I have about 50 PDF douments with size of each is around 10MB. I am using
PDFbox for parsing, just wondering how I can index bookmarsk with its
corresponded page information?

I use PDDocumentOutline to get bookmark's title, but I only have
PDNamedDestination which offers no page number info. Can someone shed some
light on this? Thanks  a lot.
