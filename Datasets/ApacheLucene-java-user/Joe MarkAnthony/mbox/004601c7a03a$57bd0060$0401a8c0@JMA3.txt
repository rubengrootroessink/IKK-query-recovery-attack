SUBJECT: Number of documents in an index with filter
DATE: 27 May 2007


Greetings,

I would like to add the number of possible hits in my queries, for example,
"found 18 hits out of a possible 245,000 documents".  I am assuming that
IndexReader.numDocs() is the best way to get this value.

However, I would like to use a filter as part of the query.  What is the
most efficient way to get the total number of documents given a filter on a
query?

Thanks,
J
