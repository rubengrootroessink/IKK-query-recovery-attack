SUBJECT: Opposite to StopFilter. Anything already implemented out there?
DATE: 22 Jul 2008


Hi All, 

I want to index some incoming text. In this case what I want to do is just
detect keywords in that text. Therefore I want to discard everything that is
not in the keywords set. This sounds to me pretty much like the reverse of
using stop words, that is it I want to use a set of "accepted" words. 

So I planned to create a new filter that just checks that incoming words are
in the "acceptable set" and discards them otherwise. Are you aware of any
analyzer/filter out there that uses this approach? Is there any other better
way to do this?

Best Regards,
Martin
