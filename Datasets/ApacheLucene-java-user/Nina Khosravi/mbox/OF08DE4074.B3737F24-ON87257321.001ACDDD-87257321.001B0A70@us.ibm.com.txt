Sure.  It is one of the contributed analyzers.

The Java docs are here:
http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/index.html.

Also, the source files are  here:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/analyzers/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/cjk/

Thanks,
Nina

Subject: CJKAnalyzer - Issues with scoring




Hello,

I am in desperate need of help on a problem with our newly deployed
application that is now using the CJKAnalyzer/CJKTokenizer.  Our previous
release was using the WhitespaceAnalyzer and the users were extremely happy
with the search results ordered by the score of the documents.  We switched
to the CJKAnalyzer and now the scoring is not giving them the results they
are expecting.   Any ideas on why using the CJKAnalyzer would be so
different?  Some documents that contain more instances of a search term are
appearing at a lower position in the search results than those having one
instance of the search term.

I tried printing the explanation of the scoring but don't get any
information, just the value 0.0 for each doc returned.  Anyone have any
ideas?  I have not dug deep into this problem.  I am pressed for time so
was hoping someone could provide some guidance.

Thanks!!

Nina
