SUBJECT: Possibility of a relational query?
DATE: 17 Mar 2006

I have a need to issue a query that is typically performed on a relational 
database. I may have to give up on this idea but thought I may ask if 
there is a way to handle this type query. Let's say my documents all have 
2 fields fieldA and fieldB. Is there a query that can return hits for all 
documents where fieldA equals fieldB regardless of what values these 2 
fields have?
