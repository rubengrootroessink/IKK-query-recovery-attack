SUBJECT: StandardFilter - can I escape certain chars (such as * and ?)
DATE: 20 Oct 2005

Hello

I am building a search api that will search against content that was 
indexed using the StandardAnalyzer. I am trying to simulate the same 
filtering that occurs when the index was created on the search string. I 
am using the StandardTokenizer and StopFilter. The problem I'm 
encountering is that the StandardTokenizer removes the Lucene special 
characters such as the wildcard char, *, and ?. Is there a way to exclude 
which characters are stripped out when I use either the StandardTokenizer 
or StandardFilter. I want to retain the Lucene special chars. 

I guess my other option is to not use the StandardFilter but strip out the 
special characters myself. I need to build a special query that is similar 
to what MultiTermQueryParser gives you but with some changes that is why I 
am analyzing the input myself to build the query myself. 

Regards,
Nina Khosravi
