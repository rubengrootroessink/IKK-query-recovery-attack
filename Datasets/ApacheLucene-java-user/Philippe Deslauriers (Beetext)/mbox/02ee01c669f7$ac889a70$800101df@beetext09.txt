SUBJECT: Occurence (freq) and ordering
DATE: 27 Apr 2006

Hi again,

 

Upgrading from lucene 1.3 to 1.9.

 

We need to order the result in order of occurrences (score of a doc = sum of
occurrences of all Query).

In lucene 1.3 we did rewrite all the Query classes (BooleanQuery,
PhraseQuery, etc..) to reach our goals, but is there an easier way to do it
in 1.9?

 

I am just starting to read on Similarity, weights etc.

 

Can someone give me a heads up?

 

Thanks!
