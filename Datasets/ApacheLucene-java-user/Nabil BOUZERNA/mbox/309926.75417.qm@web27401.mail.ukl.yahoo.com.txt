SUBJECT: Hits document offset information
DATE: 2 Sep 2008

Hi All,

I have following problem. 

All threads similar to my problem are former so I try a new post.
 
When I execute a search (Lucene Core 2.3.2) I receive the list of document Hits. 
Then, I call current highlighter (2.3.2) to get the best fragments  : getBestFragments(tokenStream,
texte,1,"...");

Now, I would like to to access to the best fragments offsetsfrom each document (hits.doc(i)).


Any recommendations to obtain offsets ? 

Thanks,

Nabil
