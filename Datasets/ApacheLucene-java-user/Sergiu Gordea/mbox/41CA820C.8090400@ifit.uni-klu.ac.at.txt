SUBJECT: Re: addIndexes() Question
DATE: 23 Dec 2004

I think you should change a little bit your plans, and to think that 
your goal is to
create a fast search engine not a fast indexing engine.
When you plan to index a lot of documents then it is possible to creata 
a lot of segments (if you don't optimize the index)
and the serch will be very slow comparing with the search on an 
optimized index.
The problem is that the optimization of big indexes is a time consuming 
operation, and also

addIndexes(Directory[] dirs) I think is also a time consuming operation.

 Therefore I suggest to think how can you design the indices to have a fast search, and then

you should design an offline indexing process. 

 That is my suggestion ... maybe it doesn't fit your requirements, maybe it does ...
 
  All the best,

  Sergiu
