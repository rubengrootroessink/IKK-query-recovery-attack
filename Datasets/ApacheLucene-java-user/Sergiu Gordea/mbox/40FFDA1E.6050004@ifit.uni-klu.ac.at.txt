SUBJECT: Re: rebuild index
DATE: 22 Jul 2004

Because on the other hand I want to have a clean index, without any kind 
of garbage.

This is the requested funtionality of the rebuild index function.
Clean Index and don't loose data.

I was also thinking that I can delete the index location and create a 
new index, this may have the same effect as the missing
deleteAll() method. But in this case I loose all the data from index 
forever, and If  I get a error because of write lock,
I may have no index at all. Which is inacceptable for a productve system.

Anyway, thanks for ideea, It may work if I merge the indexes in my code, 
but I don't fill that this is the right way to solve the problem.
