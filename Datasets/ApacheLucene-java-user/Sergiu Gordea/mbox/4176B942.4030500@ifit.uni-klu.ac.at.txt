the subject must be also tokennized, otherwise you cannot get any 
results that doesn't match the Term exaclty

 so ... for example, let's asume you have the folowing titles:
"George Trash Elections"
"George Trash"

if you search for "George Trash" and your title is not tokenized you 
will get just the second document (I hope I'm
not making any mistake when I say that, anyway it can be easily tested).

how is there represented in the GUI as a select box? or input field?
if it is select box, if you have the concept of unique domain concept  
.. you can use a  a not tokenized string, or even a numerical
representation, but I think it is not your case.
In the case of input fields .. again I suggest you to tokenize the string

no problem ... once again .. use
+subject:"my searched subject"

the tokenization doesn't change the word order, in the case you use a 
PhraseQuery you will get the correct results

+title:"George Bush"
doesn't return documents with the title
"Bush George"

:)) This is a general truth the the result are better when the people 
know what they are searching for :)

I cannot see anything special in your problem.
Before strating to implement a complex solution probably will be better 
to give it a chance to the simple one ...
I ensure you that you won't loose anything, and even if you decide to 
implement complex solutions you will have
a lot of reusable code.

 so ... Have fun,

  Sergiu

PS: if you can provide an example with a false positive please ... 
provide us the case
