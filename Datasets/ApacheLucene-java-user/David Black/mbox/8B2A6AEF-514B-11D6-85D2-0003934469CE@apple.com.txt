SUBJECT: HTML Analyzer & filter
DATE: 16 Apr 2002

Not to seem too lazy but I was just beginning to write an HTML Filter 
and Analyzer and thought..."gee, I bet someone has done this already".  
Are there any Apache/GPL HTML filters out there as a part of another 
project or that anyone on this list would be willing to contribute.

Thanks
