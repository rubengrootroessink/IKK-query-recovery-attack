SUBJECT: Associating Page Numbers in large documents
DATE: 23 Apr 2004

I have a multiple page document and I would like to be able to provide 
the page number(s) where the "hit" was found.

I'm thinking that I could index each page separately and have a field 
that indicates if it's a child (member) of a larger "parent" document 
and then let manipulate the results to return a single result with the 
page number(s).

Is there a better way to approach this?


Thank You.
