SUBJECT: Re: Cannot compile Lucene
DATE: 24 Apr 2002

I'm writing a WebObjects application with Lucene and ProjectBuilder and 
had to compile the Lucene project via ant and include the jar in my 
project resources.  Ideally, I would like to create a Framework with the 
Lucene source and I haven't figured out how to get the javacc part to 
work....I think it's just a hack to the build scripts in the targets 
section.  I will be curious to see how this is accomplished and will do 
some research on this topic.
