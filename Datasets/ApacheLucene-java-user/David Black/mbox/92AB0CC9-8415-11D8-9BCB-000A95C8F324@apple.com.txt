SUBJECT: Nested category strategy
DATE: 1 Apr 2004

Hey All,

I'm trying to figure out the best approach to something.

Each document I index has an array of categories which looks like the 
following example....

/Science/Medicine/Serology/blood gas
/Biology/Fluids/Blood/

etc.

Anyway, there's a couple things I'm trying to deal with.

1. The fact that we have an undefined array size.  I can't just shove 
these into a single field.  I could explode them into multiple fields 
on the fly like category_1, category_2. etc. etc

2. The fact that a search will need to be performed like " category: 
/Science/Medicine/*" would need to return all items within that 
category.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can give me some help here.

Thanks
