Hi Eric,

Tnx, I just saw the example in Lucene in Action.  But I am not sure how I can apply it in
my case as it was used to sort the results, but what I need is to get only the records that
are within a limit radius.  And I want the results to be sorted according to score (text match
on title ).  

Tnx for pointing me to that direction, I will study it and see how I can use it.  

Johnny

There's also an example of something very similar in Lucene In Action.
