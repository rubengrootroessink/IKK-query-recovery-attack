I need to use getTermFreqVector on a subset of docs that belong to the hits for a query. I
understand I need to pass the docNumber as an argument in this case. How do I access that.

For ex .

doc = hits.doc(0);
TermFreqVector vector = reader.getTermFreqVector(docId, "field");


How do I get docId?
