I use ant for many other builds so I know that's not the problem.

When I run 'ant' from the directory I have untarred lucene to I get a 'build 
failed' error, it says,

Cannot find common-build.xml imported from /root/lucene-1.9.1/build.xml

Where could I find common-build.xml, and build-deprecated.xml??

Jim
