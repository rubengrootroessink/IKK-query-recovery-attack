DATE: 18 Jan 2011

[X] ASF Mirrors (linked in our release announcements or via the Lucene
website)

[] Maven repository (whether you use Maven, Ant+Ivy, Buildr, etc.)

[] I/we build them from source via an SVN/Git checkout.

[] Other (someone in your company mirrors them internally or via a
downstream project)
