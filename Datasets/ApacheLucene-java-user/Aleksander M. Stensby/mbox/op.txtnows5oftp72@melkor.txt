SUBJECT: Re: Indexer / Searcher holding deleted files
DATE: 29 Aug 2007

Hmm, yeah, well thats what I do now...
Shouldn't it be sufficient to do:

searcher.close();
(...)
searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexPath);


Or?

And maybe wrap that in
if(searcher.getIndexReader.hasDeletions())
and possibly (!searcher.getIndexReader.isCurrent())

thanks,
Aleksander
