DATE: 29 Jun 2006

No... Don't think thats the idea.

I think that u would make use of the wordnet index after a user have  
inputted a search. U take each term of the search, look up those terms in  
the wordnet index, then use the results you get to search your index for  
all those aggregated terms along with the users initial search.

Then you return the matches.

But, I may be wrong..
