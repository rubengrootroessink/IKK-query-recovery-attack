SUBJECT: Re: Reviving a dead index
DATE: 23 Nov 2006

Hey, saw this old thread, and was just wondering if any of you solved the  
problem? Same has happened to me now. Couldn't really trace back to the  
origin of the problem, but the segments file references a segment that is  
obviously corrupt/not complete...

I thought i might remove the uncomplete segment, but then i guess this  
would f* up my segments file. Any taker on how to remove the segment in  
question, and make the rest of the index work again?.. Since i guess its  
not as straightforward to just remove the segmentname from the segments  
file without changing some of the other crytic bytes aswell..?
