I think that the closest you get to "scoped" search in your case would be  
to use filters. (If you index your paths, or if the documents have some  
standarized format, I assume you could just use one field per element in  
your document.)

Maybe you could say a bit about you document structure? (If your question  
is a XML specific parsing question, the Lucene mailing list isn't really  
right place...)
