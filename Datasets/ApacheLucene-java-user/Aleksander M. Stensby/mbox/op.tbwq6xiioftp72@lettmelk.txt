If your database table looks like this:

ID - Content - Subject - Author

you get the fields from you db and assumably store them in some bean, or  
directly in strings like this;
String id, content, subject, author.

you can create a lucene document in this fashion:

final Document doc = new Document();

doc.add(new Field("id", id, Store.YES, Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
doc.add(new Field("content", content, Store.NO, Index.TOKENIZED));
... and so on

Store.* and Index.* choices depend on your need.

then store the document to you index using

writer.addDocument(doc);

Of course it is a bit dirty to name the fields in the code and you could  
for instance declare the field-names

like:
public static final String SIGNATUREURI = "signatureuri";

Hope this helps. If you read a bit in the wiki, you will find a nice deal  
of pointers there aswell.
