DATE: 24 Dec 2008

Hello Amar,
the reason why people got confused from your questions is that you are  
using Hibernate Search (which is built on top of Lucene and Hibernate) to  
persist objects from your DB to lucene. So, you should really ask such  
questions on the hibernate mailing list since the indexing logic has  
nothing at all to do with Lucene (since you are using annotations).
If you were to use Lucene directly, you would read values from you DB  
(possibly into you Entity Bean), then transform values into fields and  
index with IndexWriter. This is where Erick mentions that you could just  
do something like
if(recipe.getChain == null) {
  //add field with value = "NULLNULLNULL"
}else{
  ...
  // add value that we get from the chain object.
}


cheers,
  Aleks
