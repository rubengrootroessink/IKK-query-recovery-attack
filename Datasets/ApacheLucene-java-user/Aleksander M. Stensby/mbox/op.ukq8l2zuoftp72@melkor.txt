SUBJECT: Re: how to estimate how much memory is required to support the large index search
DATE: 17 Nov 2008

One major factor that may result in heap space problems is if you are  
doing any form of sorting when searching. Do you have any form of default  
sort in your application? Also, the type of field used for sorting is  
important with regard to memory consumption.

This issue has been discussed before on the list. (You can search the  
archive for sorting and memory consumption.)
