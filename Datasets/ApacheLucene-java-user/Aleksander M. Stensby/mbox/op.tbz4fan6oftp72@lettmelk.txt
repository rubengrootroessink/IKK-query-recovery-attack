Well, it is common in most databasesystems, that if you dont specify a  
sort, you get the results sorted by id, or by when the rows are inserted  
into the db.

The quickest way for you is to write around your query.
instead of doing one query, just do where queries with equals. this would  
produce a bit overflow if you have your database on an external server,  
but again, the quickest query to ever run in sql are equals-queries. Since  
the ID is unique (i hope so), it should be no problem at all.
... WHERE id = 2;
... WHERE id = 3
... WHERE id = 19
and so on would give you the correct relevance-order.
