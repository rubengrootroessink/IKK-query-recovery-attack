SUBJECT: Indexer / Searcher holding deleted files
DATE: 29 Aug 2007

Hello everyone. I have a system where an indexing-process is running  
several times a day, adding documents, and performing an optimize() at the  
end of every run.
In addition, we have a web-application (running in tomcat) that is used to  
perform searches on the index(es).

The problem (probably because of my lack of knowledge) is that when the  
indexer has performed its optimize routine, marking the files as (deleted)  
in the filesystem (a unix system), the files are not deleted, because  
tomcat is keeping the files locked... SO as you can all imagine, the lvm  
is ever growing... Problem of course solves itself through a  
Tomcat-restart, but that's not a very ideal solution to perform restarts  
every other day or so...

I presume its the IndexReader and/or IndexSearcher that is keeping the  
files locked for deletion (in the web-application). So, i was wondering if  
any of you have any input on how I can release the files (or actually just  
delete them after the optimize routine in the indexer right away...

Than you very much for any feedback!
