Your query includeds apostrophes which tells google to include common  
words in the query.
But, if you remove the apostrophes, you will still get results, as google  
states:

"Google ignores stop words when they're placed in searches alongside less  
common words. For example, a search for [ The Sound and the Fury ] will  
only return results for the terms "Sound" and "Fury." However, a search  
that only includes stop words -- [ The Who ], for example -- will be  
processed as is."

The key here is "when they're placed in searches alongside less common  
words".

Hope that answers your questions.
