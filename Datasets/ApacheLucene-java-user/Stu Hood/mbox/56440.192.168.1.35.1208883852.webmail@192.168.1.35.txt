Hey Mike,

Thank you very much for looking into this issue!

I originally switched to the SerialMergeScheduler to try and work around this bug: http://lucene.markmail.org/message/awkkunr7j24nh4qj
. I switched back to the ConcurrentMergeScheduler yesterday (since I would rather fail quickly
due to the linked issue, rather than hang due to the bug we discovered).

Nonetheless, Lucene is great, and I really appreciate your hard work! Would you mind sending
out a link to the issue you created?

Thanks,
Stu
