Hey gang,

I think we've been suffering from the following bug, and I have a question about the JVM fix.

http://markmail.org/message/di3vdyfq5odfbai6

We're running 1.6.0_05 and Lucene 2.3.2.

Supposedly downgrading to 1.6.0_02 will fix the issue, but I'd much rather upgrade if possible.
1.6.0_06 is out, and I was wondering if anyone had tested it with Lucene 2.3.2?

Thanks,
