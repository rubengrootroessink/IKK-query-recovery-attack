Hey Mike,

Thanks for your input... the 'IndexWriter.close' call was actually in a 'finally' block around
the merge code, without a 'catch', which I realized may have been hiding the exception (I
didn't realize close would block if an exception had occurred).

I've moved the close out of the finally block, so hopefully if an exception was being hidden,
I'll see it and report back.

Thanks,
Stu
