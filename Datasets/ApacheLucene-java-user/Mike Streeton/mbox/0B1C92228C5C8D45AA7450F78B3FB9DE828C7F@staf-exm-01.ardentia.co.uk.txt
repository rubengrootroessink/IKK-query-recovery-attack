SUBJECT: Copying documents
DATE: 25 Jul 2006

I want to copy a selection of documents from one index to another. I can
get the Document objects from the IndexReader and write them to the
target index using the IndexWriter. The problem I have is this loses
fields that have not been stored, is there a way round this.

 

Thanks

 

Mike
