SUBJECT: Terms contain spaces
DATE: 27 Oct 2005

I have been given an index with a term that has been stored as a keyword
and contains spaces. We are parsing a query using QueryParser but given
'myfield:"abc def"' it generates a PhraseQuery for myfield:abc and
myfield:def. What is needed is a TermQuery(new Term(myfield,"abc def")).
Can you tell query parser what to generate for strings in quotes? 

 

Thanks

 

Mike
