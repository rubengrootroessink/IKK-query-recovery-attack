Are there any issues surrounding TermDocs.skipTo(). I have a index that works okay if I use
TermDocs.next() to find next doc id, but using skipTo to go to the one after a point can miss
sometimes.

e.g. Iterating using TermDocs.next() and TermDocs.doc() 1,50,10000,20000 but suing TermDocs.skipTo(51)
returns false indicating that no doc id > 50 exists.

I will try and create a sample index to show this.

Many Thanks

Mike
