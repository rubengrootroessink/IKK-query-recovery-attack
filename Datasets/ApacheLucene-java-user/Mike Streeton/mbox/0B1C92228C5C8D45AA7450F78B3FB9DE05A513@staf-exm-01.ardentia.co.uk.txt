Thanks for this, I did not really explain my self well in the original
question, what I was interested to know is would a single Searcher
constructed from a MultiReader (across several different indexes) work
better than a MultiSearcher constructed from IndexSearchers each
pointing at a single index?

Thanks

Mike

Look at IndexReader.open()
It actually uses a MultiReader if there are multiple segments.
