Yonik,
    Thanks for this , I have checked and it is not at the end of the index, but something
funny is happening. It is a multireader each reader within it has 100,000 documents, but when
it fails it is trying to access a document e.g. 123,456, in the segment that only has 100,000

Many Thanks

Mike

I bet you are triggering an issue in multi-level skip lists by
attempting to skipTo a target past maxDoc (which per the javadoc,
seems like it should be legal).

So a short term workaround for you might be to first test if the
target you are trying to skip to is less than maxDoc().
