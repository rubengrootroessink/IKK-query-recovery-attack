SUBJECT: Switching default parsing for Or and AND
DATE: 3 Jan 2006

Is there a way of altering the way lucene parses a default string to use
AND instead of OR, e.g. usually "joe bloggs" is executed as "joe OR
bloggs", is there a flag to change this to "joe AND bloggs" which seems
to be the way most search engines work.

 

Thanks

 

Mike
