I would use a RangeFilter instead of using the default Boolean query as
this will always break at some point with Too many Boolean clauses.
Extend QueryParser to sort this out.  As far as extracting information
from log files I would look at creating yourself a LogAnalyzer that can
interpret the contents and indexing it appropriately.

Hope this helps

Subject: Using Lucene to search log files

Hi All,

Im a Lucene newbie,


Requirement : 
==============
a) Build a log viewer tool, search log files for
keywords and time stamp

b)  files in production approx 200 logs per day and
each log file may range from 1MB - 5MB

Lucene 
========
We wanted to utilize Lucene's search capabilities
especially search all 200 log files content quickly

a) Search criteria:
    i) Timestamp search: Fetch contents between any
two timestamps 

   ii) Fetch log file contents for specified keyword 


Query 
========
    a ) Would greatly appreciate if some suggestions 
        whether Lucene will be appropriate tool for
the requirement ??


    b) I have tried to use SpanQuery however
struggling to fetch entire conents e.g. (between two
timestamps) 

    c) I had also looked at
LargeScaleDateRangeProcessing in the wiki, is that a
right approach for the requirement



  Any help / suggestion would be greatly appreciated,


  Many thanks in advance,
  Abdul
