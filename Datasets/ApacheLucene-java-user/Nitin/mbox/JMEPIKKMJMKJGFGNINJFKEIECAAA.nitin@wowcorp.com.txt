  Hallo everybody,


  I am beginning with Lucene. I tested the Webdemo described in the
Book on my HomePC. When I upload it on a webserver, this example
works but he doesn't find any keyword, the result of every search is
null results. I have uploaded the same index consists of 3files
deletable,segments and _9m.cfs. On my homepc i have as an example for
the jeyword "java" many results , on the webhost account null
results. Perhaps anybody had the same problem than me and can give my
a hint what I do wrong.

  Thank you

  Greetings


  Gaston
