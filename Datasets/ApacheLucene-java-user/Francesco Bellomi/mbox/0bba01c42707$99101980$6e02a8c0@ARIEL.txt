Doug, thanks for your suggestions!

I will implement your solution and make it public.
We already use a 1.4 JVM, so we have no problems with that.

The only problem is that, as lucene 1.4rc2, FSDirectory is 'final'; I would
go for the subclassing solution if you can make it not final; otherwise, if
someone has good arguments for the single 'fat' FSDirectory solution, just
let me know it.
In fact, a third architectural approach would be to define an API for
"pluggable" lock implementations: IMHO that would be more robust to changes
in the Directory interface and implementations.

Thanks again!
Francesco
