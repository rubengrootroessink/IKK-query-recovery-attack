SUBJECT: Locking problems with NFS
DATE: 20 Apr 2004

Dear Lucene users,

we are experiencing some difficulties in using Lucene with a NFS filesystem.
Basically, locking seems not to work properly, since it appears that
attempted concurring writing on the index (from different VMs) are not
blocked, and this often causes the index to be corrupted.

I found a reference to this topic in the archives:
http://issues.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apac
he.org&msgId=784959

Does anybody have a solution for this problem? Does anyone have some
suggestions about the implementation of some alternative approach for
locking, in order to make Lucene compatible with NFS?

We are using 1.4rc2.

Thanks in advance,
Francesco
