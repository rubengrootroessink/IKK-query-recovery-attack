SUBJECT: using relative paths
DATE: 20 Feb 2004

Hi
I am using Lucene with Struts framework in my web application.
I am using Tomcat and have my application in webapp directory. I want to create indexes for
all the HTMLs lying in html folder. 
I am facing problem in giving relative paths for the source and index folders in my fn to
create index.

indexDocs(root, index, create);    // add new docs

How can i give relative paths for that..
Pls give me some example.. that will be helpful

Thanks..
Raman Garg
