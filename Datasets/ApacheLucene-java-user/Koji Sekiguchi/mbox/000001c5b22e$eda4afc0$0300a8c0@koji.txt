SUBJECT: TermVectorOffsetInfo class?
DATE: 5 Sep 2005

Hi,

I wanted to try highlighter in contrib, compiled it and
I got a compile error because there isn't TermVectorOffsetInfo
class which is imported by TokenSources.java:

import org.apache.lucene.index.TermVectorOffsetInfo;

I tried to find the issues on Bugzilla, but couldn't find them.

Where can I get the class?

Thanks in advance,

Koji
