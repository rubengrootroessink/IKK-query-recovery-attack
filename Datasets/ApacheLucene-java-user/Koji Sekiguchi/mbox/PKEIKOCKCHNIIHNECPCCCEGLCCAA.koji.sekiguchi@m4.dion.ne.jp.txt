I'm curious to know "Candidate Identification for QA".
At your PPT slide p.19,

"Can be as short as a word or as large as multiple documents, based on
system goals"

Can you explain it in more detail?
I expect that QAService.java implements the spirit of the above sentence,
but I couldn't understand the meaning.

Thanks in advance,

Koji
