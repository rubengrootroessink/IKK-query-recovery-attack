Anupam,

I'm sorry but no plan. Why I developed *FVH* (not FHV :) is because one of our customer
required the highlighting feature for N-gram field. Now it has been contributed back to
the community, I've used FVH for a lot of customers. But they are using CJKTokanizer
or similar tokenizer which is minGram=maxGram. I don't have strong motivation of removing
the restriction myself, but I'm open to accept patches as always.
