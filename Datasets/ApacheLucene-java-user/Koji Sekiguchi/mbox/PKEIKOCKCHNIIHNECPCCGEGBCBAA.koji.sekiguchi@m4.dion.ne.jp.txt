SUBJECT: What is stemming?
DATE: 20 Nov 2005

Hello, Luceners!

What is "stemming"?

I have Lucene in Action and found the following definitions on page 103:

- reducing words to a root form (stemming)
- changing words into the basic form (lemmatization)

but I cannot see the difference between them.
I'm also confused by the following words on page 71:

- convert terms to base word forms (stemming)

It seems "lemmatization" to me...

Could someone explain what "stemming" is?
Some illustrative cases would be very appreciated.
My mother tongue is not English.

Thank you,

Koji
