One possibility I can think of is that you are using CJKAnalyzer and 
Lucene 2.0 or previous version.
The combination of those cannot highlight CJK keywords correctly.
If this is your case, try StandardAnalyzer or upgrading Lucene 2.1/2.2 
and its CJKAnalyzer and highlighter.

Also check:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-627

Hope this helps,
