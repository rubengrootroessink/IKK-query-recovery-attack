How about using BoostingTermQuery and Payload?

1. In your Analyzer, put a value (boost value, for example) into payload 
of Token "fox" and "dog".
2. Define your Similarity and override scorePayload() method to boost 
marked token.
3. Use your Similarity when construct IndexSearcher, and use 
BoostingTermQuery when searching.
