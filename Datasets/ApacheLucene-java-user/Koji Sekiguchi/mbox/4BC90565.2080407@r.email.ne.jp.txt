Did you try QueryScorer? If I remember it correctly, QueryScorer
can recognize phrase matches. Note that QueryScorer can recognize phrases,
though, tagging works per term in phrase query, not phrase. i.e. if your 
query is
phrase "foo bar", highlighter will return <b>foo</b> <b>bar</b>, not
<b>foo bar</b>.
