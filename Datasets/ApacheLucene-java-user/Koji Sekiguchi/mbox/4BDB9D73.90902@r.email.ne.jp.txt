SUBJECT: FieldCache memory estimation - term values are interned?
DATE: 1 May 2010

Hello,

Are Strings that are got via FieldCache.DEFAULT.getStrings( reader,
field ) interned?

Since I have a requirement for having FieldCaches of some
fields in 250M docs index, I'd like to estimate memory
consumed by FieldCache.

By looking at FieldCacheImpl source code, it seems that
field names are interned, but values are not?

Than you,

Koji
