DATE: 26 Jan 2009

Hello,

I have a requirement to search English words with taking into account
conjugation of verbs and comparative and superlative of adjectives.
I googled but couldn't find solution so far. Do I have to have a synonym
table
to solve this problem or is there someone who have good solution in this
list?

regards,

Koji
