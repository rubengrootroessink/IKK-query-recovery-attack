SUBJECT: score formula in Similarity javadoc
DATE: 26 Oct 2005

Hello,

I apologize if this list is not appropriate for sending a patch.

It seems there is an error on score formula in Similarity javadoc:

score(q,d) = sigma( tf * idf^2 * ... )

should be

score(q,d) = sigma( tf * idf * ... )

if my understanding is correct, I would appreciate it if
someone could apply the attached patch to svn.

BTW, in java langauge, operator ^ means BIT XOR... :)

regards,

Koji
