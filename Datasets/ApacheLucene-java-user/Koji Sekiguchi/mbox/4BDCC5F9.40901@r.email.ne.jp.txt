Yeah, you are right. Because I could see the arbitrary two Strings that have
same value were identical (== is true) in String[] gotten by 
getStrings() but
I coudn't see explicit intern() for them, I asked. Can you elaborate who 
done it?

Yes, I think StringIndex is better than String[] for my requirement in terms
of memory consumption as well (an extreme case, male/female field etc.).
