Hi Steve,

You cannot access FieldTermStack from FVH, but I think you
can create it by your own. To know how to do it, please refer to
FieldTermStackTest.java. To instantiate FieldTermStack, FieldQuery
object is needed. And FieldQuery object can be obtained from FVH.

But I don't understand why you need FieldTermStack. Just using
Lucene's TermVector with offsets (and positions, if necessary) doesn't
solve your problem?
