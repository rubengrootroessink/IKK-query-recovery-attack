SpanScorer implementation has replaced QueryScorer at LUCENE-1685.
 From contrib/CHANGES.txt:

  * LUCENE-1685: The position aware SpanScorer has become the default scorer
     for Highlighting. The SpanScorer implementation has replaced 
QueryScorer
     and the old term highlighting QueryScorer has been renamed to
     QueryTermScorer.
