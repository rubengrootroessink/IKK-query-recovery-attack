Yonik,

Thank you for your explanation.
In passing, I realized this issue by my customer. They are using Solr.
To reproduce the issue with Solr, post exampledocs/*.xml twice
and issue a query with q=ipod&debugQuery=on.

I understand. But I think we could well come accross this issue
with Lucene 2.1 than 2.0?

Thank you again,

Koji
