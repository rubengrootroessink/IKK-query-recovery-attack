SUBJECT: ConstantScoreRangeQuery and ConstantScoreQuery
DATE: 17 Mar 2006

Hello,

At Doug's hand on recent thread "Re: TooManyClauses exception in Lucene
(1.4)",
I could understand why ConstantScoreRangeQuery was added in Lucene 1.9.
I appreciate that.

And I read the following issue again:

ConstantScoreRangeQuery - fixes "too many clauses" exception
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-383

But still, I cannot understand very well why ConstantScoreQuery comes out.
Is it for to implement ConstantScoreRangeQuery? Or, is it used for something
by itself?

Thank you very much in advance,

Koji
