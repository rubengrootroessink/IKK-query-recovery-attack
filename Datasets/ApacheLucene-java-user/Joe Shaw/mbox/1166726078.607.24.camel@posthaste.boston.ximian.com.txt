You might be able to do this more efficiently with the posix_fadvise()
function.  C pseudocode:

        int fd = open ("/path/to/index/foo.cfs");
        
        // indicate you'll be reading the file sequentially
        posix_fadvise (fd, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL);
        
        // tell the kernel you will need the whole file.
        posix_fadvice (fd, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED);

I don't know offhand if Java binds these APIs, though.
