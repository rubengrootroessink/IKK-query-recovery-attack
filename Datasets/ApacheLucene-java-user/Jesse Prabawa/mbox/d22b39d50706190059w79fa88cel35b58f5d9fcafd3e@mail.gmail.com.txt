SUBJECT: Position of matches to affect scoring
DATE: 19 Jun 2007

Hi,

The Lucene FAQ at http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ mentions that
the position of the matches in the text does not affect scoring. So is there
anyway that I can make the position of the matches affect scoring? For
example, I want matches that occur at the beginning to weigh more than those
that occur elsewhere in the text. I have just started using Lucene so any
help/advice is greatly appreciated :)

Thanks,

Jes
