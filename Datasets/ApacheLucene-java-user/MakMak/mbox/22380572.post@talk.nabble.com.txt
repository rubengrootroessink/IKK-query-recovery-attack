DATE: 6 Mar 2009


Hey Mike, thanks for the quick response, I tried passing Directory to
IndexReader.open() and there were no deadlocks!! I will get rid of
synchronizing on FSDirectory too. 

However do you think it will be better to modify the docs for FSDirectory
and remove the sync part of "Directories are cached, so that, for a given
canonical path, the same FSDirectory instance will always be returned by
getDirectory. This permits synchronization on directories." Sounds
misleading.

Lastly, can you please very briefly explain why passing a Directory worked?

-thanks
