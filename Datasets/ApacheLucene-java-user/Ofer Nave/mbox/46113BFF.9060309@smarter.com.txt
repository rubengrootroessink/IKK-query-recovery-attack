I'd like to be able to boost documents at search-time, and I'm not sure 
how to do it.

Example:

I'm building a search engine for products (comparison shopping).  Many 
queries tend to indicate a category (i.e., 'digital cameras') as opposed 
to a product (i.e., 'canon powershot').  I have the name of the category 
the product is in indexed in a separate field.  My intention was to 
query both the title field and the category field, and when the category 
field relevancy is extremely high, boost the documents in that category.

Is there a way to do this?  Or an alternative approach to the problem?
