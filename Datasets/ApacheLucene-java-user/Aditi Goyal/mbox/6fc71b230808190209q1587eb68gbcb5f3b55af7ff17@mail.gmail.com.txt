SUBJECT: java.lang.NullPointerExcpetion while indexing on linux
DATE: 19 Aug 2008

Hi All,

I am using IndexWriter for adding the documents. I am re-using the document
as well as the fields for improving index speed as per the link
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveIndexingSpeed.

So, for each doc, i am first removing field using doc.removeField() and then
field.setValue() for changing the value of the field and finally
doc.add(field) for adding the field to the document.

It works fine on windows, however it throws  (<class 'lucene.JavaError'>,
JavaError(<Throwable: java.lang.NullPointerException>,) when I run
indexwriter.addDocument(doc) on Linux.

Can anyone please guide why is it happening this way.
I am using lucene 2.3.1 version and JCC version is 1.8 and Python is 2.5

Thanks,
Aditi
