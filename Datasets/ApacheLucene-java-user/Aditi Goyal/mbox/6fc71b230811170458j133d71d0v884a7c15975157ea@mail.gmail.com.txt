SUBJECT: Searching across multiple fields
DATE: 17 Nov 2008

Hi,

Lets say I have an index with the following fields:
field1, field2, field3 and field4 where all the fields can have same values.

Now I want to search a document where "basket" and "apple" are part of the
whole document but "orange" is not.

I have tried using MultiFieldQueryParser but it is not showing correct
results.

I typed the command ("basket" AND "apple") NOT "orange" for the
MultiFieldQueryParser

query = lucene.MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(command, fields, shoulds,
analyzer )
hits = self.searcher.search(query)


Am I doing something wrong? Please help.

Thanks,
Aditi
