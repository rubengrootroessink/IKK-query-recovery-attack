SUBJECT: Document larger than setRAMBufferSizeMB()
DATE: 3 Oct 2008

Hi Everyone,

I have an index which I am opening at one time only. I keep adding the
documents to it until I reach a limit of 500.
After this, I close the index and open it again. (This is done in order to
save time taken by opening and closing the index)
Also, I have set setRAMBufferSizeMB to 16MB.

If the document size itself is greater than 16MB what will happen in this
case??
It is throwing
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
Now, my query is,
Can we change something in the way we parse/index to make it more memory
friendly so that it doesnt throw this exception.
And, Can it be caught and overcome gracefully?


Thanks a lot
Aditi
