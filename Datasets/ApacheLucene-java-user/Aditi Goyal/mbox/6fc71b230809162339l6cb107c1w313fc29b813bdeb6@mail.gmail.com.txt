SUBJECT: jre installing problem in ubuntu
DATE: 17 Sep 2008

Hi All,

I'm running Ubuntu Linux 8.04, which has the sun jre installed in the system
area (/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.06/jre/lib/).

I've manually installed an updated JRE (jre1.6.0_07) into /usr/local area
(/usr/local/lib/jre1.6.0_07/lib/), and my PATH environment variable is
updated to use the new jre.

A "java - version" confirms it:

java version "1.6.0_07"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_07-b06)
Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 10.0-b23, mixed mode)

How can I tell pylucene to use the new JRE? I've tried something like this:

classpath = lucene.CLASSPATH + ':' + newclasspath (where newclasspath =
"/usr/local/lib/jre1.6.0_07/lib/i386:/usr/local/lib/jre1.6.0_07/lib/i386/server")
lucene.initVM(classpath)

There is no error, but the running program still seems to use the older jre.

Any ideas...?

Thanks.
Aditi
