Thanks Mike. I found the problem.
The problem was that I was not converting the value of the fields to utf-8
and hence while adding it to doc it was getting stored as None.
So, when I did doc.get('fieldA') , instead of giving the blank or any other
string, it was giving out None.

To overcome this, I first converted the string to utf-8 format and then
field.setValue() and then doc.add(field), It seems to be working fine.,


However, I have one question. When I do a feild.setValue() and then
doc.add() will it replace the value of the field in the doc or add a new
field with the similar name and the new value? Since i am reusing the doc
and i am not reinitialising the doc anywhere and since you told that
doc.removeField() is an expensive operation.

Thanks,
Aditi
