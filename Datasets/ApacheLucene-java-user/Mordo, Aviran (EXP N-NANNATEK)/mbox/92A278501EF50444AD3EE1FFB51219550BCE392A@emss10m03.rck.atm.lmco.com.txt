The StandardAnalyzer should work just fine with it, It will break the
search string to 5 search terms.

Hi Luceners

Apologies.....

I  have along Search String as given below...

 

SearchWord =  "\"" + "Dough Cutting" + "\"" +  "  " +  "Otis
Gospodnetic"  +  "   " + "\"" + "Erik Hatcher" + "\""  + "  " + 
                           "Authors of " + "\"" + "Lucene In Action"
+"\"";

And prior to searching the Index ,I need the Words to be Split.

SearchWord   = 

   1)   "\"" + "Dough Cutting" + "\""  
   2)   "Otis Gospodnetic"
   3)  "\"" + "Erik Hatcher" + "\""  
   4)  "Authors of "
   5) "\"" +"Lucene In Action" +"\""

I am shure some Analyzer within Lucene is performin the task.
So some body please Tell me Howto 

[ I already used Analysis/Paralysis code to check ,but no help ]

 


WITH WARM REGARDS 
HAVE A NICE DAY
