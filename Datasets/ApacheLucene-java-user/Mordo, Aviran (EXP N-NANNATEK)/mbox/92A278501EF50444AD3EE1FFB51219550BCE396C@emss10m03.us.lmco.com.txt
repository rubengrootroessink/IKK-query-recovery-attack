You can store the values as a coma separated string (which then you'll
need to parse manually back to a HashMap)

Subject: Storing HashMap as an UnIndexed Field

Hi,

   I'd like to store a HashMap for some extra data to be used when a
given document is retrieved as a Hit for a query.  To add an UnIndexed
Field to an index takes only Strings as parameters.  Does anyone have
any suggestions on how I might convert the HashMap to a String that is
efficiently recomposed into the desired HashMap on the other end?

Thanks,
Tricia
