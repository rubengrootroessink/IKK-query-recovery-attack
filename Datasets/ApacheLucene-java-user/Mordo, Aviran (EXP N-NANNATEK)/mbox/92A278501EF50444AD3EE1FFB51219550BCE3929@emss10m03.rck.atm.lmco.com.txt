You can try working with two indexes one for all of today's messages
which will be pretty small, and another for past messages. Then once a
day merge the small index to the big one and start fresh. This way you
need only to open an IndexReader for the small index while the big one
does not change.

Subject: Search shortly after adding a doc

i want to use lucene to search shortly (within a second) after adding a
document.
 closing a writer to ensure the new document is written and then opening
an index reader seems to be too slow on large indexes.

how do other people
handle this?  

(i know this can be solved with a database but i'd like to use the
tokenization/stemming features of lucene).
