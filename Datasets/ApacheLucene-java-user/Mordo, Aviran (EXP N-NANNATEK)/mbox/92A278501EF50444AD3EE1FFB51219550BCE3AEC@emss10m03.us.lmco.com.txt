SUBJECT: What is the largest index(s) size lucene can support
DATE: 29 Mar 2006

I know Lucene can have multiple indexes and have a parallel search
across indexes. The question I have is what is the largest number of
documents Lucene can support with multiple distributed indexes.

Or if to be more specific, can Lucene support BILLIONS of documents
(across multiple indexes), and search all of them at once using the
Parallel searcher?
