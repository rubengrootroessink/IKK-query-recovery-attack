Lucene only uses strings to store and search, you should convert any
objects to string.
For dates you have a special Date field that you should use which
converts dated to a searchable strings

Subject: date keyword

I use lucene to index a key word with date object. When I search
document, how could I process the searching result for that field? For
example:
index date with
Field field = Field.Keyword("created", new Date); .....
......
When I search that, I get that field back Field f =
doc.getField("created").
but value of that field is just like
0edtel52h
How could I process that to get Date object back?
Thanks a lot.
