When using sort there is no meaning for weight.

You can just assign the field B some weight when creating the index?

N documents that match a certain additional criteria get pushed to the
top of the sort?  For instance say you sort your query based on field A,

the result set which have field B = some criteria will appear at the
beginning of the resulting hits collection?
