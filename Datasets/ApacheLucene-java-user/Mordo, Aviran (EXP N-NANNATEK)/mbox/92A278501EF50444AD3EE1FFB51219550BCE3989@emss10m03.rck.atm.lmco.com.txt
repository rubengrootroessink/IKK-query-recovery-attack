The simple solution is to put each section in a separate field and query
the appropriate fields according to the user group.

The simple scenario is this:
 One large text document with three sections  Section A Section B
Section C  Three user groups:
 User Group X
User Group Y
User Group Z
 I want to provide security to the various sections of the document to
certain groups of users. For example, User Group X can only search on
Section A, and User Group Y can search on Section A and Section B.
 We have considered various scenarios such as partitioning the document
into separate fields or even having separate repositories, but we then
get hung up on search syntax.
 In searching the archives and reading the LIA book I see examples of
document-level security, but this almost seems to be a different
security problem. I'm not necessarily looking for the perfect solution,
but rather different approaches that we can look at.
