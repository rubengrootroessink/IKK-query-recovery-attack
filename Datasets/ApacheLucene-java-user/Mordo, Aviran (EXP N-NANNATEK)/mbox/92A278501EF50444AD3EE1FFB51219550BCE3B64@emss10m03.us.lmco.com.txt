What you are asking is not possible. The whole purpose of the analyzer
is to tokenize the fields, so if you want them to be tokenized don't use
the Keyword fields. If you want to use both tokenized and untokenized
just create another filed that will be tokenized.

Subject: How can I tell Lucene to also use analyzer for Keyword fields

Hi,
It seems anaylzers are never get called for UnTokenized fields(Seems no
luck either using PerFieldAnalyzer).

What should I do, If I would like to use analyzer for Untokenized
fields.
Lets say for Keyword or Unstored fields.

I basically would like to use lucene Sort functionality on UnTokenized
fields which needs some analyzation at indexing time.

Thanks in advance,
Regards,
Jelda
