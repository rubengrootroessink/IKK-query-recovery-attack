Well there isn't really much difference. If you have large amount of
data then I would suggest 2 indexes, but not then one index will work
too.

Hiya

Given that I have two high level business entities, catalog (containing
product information) and contract (containing filter criteria about
which products are available for sale and which are not), what is a
better approach?

1. To have two different indices and query them separately.
OR
2. Have only one physical index with two different types of document,
one for catalog and the other contract?

Thanks
Sid
