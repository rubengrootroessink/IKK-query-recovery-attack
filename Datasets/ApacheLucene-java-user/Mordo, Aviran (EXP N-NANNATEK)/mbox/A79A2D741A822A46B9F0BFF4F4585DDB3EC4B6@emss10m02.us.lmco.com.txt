1. Yes it is safe to search while optimizing and adding documents to an
index.

2. NO you can not add documents to an index while it is optimized. You
can only have one instance of IndexWriter working on an index

Is it save to search an index while its beeing optimized by another java
process?

Is it save to add documents to an index while its beeing optimized by
another java process?
