You'll need to do it manually and not with Lucene.

Just grab all the results from Lucene and process them yourself.

Subject: How can I use SortComparator in my case?

Hi,
I have a requirement to sort search results in a round robin.
Ex:sorting results by field "customer" 
suppose following customers are found (number of results in brackets)
and results are sorted by customer.
 
Amazon(10)
Dell(2)
EBay(4)
Yahoo(20)
 
but I want to sort them in the following way,
Amazon(1)
Dell(1)
EBay(1)
Yahoo(1)
 
Amazon(1)
Dell(1)
EBay(1)
Yahoo(1)
 
Amazon(1)
EBay(1)
Yahoo(1)
  
Amazon(1)
EBay(1)
Yahoo(1)
 
etc.. etc..
 
 
You think I can use somehow SortComparator here? 
any suggestions?
 
Thx,
Jelda
