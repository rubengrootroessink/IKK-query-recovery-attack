There where no problems for me. 
Do you use the same IndexReader for all your searchers ?

Subject: IndexSearcher in servlet containers

Has anyone got experience of using the IndexSearcher in a servlet? I'm
having caching problems when there's a lot of different concurrent users
with the current setup. Currently the setup is to create a IndexSearcher
per servlet doPost call and close it after. But with concurrent requests
- especially ones which are performing fairly complex ranked boolean
queries that take a few seconds are causing caching problems - sometimes
a completely different set of results will be returned or nothing at
all. Has anyone come across errors like these before or know best
practices for searching in concurrent servlets?

Thanks
