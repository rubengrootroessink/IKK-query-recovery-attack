After you delete / add documents, you need to get a new IndexReader instance to reflect the
changes.

Hi,

over again a question about updating!
I update my index by first deletion all the documents from index which are not anymore in
the document directories, then i delete all documents from index which have changed and at
last i add all documents to the index which are not in the index but in the document directories!!!
But i is like that... that all works very good!
But the problem is that it doesn't find all documents to add or delete by the first running!!!
For example i deleted 12 documents from the directory or i changed them. If i start the application
it delete only 7 from index.
If i start the application again it delete the other rest!!! But why?

Why doesn't do it by the first time!!!?

Thanks in forward!
Bye
