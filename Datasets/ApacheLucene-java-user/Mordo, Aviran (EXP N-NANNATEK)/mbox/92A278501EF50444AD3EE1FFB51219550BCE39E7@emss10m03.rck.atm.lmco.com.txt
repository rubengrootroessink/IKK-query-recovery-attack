You can use your own Analyzer to support special characters. Just
process the special characters in your analyzer

Subject: Searching Special Characters

Hi

Our index contains articles with special characters. For instance, the
string P&O is indexed as P&#38;O. The correct entity codes are indexed
for all the special characters we use.

My question is that a typical user searching for the above will enter
P&O but that will not match P&#38;O.

I know I could replace & for &#38; but this did not work either and I
don't think it's the best solution even if it did.

The search String looked like
+(headline:&#38;)

I would like to extend any functionality to all special chars, for
example to single quote (&#8217;)

They're indexed using StandardAnalyzer

Any advice?

Cheers
