The index is available for search even during optimization, you should not have any problem
with that.

Subject: IndexWriter.optimize() need to much time.

Hello,

my problem is that IndexWriter.optimize() take 20 minutes. OK it is not a lot of time, but
I can't allow me to block the system such a long time :-(.
I don't know when I can take the time for optimize().

Has someone allready find a workarround for this problem ?
Is it possible to make a sleep in the 'optimize() while' so that the index is avaible for
another Thread ? Would it be usefull ?

thanks
    Éric.
