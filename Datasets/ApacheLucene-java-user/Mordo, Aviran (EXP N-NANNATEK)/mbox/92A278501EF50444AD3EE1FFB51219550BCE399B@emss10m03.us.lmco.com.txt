You might want to check your analyzer, it might trims or ignore these
names.

Subject: Can't find record when I'm sure I should

I have a set of indexes containing business information (name, address,
phone, etc).  There are a couple particular companies that don't come up
when people search for them.  I've used our debugging app that allows
lucene queries to be executed directly, and I have confirmed this. 

I can find the company if I search for it in the debugging app either by
its unique ID or address, but when I search for it using query only on
its exact name, it doesn't show up.  

Any advice for how to debug this?

Thanks!
