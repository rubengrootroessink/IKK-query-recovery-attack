It is up to you. What ever you put in the document during indexing
you'll get back. If you'll add a field of just the document name you can
retrieve that, or just parse the file name from the path.

Is it possible to get Document Name, instead of its entire path?

Currently, i have something like this:
out.println (doc.get ("path"));   // Which gives me /documents/file.txt

Is it possible to get  "file.txt"
