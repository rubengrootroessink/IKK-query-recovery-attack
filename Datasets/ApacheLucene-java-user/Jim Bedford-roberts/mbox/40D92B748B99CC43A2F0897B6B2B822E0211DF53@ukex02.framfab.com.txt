Thanks for your prompt response! You ask about the use case. We have a series of similar intranet
sites, each represented by a separate tomcat application instance using the same code base
but with different start-up parameters. The intranets all provide a common search function
based on the same underlying index.

Admittedly we could have developed a single central search component, but given the way the
code has evolved our current approach is simplest for us. With separate application instances
sharing access to the same index we are getting occasional COMMIT lock time outs even while
using singleton IndexSearchers in each application.

Here's a patch (I hope it gets through). Let me know if it's okay, I will 
commit it then.
