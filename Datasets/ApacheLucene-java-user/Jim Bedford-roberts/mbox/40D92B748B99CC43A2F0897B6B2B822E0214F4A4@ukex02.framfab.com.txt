Yes - this 1.4 bug is what induced us to upgrade to 1.9! So, finding the same problem in a
different guise in 1.9 is quite an unfortunate coincidence!

Have you already tried using Lucene 1.9 without my patch? Because there was 
another bug in 1.4 that made the default timeout not work. From the 
changelog:

7. Getting a lock file with Lock.obtain(long) was supposed to wait for
    a given amount of milliseconds, but this didn't work.
