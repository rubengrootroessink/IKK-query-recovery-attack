SUBJECT: Setting the COMMIT lock timeout.
DATE: 13 Mar 2006

I'm confused about how to set the COMMIT lock timeout since the version
1.9.1 release.

 

I note that this can't be set from system properties anymore
(CHANGES.txt, changes in run time behaviour 7), but am unable to find
the replacement setter method promised for IndexWriter.

 

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

 

Thanks

Jim
