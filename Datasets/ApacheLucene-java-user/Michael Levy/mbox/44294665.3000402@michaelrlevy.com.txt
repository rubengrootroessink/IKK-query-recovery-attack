I'm looking for advice on selecting a search application.  I'm 
responsible for developing a new search platform for use in a historical 
research organization and museum.  I've pretty much decided on Lucene as 
the library for custom servlet apps that would use the Lucene API directly.

At the same time, we have a number of application ideas that could 
probably use a flexible/customizable off-the-shelf crawling 
application.  For starters, it would be pretty basic stuff like indexing 
PDF files using some library, returning links that have been translated 
to point to a Tomcat virtual directory containing the files.  But our 
apps could quickly get more complex as we think of new search ideas.

I'm having a hard time comparing and contrasting Nutch, Solr, and 
Red-piranha.  I would appreciate anyone offering your ideas or 
experiences about which of these (or any other comprehensive search 
solutions) are good for which types of applications.  TIA!
