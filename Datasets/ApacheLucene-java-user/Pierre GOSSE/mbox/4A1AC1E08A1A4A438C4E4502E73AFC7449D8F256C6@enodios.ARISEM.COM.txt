I've just read about payload, and I'm not sure it would be easy to use that feature in calculating
distances for SpanQueries. I guess You would have to build your own SpanQuery, using payload
instead of term position. But it would be much lighter for index size if it were possible,
indeed.

I hope some lucene expert can give his insight about all this. :)

Hi Pierre,

many thanks for your idear.
I had a look to Payloads ... should it possible to store the line number as payload?

Best Regards,
Livia

>One way of doing this line slope would be to implement a custom tokenizer that could tokenize
on new line, and split each token into the words it contains. I.e. Each word of a line would
be seen as being at the same position (and having same offset and length as the complete line).

It works really good.
