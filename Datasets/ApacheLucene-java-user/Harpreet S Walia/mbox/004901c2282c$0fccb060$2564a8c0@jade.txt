Hi

I was going through the FAQ and found a mention of thread safety of lucene. From what i understand
lucene is not full thread safe . the FAQ is dated 2001 . has there been any improvements on
this since then . 

Is it safe to perform search and index operations on the same index simultaneously .

Please pardon me if this question has been asked before.

Thanks and Regards,

Harpreet
