SUBJECT: Replication of indexes
DATE: 14 Jul 2002

Hello Everybody, 

I have a requirement where i need to replicate the index files generated by lucene to another
server at a remote location. 
What i have observed is that lucene keeps on changing file names for the index files  . does
it follow any speific pattern in doing this ?
Is anybody doing something like this ? 

>From what i understand it will be best if i optimize the index before i replicate it and
also make a local copy so that the index is not 
updated while it is being replicated. What other issues can be there if i try something like
this . 

TIA

Regards
Harpreet
