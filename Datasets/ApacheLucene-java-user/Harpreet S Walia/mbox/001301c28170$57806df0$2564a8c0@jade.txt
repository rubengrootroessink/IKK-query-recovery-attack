Thanks a lot Dave and Ype .

Dave , I tried the setBoost you had mantioned. what i found is that i have
to set the boost of the other fields to 1 in order to get proper results . i
am not sure why , but its working  :-).

Ype, the other option that u suggested is great . i guess this is a more
proper way of doing it . i also found some references to the same in the
mail archives.

Thanks once again.

Regards,
Harpreet
