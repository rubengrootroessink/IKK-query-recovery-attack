SUBJECT: How does simple analyser work
DATE: 11 Jun 2002

Hi,

Are there any resources available which explain how the simple analyser processes the data
given to it . 
what i want to know is that suppose i have a set of words , what exact rules are applied to
tokenize and index these words and how can i customize them. 

My requirement is that the words be broken only by spaces and not at any other character .
I understand that this can be done by writing  a parser in JAVACC . but is there any simpler
way of achieving this .

I would really appriciate the help .

Thanks and regards
Harpreet
