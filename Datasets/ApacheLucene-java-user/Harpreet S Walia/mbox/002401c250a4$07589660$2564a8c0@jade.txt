SUBJECT: Index Replication
DATE: 31 Aug 2002

Hi ,

I  have observed that the file names for lucene index files keep on changing
. I want to replicate these indexes to another server . is their a way by
which i can stop this or is there any specific format that these filenames
follow . I am working on windows , if that has something to do with it.

Thanks
Harpreet
