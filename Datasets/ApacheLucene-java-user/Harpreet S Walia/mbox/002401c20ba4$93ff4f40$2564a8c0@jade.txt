SUBJECT: Partial word search with unicode contents
DATE: 4 Jun 2002

Hi,

We are using lucene to index and search unicode(utf-8) contents in
devnagari(hindi) language .

What we have observed is that our query fetches results which have partial
word match . i.e if it were english then a query "india" would relurn words
like
indian , southindia and so on.

Is there a way by which we can instruct lucene to only search complete words
and not word parts.

TIA

Regards
harpreet
