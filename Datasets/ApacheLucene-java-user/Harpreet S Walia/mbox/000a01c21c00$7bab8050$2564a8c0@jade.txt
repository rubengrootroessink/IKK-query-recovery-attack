SUBJECT: Updating Documents in the index
DATE: 25 Jun 2002

Hi,

My application needs to provide a feature for updating documents in the index. 
I am thinking of doing this by deleting the original document and indexing the updated one
again , I think this is possible using the delete methods in the IndexReader class . 

Is there some other better way to achieve this with lucene .

Thanks and Regards
Harpreet
