SUBJECT: Optimization Question
DATE: 2 Jan 2003

Hi,

I am using lucene on windows and have the following query abt optimization.

Is it safe to search if a optimize process is going on . i found a reference of this in the
archives which said that on unix it should not be a problem due to the way it handles files
. has anyone tried this on windows .

TIA

Regards , 
Harpreet
