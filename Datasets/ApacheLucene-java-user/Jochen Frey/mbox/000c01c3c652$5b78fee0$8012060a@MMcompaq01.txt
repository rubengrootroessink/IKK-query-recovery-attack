Stephane,

	The actual indexing is actually less glamorous than it sounds. When
you index 1TB across 10 machines you end up with 100GB on each machine. We
do not merge the indexes either, since we get better speed on indexing as
well as querying when we keep indexes smaller and distributed across
different machines. (But somehow I think that I'll sit down and merge all of
them together and play with it when I get a chance ... 'cause it's cool :-)
I'll keep you posted when it happens).
 
	My test set that I am playing with is 40GB, and I just posted a
benchmark.
 
	Best,
		Jochen
