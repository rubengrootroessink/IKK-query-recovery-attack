None of those solutions that I know about (other than re-parsing) work for
us (for us the highlighting must be confided to exactly one sentence), and
even though we are desperate to have something smarter, we would not want to
lose the benefits of super small and fast indexes.

We have pondered (but don't have the time, currently) to develop a package
that would store token locations (outside of the Lucene core) and hack
Lucene to get token-ids.

Sorry, no real solutions here; I guess this post is a +1 for keeping indexes
small and fast, and a +1 for this being a real problem without a perfect
solution (yet).
