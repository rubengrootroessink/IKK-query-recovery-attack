Anson,

	One way of doing it is having subsets of your indexes / data on
different machines. Each machine indexes its own data. You implement a
system that distributes queries to the various machines and merges the
results back.

	The working well completely depends on your implementation of the
distributed search.

	I believe there was a discussion about implementing this using a
MultiSearcher somewhere as well.

	Cheers!
		Jochen

Further on this topic - has anyone tried implementing a distributed
search with Lucene?  How does it work and does it work well?

Hi All,

I'm Hamish Carpenter who contributed the benchmarks with the comment
about the IndexSearcherCache.  Using this solved our issues with too
many files open under linux.

The original IndexSearcherCache email is here:

See here for a copy of the above message and a download link:
