Terry,

With regular queries (non-Span-queries) you cannot request that results of
OR / AND / NOT operations are near to one another (i.e. (A or B) near (C or
D)). The span queries solve that problem by allowing any span query to be
used in a SpanNearQuery (and vice versa). There are other applications for
this as well, but this is one of them.

Hope that helps to get you started. Examples for the use can be found in the
unit tests (TestBasics.java, I believe).

Cheers,
Jochen

Otis,

Can you give me/us a rough idea of what these are supposed to do?  It's hard
to extrapolate the terse unit test code into much of a general notion.  I
searched the archives with little success.

Regards,

Terry
