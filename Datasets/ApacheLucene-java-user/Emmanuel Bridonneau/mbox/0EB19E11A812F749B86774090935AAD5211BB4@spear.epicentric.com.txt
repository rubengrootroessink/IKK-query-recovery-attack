What about trying to export the content of your database (the fields you're
interested in) into flat files? You then feed your indexer with your
FileInputStream using the pattern you describe below and recreate your
search and see if result differs.

I came across a tutorial which had some details on the static factory Field
methods.  But none of the factory methods return a Field object with the
following settings:
Store => false
Index => true
Tokenize => false

I'm beginning to think this is a bug - that this combination is handled
correctly.
