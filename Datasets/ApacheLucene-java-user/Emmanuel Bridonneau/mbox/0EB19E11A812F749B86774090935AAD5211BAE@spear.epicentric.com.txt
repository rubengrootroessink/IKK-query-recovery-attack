SUBJECT: Lucene indexer vs. DB index
DATE: 20 Nov 2001

Can anyone tell me the advantages of Lucene indexer for indexing data
located in a database or LDAP server over creating another index in the
database or from an LDAP console?
There got to be some for indexing database records but I can't see them?
Any light out there?
