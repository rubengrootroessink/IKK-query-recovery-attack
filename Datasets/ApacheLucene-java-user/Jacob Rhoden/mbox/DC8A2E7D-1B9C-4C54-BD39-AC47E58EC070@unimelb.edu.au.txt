SUBJECT: Re: Lucene as a primary datastore
DATE: 20 Jan 2010

In the same way that you should take regular exports/dumps of your mysql databases, you could
have the same strategy with lucene.

As long as you have code that can export your data that runs daily, and code that can rebuild
your index from that data, In the event of a problem the most you will loose is up to 24 hours
of data yes?

The whole concept of using lucene as the data store has also been on my mind, simply because
I have some systems where the lucene index is simply a copy of all of the mysql data, makes
me wonder why I even bother with the mysql part (:
