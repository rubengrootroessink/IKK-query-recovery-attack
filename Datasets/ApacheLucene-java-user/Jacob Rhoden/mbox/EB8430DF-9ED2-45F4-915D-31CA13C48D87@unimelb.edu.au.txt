Apologies if this info is already somewhere, but google cant find it  
(: I am assuming the following code is completely thread safe:



// Called from a servlet when a user action results in the index  
needing to be updated
public static void rebuildIndex() {
	FSDirectory dir = new NIOFSDirectory(new  
File(Configuration.getAttachmentFolder()), null);
	IndexWriter w = new IndexWriter(dir, analyzer,  
IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.UNLIMITED);
	.... build index ...
	w.optimize();
	w.commit();
	w.close();
}

The following code is called from the search servlet:

// Called by the search servlet
public void search() {
	FSDirectory dir = new NIOFSDirectory(new  
File(Configuration.getAttachmentFolder()), null);
	IndexReader indexReader = IndexReader.open(dir,true);
	IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexReader);
	.... do the search ...
}

I am trying to work out the best/correct way to improve upon this:

1) Should the "FSDirectory dir" object be shared as some sort of  
static variable?
2) Should the "IndexSearcher searcher" or the "IndexReader  
indexReader" objects be stored as a static variable, and then simply  
replaced when the index is rebuilt?


Thanks,
Jacob
