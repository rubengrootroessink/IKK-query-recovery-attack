Hi Jake

Ok. The number of file handles left open is increasing rapidly. For 
instance, 4200 file handles were left open by Lucene 2.9.1 over a period 
of  16 min. You can see in the attached snapshot a picture from JPicus 
showing the file handles that are left open. These index files are  
deleted but the OS still holds references to them. Could it be that 
Lucene merge threads are not closing files correctly before they are 
deleted? More than likely, it is an error with our code, but where? Our 
LuceneIndex wrapper class is attached. If I set the max file OS count to 
a low figure, my application stops in its track, so this is definitely a 
critical issue that must be resolved.

Yes, but they do not. They just keep growing over time until the file 
handle count is exhausted.
I can see from the JPicus utility that although these
