SUBJECT: Lucene Search Performance
DATE: 26 Feb 2008

Hi

I am looking for a way to improve the search performance of my 
application. I've followed every suggestion in the Lucene Wiki but the 
search is still too slow with large indexes. I was wondering whether 
there was a way to restrict a search to a specific time period and in 
doing so sacrifice the quality of search results? Any other suggestions 
on how to improve search performance?

Much appreciate

Jamie
