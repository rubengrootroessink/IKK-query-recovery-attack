Hi Paul,

I just noticed the discussion around this.

All most all of my customers have/are experiencing the intermittant 
FileNotFound problem.

Our software uses Lucene 2.3.1. I have just upgraded to Lucene 2.3.2 in 
the hope that this was one of the bugs that was fixed.

I would be very interested in a resolution or known workaround.

Thanks!

Jamie
