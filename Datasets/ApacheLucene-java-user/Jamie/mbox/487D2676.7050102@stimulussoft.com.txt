SUBJECT: Lucene & XFile interface
DATE: 15 Jul 2008

Hi there

I am trying to use YANFS (see https://yanfs.dev.java.net/) to allow 
administrators to configure Lucene index that is accessible via NFS on a 
remote drive. Is there a way to easily modify lucene such that when it 
reads / writes from the Index it uses the XFile  object instead of File? 
In this way, there is a lot more flexibility on where the index can be 
stored (without having to rely on operating system mount points). Is it 
correct to subclass org.apache.lucene.store.Directory for this purpose? 
Are there any other considerations that one should bear in mind?

Thanks in advance

Jamie
