Hi There

We are trying to search for the exact word "Lowe's" across a large set 
of indexed data. Our results include everything with "low" in it. Thus, 
we are receiving a much larger data set that we expected. The data is 
indexing using the analyzer:
            TokenStream result = new StandardTokenizer(reader);
            result = new StandardFilter(result);
            result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);
            result = new StopFilter(result, stopTable);
            result = new PorterStemFilter(result);
            return result;

Thanks

Jamie
