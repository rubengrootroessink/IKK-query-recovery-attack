Hi Everyone

I have two queries:

Query 1
======

(attachments:"beauty supply") AND sentdate:[d20081117010000 TO 
d20090117235900]

Query 2
======

(priority:beauty attach:beauty score:beauty size:beauty sentdate:beauty 
archivedate:beauty receiveddate:beauty from:beauty to:beauty 
subject:beauty cc:beauty bcc:beauty deliveredto:beauty flag:beauty 
sensitivity:beauty sender:beauty recipient:beauty body:beauty 
attachments:beauty attachname:beauty AND priority:supply attach:supply 
score:supply size:supply sentdate:supply archivedate:supply 
receiveddate:supply from:supply to:supply subject:supply cc:supply 
bcc:supply deliveredto:supply flag:supply sensitivity:supply 
sender:supply recipient:supply body:supply attachments:supply 
attachname:supply) AND sentdate:[d20081117010000 TO d20090117235900]

Query 1 returns 138 results, while Query 2 return 0 result. Any idea 
why? The second query is meant to offer the search across all fields, 
whereas the first query specifies one field. Is there a better way to 
conduct a search across all fields? Am I missing something?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Regards,

Jamie
