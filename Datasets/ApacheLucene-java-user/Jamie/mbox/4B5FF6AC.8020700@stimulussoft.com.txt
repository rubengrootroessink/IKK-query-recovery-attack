Of course, the call exists, its just that during testing we did not 
execute any searches at all.

Nope. I previously used to open and close the reader on each search. 
When I noticed the getReader() functionality
was available, I jumped at it. It immediately offered significant 
performance increases...

We are now attempting to analyze Lucene using JPicus to try and get a 
picture of what is happening here.
