Hi Michael & Others

Ok. I've gathered some more statistics from a different machine for your 
analysis.
(I had to switch machines because the original one was in production and 
my tests were interfering).

Here are the statistics from the new machine:

Total Documents: 1.2 million
Results Returned:  900k
Store Size 238G (size of original documents)
Index Size 1.2G (lucene index size)
Index / Store Ratio 0.5%

The search query is as follows:

archivedate:[d20071229010000 TO d20080228235900]

As you can see, I am using a range query to search between specific dates.
Question: should this query be moved to a filter rather? I did not do 
this as I needed to have the option to sort on date.

There are no other specific filters applied and in this example sorting 
is turned off.

On this particular machine the search time varies between 2.64 seconds 
and about 5 seconds.

The limitations of this machine are that it does uses a normal IDE drive 
to house the index, not a SATA drive

I would appreciate your recommendations.

Hi Michael,
I guess the hotspot of lucene is
org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search()

Hi Jamie,
What's the original text size of a million emails?
I estimate the size of an email is around 100k, is this true?
When you doing search, what kind keywords did you input, words or short
sentence?
How many results return?
Did you use filter to shrink the results size?

  So you're saying searches are taking 10 seconds on a 5G index? If so that
seems ungodly slow.
If you're on *nix, have you watched your iostat statistics? Maybe
something
is hammering your hds.
Something seems amiss.

What lucene methods were pointed to as hotspots by YourKit?
