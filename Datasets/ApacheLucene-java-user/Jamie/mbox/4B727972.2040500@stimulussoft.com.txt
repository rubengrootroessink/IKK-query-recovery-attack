SUBJECT: Contrib Lucene Analyzers & Stemming
DATE: 10 Feb 2010

Hi There

We are having problems with some of the Lucene analyzers in the 
contributions package. For instance, it appears that the Russian 
analyzer supports stemming, although, when we test it it does not. Is 
there a specific switch that we must enable to enable the stemming of 
words? When we using Lucene 2.9.1, stemming appeared to work and after 
having upgraded to Lucene 3.0, it does not.

Thanks in advance

Jamie
