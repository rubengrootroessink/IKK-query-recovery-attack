SUBJECT: Indexing in multi-threaded environment
DATE: 3 May 2005

Hi,
I am starting my application in multi-threaded environment,
could somebody show me any examples with serialize calls to the
IndexWriter.addDocument(Document)?

because my idea is to use RAMDirectory based in parallel, one in each
thread, and merges them into a single index on the disk using
IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[]) method, It is working with a single
process but I have problems with my threads implementation.
Or any ideas about this.

Best regards.
Sodel.
