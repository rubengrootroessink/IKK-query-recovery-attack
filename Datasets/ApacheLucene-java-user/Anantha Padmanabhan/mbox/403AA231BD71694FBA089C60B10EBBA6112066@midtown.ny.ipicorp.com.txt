Hi Ramon,
 
It worked.  Thanks for the help.  Oh, one more:  I want to run the demo against a set of txt
files on a different directory.  Would the index files be created under lucene_home/index
or would it create a new directory /index in the same directory where the txt files are located?
 
Anyhow, thanks for the help.....
 
Anantha

Hi Anantha,

Put it on your jre\lib\ext folder. That's what I did when I got the same
problem.

In my case, the Lucene jars are on my C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0\lib\ext
folder.

Let me know if that works.

Thanks,
Ramon

Hi,

Trying to run the demo, I get: Exception in thread "main"
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError": org/apache/lucene/demo/IndexFiles.  I have
both the .jar files in my classpath.  Appreciate help.

Anantha
