No, the query should match all of them.
The query:
  NAME:De Agos* AND FIRST:Maria
should return 2 documents:
  NAME: De agostino
  FIRST: Maria

  NAME: De agostato
  FIRST: Maria

Do I need synonym for that?

> In your case, storing NAME as UN_TOKENIZED should enable your

The query:
   NOM:"Zullo"* AND PRENOM:"Andrea"* AND DATE_NAISSANCE:19630622
doesn't work:
   Cannot parse 'NOM:"De Zullo"* AND PRENOM:"Andrea"* AND 
DATE_NAISSANCE:19630622': '*' or '?' not allowed as first character in 
WildcardQuery

Any idea?
