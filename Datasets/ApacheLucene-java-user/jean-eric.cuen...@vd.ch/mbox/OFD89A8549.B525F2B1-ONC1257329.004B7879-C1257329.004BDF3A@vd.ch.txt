SUBJECT: Search query with wildcard and spaces
DATE: 31 Jul 2007

Hi,
I would like to make a search query that should match the following 
documents:

   NAME: De agostino
   FIRST: Maria

   NAME: De agostato
   FIRST: Maria

How to design the query? The following:
   NAME:De Agos* AND FIRST:Maria
Doesn't work since there is a space in the name. And:
   NAME:"De Agos"* AND FIRST:Maria
   NAME:"De Agos*" AND FIRST:Maria
doesn't work neither, since the double-quotes don't accept the wirldcard.

Thanks for help
