SUBJECT: Transform a sentences in Terms
DATE: 17 Jun 2004

Hi folks!

I needed something like this...
I have a sentence: "I love my dog".
Someone has a code that I can transform this sentence in Terms to add in a
PhraseQuery ?

PhraseQuery pq = new PhraseQuery();

while ( <sentence doesn't ended> )
   query.add(new Term("field", text));


Regards!
