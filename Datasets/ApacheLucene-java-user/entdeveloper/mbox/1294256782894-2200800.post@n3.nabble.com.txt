SUBJECT: CachingWrapperFilter vs FieldCacheTermsFilter
DATE: 5 Jan 2011


Could someone provide some general guidelines on what scenario is best to use
either the CachingWrapperFilter vs the FieldCacheTermsFilter?

I understand there are certain restrictions, like the FieldCacheTermsFilter
requires there to be a single-valued field for all documents in the index.
But performance-wise, and aside from that criteria, are there use-case
scenarios where it is better to use one over the other?
