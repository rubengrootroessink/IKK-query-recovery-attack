SUBJECT: Lucene with Simple Database
DATE: 19 Jul 2006

hi,
I have till now used lucene mainly for searching through text files. I
wanted to know if its sensible to use lucene with a database which does not
have fields with large text values.
for e.g. a table like

id       Name            Address
1        Name1          name1,strreet1,city1,country1
2        Name2          name2,strreet2,city2,country2
3        Name3          name3,strreet3,city3,country3
4        Name4          name4,strreet4,city4,country4

with abt a 10000 records like this.

Is it worth using and maintaining a lucene index instead of just creating
indices in the database on the fields to be searched for. Will using lucene
offer any significant performance benefit.
How much of a performance overhead will updating the index(each time the
database changes) would be.
All these fields need not be analyzed.

ANy help would be gr8.
