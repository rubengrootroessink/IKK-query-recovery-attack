SUBJECT: stuck with Encoded (possibly?) Database entries
DATE: 12 Jan 2009


I am quite new to lucene, but am trying to learn quite quickly because:
I am trying to convert a dictionary which has been stored in a lucene
database (several in fact) into Stardict format so that I can ultimately
import it into Dictionary.app in OS X
The dictionary in question has a java front-end which doesn't seem to get
past the startup screen.
Using the tool Luke to look into the databases, there is basically one
database with 88455 documents (which i think is the number of words in the
dictionary) and 936811 terms: this database has 3 populated fields - WORD,
ORDER, and docid
There are two other databases, one of which also has 88455 documents with
fields FILE and docid
My guess is that the docid corresponds between these databases, and the
contents of the FILE field is the definition.
the problem is that the contents of this field is just garbled text.
is there any obvious compression technique which might have been used to
store this? obviously, the dictionary entires would just have text (and I
believe some formatting, which might be in html)
the dictionary is spanish, so some of the custom java code has spanish
variable names, making it harder to see what's going on, but there are some
java files for crypto, although it looks like a premade java crypto package.
The text in the files looks like this:

Any help would be really appreciated - this is purchased software that ought
to work, but i have turned it into a project rather than sending it back.
