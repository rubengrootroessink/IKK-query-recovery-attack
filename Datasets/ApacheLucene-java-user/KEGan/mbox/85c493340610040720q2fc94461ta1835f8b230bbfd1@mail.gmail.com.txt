Erick, thanks for your reply.

I have the LIA. But the sorting is not the solution I am looking for. As if
I sort, I will lose out the relevancy from searches of other fields. I want
the number proximity to be one in many of the fields that is searched. So
the "num" field will contribute to the overall document score.
