Hi,

I have read that *Andrzej Bialecki *mentioned that he would release new
version of Luke based on Lucene 2.0.0 soon. URL here ...
http://www.mail-archive.com/java-user@lucene.apache.org/msg08612.html.
Anyone has any idea if it has been released ?

Andrzej, if you are reading this, could you please let us know :) Thanks.
