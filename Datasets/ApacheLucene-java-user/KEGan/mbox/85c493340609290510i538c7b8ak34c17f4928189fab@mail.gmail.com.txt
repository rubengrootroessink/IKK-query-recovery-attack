SUBJECT: Sort by date THEN by relevancy
DATE: 29 Sep 2006

Hi,

I have seen some sort examples in LIA. But cant find what I am looking for.
How do I sort document by date, AND for all the documents with the same date
... these are sorted by relavency. (Date has higher sort priority in this
case).

Thanks.
