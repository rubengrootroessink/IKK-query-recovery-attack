I think I am going to answer my own question.

Just use the

*Sort*<file:///D:/library/apache/lucene-2.0.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Sort.html#Sort(org.apache.lucene.search.SortField[])>
(SortField<file:///D:/library/apache/lucene-2.0.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/SortField.html>
[] fields)
*Sort*<file:///D:/library/apache/lucene-2.0.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Sort.html#Sort(java.lang.String[])>
(String <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html>
[] fields)

This should do it right ?
