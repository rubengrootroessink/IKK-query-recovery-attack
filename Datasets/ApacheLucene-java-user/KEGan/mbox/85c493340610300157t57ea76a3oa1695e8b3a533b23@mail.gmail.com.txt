SUBJECT: Indexing floating point number
DATE: 30 Oct 2006

Hi,

Newbie question. How do we index floating point number in Lucene, so that it
is sortable ? There is a built-in utility class 'NumberTools' which help
with indexing integer. Does Lucene has the same mechanism for floating point
number?

Thanks.
