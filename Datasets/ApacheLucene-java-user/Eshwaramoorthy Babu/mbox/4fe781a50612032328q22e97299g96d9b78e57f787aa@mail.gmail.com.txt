DATE: 4 Dec 2006

Hi ,

we have a requirement to compare 2 xml files and generate
result(reconcilation report).
The xml file size is 6MB each and the flrmat is as below
<Data>
<Id>123</Id>
<Amount>123</Amount>
</Data>


I have to implement the below logic

Number of matching ID'S in both xml
 Number of non matching ID'S in both xml
 Number of non matching ID'S in both xml

I am planning to use digester and lucene for my above requirement.

Is my desicion of using lucene  correct? or is there any bettwr approch for
my above problem.

Thanks,
Babu
