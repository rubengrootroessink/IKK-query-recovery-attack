SUBJECT: Multiple character wildcard search
DATE: 4 Dec 2006

Hi,



Can anyone please tell me how to specify multiple character wildcard
searches in "Term"

Below is my requirement



1) I want search all names that starts with Z (Z*)

2) My programme will receive list of names in JAVA collection (Vector or
ArrayList or Hashtable), I want to search for all the names which are not
there in the collection



I have tried the below code to implement the 1st problem but the search
returns 0 result



Analyzer analyzer = new WhitespaceAnalyzer();

boolean createFlag = true;

.......

.......

.......

IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexDir1);

Query query = new TermQuery(new Term("name", "Z*"));



When I execute teh above code the search is returning 0 Hits.

If I give the full name "Zane" the search returns 1 Hits.





Thanks in advance,

Babu
