SUBJECT: MapReduce usage with Lucene Indexing
DATE: 25 Jan 2008

Hi,
   I am very new to Lucene & Hadoop, and I have a project where I need to
use Lucene to index some input given either as a a huge collection of
Java objects or one huge java object. 
  I read about Hadoop's MapReduce utilities and I want to leverage that feature in my case
described above. 
 
Can some one please tell me how I can approach the problem described
above. Because all the Hadoop's MapReduce examples out there show only
File based input and don't explicitly deal with data coming in as a
huge Java object or so to speak.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Roger
