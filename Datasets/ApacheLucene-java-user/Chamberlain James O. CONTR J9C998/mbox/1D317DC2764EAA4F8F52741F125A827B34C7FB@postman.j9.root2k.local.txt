DATE: 18 Dec 2003

I have been struggling with the same issue. What I have done so far is
to create a singleton for each index and then synchronize all add and
remove calls. When the remove is called it checks to see if the index is
locked, if not it sets a Boolean to prevent an IndexWriter from being
opened. This seems to be working but I am still testing.

Isn't this easier said than done? In a web environment, you have hits
coming in and searching continuously. 

There are two issues:
1. Having new searches start using the new index only when it's ready,
not in a "half baked" state, which means that you have to synchronize
the switch from the old index to the new one. 2. It's not trivial to
figure out when it's safe to discard the old index; all existing
searches are done with it.

To make things more complicated, the Hits object is dependent on your
IndexSearcher object, so if you have Hits objects in use you probably
can't  close your IndexSearcher.

Is this a correct analysis or is there an obvious strategy to work
around this issue?
