Make sure you run "ant dist" so that everything gets built. There are  
demo source files that do basic things like index and search files.  
Add the lucene-demos jar to your classpath, (or specify on your  
command line) then run:

java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles   <directory containing your  
files to index>

I'd recommend the "Lucene In Action" book, I found it very helpful  
for getting started.
