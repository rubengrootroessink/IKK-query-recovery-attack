SUBJECT: fields that change over time
DATE: 14 Jun 2005

 From reading the docs, it appears that Lucene supports addition of  
new fields over time to an existing index. This is very handy for  
folks whose indexing requirements change over time. My question has  
to do with a change in an existing field name that goes from being  
unstored to stored. Obviously any previously indexed document will  
not have the stored value, but will Lucene handle a mix of unstored  
and stored values for a given field name, within the same index?

Thanks in advance,

Peter
