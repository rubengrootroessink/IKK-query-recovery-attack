SUBJECT: Problem building Lucene 2_4 with Ant/Eclipse
DATE: 8 Mar 2009

I get the problem below in trying to build Lucene 2_4.
I'm using Eclipse and just run Ant on the top build.xml.

It is pretty weird because the core is indeed build, but for some reason the
build stops there and I don't get any of the demos build etc...

Any idea what this "svnversion" program is ?
*

compile-core*:
*

jar-core*:

[*exec*] Execute failed: *java.io.IOException*: Cannot run program
"svnversion": CreateProcess error=2, can not find file

[*jar*] Building jar: D:\Bii\Workbench\lucene_2_4\build\lucene-core-2.4.jar
*

default*:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
