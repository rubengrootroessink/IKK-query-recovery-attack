SUBJECT: Why do range queries work on fields only ?
DATE: 3 Mar 2009

Hi all,


The range query only works on fields (using a string compare)... is there
any reason why it is not possible on the words of the document.

The following query  [stringa TO stringb] would just give the list of
documents which contains words between those two strings.
