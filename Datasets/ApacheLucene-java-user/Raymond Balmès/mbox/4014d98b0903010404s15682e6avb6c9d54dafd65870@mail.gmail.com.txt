SUBJECT: N-grams with numbers and Shinglefilters
DATE: 1 Mar 2009

Hi,

I'm trying to index (& search later) documents that contain tri-grams
however they have the following form:

<string> <2 digit> <2 digit>

Does the ShingleFilter work with numbers in the match ?

Another complication, in future features I'd like to add optional digits
like

[<1 digit>] <string> <2 digit> <2 digit>

I suppose the ShingleFilter won't do it ?
Any better advice ?

Any help appreciated.
