Hi guys,

Fairly new to Lucene, and just finished reading Lucene in Action.

My problem is the following I need to index the documents that only contains
the following pattern(s) in a mass of documents:

<tag> <#1> <#2>

<tag> is a fixed list of words
<#x> are small numbers <100

My idea is to simply build a TokenFilter that will look for those... do I
have it right ?

Some side questions:
what if I want to index <tag> <#1> <#2> as keywords ?
what if I also want to give full text search on the select documents ?

Thx for your help
