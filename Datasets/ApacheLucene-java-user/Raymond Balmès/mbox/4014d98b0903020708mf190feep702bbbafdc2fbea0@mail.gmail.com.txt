Well,

In the mean time I've looked at the details of the implementation and it
gave me an idea for what I'm looking for :

suppose I have a tri-gram, what I want to do is index the tri-gram "string
digit1 digit2" as one indexing phrase, and not index each token separately.

In the shingler filter, if I understood it correctly, tokens are separated
by '_' whilst n-grams are separated  by " ", that is the mechanism which I
was missing. And of course I need my logic around to filter valid tri-grams
but I don't need help for this, I can easily do that using regex for
instance.

My documents look like regular html or pdf pages although some of them
contains those specific tri-grams.

Thx,


-RB-
