Yes, I don't need a ShingleFilter I understand it by now.

Yes I will have many of these phrases in the documents... this is why I
thought I shouldn't use Lucene fields.

I will investigate further your keyword approach sounds like possible, thx

However I presume I may need to normalize the phrases for the search phase,
so it may not work.

Keep in touch,
