SUBJECT: Re: Why do range queries work on fields only ?
DATE: 4 Mar 2009

I'm in the design phase and not used lucene so far... that should come
pretty soon though.

The range query that I have been looking at in the API documentation and the
code, calls for a field name and subsequently search a field for range
(example of date searching)... and I did not see operators for the normal
term search that allow for this... but I'm new as you can see.
http://www.jdocs.com/lucene/2.0.0/org/apache/lucene/search/RangeFilter.html

Thx,

-Raymond-
