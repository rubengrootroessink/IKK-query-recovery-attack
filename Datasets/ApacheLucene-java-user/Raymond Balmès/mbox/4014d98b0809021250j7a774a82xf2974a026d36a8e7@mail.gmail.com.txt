OK, not clear enough.

I have documents in which I'm looking for 3 consecutive elements :
<string1> <#1> <#2> (string1 is a predefined list)

I want to disregard those without this sequence and reverse index those with
these markers... it looks to me that parsing won't do the job since my
documents are unstructured and do not have a specific grammar. The triplets
are to be found in the body of the document (if any)

At this moment I have the impression that I need to have a double pass on
the document stream :
1. pass 1 extract the triplets (with TokenFilter ???)  - if there are no
triplets disregard the document
2. pass 2 index the document stream with keywords for the found triplets and
text (standardanalyzer) for the actual body.

additionnal issue, I'm finding that the numbers might be in Roman
notation... any idea how tocheck if a token could be roman number or just
another random stream
