SUBJECT: Custom normalization in Similarity
DATE: 29 Aug 2007

Hello,

I'd like to know if there is a way to perform custom correction to the 
similarity norm before it is written
At best, we wished we could do this by extending the Similarity class, 
but encodeNorm, that would be the best place to do it, is a static 
method and thus it's no use to override it.

Is there a reason why this method is static? And is there any solution 
that could allow us to do this value correction?

Thanks for any help,
Emmanuel
