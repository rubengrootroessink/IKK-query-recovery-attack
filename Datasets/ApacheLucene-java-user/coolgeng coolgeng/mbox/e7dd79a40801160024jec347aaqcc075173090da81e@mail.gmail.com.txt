DATE: 16 Jan 2008

firstly, I submit the query like "select * from [tablename]". And in this
table, there are around  30th columns and  40,000 rows data. And I use the
standrandAnalyzer to generate the index. And as my experience, it cost 200M
disk to store the index.

for example, I will search the "Name" field in the index and it does work
perfectly. But when I create an index on the 100,000,000 data. It will cost
too much time to index creation. So is there some good solution to solve
this?
thanks
