SUBJECT: lucene scalability questions
DATE: 4 Jan 2007

So this question has two parts:

1. How does Lucene scale, exactly? Do we distribute the index to multiple
servers somehow? Or is it one index, sitting on some sort of a shared
filesystem, shared by all Lucene servers? If it's the latter, the bottleneck
will be I/O ... anyway, elaborate on scalability please, and how you set it
up

2. High availability. How would one go about making Lucene redundant?
