SUBJECT: Compiling analyzers from the Sandbox - where is comon-build.xml?
DATE: 21 Nov 2009

Hi,

probably a newbie question (both newbie with Lucene and I don't do 
something with Java very often):

I want to use org.apache.lucene.analysis.de.GermanAnalyzer.

I checked out the Lucene Sandbox from SVN and wanted to create a build 
now using

cd sandbox/contrib
ant -f contrib-build.xml

All build-files refer to common-build.xml, but his file seems to be gone 
since Lucene 2.3.

How can I compile the class mentioned above?

Thanks for any hint
Dorthe
