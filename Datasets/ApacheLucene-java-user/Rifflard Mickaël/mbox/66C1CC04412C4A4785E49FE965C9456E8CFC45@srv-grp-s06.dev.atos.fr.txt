SUBJECT: Real time indexing with RAMDirectory
DATE: 10 May 2005

Hi all,

Is it possible, with the RAMDirectory (or another Directory), to "flush" informations after
each Document indexing ?
I tried this but this "flush" appears to be able to be made after 2 indexing at best.

What do you think about it ? I forgot a configuration ?

Thanks,
 
	Mickaël
