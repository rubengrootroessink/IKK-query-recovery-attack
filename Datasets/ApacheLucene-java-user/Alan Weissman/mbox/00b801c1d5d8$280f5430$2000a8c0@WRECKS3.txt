SUBJECT: Lexical Error???  Help Please!
DATE: 27 Mar 2002

I just started having trouble with Lucene.  I'm getting this Lexical error
almost out of nowhere.  What does this mean?  All I can understand from it
is that there is an "*" that is causing a problem, but there are no "*"'s in
the text being searched!

Thanks,
Alan
