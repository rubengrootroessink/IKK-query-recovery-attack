SUBJECT: Re: Boolean AND query
DATE: 22 Feb 2002

Hi everyone,

As I understand, the current syntax makes AND and OR statements both OR
statements unless +/- are used, which greatly diminishes Lucene's usefulness
in my application, as I would imagine in others, where I am working with
non-savvy users who use '+' and '-' < 1% of the time, unless we were to
instruct them to do so which should not be necessary.

I recognize the usefulness of this feature in some applications for instance
web searches, where if an ANDed boolean query is submitted and both terms
don't match the user expects to see pages that match on at least one term.
However, this is not always the case.

Am I correct in understanding how the Boolean Queries work?  If so, what can
I implement to get around the necessity of +/- of terms?

Thanks,
Al
