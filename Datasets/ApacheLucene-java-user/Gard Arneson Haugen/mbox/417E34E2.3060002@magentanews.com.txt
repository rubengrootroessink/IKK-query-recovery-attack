SUBJECT: Large number of documents
DATE: 26 Oct 2004

Hi,

I have just started looking at Lucene and are not an experienced user of 
Java, but from what I've been reading this search tool should manage 
large amounts of documents.

I'm wondering if someone have any experience using Lucene on large 
amount of documents. I need to be able to index and search  through 
20-30 million documents of around 8kb. They are all simple text document 
with some attributes to restrict the search result on.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

Best regards,
Gard Arneson Haugen
