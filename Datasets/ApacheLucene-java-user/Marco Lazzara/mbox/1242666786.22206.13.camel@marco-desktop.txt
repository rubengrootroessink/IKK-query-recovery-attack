SUBJECT: Searching index problems with tomcat
DATE: 18 May 2009

Hi everybody,
I've a problem with my searching index.
I've created a stand alone application and it works perfectly.
I've put them on tomcat launching with java web start,but if I run the
query(the same query) I always obtain no results!!!Why??
Obviously My tomcat app is looking at the same index from my standalone
app.
I've tried to put the index everywhere but the result is always the
same.
Please help me!!!
Marco Lazzara
