SUBJECT: Appending * to each search term
DATE: 17 Mar 2006

Hello all,

I'd like to append an * (create a WildcardQuery) to each search term  
in a query, such that a query that is entered as e.g. "term1 AND  
term2" is modified (effectively) to "term1* AND term2*".
Parsing the search string is not very elegant (of course). I'm  
thinking that overriding QueryParser#get(Boolean etc.)Query is the  
way to go, the way it's designed. But still, extracting terms and  
injecting them back in while operating on specific Query classes does  
not seem the way to go.
Can anyone perhaps suggest a nice alternative?

Thanks very much and have a nice day,
    Florian
