Craig Walls wrote an excellent article in JDJ at the end of 2002 
regarding Lucene (not shown in any of the resources BTW). He documents 
using Lucene along side a database as well as provides two classes (and 
others unrelated) that extend the functionality of the StopAnalyzer to 
include numbers and or alpha numerics.
