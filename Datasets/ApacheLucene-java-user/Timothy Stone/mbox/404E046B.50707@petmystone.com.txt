SUBJECT: Search Bean contribution question
DATE: 9 Mar 2004

List,

I bit off more than I could chew for a noob to Struts and got lost 
trying to follow ACO's advice in the demo to apply MVC practices to 
Lucene. I have had some success with Struts now and I'm getting the hang 
of it in some other applications, converting one or two as well.

I found the SearchBean implementation in the sandbox. Can this be 
succesfully employed in a Struts application? For instance, applying MVC 
to the demo, an exercise I'm trying to under take.

Many thanks,
Tim
