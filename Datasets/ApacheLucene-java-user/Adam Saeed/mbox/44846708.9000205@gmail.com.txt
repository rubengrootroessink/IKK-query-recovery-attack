SUBJECT: lucene-web demo is not working?
DATE: 5 Jun 2006

I have not able to fix the below errors, for lucene-web demo.
installed tomcat-5.5, lucene-2.0.0 and jdk 1.4.
after enter search button error shows:
http status 500

org.apache.jasper.JasperException: Unable to compile class for JSP

An error occurred at line: 60 in the jsp file: /results.jsp
Generated servlet error:
The method parse(String) in the type QueryParser is not applicable for the arguments (String,
String, Analyzer)

I am not a java guy, i modified the QueryParser object at result.jsp, but not get the result.

Thanks
Adam
