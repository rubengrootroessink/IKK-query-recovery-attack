Hmm, the term vector does not have to consist of only term frequencies,
does it? To give weight to rare terms, could you create a term vector of
(TF*IDF) values for each term?  Then, a distance function would measure
how many terms two vectors have in common, giving weight to how many
rare terms two vectors have in common.

And I might add, thus, this approach to similarity gives more weight to

rare terms that match, which one might want for this kind of similarity

measure.
