SUBJECT: Re: Adding duplicate Fields to Documents
DATE: 26 Apr 2004

As two people have already stated, fields that are not tokenised are
stored seprately.  Then a single document with two fields of the same
name can be retrieved by searching for either of the fields.

However, retrieving all of the field values seems to be impossible. 
That is, given ("field_name", "keyword1") and ("field_name",
"keyword2"), using doc.get("field_name") always returns "keyword2", the
last value added.  Of course, I can't really think of a scenario where
this would be a problem..

Thanks for the help!

Luke is a good idea.  I'll also just write a simple test program and
play around with it (something I probably should have done before
posting) and then post my findings here.

You can look at your index with Luke, it might be insightful.
