I don't know if it will help, but take a look at the following email and
enclosing thread from a few weeks ago.

using lucene 1.3-final, it appears to only search the first field with
that name.  here's the code i'm using to construct the index, and I'm
using Luke to check that the index is created correctly.  Everything
looks fine, but my search returns empty.  do i have to use a special
query to work with multivalue fields?  is there a testcase in the source
that performs this kind of work that I could look at?

		//indexing
	      Document doc = new Document();

            Iterator values = myValues.iterator();
            while (values.hasNext()) {
                Object value = values.next();
                doc.add(Field.Keyword("test", value.toString()));
            }
		
		//searching
           BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
           Query fieldQuery = QueryParser.parse("searchValue", "test",
ANALYZER);
           query.add(fieldQuery, true, false);
