SUBJECT: Adding duplicate Fields to Documents
DATE: 22 Apr 2004

Hello,

I am wondering what happens when you add two Fields with same names to
a Document.  The API states that "if the fields are indexed, their text
is treated as though appended."  This much makes sense.  But what about
the following two cases:

- Adding two fields with same name that are indexed, not tokenized
(keywords)?  E.g. given ("field_name", "keyword1") and ("field_name",
"keyword2"), would the final keyword field be ("field_name",
"keyword1keyword2")?  Seems weird..

- Adding two fields with same name that are stored, but not indexed and
not tokenized (e.g. database keys)?  Are they appended (which would mess
up the database key when retrieved from the Hit)?

Thanks,
Gerard
