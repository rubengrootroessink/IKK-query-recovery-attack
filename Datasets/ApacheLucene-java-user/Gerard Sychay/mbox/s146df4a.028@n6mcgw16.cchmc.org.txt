Hi,

I've used the following Ant targets for build scripts that required
platform dependent work. In the example here, the property
"catalina.home" is set according to what platform we're running on. You
can adapt as needed.

  <target name="platform" description="Sets properties based on
platform">
    <condition property="isWin32">
      <os family="windows" />
    </condition>
    <condition property="isUnix">
      <os family="unix" />
    </condition>
  </target>

  <target name="win32" depends="platform" if="isWin32"
    description="Sets properties for Win32">
    <echo message="Looks like we're on Win32" />
    <property name="catalina.home" value="C:\Program Files\Apache
Group\Tomcat 5.0" />
  </target>

  <target name="unix" depends="platform" if="isUnix"
    description="Sets properties for Unix">
    <echo message="Looks like we're on Unix" />
    <property name="catalina.home" value="/usr/local/tomcat" />
  </target>

for the
O/s...

        [ Note :- The Path of Lucene_home,I/P and O/p directories are
also
O/s Specific should be in the Build.xml  and
                        should be trigged somthing   by this type


                             <condition property="isWindows">
                                  <os family="windows" />
                              </condition>

                                           or

                            <condition property="isUnix">
                                  <os family="unix" />

I'm not following what you want very clearly, but there is an <index>
task in Lucene's Sandbox.

Please post what you are trying, and I'd be happy to help once I see
the details.
