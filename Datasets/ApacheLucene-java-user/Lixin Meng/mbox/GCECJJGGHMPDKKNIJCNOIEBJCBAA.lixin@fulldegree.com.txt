SUBJECT: couldn't rename segments.new to segments
DATE: 17 Jun 2003

I have a program and try to index a large collection of XML files. After
about 9000 files (~2K each) , it will throw exception to complain that it
couldn't rename 'segments.new' to 'segments' or rename 'deletable.new' to
'deletable'. But the file 'segments.new' or 'deletable.new' has write
permission.

Has anybody come across this before? More information at the end of this
message.

Regards,
Lixin
