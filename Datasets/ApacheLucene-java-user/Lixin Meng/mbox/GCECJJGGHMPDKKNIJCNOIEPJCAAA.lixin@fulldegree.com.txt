Thanks for the tip. The analyzer does tokenize "SG-XRRH-C1M0-A" into 'SG'
and 'XRRH-C1M0-A'.

The approach that 'accept hyphenations when digits are included on one side
or the other' is indeed 'heuristic' :).

I might consider your suggestion on using keyword. However, in a more
general case, if one has a block of text with hyphenated words inside, the
work around with keyword doesn't apply.

Therefore, it would be preferable to treat all hyphen in the same way.
Either as a delimiter or as part of the word (maybe with a flag at the API).

Again, thanks for all the help.

Regards,
Lixin

You should look at the output of your analyzer.  Just write a simple
test program, something like:

   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
     System.out.println("Tokenizing " + args[0]);
     Analyzer analyzer = new MyAnalyzer(...);
     TokenStream ts = analyzer.tokenStream(new StringReader(args[0]));
     Token token;
     while ((token = ts.next()) != null) {
       System.out.println("Token: " + token.termText());
     }
   }

StandardAnalyzer will accept hyphenations when digits are included on
one side or the other.  This is a heuristic used to index things like
part numbers (which contain digits) as a single word but not index
things like "long-hyphenated-phrase" as a single word.  It may not be
appropriate for your application.

Also, a part number field might better be indexed as a keyword field...
