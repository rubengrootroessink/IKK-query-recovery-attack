SUBJECT: usage of prohibit operator '-'
DATE: 17 Apr 2003

I am having some problems with the probhibit operator '-'. If anyone can
shed some light on it, I certainly appreciate it.

In the index, I have a field with field name 'ID'. It tried query like:

	ID:(+ID10)
or
	ID:(+"ID10")

It will returns some hits.

However, if I try

	ID:(-ID10)
or
	ID:(-"ID10")

I got an empty result set, which should have some records.

Any idea how to use this prohibit operator?

Regards,
Lixin
