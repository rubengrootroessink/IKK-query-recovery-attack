Got it,

    I don´t have a clue if this corruption was caused by hardware failure,
but that is possible because we suffer with a lot of power failures from
time to time. But the thing is that I´ve been using lucene for a long time
and I never got this kind of exception.

    The thing is that I´d like to delete this document, but I get now
another exception:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Array
index out of range: 106577
   at org.apache.lucene.util.BitVector.set(BitVector.java:53)
   at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentReader.doDelete(SegmentReader.java:301)
   at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.deleteDocument(IndexReader.java
:674)
   at org.apache.lucene.index.MultiReader.doDelete(MultiReader.java:125)
   at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.deleteDocument(IndexReader.java
:674)
   at teste.DeleteError.main(DeleteError.java:9)

Is there a way of fixing my index without having to rebuild it all from the
ground? It takes lots of hours to re-index my whole collection.
