SUBJECT: Problems with QueryParser
DATE: 17 Jul 2006

Hi all,

IÂ´m using lucene 2.0.0 and I would like to generate a BooleanQuery from a
QueryParser. The problem is that when I parse a query like this: "(rafael
todor rossini)~2" the property of the BooleanQuery ,
minimumNumberShouldMatch is not setted properly. Is there a way of doing
that?

thanks in advance.
