SUBJECT: Indexing and searching database data
DATE: 10 Mar 2003

Hello,

Would anyone be interested in ability to use Lucene search on the data from
a database? 
I've written a small framework that allows to create Lucene index files out
of the database data, 
and then helps with the retrieval of that data (if needed) while searching. 
This way you can merge into one central index data from files, web pages and
database etc.

Greetings.

Tom S
