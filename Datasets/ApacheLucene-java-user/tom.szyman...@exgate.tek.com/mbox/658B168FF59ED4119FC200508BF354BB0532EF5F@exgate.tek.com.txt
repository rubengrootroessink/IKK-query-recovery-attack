A few people expressed interest, so I'd be glad to make it available to
anyone who wants it.
However, I'd rather not separately email the thing to each person.

What it the best way to distribute it from a central location, so anyone can
easily get it, and I can maintain it ?
(Lucene contributions page maybe

Subject: Indexing and searching database data


Hello,

Would anyone be interested in ability to use Lucene search on the data from
a database? 
I've written a small framework that allows to create Lucene index files out
of the database data, 
and then helps with the retrieval of that data (if needed) while searching. 
This way you can merge into one central index data from files, web pages and
database etc.

Greetings.

Tom S
