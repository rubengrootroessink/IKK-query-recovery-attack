SUBJECT: Re: stopword AND validword throws exception
DATE: 10 Nov 2004

Thanx for your replies guys.

Now, I was trying to locate the latest patch for this "problem group", and the last thread
I've
read about this is:
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25820
It ends with an open question from Morus:
"If you want me to change the patch, let me know. That no big deal."

Did you change the patch since then?

In other words: What is the latest development in this topic?
Can I simply download the latest compiled development version of lucene.jar and will it fix
my
problem?

The lastest builds I could find are these:
http://cvs.apache.org/builds/jakarta-lucene/nightly/2003-09-09/

It seems to be quite old, so please help me out!

Thanx,
Sanyi
