Ok, this might be true, but:

All of my other tests where the CPU is involved, are running a LOT faster on the desktop PC
with
the 3GHz P4.
Even other JAVA parts are running a LOT faster. (twice as fast nearly)
So, we can't even say that the JAVA VM takes no advantage of the 3GHz P4 compared to the 1.8GHz
Pentium-M.
Everything is a LOT faster, except searching with lucene. (which is also a bit faster, but
slightly)

It is a 3GByte index and I always reboot between tests, so cahcing is not the case.

Are you using reiserfs with SuSE?
