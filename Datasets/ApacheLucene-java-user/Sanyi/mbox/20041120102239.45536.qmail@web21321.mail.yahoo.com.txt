Well, since I had different experiences with different analyzers I've tried, I thougt that
this
problem must origin from either the indexing or a lucene bug.

Yes, this must be a problem for me, since I took this sentence from the manual as the starting
point:
"Returns the current Term in the enumeration. Initially invalid, valid after next() called
for the
first time."

So, it seems that it was a bug in the docs, not the api itself.

> Is that, what you miss or do you loose
> more than one term?

It seemed to me that it was skipping more stuff, but I'd better not say this, since I didn't
know
that the term is valid even before the first next(), so I could've been misleaded by my own
chaotic experiences.

Since my code was completly restructured since then, I don't have all the surrounging stuff
needed
for further testing.

Anyway, we've found a docs bug thanks to you and my code is cleaner and better the other way.

Thanx!
