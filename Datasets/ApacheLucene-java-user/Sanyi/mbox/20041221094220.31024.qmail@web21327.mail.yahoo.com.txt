SUBJECT: Re: Synonyms for AND/OR/NOT operators
DATE: 21 Dec 2004

Hi!

I think we're talking about different things.
My question is about using synonyms for AND/OR/NOT operators, not about synonyms of words
in the
index.
For example, in some language: AND = AANNDD; OR = OORR; NOT = NNOOTT

So, the user can enter:
(cat OR kitty) AND black AND tail

and either:

(cat OORR kitty) AANNDD black AANNDD tail

Both sets of operators must work.
It must be some kind of a query parser modification/parametering, so there is nothing to do
with
the index.

I hope I was more specific now ;)

Thanx,
Sanyi
