SUBJECT: Synonyms for AND/OR/NOT operators
DATE: 21 Dec 2004

Hi!

What is the simplest way to add synonyms for AND/OR/NOT operators?
I'd like to support two sets of operator words, so people can use either the original english
operators and my custom ones for our local language.

Thank you for your attention!
Sanyi
