SUBJECT: Storing info about the index in the index
DATE: 17 Feb 2005

Hi!

Is there any way to store info about the index in the index?
(You know, like in .doc files on Windows. You can store title, author, etc...)
I need to store the last indexed database UID in the index and maybe some other useful infos
too.
I don't want to store them separately in the database or in another file because of administrative
reasons.

Regards,
Sanyi
