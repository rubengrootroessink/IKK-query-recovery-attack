It is 3GBytes big and it will grow a lot.
I have to search from the HDD which is very fast compared to the notebook's HDD.

Average seek time:
Notebook: 8-9ms
Desktop: 3.9ms

Data read:
Notebook: max. ~20MBytes/sec
Desktop: 60-80MBytes/sec

So, if the bottleneck is the HDD, it has to be 2x-3x faster on the desktop system.
Except if reiserfs is a lot slower than NTFS.

Ok, but I have very simple and pure tests and everything is measured part-by-part.
..and every parts speeds up a lot on the desltop system, except the lucene search part.

I call my java program from command line on both systems, like:
search hello
Then it searches for bravo and collects the elapsed milliseconds between every call to anything.
Then it displays the results. It is very simple.

Thanx for the hint. Since my search searches for only 30 hits, it completes too fastly to
let me
monitor it real-time.
Anyway, if reiserfs will prove to be fast enough, I'll search for other reasons and will perform
longer tests for real-time monitoring.
