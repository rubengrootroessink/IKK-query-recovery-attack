SUBJECT: there are more terms than documents in field ...
DATE: 23 Feb 2005

Hi!

I'm indexing 99 documents, then I want to sort them by title, but Lucene throws:

there are more terms than documents in field "title"

I have no such problems with my other indices with a lot more documents.

How can I sort smaller indices by title?

Regards,
Sanyi
