Well, I read YYYY-MM-DD format string from a database.
So, I need to know how to convert YYYY-MM-DD to DateField.timeToString()'s result format.
Or I have to convert YYYY-MM-DD to file.lastModified()'s format which I can pass to
DateField.timeToString().
What is the easiest solution?

So, why do you recommend RangeFilter over DateFilter?
Does it require less index data or/and has it better performance?
(I'm using 1.4.2)

Simply saying:
I let the user to enter the search string on a HTML form, then I call my custom lucene-based
java
class through command line (the calling method may change to the PHP-to-JAVA bridge if it'll
be
perfect for my needs).
So, every search is a whole new round. New HTML FORM post -> new command line JVM call
-> new
index searcher, etc...

The OS is caching the index file pretty well (only the memory size is the limit of course).

Will my implementation's performance drop down a lot when I implement DateFilter?
