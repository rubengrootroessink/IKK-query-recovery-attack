Hi!

Can you please explain how did you implement the java and php part to let them communicate
through
this bridge?
The brige's project summary talks about "java "application-server" or a dedicated java process"
and I'm not into Java that much.
Currenty I'm using a self-written command-line search program and it outputs its results to
the
standard output.
I guess your solution must be better ;)

If the "communication parts" of your code aren't top secret, can you please share them with
me/us?

Regards,
Sanyi
