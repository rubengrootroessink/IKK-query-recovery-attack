Great news, thanx!

Well, can you post here a short example?
When I currently type "xxx.UnStored(.." I can simply type "xxx.DateField(.." ?
Does it take strings like "2004-11-05"?

I've read somewhere that classic range filtering can easily exceed the maximum number of boolean
query clauses. I need to filter a very large range of dates with day accuracy and I don't
want to
increase the max. clause count to very high values. So, I decided to use DateFilter which
has no
such problems AFAIK.

How much impact does DateFilter have on search times?
