I have 3GByte RAM and my index is 3GByte big currently. (it'll be soon about 4GByte)
So, I have to find out this another way.

I think that it a good general benchmark that almost everything runs at least twice as fast
on the
3.0GHz P4 except lucene search.

I can tell one more interesting info:
I have a MySQL table with ~20million records.
I throw a DROP INDEX on that table, MySQL rebuilds the whole huge table into a tempfile.
It completes in 30 minutes on both systems.
It doesn't matter again that the 15kRPM U320 HDD is 2x-3x as fast.
Very surprising again.
Hmm... reiserfs must be very-very slow, or I'm completly lost :)

I'll try this later and I really hope it won't be the reason.

Both drives have 8M cache.

Are you saying that SCSI command queuing wastes more time than a 15kRPM 3.9ms HDD can gain
over a
7.2kRPM 8-9ms HDD?
It sounds terrible and I hope it isn't true.

It is not a Xeon, just a P4 3.0GHz HT.

Lucene indexing completes in 13-15 hours on the desktop system while it completes in about
29-33
hours on the notebook.

Now, combine it with the DROP INDEX tests completing in the same amount of time on both and
find
out why is the search only slightly faster :)

I'm worried about searching. Indexing is a lot faster on the desktop config.
