SUBJECT: stopword AND validword throws exception
DATE: 10 Nov 2004

Hi!

I've left out custom stopwords from my index using the StopAnalyzer(customstopwords).
Now, when I try to searh the index the same way (StopAnalyzer(customstopwords)), it seems
to act
strange:

This query works as expected:
validword AND stopword
(throws out the stopword part and searches for validword)

This query seems to crash:
stopword AND validword
(java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1)

Maybe it can't handle the case if it had to remove the very first part of the query?!
Can anyone else test this for me? How can I overcome this problem?

(lucene-1.4-final.jar)

Thanks for your time!

Sanyi
