SUBJECT: QueryParser and Special Characters
DATE: 9 May 2005

The documentation tells us to escape special characters by using the \

Example:

\(1\+1\)

However if we put this in a string

String query = "\(1\+1\)";

Then the java compiler throws an Invalid Escape Sequence error.
QueryParser doesn't seem to recognize the double backslash.  Is there a
workaround for this?

Thanks,
Peter
