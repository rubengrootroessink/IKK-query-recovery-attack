Hello Aslam,

you should store the TermVector in the index as well:

doc.add(new Field("field name", "field value", Field.Store.YES, 
Field.Index.TOKENIZED, Field.TermVector.YES));

"A term vector is a list of the document's terms and their number of 
occurences in that document."

The IndexReader allows you to access the TermVector of a document:

TermFreqVector IndexReader.getTermFreqVector(int docNumber, String field)

I hope it helps.

Sören
