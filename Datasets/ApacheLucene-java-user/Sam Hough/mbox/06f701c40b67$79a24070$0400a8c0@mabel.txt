SUBJECT: order of Field objects within Document
DATE: 16 Mar 2004

Can anybody confirm that no guarantee is given that Fields retain
their order within a Document?

Version 1.3 seems to (although reversing the order
on occasion).

Doesnt seem likely but would be really useful for my current application ;)
Im just asking for clarification not a change of spec although a comment 
in the JavaDoc for Document making it explicit might be handy.

Thanks

Sam
