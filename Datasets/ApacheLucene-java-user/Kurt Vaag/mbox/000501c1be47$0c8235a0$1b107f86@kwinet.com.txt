Thanks Winton,

Thats what it was. I just assumed java would take all the 1G that
it needed. Didn't realize the default was 64M. Also thanks for not
saying RTFM (which I had done but didn't know what TF to do with the
-Xmx option).

java  -Xmx1000m  ....

Sorry if you already tried resizing your heap. Actually with 1.3.1
you could go up above a gig, but really swapping aint gonna help much.
