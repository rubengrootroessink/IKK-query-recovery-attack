SUBJECT: Build index using RAMDirectory "out of memory" errors
DATE: 25 Feb 2002

I have been using Lucene for 3 weeks and it rules.

The indexing process can be slow. So I searched the mailgroup archives
and found example code using RAMDirectory to improve indexing speed.
The example code I found was indexing 100,000 files at a time to the
RAMDirectory before writing to disk.

I tried indexing 10,000 files at a time to the RAMDirectory before writing
to disk. This drastically improved indexing times but sometimes I get
"out of memory" errors. I am indexing text files and adding 9 fields from
an Oracle database.

Environment:
Solaris 2.8 with 1G of ram and 2G of swap
Java 1.3.1
Lucene 1.2-rc4

Any ideas for eliminating the "out of memory" errors ?
