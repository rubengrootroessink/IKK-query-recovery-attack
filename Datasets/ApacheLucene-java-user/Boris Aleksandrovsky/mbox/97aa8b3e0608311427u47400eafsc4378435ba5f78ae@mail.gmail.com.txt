Jason,

You can look here:

http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/downloads.htm

for

Word frequency counts from a 1.5B word corpus (TREC disks 1-5 and the Reuters
corpus <http://about.reuters.com/researchandstandards/corpus/>). The words
are normalized as follows: ALL CAP words are prepended with a_ and
Capitalized words are prepended with c_ after downcasing. Digits are all
replaced with 0.

Cheers,
Boris
