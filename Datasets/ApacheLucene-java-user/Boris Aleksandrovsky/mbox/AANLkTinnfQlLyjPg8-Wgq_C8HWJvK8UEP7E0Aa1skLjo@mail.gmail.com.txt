Thanks, Sashi, I am asking more about a general library which will remove
those HTML element which are unwanted/useless for indexing. For instance, we
are using a general method to remove headers by comparing the structure of
HTML on the top-level document from the site (e.g. www.nytimes.com) and the
page being crawled (which happens to be further down in the hierarchy).
Generally the difference will be the header or the footer. Is there a
library out there which contains a collection of hacks like that?
