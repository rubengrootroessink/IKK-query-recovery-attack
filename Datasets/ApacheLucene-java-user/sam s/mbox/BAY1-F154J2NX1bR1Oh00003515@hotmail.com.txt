DATE: 21 Nov 2003

You are right, just for search it wont take much time. I have relatively 
small index.

Almost all documents change daily. So one way I am thinking of updating 
index is creating new index set in a temp directory by other process. When 
time comes to update index then renaming in-use dir to archive dir and 
renaming temp dir to in-use dir. I am not sure whether this is a good idea, 
what do you say?

I have overall 70000 docs with around 20 fields where 3 fields contain more 
text. I have indexed and tokenized 11 fields. Average size of data I put in 
a document is 2 kb.

Thanks
