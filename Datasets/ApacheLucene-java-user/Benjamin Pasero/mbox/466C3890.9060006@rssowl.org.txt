Sorry for not being clear what I am trying to achieve. I am storing
documents in my index that are made of 5 Fields. One of the Fields
contains keywords that describe the document. Now, I need a fast
way of retrieving these keywords together with their frequency from
the index.

My current solution is to use IndexReader#terms() to walk over all
terms and count the ones that appear in the keyword-Field.

As you can assume, this is not scaling well. The content in the keywords
field is usually quite small, however, the other fields may store
up to thousands of terms.

What I am asking for is a way to walk all the terms of just the 
keyword-field
in order to avoid having to walk all terms in all fields.

Of course, even better would be some API that would return a TermVector from
the keyword-field. But I guess TermVectors are only supported on a per
Document level and not index level?

Ben
