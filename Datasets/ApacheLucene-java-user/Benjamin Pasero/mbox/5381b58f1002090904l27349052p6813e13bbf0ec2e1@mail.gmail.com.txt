SUBJECT: Creating a Query that matches Documents without a specific Field set?
DATE: 9 Feb 2010

Hi,

is there any way I can search for Documents that have a specific Field not set?

The use case is obvious: Consider you introduce a new field to your
documents but dont want to migrate all other documents,
how would you be able to write a Query that covers both old and new documents?

I was hoping that a simple TermQuery where the term value was set to
be an empty String would help me out but I was prooven
wrong.

Thanks for helping,
Ben
