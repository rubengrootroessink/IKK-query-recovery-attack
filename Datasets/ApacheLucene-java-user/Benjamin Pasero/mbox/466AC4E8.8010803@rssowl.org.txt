SUBJECT: Retrieving TermVectors from a Field over the full index?
DATE: 9 Jun 2007

Hi,

I wonder if this is possible:

Return all Terms of a Field in the Index together with the number of
occurances
in all documents.

E.g. have 10 Documents with the Field "author" in the index, 5 of them
having
the value "foo" and 5 "bar" I would like to build a map with:

[foo] -> 5
[bar] -> 5

I looked at what Luke is doing to show the top terms of a given field in the
index and it seems to iterate over all terms (using
IndexReader#terms()). Isnt
that quite un-efficient? I would at least expect a method
IndexReader#terms(String field)
to limit the terms on the desired field.

Thanks for helping,
Ben
