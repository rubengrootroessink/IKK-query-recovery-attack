SUBJECT: Standalone Lucene server
DATE: 31 May 2002

I'm thinking of using Lucene as a general purpose tool in my toolbox,
and therefore use it in non-java-only-environments.

For instance, I would like to use the search capabilities in one of my
clients NT4/IIS/ASP-environments.

Since Lucene is essentially a java-library today, I'm wondering if
anyone have wrapped it up as standalone search engine with some neat
interface (keywords: TCP, HTTP, XML-RPC, SOAP, whatever really...)? 

Otherwise I suppose it could be an idea to create this sort of
container.
