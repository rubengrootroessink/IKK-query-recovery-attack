Yet another burning question :-).  Can someone explain how the document 
numbers in Lucene documents work?  For example, the TermDocs.doc() 
method returns "the current doc number."  How can I get this doc number 
if I just have a Document?

Here's the context.  I'm working on implementing Justin Zobel's 
similarity functions (from his paper "Exploring the Similarity Space," 
mentioned previously by Ian) in a retrieval system based on Lucene.  I 
have a Lucene document and a term, for which I can get a TermDocs object 
from an IndexReader.  I then want to get the number of occurrences of 
that term in the specific Lucene document mentioned above.  I would like 
to call TermDocs.skip(<"doc # of Lucene doc">) and then freq() to get 
this frequency.  Is this the way to get the frequency of a term in a 
specific document?
