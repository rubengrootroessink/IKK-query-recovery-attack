SUBJECT: How to efficiently get # of search results, per attribute
DATE: 13 Nov 2004

I'd like to implement a search across several types of "entities",
let's say, classes, professors, and departments.  I want the user to
be able to enter a simple, single query and not have to specify what
they're looking for.  Then I want the search results to be something
like this:

Search results for: "philosophy boyer"

Found: 121 classes - 5 professors - 2 departments

<search results here...>


I know I could iterate through every hit returned and count them up
myself, but that seems inefficient if there are lots of results.  Is
there some other way to get this kind of information from the search
result set?  My other ideas are: doing a separate search each result
type, or storing different types in different indexes.  Any
suggestions?  Thanks for your help!
