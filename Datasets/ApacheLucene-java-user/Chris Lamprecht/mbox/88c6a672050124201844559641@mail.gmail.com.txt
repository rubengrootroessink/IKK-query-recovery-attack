Hi Karthik,

If you are talking about SingleThreadModel (i.e. your servlet
implements javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel), this does not guarantee
that two different instances of your servlet won't be run at the same
time.  It only guarantees that each instance of your servlet will only
be run by one thread at a time.  See:

http://java.sun.com/j2ee/sdk_1.3/techdocs/api/javax/servlet/SingleThreadModel.html

If you are accessing a shared resource (a lucene index), you'll have
to prevent concurrent modifications somehow other than
SingleThreadModel.

I think they've finally deprecated SingleThreadModel in the latest
(may be not even out yet) servlet spec.
