SUBJECT: Re: StandardAnalyzer unit tests?
DATE: 17 Jan 2005

Erik, Paul, Daniel,

I submitted a testcase --
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33134

On a related note, what do you all think about updating the
StandardAnalyzer grammar to treat "C#" and "C++" as tokens?  It's a
small modification to the grammar -- NutchAnalysis.jj has it.
