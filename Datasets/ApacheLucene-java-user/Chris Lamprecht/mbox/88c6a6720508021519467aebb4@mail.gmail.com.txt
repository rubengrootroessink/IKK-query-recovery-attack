SUBJECT: Re: IO bandwidth throttling
DATE: 2 Aug 2005

I've wanted something similar, for the same purpose -- to keep lucene
from consuming disk I/O resources when another process is running on
the same machine.

A general solution might be to define a simple interface such as

interface IndexInputOutputListener {
    void willReadBytes(int numberOfBytes);
    void willWriteBytes(int numberOfBytes);
}

If non-null, then Lucene can call these methods just before it calls
IndexInput.readBytes() or IndexOutput.writeBytes()   (referring to the
Lucene 1.9 API).  People could implement these methods to do whatever
they want, including throttling I/O, or just keeping I/O profiling
statistics.

Also the above interface could be split into two, an
IndexInputListener and IndexOutputListener, if people are likely to
use one and not the other.

In the meantime, you may be able to do what you want by extending or
decorating FSDirectory, and do the throttling just before or after
calling the real FSDirectory's read/write methods (in FSIndexOutput
and FSIndexInput inner classes).
