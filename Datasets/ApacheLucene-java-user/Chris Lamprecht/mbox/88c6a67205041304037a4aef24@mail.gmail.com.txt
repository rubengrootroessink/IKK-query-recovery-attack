Yes, you can store different types of documents (i.e., they have
different fields) in the same lucene index.  You do not need a
MultiSearcher for this.  (Of course, you could also divide your
documents between more than one index, and use MultiSearcher if you
want, but it's not necessary).

For this you can use a field boost, either at indexing time, or at
search time.  I'm not sure what 'ponderation' means.

You can filter search terms using "stop words" with the Analyzer used
at query parsing time.  Lucene can do "AND" searches, "OR" searches,
and "NOT" searches, as well as range queries, wildcards, and more.

You can use lucene Filters for this.  If you're new to lucene, the
best thing you can do for yourself is buy the book _Lucene in Action_.
 It explains how to do all this stuff and more.
