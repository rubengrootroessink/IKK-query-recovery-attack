Zach,
It probably won't help performance to split the index and then search
it on the same machine unless you search the indexes in parallel (with
a multiprocessor or multi-core machine).  Even in this case, the disk
is often a bottleneck, essentially preventing the search from really
running in parallel.  Although if your index is in the filesystem
cache this may be fast.

Notice I said "probably", "often", "may be" in the above paragraph --
you just have to performance test it and measure it to see.  Start
with a simple, one-index setup and see if that works.  A 2GB index
isn't itself a problem (under linux at least).    Then your queries
and any pre/post-query processing become the bigger factors.  I
haven't run into any filesize limits under linux with indexes up to
12GB (and others here with even larger indexes).  The one exception is
using Lucene 1.9's MMapDirectory-- it's limited to (I believe) 4GB on
a 32-bit platform.
