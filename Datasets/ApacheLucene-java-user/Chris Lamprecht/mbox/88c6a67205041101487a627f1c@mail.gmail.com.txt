SUBJECT: RangeQuery doesn't override equals() or hashCode() - intentional?
DATE: 11 Apr 2005

I was attempting to cache QueryFilters in a Map using the Query as the
key (a BooleanQuery instance containing two RangeQueries), and I
discovered that my BooleanQueries' equals() methods would always
return false, even when the queries were equivalent.  The culprit was
RangeQuery - it doesn't implement equals() or hashCode().  Is this
intentional, and if not, can I propose a patch to implement these
methods?  thanks,

Chris
