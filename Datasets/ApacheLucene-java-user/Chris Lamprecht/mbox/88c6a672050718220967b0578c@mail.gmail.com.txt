See the paper at: http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html 

"MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for
processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map
function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of
intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all
intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Many
real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper.
"

cool stuff
