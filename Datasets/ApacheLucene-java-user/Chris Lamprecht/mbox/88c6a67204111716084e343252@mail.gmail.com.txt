John,

It actually should be pretty easy to use just the parts of Lucene you
want (the analyzers, etc) without using the rest.  See the example of
the PorterStemmer from this article:

http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/01/15/lucene.html?page=2

You could feed a Reader to the tokenStream() method of
PorterStemAnalyzer, and get back a TokenStream, from which you pull
the tokens using the next() method.

 I would like to be able to send in a phrase and get back a collection of keywords if possible.

have time to spend a month making a carefully tested, administratable Lucene solution for
my site yet, but I intend to do so over time.  Funny thing is the Lucene code likely would
only take up a couple hundred of lines, but integration and administration would take me much
more time.

  Each record I would need to do this to is small with maybe only average 15 userful words.
  I would be able to have an in-database solution though ranking, etc would not exist.   This
is better then the exact word searching i have currently which is really bad.

so many people would not have access to even this basic ability in production systems for
some time yet.
