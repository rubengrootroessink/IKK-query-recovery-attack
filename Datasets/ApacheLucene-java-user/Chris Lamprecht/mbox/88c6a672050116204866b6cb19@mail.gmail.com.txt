SUBJECT: StandardAnalyzer unit tests?
DATE: 17 Jan 2005

Does anyone have a unit test for StandardAnalyzer?  I've modified the
StandardAnalyzer javacc grammar to tokenize "c#" and "c++" without
removing the "#" and "++" parts, using pieces of the grammar from
Nutch.  Now I'd like to make sure I didn't change the way it parses
any other tokens.  thanks,

-Chris
