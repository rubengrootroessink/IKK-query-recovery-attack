SUBJECT: Re: performance implications for an index with large number of documents.
DATE: 24 Jan 2006

How much RAM do you have?  If you're under linux, can you run
something like "iostat -x -d -t 60" and watch your disk usage during
searching?  If your disk utilization is high, add more RAM (enough to
hold your index in RAM) and see if the OS cache solves the problem.  I
would try this before the common approach of loading the index into a
RAMDirectory.  You might even try lowering your java heap to give more
to the OS.

Watch your CPU usage (using tools 'top' or 'sar'), are you CPU-bound? 
With more info, we can try to pinpoint the bottleneck.
