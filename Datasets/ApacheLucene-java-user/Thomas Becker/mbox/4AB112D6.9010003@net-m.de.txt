SUBJECT: Re: lucene 2.9.0RC4 slower than 2.4.1?
DATE: 16 Sep 2009

New Profiling sessions with invocation counts. A single lucene search request
with huge resultset (169k items).

Quite interesting results though and there's definetly something wrong with luc
2.9 and the way I'm using it. But see yourself:

and even worse:

Have to verify that the last one is not by accident more than one request. Will
do the run again and then post the required info.
