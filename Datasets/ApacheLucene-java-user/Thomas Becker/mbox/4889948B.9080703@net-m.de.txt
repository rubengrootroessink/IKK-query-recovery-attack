SUBJECT: Range Query Question
DATE: 25 Jul 2008

Hi all,

I need to replace some db queries with lucene due to response time 
issues for sure. In this special case I need to do a range query on a 
field and a prefix query. I'm trying to prepare and try my query in luke 
with no success before migrating it to java.

I need to find all names starting with for example "A Balladeer" to "A 
Perfect Circle" in the name field. The sort field is sortName (same 
content as name, but untokenized for sorting).

I tried the following in luke which should give me a few hundred docs:

name:["A Balladeer*" TO "A Perfect Circle*"] - 0 results, also there 
should be some
name:["A Balladeer*" TO "B*" - >10k results, but also returns results 
which have a string in the middle or end starting with A

I tried using sortName (untokenized) field instead:
sortName:["A Balladeer*" TO "B*" - 25 results, all starting with A* 
(guess since it's untokenized), but far less than expected again

Tried a couple of more (stupid) things with little success. I googled 
around, but I'm kinda stuck here. So I'm asking the list. How can I 
search all name/sortName fields in a range between "A Balladeer*" TO "A 
Perfect Circle*" and get only terms back which are starting with that 
terms? Is there a way to accomplish that in Java and try it in luke?

And is there a way to sort resultsets in luke?

Cheers,
Thomas
