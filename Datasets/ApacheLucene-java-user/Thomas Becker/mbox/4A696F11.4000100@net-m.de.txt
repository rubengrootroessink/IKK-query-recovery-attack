SUBJECT: Re: Loading an index into memory
DATE: 24 Jul 2009

We've a centralized lucene index running on a nfs share. This index gets
an update per 30 min. The LuceneServer nodes will notice the update and
copy the index (about 2,5gig) to a local tmpfs directory. Searching is
way faster in our case compared to a local disk.
However eks' concerns are valid and in the beginning we had some issues
with the OS starting to swap out things without a noticeable reason.
However this swapping occured rarely and did not affect performance
severly. Now the boxes got some more main memory and the problem is
gone. Two LuceneServer instances are sufficient to handle up to 60 heavy
search requests per second, which involves also some object generation,
etc.

I've tried RAMDirectory first, but we went the tmpfs way quite fast.
Sadly I can't remember what the main reason of our decision has been.

you should go for it. That gives you the fastest and the most stable performance, no OS swaps,
no sudden performance drops... Uwe's tip is very good, if you/OS occasionally need RAM for
other things, so that OS can borrow some from your index. This swapping comes with price,
which can or cannot be ok for you.
