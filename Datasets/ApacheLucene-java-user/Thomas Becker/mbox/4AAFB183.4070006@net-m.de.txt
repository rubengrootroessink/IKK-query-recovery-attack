SUBJECT: Re: lucene 2.9.0RC4 slower than 2.4.1?
DATE: 15 Sep 2009

Hey Mark,

yes. I'm running the app on unix. You see the difference between 2.9 and 2.4 here:

http://ankeschwarzer.de/tmp/graph.jpg

2.4 responds much quicker thus increasing throughput severly. I'm having a
single segment only:

-rw-r--r-- 1 asuser asgroup         20 Sep  9 16:40 segments.gen
-rw-r--r-- 1 asuser asgroup        294 Sep  9 16:44 segments_1o
-rw-r--r-- 1 asuser asgroup 2810603184 Sep  9 16:44 _7c.cfs

The FileChannel.read hotspot is indeed strange. Especially if taking into
account that the index is lying on a tmpfs (in memory). And 2.4 should be using
NIOFSDirectory as well?! Will check that.

Thanks a lot for your support!

Cheers,
Thomas
