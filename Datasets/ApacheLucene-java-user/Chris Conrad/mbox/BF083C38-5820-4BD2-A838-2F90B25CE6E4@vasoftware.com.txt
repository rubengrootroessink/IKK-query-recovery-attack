SUBJECT: Re: SourceForge.net Lucene based search announcement
DATE: 27 May 2005

Hello,

The "results by YAHOO! search" is a marketing thing that we have no  
real control over.  I promise that the actual project search engine  
is using Lucene.

As for defaulting to OR, it was decided that the new search should  
function as similarly as possible to the old search system by  
default.  The new search engine, however, will happily handle boolean  
queries in the search box, so feel free to search for "lucene and  
java".  We're working on a comprehensive search guide which will  
explain the features in more details but some of the new things you  
can do include phrase searches and prefix searches.

And I have to admit, we haven't stomped out all of the bugs yet.  If  
you do find something that seems genuinely broken, please submit a  
support request.
