SUBJECT: SourceForge.net Lucene based search announcement
DATE: 25 May 2005

Hello,

I just wanted to let everyone know that we've officially announced  
that the new SourceForge.net search system is based on Lucene.  It's  
been in operation for over a month now and we're very happy with it.   
I'd also like to personally thank Erik Hatcher for helping me out  
during development.

You can find Lucene listed in the Site Software section of our  
support guide here: http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php? 
docid=11230&group_id=1#site_software

Thanks,
Chris Conrad
SourceForge.net Engineer
