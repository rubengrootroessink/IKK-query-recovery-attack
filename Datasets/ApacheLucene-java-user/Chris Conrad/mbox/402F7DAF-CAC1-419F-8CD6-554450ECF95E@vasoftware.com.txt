We're using the StandardAnalyzer.  We are having very strange  
problems and I haven't been able to track them down.  I know that the  
SourceForge Enterprise Edition team at VA has also seen the same kind  
of problem (i.e. search terms returning no results when there seem to  
be matches).

We don't really measure peak load accurately but if you watch the  
query log it's scrolling constantly.  I would guess that we peak at  
5-7 queries per second but don't quote me on it.
