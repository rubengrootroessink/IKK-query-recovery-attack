We don't crawl per se, we use triggers in the database to spool  
changes to a table which is then processed in batches.  The searches  
which are searching data stored on SourceForge.net all work that  
way.  The Freshmeat.net search, on the other hand, actually posts the  
search to Freshmeat.net.  We have no control over their search  
system, though, that search type is provided as a convenience for users.

I took a quick look at your tool and it seems pretty robust.  Perhaps  
I'll have time to fully evaluate it at some point.
