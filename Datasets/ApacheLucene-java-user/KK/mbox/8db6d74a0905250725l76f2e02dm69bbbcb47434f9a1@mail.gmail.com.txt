SUBJECT: Re: How to extract 15/20 words around the matched query after getting	results from lucene searcher?
DATE: 25 May 2009

Thank you very much @Michael.
I googled and didn't find much but I grabbed the book LIA 2nd Edn and went
through that and found a very good example in Sec8.7 and that helped me
solve the problem. Now I'm able to do highlighting for english texts but for
non-english text no luck yet. I've posted new mails regarding the same[dont
want to do cossposting]. If possible please have a look.
And yes I must thank you and other authors for the wonderful book called
LIA. Once I went thru this book I got cleared a lot many things, really very
nice book. Surprisingly there is not much information on the net regarding
the advanced features of lucene all of which are clearly explained in this
book with examples.

Thank you.
KK.
