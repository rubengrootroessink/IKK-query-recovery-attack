Hi Stanley,
As Alexander correctly mentioned, you should first try your hands with
Solr[which uses Lucene at the backend] keeping you away/free from all the
nitty-gritty.
First get the Solr running, making sure your are able to post/index
documents in it and also able to search it from the solr admin interface. I
must say that the solr home page mentions everything for getting started on
Solr. If you still need help you can google out or may be have a look on
these links,
# http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-solr1/
  --- this article is very good, I hope it wil solve your problem, at least
it will get you started
#
http://justin-hayes.com/2009-04-08/installing-apache-tomcat-6-and-solr-nightly-on-ubuntu-804
  -- this is ubuntu specific running in tomcat

First you have to decide the container, the simplest one is obiviously
Apache Tomcat. Get that running. Have a look here,
# www.devx.com/webdev/Article/16416
-- for windows
# www.eglug.org/book/export/html/1630
 -- for linux

Once you have tomcat running deploy the solr war as given is Solr wiki/home
page and try to acces the sole admin page from the browser.

Once its up and you have indexed some pages then you have to decide how to
integrate it with html pages. So for that you have to decide on client side
scripting. If you know Javascript and say php/jsp then you can get started.
First write some php codes through which you can talk to Solr[solr has
support for communicating with PHP using solr-php-client],
have a look here,
http://wiki.apache.org/*solr*/Integrating*Solr
*  this shows how to integrate solr. Now call the methods on that PHP page
running at the server side from the javascript code in the client side and
do whatever you watn with the results.
Hope this will get you started. If you need more information you can always
post in in this mailing list.
