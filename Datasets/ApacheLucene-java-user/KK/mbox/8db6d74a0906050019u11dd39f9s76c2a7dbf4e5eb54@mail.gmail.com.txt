SUBJECT: Re: How to support stemming and case folding for english content	mixed with non-english content?
DATE: 5 Jun 2009

Hi Robert,
This is what I copied from ThaiAnalyzer @ lucene contrib

public class ThaiAnalyzer extends Analyzer {
  public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
      TokenStream ts = new StandardTokenizer(reader);
    ts = new StandardFilter(ts);
    ts = new ThaiWordFilter(ts);
    ts = new StopFilter(ts, StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS);
    return ts;
  }
}

Now as you said, I've to use whitespacetokenizer withworddelimitefilter[solr
nightly.jar] stop wordremoval, porter stemmer etc , so it is something like
this,
public class IndicAnalyzer extends Analyzer {
 public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
   TokenStream ts = new WhiteSpaceTokenizer(reader);
   ts = new WordDelimiterFilter(ts);
   ts = new LowerCaseFilter(ts);
   ts = new StopFilter(ts, StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS)   // english
stop filter, is this the default one?
   ts = new PorterFilter(ts);
   return ts;
 }
}

Does this sound OK? I think it will do the job...let me try it out..
I dont need custom filter as per my requirement, at least not for these
basic things I'm doing? I think so...

Thanks,
KK.
