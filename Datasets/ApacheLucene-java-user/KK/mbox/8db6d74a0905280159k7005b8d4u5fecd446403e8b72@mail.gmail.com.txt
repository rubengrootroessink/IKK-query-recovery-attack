As I know, you extract the text out of html pages, I dont think you want to
index the tags as well, right?
So what gets indexed by lucene is just the text and what you get as search
result is what you've indexed.
I'm repeating myself, once you have the search result, its upon you to do
what you want with that.
No body indexes the raw html/xml etc. You index the body/title etc . But if
your requirement is to index the raw html file, then wait for someone else
to respond.
As far as the power of lucene is concerned, it can do almost anything on
indexing/searching. Its limited because of the way one makes use of it and
not due to the functionality/adaptabiliy of lucene.

First make yourself clear about what you want at the end of the day, then
try to get that done.
