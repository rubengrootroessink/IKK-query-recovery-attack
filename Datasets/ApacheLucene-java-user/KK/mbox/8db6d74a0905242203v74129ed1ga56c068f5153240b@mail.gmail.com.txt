SUBJECT: How to extract 15/20 words around the matched query after getting	results from lucene searcher?
DATE: 25 May 2009

Hi All,
I'm trying to index some non-english web pages and I'm keeping all the
content of the page in a single field and the searches are working fine as
well. Now when I search for some query it gives the complete page, which is
expected. Now I want to restrict the showing of results to say 20 words
around the match, something like google does, otherwise we cann't make users
to look for a match in the whole page content[I'll use highlighter after
this is done]. So getting positions of the matched word/phrase might help so
that I can extract some words before and some words after that and will show
that to end user. Any idea on doing the same will be very helpful. Thank
you.

KK.
