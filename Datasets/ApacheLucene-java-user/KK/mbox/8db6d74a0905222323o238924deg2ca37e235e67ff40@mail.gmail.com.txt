SUBJECT: Which analyzer to use for non-english unicoded text?
DATE: 23 May 2009

Hi All,
I've been trying to index some non-english [Indian languages] in unicode
utf-8. For all these languages we don't have any stemmer or tokenizers etc.
To keep the searching simple I'ld like to be able to do exact word
searches/matches as a first step. I'ld like to know which will be the
simplest yet working analyzer to use for both indexing as well as
searhing[lucene wiki says both should be same, else you might not get search
results, right?]

Many a people must have done indexing for non-english text for which there
is no standard analyzers. I request them to give me ideas on this. Along
with this I would also like to do hit highlighting irrespective of language.
Ideas on this will be equally helpful.

Is simpleAnalyzer() good enough for indexing and searching?

Thanks,
KK
