SUBJECT: Re: how to get the word before and the word after the matched Term?
DATE: 25 May 2009

Hi All.
I want to do the same thing with say a window of 10/15.
Can some one give me more details about how to do this i.e getting
neighbors[both sides] of size "window", if some examples are there please
point me to them/post in the mail.
Also I would like to know about the term query. Is it the case that the term
query has to be only single term , I mean can'nt we do the same thing where
the search query is not just a term but say a phrase[multiple terms]. Now I
want to extract neighbors for this matched phrase. I think this is the
generic scenario.
So as per the mail I have to make use of SpanQuery, TermVector and
TermVectorMapper for these purposes, right?
NB:I also want to add hit highlighting after fixing the neighbor problem.

Thanks,
KK.
