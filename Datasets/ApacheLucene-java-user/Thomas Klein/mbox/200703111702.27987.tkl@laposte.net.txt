SUBJECT: date range querys
DATE: 11 Mar 2007

Hi there,

I'm indexing a lot of documents with lucene and I'm really happy with 
it :)

Observing my users, I understand they are querying only small range of 
time. Often, they only read results back from 1 month.

I got some years in my 1.3Go index. Querys takes some seconds getting 
and returning docs IDs.

I'm indexing a some date field like that : 
20060612223456
2006061222
20060612
200606
2006

In your opinion, will range query be fast enough or will I need to 
create, for exemple, one index per month and then open and parse them 
regarding querys ?

Regards,

Thomas.
