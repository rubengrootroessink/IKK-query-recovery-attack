Hi there,

I'm fairly new to lucene, I just developped a multi threaded indexing 
tcp server using lucene to hmmm, let me remember, index stuffs :)

I have to index not only english, but french and german, and, I don't 
know, perhaps other languages in the future.

Did lucene use a default stemmer or do I have to stem the texts before 
indexing ?

Does a multi-language stemmer exists ?

(sorry if the answers are in the documentation, I didn't manage to 
fully read it)

Thanks in advance !

Thomas Klein.
