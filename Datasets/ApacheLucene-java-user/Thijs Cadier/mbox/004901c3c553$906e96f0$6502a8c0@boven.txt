SUBJECT: Wildcard in Field
DATE: 18 Dec 2003

I'm implementing Lucene in our Content Management system. A plugin for every
type of content fills the Document, so I have no control over the amount and
names of the fields.

Now I'm trying to do a search in every field. But Lucene won't accept a * as
a field name in the Query. Is there a way to perform a search like this?
