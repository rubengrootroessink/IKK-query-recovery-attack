You can try Hibernate Search. Maybe it can work.

主题： does lucene support Database full text search 
 
Hi:
I am using MySql,and I want to use the full text search is rather weak.
So I use the Sphinx,however I found it can not support Chinese work
searching prefectly.
So I wonder if Lucene can work better?
