Subject: Parsing large xml files 


Hi, 

While trying to parse xml documents of about 50MB size, we run into 
OutOfMemoryError due to java heap space. Increasing JVM to use close 2GB 
(that is the max), does not help. Is there any API that could be used to 
handle such large single xml files? 

If Lucene is not the right place, please let me know alternate places to 
look for, 

Thanks in advance,
