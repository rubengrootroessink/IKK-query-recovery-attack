doc.add(new Field("authors", "name1 surname1 name2 surmane2", StoreOption, 
IndexOption); 

So you can make a search like 
authors:"name1 surname1" 

(Disadvantage: you will also get result with a search like authors:"surname1 
name2" )

Thanks Erick, 

In more complex xml I mean, for example this xml: 

<root> 
<book> 
<title>Lucene Book</title> 
<authors> 
<author>Book author 1</author> 
<author>Book author 2</author> 
</authors> 
<summary>Book for Lucene</summary> 
</book> 
<book> 

<title>Lucene Book 2</title> 

<authors> 

<author>Book 2 author 1</author> 

<author>Book 2 author 2</author> 


</authors> 

<summary>Book 2 for Lucene</summary> 


</book> 
</root> 

for each 'book' node is handled by one Document rite? and now 
how to handle the 'authors' node? should I put in new Document? or how? 

thx. :)

Lucene is an *engine*, not an application. *You* have to process the 
XML, decide what the structure of your index is and index the data. There 
are many 
XML parser options, this is just straight Java code. You'll decide 
what's relevant, and add the contents of the relevant elements to a Lucene 
document 
then add that to your index. 

Similarly for searching. 

So, say you have the following simple XML doc 
<root> 
<ele1>ele 1 text</ele1> 
<ele2>ele 2 text</ele2> 
</root> 

You'd have to parse that text, then, say, add (semi-pseudo-code) 
Document doc = new Document() 
doc.add(new Field("ele1field", "ele 1 text", StoreOPtion, IndexOption); 
doc.add(new Field("ele2field", "ele 2 text", StoreOption, IndexOption); 
writer.add(doc); 

Then at search time you'd form your queries on "ele1field" and ele2field".
