once you get comfortable with vtd-xml, few people will ever get back to DOM and SAX...

Thanks everyone for your useful suggestions/links. 

Lucene uses DOM and we tried with SAX. 

XML Pull & vtd-xml as well as Piccolo seem good. 

However, for now, we've broken the file into smaller chunks and then 
parsing it. 

When we get some time, we'ld like to refactor with the suggested ones. 

Erick: We do use Eclipse. But running from CLI gives the same error! May 
be there is a way to address the memory issues, but the current idea of 
breaking into smaller chunks have worked for now... 


Sincerely,

I am not familiar with that particular code of Lucene, but is it 
possible that Lucene is using DOM for this parsing? 
If so, one could try to replace it by SAX, and hence get rid of the 
OutOfMemory issue.
