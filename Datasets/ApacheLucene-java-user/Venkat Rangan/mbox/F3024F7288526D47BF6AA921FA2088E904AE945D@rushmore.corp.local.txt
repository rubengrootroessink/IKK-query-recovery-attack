SUBJECT: Number of documents in each segment before a merge occurs
DATE: 26 Jul 2009

Hi,

 

We are writing to an index using IndexWriter with setMergeFactor() set
to 10. After inserting several documents, a merge occurs, but our
observation is that each segment only has a single document. Is there a
way to get more than a single document in each segment before they are
picked up for a merge?

 

The following is the merge debug line when setInfoStream is set to
stdout stream.

 

2009-07-26 07:07:09,202 INFO  [STDOUT] (main:) merging segments _ram_0
(1 docs) _ram_1 (1 docs) _ram_2 (1 docs) _ram_3 (1 docs) _ram_4 (1 docs)
_ram_5 (1 docs) _ram_6 (1 docs) _ram_7 (1 docs) _ram_8 (1 docs) _ram_9
(1 docs) into _0 (10 docs)

 

Thanks,
