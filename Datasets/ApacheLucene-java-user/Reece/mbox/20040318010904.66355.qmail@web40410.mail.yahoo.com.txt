SUBJECT: Searches containing a dollar sign $
DATE: 18 Mar 2004

Hi,

I have a field that has a dollar sign in it like this:
  abc$def

I perform the following queries using the
StandardAnalyzer:

1). myField:abc$def - work
2). myField:abc*    - work
3). myField:abc$*   - no work

Why doesn't the third query work?  Is there an
analyzer that will handle all three of these queries?

Thanks,
Reece
