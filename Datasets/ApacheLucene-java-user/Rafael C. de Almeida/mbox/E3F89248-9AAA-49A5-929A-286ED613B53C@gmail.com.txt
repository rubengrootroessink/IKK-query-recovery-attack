SUBJECT: Unique tokens analyzer
DATE: 14 Oct 2008

Hello,

Is there a analyzer that will tokenize the stream such that there's no  
repeated tokens in the stream? I have a keyword-field on my document,  
so if one keyword already appears on the list there's no point in  
having it shown again. Does it make sense having that analyzer? Or  
indexing repeated keywords on the same field shouldn't hurt  
performance or search quality in any way?
