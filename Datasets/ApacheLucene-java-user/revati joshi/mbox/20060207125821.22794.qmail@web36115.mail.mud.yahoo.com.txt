Hello lucene members,
                                     i'm the silent member of this group.last week i had sent
some query regarding reindexing,but i dn't received any reply from any one.Still i'm stuck
up with the same problem of reindexing.
  i hve completed with the reindexing code using hibernate Lifecycle class but i don't know
where and when to call this class for reindexing purpose during updation or new creation of
any file in ur system.
  I just want to know the precise procedure or method for this.
  So plz do suggest some solution to this as early as possible.
  Thanks for ur cooperation.
  Byee for now.
