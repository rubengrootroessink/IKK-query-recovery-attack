SUBJECT: updating index
DATE: 16 Feb 2006

Hi,
       i hve tried updating lucene index using Hibernate lifecycle class but not able to get
the implementation of this class.
  www.hibernate.org - Using Lifecycles and Interceptors to update Lucene searches.htm
  The onSave(),onUpdate() method has got the Session parameter which is to passed while invoking
it.
  i'm not able to get idea about Session parameter.How do i pass Session parameter to it.Since
i hve created GUI using java swing n awt components,so how n where do i invoke these methods
n Session parameter.
  Is it proper if i do with Multithreading concept which will continuously do indexing in
the background in order to make updation in indexing.
  Plz suggest some solution to this problem as soon as possible.
  Thnks for ur cooperation in advance.
                                                 with regards,
                                                  Revati.
