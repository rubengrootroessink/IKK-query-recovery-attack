SUBJECT: Indexing problem
DATE: 18 Feb 2006

Hi,
       i'm facing problem while indexing the files .There r some files which r not in normal
ASCII format having ASCII characters but r in some arabic,french format which i don't want
to index those files.
  Because of these files my indexing process gets halted in between.so is there any class
in Lucene to ignore such files.
  plz suggest some solution to this.
  Thnkx for ur cooperation in advance.
                                                         regards,
                                                          Revati.
