SUBJECT: Reindexing
DATE: 31 Jan 2006

Hello Lucene members.
                                       i tried to do reindexing using Lifecycle interface
of Hibernate
  ,but i'm stuck up with the implementation part of this interface.
  I wrote the code for it but i'm now stuck up with the concept of Hibernate.
  It uses methods lkie Onsave(),OnUpdate()... but where and when do i call this methods.Rather
then calling these methods,when exactly these methods r invoked or where i'll hve to call
the class implementing this methods?.
  How exactly reindexing will take place.?
  Plz suggest any solution to this problem.
  Thnkx for forwarding the Hibernate link.
  Thnkx for ur cooperation.
  Thanking you,
                                            with regards,
                                            Revati.
