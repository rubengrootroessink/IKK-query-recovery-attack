SUBJECT: Synchronizing a Context
DATE: 15 Jan 2004

Hi,

I am relatively new to Velocity and I have been trying to write a shared 
Context for a group of Servlets. However, I see in the Javadoc 
documentation that the VelocityContext object is not thread safe, I have 
also examined the hierarchy of super classes and find that it pretty 
much comes down to the InternalContextBase.icachePut and 
InternalContextBase.icacheGet methods.

What I was wondering was, if I synchronized these methods in a subclass 
and extended the AbstractContext would I have a thread safe Context 
implementation ? If not is there any support within the core Velocity 
API for thread safe (preferably chained) Context objects. Any help on 
this would be appreciated!

Niall
