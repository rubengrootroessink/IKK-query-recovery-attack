Hi!
For you Mark Harwood has made a file HighlightExtractorTest in which 
the principle of work Highlight is specified.
Besides by replacing tags <B> for example on < B style = " 
color:black; background-color:#ffff66 " >, receive yellow Highlight. 
If to apply conformity found word and color, it will turn out as at 
Google and etc.
Best regards,
Vladimir.
