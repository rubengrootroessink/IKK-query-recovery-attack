DATE: 17 Mar 2004

Dear developers!

The user using RussianAnalyzer writes to you of Lucene. There is one 
problem at work only with it 
of Analyzer it is parameter of the Russian coding (you it know as the 
set of the code tables for one 
language always causes admiration). East Europe or the population the 
using applied programs in 
Russian use the coding windows-1251 as basic or widely widespread 
client a platform MS Windows. 
There is an opinion to update constructor without parameters 
establishing default "Cp1251".

See attached file: RussianAnalyzerPatchs.tgz
RussianAnalyzer.java.path
RussianLetterTokenizer.java.patch
RussianLowerCaseFilter.java.patch
RussianStemFilter.java.patch
TestRussianAnalyzer.java.path

Such updating will remove mess (for the beginners in Lucene or 
beginners of Russian) and will facilitate use Analyzers at switchings 
multilanguage search. 

Regards,
Vladimir Yuryev.
