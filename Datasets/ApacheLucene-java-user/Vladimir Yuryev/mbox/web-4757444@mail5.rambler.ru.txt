Hi !

I have made latest update from lucene CVS, in which build.xml has 
problems:

Buildfile: /home/vyuryev/workspace/jakarta-lucene/build.xml
BUILD FAILED: 
file:/home/vyuryev/workspace/jakarta-lucene/build.xml:11: Unexpected 
element "tstamp"
Total time: 297 milliseconds

Best Regards,
Vladimir Yuryev
