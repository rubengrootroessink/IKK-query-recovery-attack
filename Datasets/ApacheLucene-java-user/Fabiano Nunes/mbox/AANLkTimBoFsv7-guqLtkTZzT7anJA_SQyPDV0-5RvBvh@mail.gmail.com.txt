SUBJECT: Custom token attributes and payload. XML analyzing.

Hello,

I'm trying to store some token attributes found in a XML document.
More specifically, token coordinates for future highlighting.
Example: I have a XML with this structure:

<word c="184,108,292,11">Lucene</word>
<word c="306,21,292,11">in</word>
<word c="340,74,292,11">Action</word>
<word c="428,11,292,11">2nd</word>
<word c="453,23,292,11">Edition</word>

I want to store the @c attribute from word element (coordinates
left,width,top,height) in each token. So, in the search, I'll retrieve each
token position for highlighting. There is any good approach to do this?
