SUBJECT: PayloadSpanUtil and unstored fields.
DATE: 1 Dec 2010

PayloadSpanUtil can't retrieve payloads from unstored fields (Field.Store.NO).
Since the payloads is stored in terms, why do I need store the fields?
Example:
PayloadSpanUtil psu = new PayloadSpanUtil(ireader);
 Collection<byte[]> tests = psu.getPayloadsForQuery(query);
Assert.assertTrue((tests.size() > 0)); // <------- tests is always 0 if the
field is Field.Store.NO

Thanks.
