SUBJECT: Search on all fields in a document
DATE: 20 Oct 2005

Hi,

If I have a document with a number of fields in it, is there a way to 
say that I want to search for a term across all those fields without 
stating the terms explicitly?

Detail:

I have multiple different types of products (cds, dvds, games, books 
etc.) each different product has different fields in it's document but 
all are indexed in the same index. This works for advanced searches but 
I would like to have a simple search where the user just whacks in a 
string (say Micheal Jackson) and the search would search through all 
terms of all documents and return cds by Micheal Jackson, music dvds by 
him, his biography perhaps, and maybe even a book on how to get away 
with pedophilia ;)

Any ideas?

Cheers
Rob
