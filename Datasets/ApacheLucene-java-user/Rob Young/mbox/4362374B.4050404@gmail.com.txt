How important is it that the search index be absolutely up to date? I 
read from a RAMDirectory based index but the actual index is in a 
FSDirectory. The way I managed it was to have the RAMDirectory 
periodically (two hourly) reloaded. My data doesn't have to be 
completely up to date so this works for me.
