SUBJECT: Using analyzers with term queries
DATE: 25 Oct 2005

Hi,

I am using TermQuery s (and FuzzyQuery s) on the searching side and I 
would like to keep doing so. However, I would like to use the 
MetaphoneReplacementAnalyzer (from Lucene in Action) when indexing. How 
can I allow for this in searching if I'm using TermQuery?

Thanks
Rob
