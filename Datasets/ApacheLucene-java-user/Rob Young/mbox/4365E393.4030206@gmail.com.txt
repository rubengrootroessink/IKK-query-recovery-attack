SUBJECT: StandardTokenizer throws extra exceptions
DATE: 31 Oct 2005

Hi,

I'm trying to create another, slightly changed, version of 
StandardAnalyzer. I've coppied out the source, editted the .jj file and 
re-built the StandardTokenizer class. The problem I am facing is, when I 
have all this in eclipse it's telling me that the ParseException is not 
compatible with the throws clause in TokenStream.next(), I check 
TokenStream.next() and the only Exception it's throwing there is 
IOException. How can I get around this error? As far as I can see 
StandardAnalyzer doesn't seem to do anything to get around it.

Cheers
Rob
