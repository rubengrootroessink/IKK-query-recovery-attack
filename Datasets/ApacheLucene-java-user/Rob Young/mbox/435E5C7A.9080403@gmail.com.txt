Hey, thanks for the fuzzyQuery.rewrite tip, I'll try that out to see 
what's going on. Regarding the theory about falling below the 0.5f 
threshold, that's not the case because new FuzzyQuery( new Term( ... ), 
0.5f ) on it's own matches. I'll see what I can find out with your 
rewrite tip though :)
