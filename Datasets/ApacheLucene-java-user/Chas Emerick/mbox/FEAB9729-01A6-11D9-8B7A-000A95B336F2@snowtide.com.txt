Ben,

Wow, thanks for the plug! :-)

Truthfully, I was worried that our open-source brethren might feel 
slighted by the comparison -- that's partially why we wanted to make 
sure it was as thorough and transparent as possible so that anyone 
could review the results for themselves.  I'm glad that you're not at 
all sore.
