SUBJECT: Addition to contributions page
DATE: 10 Sep 2004

I hope I'm posting this request to the right list.  The page that lists 
3rd-party tools that work with Lucene ( 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/contributions.html ) says that to 
be added to the the page, one should send a message to one of the 
Lucene mailing lists.  So, that's what I'm doing.

PDFTextStream should be added to the 'Document Converters' section, 
with this URL < http://snowtide.com >, and perhaps this heading: 
'PDFTextStream -- PDF text and metadata extraction'.  The 'Author' 
field should probably be left blank, since there's no single creator.

Thanks much,

Chas Emerick   |   cemerick@snowtide.com
