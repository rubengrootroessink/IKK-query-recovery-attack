There are a number of libraries for Java that provide PDF text 
extraction functionality.  A pretty comprehensive list is available at 
< http://www.geocities.com/marcoschmidt.geo/java-libraries-pdf.html >.  
I'm obviously biased towards recommending our solution, PDFTextStream < 
http://snowtide.com/home/PDFTextStream/ >; it's the fastest thing out 
there for Java, and it provides a very easy-to-use Lucene integration 
module that will have you up and running in no time <

 >.

For office documents, just about the only game in town that I know of 
is the Jakarta POI project < http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/ >.  It's 
been quite a while since I've touched it, but it's definitely the best 
place to start.
