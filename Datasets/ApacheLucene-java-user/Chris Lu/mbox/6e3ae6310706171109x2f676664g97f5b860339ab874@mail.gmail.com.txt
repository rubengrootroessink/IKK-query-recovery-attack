There are three things to watch out for chinese or CJK languages:

1. The content source or database need to be encoded in UTF-8.
2. StandardAnalyzer doesn't support chinese words well. Use either
ChineseAnalyzer or CJKAnalyzer. My experience is that CJKAnalyzer is a
little better.
3. The user's query should be encoded in UTF-8.
