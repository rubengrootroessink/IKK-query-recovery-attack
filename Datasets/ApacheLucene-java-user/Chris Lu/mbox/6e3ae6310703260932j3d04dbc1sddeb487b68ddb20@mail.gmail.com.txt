This seems good but too strict and not practical for me. And I doubt
it's useful for any real practice also...

I think the better question could be, given a large/stale index A, a
small/updated index B, and the B does not satisfy the requirement of
ParallelReader. How can I create an index C that "add the same
documents in the same order of index A"?
