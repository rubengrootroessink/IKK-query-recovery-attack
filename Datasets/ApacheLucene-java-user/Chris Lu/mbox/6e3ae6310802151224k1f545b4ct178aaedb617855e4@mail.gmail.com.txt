Sorry, sent the previous draft email by mistake. Here is the correct one.

Sounds a typical SQL pivot problem.

select Id, SIN, data.*
from IdCard, (SELECT
      ID
      MAX(CASE WHEN name = 'Fname' THEN Value END) AS Fname,
      MAX(CASE WHEN name = 'Lname' THEN Value END) AS Lname,
      MAX(CASE WHEN name = 'Age' THEN Value END) AS Age,
      MAX(CASE WHEN name = 'Country' THEN Value END) AS Country
FROM
       DATA_Table
GROUP BY
      ID
) data

To speed things up, you can split the SQLs into 2 for better performance.

This is how DBSight does this. You can write your own SQLs, but
generally it's the same methods.
