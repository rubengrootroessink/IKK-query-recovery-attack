Hi, Antoine,

It does take a long time to open the index reader.
One thing you could do is to put new documents into one smaller index and
re-open it, it should be much faster.

Also, you may need to have one index reader open, and open a new index
reader, then close the previous index reader, to ensure no service down
time.
