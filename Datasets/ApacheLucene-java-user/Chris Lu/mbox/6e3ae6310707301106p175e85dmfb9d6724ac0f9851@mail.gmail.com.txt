SUBJECT: a question for french analyzer
DATE: 30 Jul 2007

Hi,

I am not a French speaker, but here are some questions regarding
French analyzer:

Is there any analyzer that can do this? Analyze accentuated letters to
non accentuated corresponding letters (é,è,ê,ë -> e), so that

search "fenêtre" (=window) found all docs with "fenêtre" or "fenetre"
and
search "fenetre" found the same result, all docs with "fenêtre" or "fenetre"

Current analyzers, Snowball-French and FrenchAnalyzer don't have this feature.
