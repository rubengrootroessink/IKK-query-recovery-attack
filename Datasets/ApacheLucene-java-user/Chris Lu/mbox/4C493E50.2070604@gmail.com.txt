3) Sounds you want to use Lucene for storage, without databases like 
mysql. It may work, but hard for later data management.
1) and 2) You can use mysql as main storage, and pull data out to create 
Lucene indexes. Pay attention to incremental changes. It's a continuous 
process, not one-time data import. Or you would have to put a hook in 
your program to write new content to the index. Anyway, you can get it 
work, but maybe not as simple as you expected.
