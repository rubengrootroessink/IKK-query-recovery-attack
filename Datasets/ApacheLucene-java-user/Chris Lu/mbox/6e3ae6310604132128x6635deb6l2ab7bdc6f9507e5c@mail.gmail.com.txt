I don't want to advertise DBSight there to polute the mailing list.
But this recurring lucene database question often comes out. So here
is the reply. And Tony, these questions you can contact us directly
later.

What you asked is exactly what DBSight does. And all you need to do to
get it up and running is to write simply SQL selects.

Your main table is a fact table, formed a list of Documents in
Lucene's term. You write your SQL to select all main table records,
and other SQLs to retreive data from all other lookup tables. DBSight
will retrieve all the data, create an lucene index.

Check the step by step example and you will understand more.

And you can use DBSight to schedule data sync, configure search result
templates, and much more. That's another story.

It's easier to have DBSight setup, create your index, have your
content website up and running like Google or Yahoo search, than
reading all the marketing materials.

Faster to setup than reading marketing materials.
