SUBJECT: Re: How does Lucene compare to Dieselpoint?
DATE: 16 Dec 2005

Lucene is more like an engine, while Dieselpoint is more like a car.
AFAIK, Dieselpoint is doing database search, but not using Lucene.

You are welcome to try DBSight, which crawls database in a
customizable way and uses Lucene. You can set it up quickly and see if
Lucene fit your performance and functionality needs.
