SUBJECT: Re: How to use Lucene to suppot quick search on huge databases where the primary content is of non textual format ?
DATE: 9 Nov 2009

If all you do is exact match, you can create non-unique indexes on 
columns, or functional indexes.

If the database index is optimal, there should not be much performance 
difference between database approach vs Lucene approach.

Lucene's inverted index is just one kind of data structure for quick 
data access. For your exact matching, it may not help much.
Creating and maintaining Lucene index is surely more coding than create 
a database index though.
