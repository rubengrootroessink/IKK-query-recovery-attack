DATE: 25 Aug 2006

Performance wise, Lucene search is much faster for full-text search.
If you only do "Employee ID" search, or exact match of Names,
database's search can do a good job already.

If it's regarding the index maintenance, you should have a updated_at
column for each record, and select the latest records out. And do an
"update" to the index periodically.

the database and the index updated. I have created a Lucene index, and the size is around
0.5 GB.
