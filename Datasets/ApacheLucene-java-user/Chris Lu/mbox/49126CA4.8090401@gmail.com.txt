SUBJECT: Re: Can lucene search from multi-index directory like using FK in database?
DATE: 6 Nov 2008

These are common problems. In general, mapping database tables into 
Lucene Documents is not always good for performance. You may need to 
flatten objects to fit Lucene's shoes.

My answers are here respectively.

1. You have two alternatives here:
    1) create an index to contain both User and Field Location 
information. This is more efficient, but you will need to create a new 
index structure. But Lucene is just an "index", do not use it to mimic 
database structure.
    2) use your "terrible way" to retrieve department_id first, then to 
get the user_ids. This approach may not be that bad, although less 
performant.

2. You will need to create a little query parser to distribute words 
into two fields.
