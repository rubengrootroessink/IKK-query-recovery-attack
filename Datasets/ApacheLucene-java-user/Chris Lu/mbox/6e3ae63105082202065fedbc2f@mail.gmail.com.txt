1. storing index in database will definitely slow down the search,
using JDBCDirectory only.
2. You can try to read the index from database into RAMDirectory

What do you mean by "good-design"? You dislike filesystem? :)
I guess you don't want to have several copies of index when your
system grows. In that case, you can have one server dedicated for
indexing and searching.

This is what DBSight is doing.

Now i'm indexing it without any problem using lucene with FSDirectory. But the use of files
in j2ee app is not a "good-design" choice. So i was thinking in store index in database (using
JDBCDirectory, for instance) but i cannot find references to this approach online, seems that
nobody use it.

to store the index?
