Thanks!

I need to use fields both indexes to calculate a final ranking.

For example, one index is for the major content, the other index has
the frequently-updated vote/score/popularity information.

Like you said, the ParallelIndex seems too much hassle to maintain. It
could be simple if I store those extra information somewhere else and
use them to calculate the ranking directly.

Would  it be possible to explore solutions that may work for your specific case?
