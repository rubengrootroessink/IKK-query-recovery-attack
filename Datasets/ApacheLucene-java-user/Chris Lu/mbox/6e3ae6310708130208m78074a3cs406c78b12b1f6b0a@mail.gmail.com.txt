Hi, Rohit,

You need to create index reader in the sub directory where you created
the index files. Lucene's IndexReader won't find your index if you
simply move the index to a sub directory.

Yes, if you have several index directory, you need to combine them
together. But you can achieve this by using MultiReader.
