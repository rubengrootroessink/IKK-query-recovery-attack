DATE: 26 Feb 2007

Hi, Nicolas,

Just a note: Having one searcher is far enough for ordinary usage,
even some production sites. But I do see some throughput gain through
increasing the number of searchers.

Those searchers should either be opened on an static index, or be
synchronized to open/close cleanly, to avoid any exceptions.
