Another great write up!

One more question, "100 millions of possible locations." looks large.
But 500Kb is relatively small compared to Lucene's capability. And I
believe the performance difference between Lucene and MySql, or
others, are much obvious at 1GB~10GB level. I heard numbers like 10x
faster.

Is it possible to get numbers in that range?
