Thanks. Not really trying to sell DBSight here since most people here 
are Lucene experts.
Just to confirm that this "challenge" has been done via Lucene for quite 
a while.

The technique for it is very similar to how facet search is done, which 
has several ways also.
Million's of rows are not really "that" big when everything is properly 
warmed up.
