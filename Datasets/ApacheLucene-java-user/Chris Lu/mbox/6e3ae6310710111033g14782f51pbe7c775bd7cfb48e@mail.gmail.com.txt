SUBJECT: Re: indexing on NAS
DATE: 11 Oct 2007

I have used Lucene on SAN in a federal project, works out great. It supports
search clustering, where several other servers search on the shared index
which is produced by another server. Only need to refresh the other
searching servers' IndexSearcher after indexing is done.
