For your date interval search requirement, Lucene can do range search.
You need to use ConstantScoreRangeQuery for better performance.

You'd better select all your additional attributes into the lucene
document. This will lead to some data duplications, especially look up
values. But it's a tradeoff for faster response and not really a
problem.
