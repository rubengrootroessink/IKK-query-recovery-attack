If you mean you want a jdbc driver that you can send
 "select * from lucene_index1 where name like '%abc%' "

This would require the jdbc driver to translate SQL into Lucene query. An
interesting idea, but never seen that before. The reason is that although
look similar, SQL and Lucene query are quite different.
