Basically you need to separate your web app from your searching, for a
scalable solution. Searching is a different concern. You can develop more
kinds of search when new requirement comes in.

Technorati's way is very similar to one of DBSight configuration. One
machine is dedicated for indexing, and one or several other machines are
dedicated for searching. Searching nodes subscribe to the indexing node.
Transferring the index is pretty quick. This way scales well.

  (Database)=crawl=>(Indexing node)=replicating index=>(Searching
nodes)==>end user query

However, if your index is huge, you may need to change your index structure
to split indexing nodes into several, and one Indexing node only serves one
specific kind of index. This is kind of vertically slicing the index and
scale it.
