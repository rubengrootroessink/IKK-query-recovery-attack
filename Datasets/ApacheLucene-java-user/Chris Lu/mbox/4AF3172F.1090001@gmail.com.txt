Shahid, As Ian described, for one-to-many relationships, you need to 
flatten the relationship and store it into Documents.

It's not efficient to search for Articles, and then based on the results 
to search for related groups.
The database "good" 3NF model does not apply to Lucene for performance 
reason.
