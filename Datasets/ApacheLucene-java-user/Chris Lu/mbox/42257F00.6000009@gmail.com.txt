SUBJECT: warm up lucene, especially sort by cache

1. Need an efficient way to pick up the most frequent words in an index.
    I think this can be done, any example will be appreciated.
2. search by the most freqent words, with sort by options

Is this the only way to warm up lucene? For large indexes, the first 
sort-by search is slow.

Chris
