DATE: 24 Apr 2007

For those who may be interested,

DBSight 1.4.0 now has unlimited index size with Free version!

Basically DBSight is more like SOLR + database adapter. You just point
it with one or several SQLs to any database, and you can have Lucene
search!

It has Incremental Indexing, Recreating Index, Synchronize index with
deleted database records, in addition to facet search, multi-server
mode clustering. All can be done just by mouse clicking instead of
coding java.

Here is a video on how to create Lucene Database Search in 3 minutes:
