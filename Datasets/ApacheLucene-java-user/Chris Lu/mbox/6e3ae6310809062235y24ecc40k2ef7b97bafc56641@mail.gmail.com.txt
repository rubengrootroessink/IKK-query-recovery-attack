SUBJECT: memory leak during Lucene Search
DATE: 7 Sep 2008

Unless my understanding is wrong, there is a memory leak for Lucene search
from Lucene-1195.(svn r659602, May23,2008)

This patch brings in a ThreadLocal cache to TermInfosReader.

It's usually recommended to keep the reader open, and reuse it when
possible. In a common J2EE application, the http requests are usually
handled by different threads. But since the cache is ThreadLocal, the cache
are not really usable by other threads. What's worse, the cache can not be
cleared by another thread!

This leak is not so obvious usually. But my case is using RAMDirectory,
having several hundred megabytes. So one un-released resource is obvious to
me.

Here is the reference tree:
org.apache.lucene.store.RAMDirectory
  |- directory of org.apache.lucene.store.RAMFile
      |- file of org.apache.lucene.store.RAMInputStream
          |- base of org.apache.lucene.index.CompoundFileReader$CSIndexInput
              |- input of org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentTermEnum
                  |- value of java.lang.ThreadLocal$ThreadLocalMap$Entry


After I switched back to svn revision 659601, right before this patch is
checked in, the memory leak is gone.
Although my case is RAMDirectory, I believe this will affect disk based
index also.
