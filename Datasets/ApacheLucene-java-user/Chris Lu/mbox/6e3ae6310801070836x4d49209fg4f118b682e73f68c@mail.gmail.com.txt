SUBJECT: Re: Using Lucene with Jarowinkler
DATE: 7 Jan 2008

Hi, Shivani,

For my understanding, Jarowinkler doesn't quite fit with Lucene's
structure. Calculating Jaro-Winkler distance for the query against
each word in the index is quite computational intensive.

What's possible may be using SoundEx, Metaphone, Double Metaphone,
etc, instead. For each word in the index, it can pre-calculate a value
for the query to match against.(which is how Analyzer works).
