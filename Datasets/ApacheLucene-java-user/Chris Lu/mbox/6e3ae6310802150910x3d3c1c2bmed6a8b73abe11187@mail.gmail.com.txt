Hi, lmctndi,

You can liberate yourself from this complicated schema, and use some
SQLs to select out the content and put the data into one Lucene index.

You may need to avoid Hibernate Search here for your case, which limit
you to one way of organizing Lucene indexes. I do think this is where
DBSight comes to rescue (Note: I am developing it.), where you can
quickly and easily have one or several flexible index structures,
incremental indexing, time or other value based ranking, etc.
