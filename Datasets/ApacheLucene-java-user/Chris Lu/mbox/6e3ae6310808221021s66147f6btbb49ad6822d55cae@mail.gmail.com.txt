DATE: 22 Aug 2008

Actually there are many projects for Lucene + Database. Here is a list I
know:

* Hibernate Search
* Compass, (also Hibernate + Lucene)
* Solr + DataImportHandler (Searching + Crawler)
* DBSight, (Specific for database, closed source, but very customizable,
easy to setup)
* Browse Engine
