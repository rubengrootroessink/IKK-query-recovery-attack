A normal Lucene index should be able to handle it.

As long as no frequent insert/update, which can sometimes cause hiccups for
large indexes, one index is enough.

If your customer numbers keep growing, you will need to have one index for
each customer, which isn't that difficult really, especially your QPS is not
so demanding.
