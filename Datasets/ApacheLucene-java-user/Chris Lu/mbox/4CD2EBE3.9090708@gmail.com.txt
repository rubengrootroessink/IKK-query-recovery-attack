SUBJECT: Re: High frequency term for the searched query
DATE: 4 Nov 2010

After you get the query object, you can use IndexSearcher's function 
docFreq(), like this

final Set<Term> terms = new HashSet<Term>();
query = searcher.rewrite(query);
query.extractTerms(terms);
for(Term t : terms){
    int frequency = searcher.docFreq(t);
}
