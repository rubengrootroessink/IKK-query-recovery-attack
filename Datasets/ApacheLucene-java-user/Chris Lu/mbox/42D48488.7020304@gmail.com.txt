DATE: 13 Jul 2005

Please allow me to intraduce DBSight.
It's based on Lucene, oriented for Any database search.

Most of the things are done by web UI. No coding is needed to create 
your search.
check out this demo.  http://search.dbsight.com

It's free to download and test. Free for developer edition, non-profit 
usage.
