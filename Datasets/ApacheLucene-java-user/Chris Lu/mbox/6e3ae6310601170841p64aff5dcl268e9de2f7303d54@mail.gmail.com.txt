SUBJECT: Re: Why we use Lucene for Database search like Oracle / Sybase ?
DATE: 17 Jan 2006

1) Because database mainly uses B-tree to index records' some columns.
Lucene or other full text search software uses to analyze the content
of each document and saved to inverted index. "Lucene's index falls
into the family of indexes known as an inverted index. This is because
it can list, for a term, the documents that contain it. This is the
inverse of the natural relationship, in which documents list terms."

Oracle has it's full-text search, ultrasearch. But you need to pay a
lot extra for it.

2) It'll work. But that will lose the unique information for each
column. And you may want to assign different weight to each filed.
I(working for DBSight) recommend you to take a look at
http://www.DBSight.net. It will help you to understand Lucene with
databases better.
