Hi, Sachin,

If you like self-join, you may need to retrieve the data from the
second query and merge them into each Document object. Then you can do
the query in one shot. (it's redundant. but do not try to normalize
data in the index.)

Lucene is an index. Just like index in SQL database, which can only
support one way to query data efficiently. Lucene index can support
one of your query execution path fast. Different query may require
different index structure.
