Hi, Mike,

Thanks for your interest in DBSight!

The free version of DBSight should satisfy most of the common 
requirements. We could open source it if time is right.

There are many solutions for database and lucene, each has its own 
uniqueness.
DBSight starts from basic SQL, and just apply a little Lucene specific 
configuration and some ready-to-use scaffolding.
Compared to SOLR, DBSight's design is more like ruby-on-rails rather 
than a common web application.
