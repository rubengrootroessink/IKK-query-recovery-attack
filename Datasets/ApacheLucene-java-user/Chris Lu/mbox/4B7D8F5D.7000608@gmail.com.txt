SUBJECT: Re: Query about Query.ToString()
DATE: 18 Feb 2010

It's great that this is supported. I have 3 questions:

1) XML query parser just focuses on the "difficult" queries, left the 
"simple" ones to the standard query parser.
I think it'll be good to support all of the queries. Makes it easier to 
implement, rather than combine two different parser together.
2) Another side point is the lack of examples in the Javadoc. Currently 
I need to dig into the unit test part to find some examples.
3) Can this be "standardized" into Lucene trunk? Is it possible to 
support other serialization forms, like google protocol buffer? 
Hopefully I only need to serialize it via query.toXML() or 
query.toBytes()  and the parser can recognize the serialized forms.

to the regular Lucene QueryParser. It would be easy to add XML tags for these types but these
clauses tend to be provided by users anyway as part of free-text fields. The other XML syntax
tends to be useful for capturing all the other structured input eg date ranges, checkboxes
etc as filters or caches filters.
