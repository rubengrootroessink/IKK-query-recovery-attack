SUBJECT: follow up of Lucene out of memory with RAMDirectory on J2EE environment
DATE: 10 Sep 2008

This usually happens on J2EE environment, if you use RAMDirectory.
Before Lucene-1195.(svn r659602, May23,2008), if you close() RAMDirectory,
the resources will be released right away.

After Lucene-1195.(svn r659602, May23,2008),If you simply close() the
RAMDirectory, there will be an undetermined(and uncontrollable) time before
the RAMDirectory resources are released.
So if you want to avoid it, you will need to use re-open() function instead
of close() and open(), according to lucene developers.

I haven't tried the re-open approach, but instead I downgrade to the svn
version before the patch.
In the previous version, close() means close(), not a delayed close().

Before Lucene developers are willing to fix this, I will have to manually
remove Lucene-1195 myself if an upgrade is needed.

If you also want this to be fixed, you can join the ongoing discussion to
support it on java-dev @lucene.apache.org mailing list.
