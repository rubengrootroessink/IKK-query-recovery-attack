SUBJECT: how to detect index integrity?
DATE: 19 Mar 2005

Hi,

Is there any way to detect the index's integrity?
Sometimes I came upon exceptions like these. If it happens, my only way 
is to delete the corrupted index.

    * Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException : read past EOF
    * java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException



Being able to verify the index's integrity will prevent nightmare like
