SUBJECT: Re: Can Lucene be Used To Substitute Real Database?
DATE: 25 Oct 2005

First of all, just using Lucene to replace rdms is quite possible in
some specific cases.

In addition to updating and string/number issues, Lucene also lacks
many rdms functionalities. One of them is aggregation functions like
SUM(), or "group by".

Of course, in some case, you may be able to get around it by just
using Lucene's existing functionalities. But you will need to worry
about multi-threaded updating, Lucene index optimization, etc.
