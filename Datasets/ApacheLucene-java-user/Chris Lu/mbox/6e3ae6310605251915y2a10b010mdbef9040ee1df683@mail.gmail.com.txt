Solr is nice when you can change the existing enterprise applications,
extract content and post xml content to the server. But definately
still a lot of coding.

I would say DBSight is another alternative here. It has similar
architecture as Solr, but it crawls databases by configurable SQLs.
Only need to plug into any existing databases by JDBC, and it can fit
any schema. No xml, xslt efforts. Usually in 15 minutes you can have a
google-like search.
