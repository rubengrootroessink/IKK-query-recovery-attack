Hi, Erick,

I added ISOLatin1AccentFilter to FrenchAnalyzer following Samir's tip,
and it works great! And I think it's the right way to go. Problems
like "You have to store the data raw for display purposes if you want
the accents to show though" will go away since Analyzer already have
the original text and analyzed token mechanism built-in. And it's
pretty easy to do!

However, is there any special case that you have? Not really knowing
French, I only tested one word, "fenêtre", and it's analyzed into
"fenetre".
