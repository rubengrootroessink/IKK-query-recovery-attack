SUBJECT: JDBC proxy implementing Lucene?
DATE: 8 Aug 2005

Hi, Just an idea to make Lucene work with databases more easily.

When I communicated with Shay Banon(Compass' author), it came to me
that maybe Lucene can be wrapped around JDBC drivers. Let's say it's
L-JDBC.

So whenever an object is stored through JDBC, according to some XML
configuration file, L-JDBC can index the updated object/document, or
delete it from the index.

Basically make Lucene indexing transparent to new/existing applications.

Not really a super idea. I am wondering anyone will find it helpful?
