SUBJECT: DBSight, search on database by Lucene
DATE: 11 Jun 2005

Hello Lucene developers,

I would like to introduce myself and say thanks to Lucene contributors
and this mailing list.
We have just released DBSight 1.0, which is a J2EE application that can
create a search engine on any relational database.

You can build a vertical search website within hours if your data is in
a JDBC-enabled database.

To demonstrate the search capability, DBSight created a demo search
on 1.7 million CD albums information by freedb.org provided data.
http://search.dbsight.com/

DBSight is a highly configurable platform to create search.
It can crawl your database, create indexes, display search results.
You can customize most of the components, and manage the indexes -- all 
by web interface.

DBSight is built with Lucene for searching, JDBC for crawling, and 
Velocity for rendering.

Will this qualify DBSight to be listed on "Powered By Lucene" wiki page?

Here is a step by step tutorial on how the demo search is created.
