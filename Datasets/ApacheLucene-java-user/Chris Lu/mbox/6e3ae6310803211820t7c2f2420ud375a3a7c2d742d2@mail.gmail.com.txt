SUBJECT: factor in stopwords when searching
DATE: 22 Mar 2008

Let's say "the" is considered stopword. And for example two documents are
document A, content: "... search the database..."
document B, content: "... search database..."

So when the user's input is "search the database", searching with
query content:"search database"~1 can return both.
But is there any way to translate that into a query that can rank the
document A higher than document B?

Thanks!
