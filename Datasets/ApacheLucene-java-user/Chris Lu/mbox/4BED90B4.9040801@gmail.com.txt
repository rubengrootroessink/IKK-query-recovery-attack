SUBJECT: Re: Will doc ids ever change if nothing is deleted?
DATE: 14 May 2010

The doc id will get changed if the segments are merged. The doc id is 
more depending on the order of documents being added.

Just think about it. The doc ids are starting from 0 to N. And when some 
documents are deleted, they are marked deleted on .del file. So no 
change there. When some documents are added, the id is N+1.

Of course, if some documents from other segments are merged. The 
documents in one segment will "lose" its doc id.
