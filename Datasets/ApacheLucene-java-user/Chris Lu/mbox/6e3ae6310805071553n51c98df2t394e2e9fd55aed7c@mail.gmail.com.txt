SUBJECT: how to change the segment file names
DATE: 7 May 2008

Currently, segment file names all start with _0, and increase with each new
segment created. But seems there is no easy way to change the segment file
names.

This causes trouble when copying one index to another index's directory, if
the .cfs files have the same name.

How to change the segmant file names after it's built?
Or, how to set a different starting counter for the segment file names?

Thanks!
