SUBJECT: Re: follow up of Lucene out of memory with RAMDirectory on J2EE environment
DATE: 14 Sep 2008

Just confirmed the fix for this problem is ready in patch
LUCENE-1383<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1383>

Thanks Robert Engels for arguing with me and understand the problem quickly,
and contributed a ClosableThreadLocal class, although the problem itself is
hard to reproduce for him, and thanks Michael McCandless for fixing the
problem soooo quickly.
