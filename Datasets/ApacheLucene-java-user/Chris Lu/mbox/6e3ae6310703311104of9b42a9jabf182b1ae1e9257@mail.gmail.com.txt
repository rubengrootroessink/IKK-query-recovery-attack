SUBJECT: Re: how to index a large database
DATE: 31 Mar 2007

Mohammad,

This is the main idea, but things can get quite complicated.

In addition, do you need to do incremental indexing?
Do you need to delete duplicates?
How would you manage deleted documents in the database?
Will taking down the server while indexing affect you?
...

You are welcome to take a look at DBSight.
Here is a demo that you can create a scalable lucene database search
in 3 minutes.
