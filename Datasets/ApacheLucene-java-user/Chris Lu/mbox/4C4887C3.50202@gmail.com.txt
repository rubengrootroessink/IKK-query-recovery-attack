You can either
1) create one index for each database, and merge the results during search.
2) create the 2 indexes individually and merge them
3) merge records during SQL select.

The 1) approach should be easy to scale linearly as your database grows.
You can even distribute the indexes onto several boxes and achieve 
sharded search.
