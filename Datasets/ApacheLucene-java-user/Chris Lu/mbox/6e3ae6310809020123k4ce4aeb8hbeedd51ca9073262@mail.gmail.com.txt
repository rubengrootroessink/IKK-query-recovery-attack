SUBJECT: search for empty field?
DATE: 2 Sep 2008

Is it possible to query for documents that have empty values for a field?

Say need to find documents with category empty, I tried negative query:
 -category:*
But it returns 0 document. I think "category:*" is basically match all, so
this "-category:*" doesn't work.

Thanks!
