I may not know more than most people. But to index databases and run
periodically, you need a server instead of a simple API.
And you need to take care of notifying the searcher when you have new
index created if you want to cache the searcher for high performance.

I welcome you to take a look at DBSight.net
It's meant to help rapidly add a google-like search for any database
content, for any new/existing websites.
