SUBJECT: Re: Modelling relational data in Lucene Index?
DATE: 3 Nov 2006

For this specific question, you can create index on files, search
files that of type image, and from matched files, find the unique
directories(can be done in lucene or you can do it via java).

Of course this does not scale to deeper relationships. Usually you do
need to flattern the database objects in order to use lucene. It's
just trading space for speed.

I would prefer a detached approach instead of Hibernate or EJB's
approach, which is kind of too tightly coupled with any system. How to
rebuild if the index is corrupted, or you have a new Analyzer, or
schema evolves? How to make it multi-thread safe?
