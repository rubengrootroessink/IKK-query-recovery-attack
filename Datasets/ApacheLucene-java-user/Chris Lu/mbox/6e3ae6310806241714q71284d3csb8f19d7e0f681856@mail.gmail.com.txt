SUBJECT: lucene query parser for double-worded term query
DATE: 25 Jun 2008

Hi,

I have a tags field. And each tag can have multiple words, like "San
Francisco". Each tag is analyzed into Keyword field like this
 new Field("tags", "San Francisco",Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED)

It should be searchable if using TermQuery directly, like
  new TermQuery(new Term("tags", "San Francisco"))

But how to achieve this via Lucene Query Parser? If using
 tags:"San Francisco"
It's considered a phrase, and turned into term search of tags:San and
tags:Francisco, which will not return results.

Thanks for any advice!
