SUBJECT: Re: Virtually merge two indexes?
DATE: 26 Mar 2007

Thanks Chris Hostetter!

More questions:

1. When I use setBoost for document in index C, will that be counted in?

2. Does index A allow any deletion at all? If index A has some
deletions, I suppose index C should also delete those after
optimizing? But which deletion takes precedence?

3. If index A use compound file format, I suppose index C should also
be the same. When optimizing during creating the compound file, the
ordering will not be changed?

I am also interested to know any real production usage of ParallelReader.
