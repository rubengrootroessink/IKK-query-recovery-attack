SUBJECT: Re: Full text searching on documents saved in database as BLOB
DATE: 1 Dec 2006

Lucene can work for this case, in case you can extract data out in
plain text format. So whether your data is in BLOB or on file disk
does not really matter, but you need to detect or tell what type of
BLOB content it is, either by filename or binary format.

Usually when storing BLOB content, there will be another column
storing the filename. Based on the filename extension, you can map to
a corresponding extracting API, for pdf, word doc, etc. The database
search software I am working on, DBSight, uses this method.
