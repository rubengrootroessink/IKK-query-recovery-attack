Mark,

This is really good stuff! 
I have been thinking about it for a long while.
Thank you for showing us the door!

Basically your lucene_query function will return a true/false in one
of the query predicates for each record.
This will be very useful when other query predicates can filter out a
lot of records.

Is there any hint to give DB to use the lucene_query function last?
