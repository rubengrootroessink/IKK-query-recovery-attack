SUBJECT: Re: How to make a query that associates 2 index files
DATE: 6 May 2008

No easy way unless you merge your 2 indexes into:

Index:      [who]    [accessed]   [key]          [content]


            David    1/1/2007     Abc            "blah blah 123 ..."

            Someone  1/2/2005     Abc            "blah blah 123 ..."

            Guess    12/1/2000    Xyz            "123 321 a nice day ..."

            Harry    1/1/2008     Abc            "blah blah 123 ..."

            Sandra   1/1/2003     Xyz            "123 321 a nice day ..."


Anyway, Lucene index is more like Database Index. It's only efficient for
particular query execution paths.
If you have special requirements, you will have to re-structure your index
for performance.
