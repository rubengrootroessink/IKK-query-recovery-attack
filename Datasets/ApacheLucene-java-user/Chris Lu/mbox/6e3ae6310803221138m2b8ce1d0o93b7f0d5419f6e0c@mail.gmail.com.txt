SUBJECT: Re: factor in stopwords when searching
DATE: 22 Mar 2008

This is asked by some customer, who may not know what's "stop words" at all.

Jake's approach should be quite similar to what some search engine
companies are doing. It'll cost some storage, but can achieve a good
user experience.

The benefit is kind of obvious in real world. When users enter some
query, they do not really know stop words like "the" are not in the
index at all.
If they are looking for something, like a book titled "search the
database", other books like "search database" is ranked top, which is
not a good user experience.
