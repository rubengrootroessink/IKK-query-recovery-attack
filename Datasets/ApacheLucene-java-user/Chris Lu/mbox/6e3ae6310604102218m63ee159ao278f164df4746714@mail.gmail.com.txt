SUBJECT: Re: full text search using Lucene
DATE: 11 Apr 2006

Hi, Tony,

DBSight, like SearchBlox, Nutch, Solr, is using Lcuene to search. It
just makes it super easy and flexible to create a search on any
databases. Lucene's implementation is far more superior and flexible
to MySql's full text search.

Try it and you will know what I am talking about. Actually, I think
it'll be faster to setup DBSight, have it running, see the results,
than reading through marketing materials. :)

Right now, no funding for us. We need to sell it at a meager price.
Otherwise, we would be very willing to donate it to open source.
