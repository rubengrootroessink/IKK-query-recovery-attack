DATE: 30 Sep 2005

We have a product, DBSight, just to extract database content and
render search results. DB2 is one of the supported databases.
Many features can be found on the website.

For your case, DBSight can easily select all your data you needed and
create an index to search on.
At least you can very quickly to get it running.

Let us know the performance difference you experienced, DB2 Text
Extender vs. Lucene.

We would use Lucene Search Engine instead of DB2 Text Extender. I would like to get some more
information about how/best way to implement Lucene Search on DB2.
