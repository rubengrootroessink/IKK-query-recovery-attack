DATE: 28 Sep 2006

I like the approach in your second point. But I have doubt on the first point.

For a production level index, usually pretty big, freqent close/reopen
the searcher may not be fast enough, especially when you want to cache
sorting. It's better to keep the searchers open. But when the indexing
process is going on, the files are changing. The searcher's segment
information will be outdated and read EOF exceptions will happen.

So for a big index, it's better to keep two copies of index, one for
searching, one for indexing. And hot-swapping them when indexing is
done. This is what we did in DBSight. No read EOF exceptions or
corrupted indexes any more.
