SUBJECT: Determine the index of a hit after using MultiSearcher
DATE: 29 Nov 2005

Hello,

I am searching over multiple indices using MultiSearcher. Thus I get hits
from various indices. Is it possible to determine from which index a hit
comes?

The solution I found is to store the index in a document's field, but this
causes some overhead. I would like to find another solution.

Thank you for having read this!

Peter
