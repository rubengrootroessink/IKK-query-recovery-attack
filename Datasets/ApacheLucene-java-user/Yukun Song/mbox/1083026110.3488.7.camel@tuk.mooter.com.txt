SUBJECT: need info for database based Lucene but not flat file
DATE: 27 Apr 2004

As known, currently Lucene uses flat file to store information for
indexing. 

Any people has idea or resources for combining database (Like MySQL or
PostreSQL) and Lucene instead of current flat index file formats?

Regards,

Yukun Song
