The possible merge bug notwithstanding, let's take a step back in 
abstraction:  are you sure the relatively-complex iterative merge 
process you've described buys you anything over a simple 
backup-the-whole-index approach?  Or a 
backup-the-source-data-and-reindex approach?

Merging is I/O intensive, and the scheme you've outlined is re-reading 
and re-writing all the index data several times anyway -- it might not 
be saving you much over a full reindex.  Since the scenario you're 
trying to protect against is a very rare occurrence (so far at least), 
would it be better to spend your development time on improving the 
application than devising (and debugging, and testing, ...) a 
complicated backup and recovery scheme?
