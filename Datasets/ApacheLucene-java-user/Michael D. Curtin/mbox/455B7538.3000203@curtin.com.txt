It seems that you really do want a custom statistical analysis of the hit 
documents, an analysis that is specific not just to the hits, but to the query 
as well.  I don't think there's anything built into Lucene to do this for you.

Have you run getTermFreqVector(), with representative data and query, to see 
what its performance actually turns out to be?
