The term "function" is different from the term "function()", so a 
literal search for one won't find the other.  Your Analyzer could emit 
two tokens for the input "function()":  "function" and "function()", at 
the same position (increment 0) if that's what you want.

do I still need to escape the indexed values, e.g. keyword values, and store them in the escaped
fashion, e.g. function\() -- or is function() ok?

Don't escape them at index time, only at search time.

Good luck!
