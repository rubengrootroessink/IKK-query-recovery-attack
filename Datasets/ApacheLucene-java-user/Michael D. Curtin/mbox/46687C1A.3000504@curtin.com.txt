Weird.  The definition seems to allow expressions of the form 
A-B-C-D-E-..., where
-   "-" can be one of the five characters you mentioned
-   the A, B, C, ... are alphanumeric pseudo-words
-   A, C, E, ... or B, D, F, ... must have digits, i.e. alternating
     digit components
So "A-1-B-2" and "1-A-2-B" would be kept as single tokens, but "A-B-1-2" 
would not.  Seems more than a little hokey, but I suppose it's been 
working for a long time, for the most part.
