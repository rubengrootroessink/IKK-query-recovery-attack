The syntax that Lucene's QueryParser supports isn't very complicated. 
I'm sure you could write your own parser from scratch, perhaps with some 
syntactic construct that identifies a "normal" Lucene (sub)query and 
passes that part to QueryParser.

The hard part, I wager, will be coming up with a syntax that does all 
you want, is easy to understand, and doesn't conflict with the goal of 
keeping the simple queries simple...

Good luck!
