I think you'll need to put the three ID-based TermQuerys into a 
sub-BooleanQuery instead of the top-level query.  Something like this:

BooleanQuery subquery = new BooleanQuery();
subquery.add(term1, BooleanClause.Occur.Should);
subquery.add(term2, BooleanClause.Occur.Should);
subquery.add(term3, BooleanClause.Occur.Should);
query.add(subquery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);

Good luck!
