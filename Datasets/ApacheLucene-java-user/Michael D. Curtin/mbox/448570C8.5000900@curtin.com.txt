Not sure if I understand exactly what you want to do, but would the 
"<field>:<keyword>" syntax that QueryParser understands work for you?  That 
is, you could send query text like

     f1:foo f2:foo f3:foo

to search for "foo" in any of the 3 fields.  If you need boolean capabilities 
you can use parentheses, like so:

     +(f1:foo f2:foo f3:foo) +(f1:bar f2:bar f3:bar)

to mean "foo in some field, and bar in some field", or

     +(f1:foo f1:bar) +(f2:foo f2:bar) +(f3:foo f3:bar)

"foo or bar in all fields".

Would this work for ya?
