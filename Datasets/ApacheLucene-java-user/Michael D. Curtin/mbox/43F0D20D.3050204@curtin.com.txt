Now that it's already in 1 index, I'm afraid you can't just delete a few 
files.  On the other hand, if it's only a one-time thing, reindexing with only 
the docs you want shouldn't be too bad.  If you think you might ever need to 
perform such a cull again, you might make several distinct indexes (one per 
day, per week, per whatever) during that reindexing so the next time will be 
much easier.

Good luck!
