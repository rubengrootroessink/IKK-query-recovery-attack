A back of the envelope calculation:
     8GB / 2M docs = 4KB per doc, on avg
                   / 5 B per word, on avg = 800 words per doc, on avg

So, each query is a quarter to half the size of the average document.  I 
suspect that just about every query is hitting almost every document in 
the db, i.e. the queries are not very selective at all.  That's going to 
be slow, no two ways about it.

Could you tell us a bit more about the db and what your application is 
looking for in it, at a higher level of abstraction?
