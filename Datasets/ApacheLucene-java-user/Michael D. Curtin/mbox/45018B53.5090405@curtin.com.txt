If your question is why are the queries
	'(field:software field:engineer)'
and
	'(+field:software +field:engineer)'
returning the same results, it could be because none of your documents have 
*only* "software" *or* "engineer", i.e. they all have both words or neither. 
You could test this theory with a db containing only the 4 documents below 
(one per line):

other unrelated words
the software
the engineer
the software engineer

Good luck!
