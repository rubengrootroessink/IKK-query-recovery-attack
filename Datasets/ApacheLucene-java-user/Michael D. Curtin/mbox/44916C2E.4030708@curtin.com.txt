I don't know about "smarter", but it seems like separating (parsing) out the 
username from the hostname in the email addresses, into separate fields at 
index time, would get you want you want.  If you want documents to, cc, or 
from "james" from any domain, then the query
	"touser:james ccuser:james fromuser:james"
would work.  If you were looking for a specific sender at a specific site, 
then the query
	"+fromuser:james +fromhost:foo.com"
would work.

Good luck!
