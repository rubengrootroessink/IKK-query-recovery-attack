I have to index many documents with the same fields (only one or two
fields are different). Can I add a field (Field instance) to many
documents? It seams to work but I'm not sure if this is the right way...

What does "many" mean in this context?  If it means "most", or "all", 
perhaps it would be better not to index those fields at all -- they 
would be adding little or nothing, in terms of information content.
