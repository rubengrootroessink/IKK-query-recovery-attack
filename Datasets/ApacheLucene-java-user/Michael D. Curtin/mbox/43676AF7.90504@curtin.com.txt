What I have done in a case like this is short-circuit the search for an 
empty query and just read the documents out of the index, in order. 
That is, I don't really run a search in this case.  It's only a few 
lines of extra code, and you don't have to retrieve every document in 
the index until you need them.  Using a workaround query as in your 
example causes Lucene to examine every document in the index before 
returning you any.  Good luck!
