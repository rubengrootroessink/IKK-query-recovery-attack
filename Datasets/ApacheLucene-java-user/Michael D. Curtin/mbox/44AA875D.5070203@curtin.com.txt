For this part, I recommend using a working table to hold the IDs that result 
from your Lucene search, then use a join instead of the IN operator in your 
SQL query.  Oracle/Sybase/SQLServer all have array capabilities in their APIs 
that make an insertion of a 1000 integers pretty darn fast, so I'm guessing 
that MySQL has such a thing too.

Good luck!
