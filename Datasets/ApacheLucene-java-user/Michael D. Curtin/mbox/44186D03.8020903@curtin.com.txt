This doesn't sound like a Lucene problem, at least the way you've described 
it.  For example, Lucene can't search on any field that isn't indexed (and 
most of yours aren't indexed).

Given that, it seems like your option (c) is the way to go.  Seems like a 
simple RDBMS schema with 3 tables would do the trick:  Customers, Articles, 
and CustArt (or some other name munge) that notes which articles are for which 
customers.  If you use Oracle, there's even some sort of mechanism for serving 
up the XML files via SQL*NET, if you didn't want to have to provide for 
multiple types of connections between clients and server.

Good luck!
