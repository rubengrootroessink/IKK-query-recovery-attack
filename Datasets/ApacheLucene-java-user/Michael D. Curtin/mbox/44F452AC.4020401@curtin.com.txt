Whether it would make sense for your application or not is something I think 
you're going to have to decide yourself.  From your description, it sounds 
like it might be useful to have some of that additional information around later.

If so, how about adding a field or two to your Lucene index that store the 
additional facts?  You don't have to index them, if you don't intend to search 
based on them.  If you use an efficient encoding scheme, such fields might not 
add much to your disk usage either.

Good luck!
