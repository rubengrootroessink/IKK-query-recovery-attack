If there's nothing in the relational table that specifies the ordering, I'm 
afraid you've probably got similar problems in other places.  RDBMSes don't 
guarantee to return rows in the order they were INSERTed.  Sure, early in the 
life of a table that will tend to happen, but as DELETEs, then UPDATEs and new 
INSERTs get processed, the on-disk order tends to get pretty jumbled.  Note 
that I'm talking about anything that uses the results of your SELECT, not just 
your Lucene-related code.

If ordering of the rows is something your app needs, I recommend adding a 
column that is expressly for ordering.  A one-up integer or something like 
that.  I don't remember what the keyword in MySQL is for that, but I'm pretty 
sure there is one.  Then you can code all your SELECTs with an ORDER BY clause 
that does what you want.

Good luck!
