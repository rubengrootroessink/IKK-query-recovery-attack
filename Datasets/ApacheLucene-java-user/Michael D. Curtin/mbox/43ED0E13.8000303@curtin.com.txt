has an FS with blocks of only 1K in size (typically they are 4k or 8k, I believe), so I started
wondering what's better for Lucene - smaller or larger blocks?  I have a feeling 1K is too
small, although I don't know enough to back up this feeling. :(

On my system (dual Xeon with a couple 120GB S-ATA drives (not RAIDed), running 
Fedora Core 3) I changed BUFFER_SIZE in storage/OutputStream.java to 4096, 
achieving about 30% better performance in indexing.  The search improvement 
was smaller, enough smaller that it was on order what I thought my measurement 
error was.  I tried values up to 64K, but there wasn't much change on my 
system after 4K.
