 So 'work:' and 'work' query should still return same result.

anything :-(.   It seems to me the Lucene parser issue.... we are wondering if there is any
simple way to make the Lucene parser ignore the ":" in the query?

The StandardAnalyzer already strips out the colons from the indexed 
text, so all you need to do is get rid of them in the query.  Would

   String newquery = query.replace(query, ":", " ");

work?  It uses a space as the new text so that two query words that 
happened to be separated by the colon would still be separate words ...
