the query succeeds but what it finds is actually "function", not "function()".  If I run the
same query against "function { statement1, statement2 } it still succeeds and I get "function"
in best fragments.

I think you're going to have to write your own Analyzer subclass that 
keeps special characters in the terms.  Then, use that Analyzer during 
indexing.  The included Analyzers drop parentheses and the like.

If you're using Lucene's QueryParser, then use your new Analyzer there, 
too, and escape things like parentheses in the query text you submit to 
parse().

I think there's a discussion of custom Analyzers in the Lucene book, but 
I don't know where.  Maybe somebody else on this list knows???

Good luck!
