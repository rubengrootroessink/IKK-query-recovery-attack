Well, I looked everywhere I could think of for this contrib directory, with
no luck.  I ended up having to go install subversion on a separate machine
(I'm working on a HPUX machine that I don't control), check out the
sources, build them (by hand, since the machine doesn't have ant either)
and make my own tarball.  ugh.

This was much more difficult than it should have been, but at least I think
I got it working.
