Hi Eric,

uh.. maybe I'm being dense, but where exactly would I find this directory?
It seems that all of the mirrors I look at don't have it, nor even does the
main(?) url  (i.e. http://www.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/)

thanks.

yeah, I did, but all I found there was some info about a demo application,
a link to the aforementioned download directory, and some links to the
online sources through svn.

I'll take a closer look.  I just figured the best documentation would be on
the actual lucene site.

I was hoping to find an online overview of how things are supposed to work.
i.e. some thing that explains what the important classes are, how to use
them, etc..  Also a definition of vocabulary would be nice. 
Here's a just a brief selection of questions that I had (have) 
What is javacc?  Why do I care?  What is snowball?  What is a stemmer, and 
how/why would I use one.  What's a term vector?  What happens when you
add a the same field to a document twice?  How do I combine two queries?
(I figured some of these out, don't answer them now)

 I was able to pick out some info from the faq, but a lot of
that seems to assume you already know what you're doing.  I ended up
doing a lot of trial and error to get things going.

For instance, it took me forever just to figure out how to combine a couple 
of queries together.  The apparently appropriately named AndQuery class,
isn't what it seems, and the javadocs don't say anything that would point me
towards the correct class (which seems to be BooleanQuery)

I know much of what I just said is basically just complaining about the
level of documentation, and I'd be happy to help, but I'm still feeling
a bit overwhelmed with the amount of implied knowledge that seems
to be necessary, so picking out specific places is a bit difficult.

I suppose the most useful thing would be a better getting started guide
that actually explains how things work, rather than just saying "look at
this app".
