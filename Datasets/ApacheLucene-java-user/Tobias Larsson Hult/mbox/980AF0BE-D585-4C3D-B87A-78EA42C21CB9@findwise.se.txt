Thanks for the quick responses!

Good point about the warmup issues Erick, that's something we will  
consider. Good to know that this kind of setup has been proved working  
for at least one :) I think we will do a small setup and test the  
performance.

Thanks again for valuable input!

Best Regards
Tobias
