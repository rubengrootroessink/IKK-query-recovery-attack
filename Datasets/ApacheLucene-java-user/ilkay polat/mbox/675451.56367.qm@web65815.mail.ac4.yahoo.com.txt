Hi,
We have hardware restrictions(Max RAM can be  8GB). So, unfortunately,  increasing memory
can not be option for us for today's situation. 

Yes, as you said that problem is faced when goes to last pages of search screen because of
using search method which is find top n records. In other way, this is meaning "searching
all the thinngs returns all". 

I am now researching whether there is a way which consumes time instead of memory in this
search mechanism in lucene? Any other ideas? 

Thanks

Certainly it will. Either you need to increase your memory OR refine your
query. Eventhough you display paginated result. The first couple of pages
will display fine and going towards last may face problem. This is because,
200,000 objects is created and iterated, 190,900 objects are skipped and
last100 objects are returned. The memory is consumed in creating these
objects.
