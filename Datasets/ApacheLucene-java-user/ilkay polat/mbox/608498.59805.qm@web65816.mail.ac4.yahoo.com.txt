Indeed, this is  good solution to that kind of problems. But same problem can be  occured
in future when logs are added to index file. 
For example, here 200,000 records have problem(These logs are collected in 13 days). 
With that reverse way, there will be maximum search range is 100,000. 
But if there is 400,000 records same problem will be occured(Max search space is 200,000 again).

Is there another way which do not consume so much memory  or consume restrict memory and
consume time instead of memory. This restriction come from our project hardware restrictions(Hardware
memory is 8GB in maximum situation)?

Reverse the query sorting to display the last page.
