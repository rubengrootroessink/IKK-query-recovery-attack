SUBJECT: Unable to download Lucene source code
DATE: 8 Sep 2003


Hello,
 	I am unable to download the source code from any of the links on 
page
http://jakarta.apache.org/site/sourceindex.html
are these links working? I tried all the mirrors.

  Is there any other place on this website, where I can get the 
source code or Can anybody send me the zip files of source code by 
mail, if the size is not too big?

 	Kindly help me out.I am itching to provide 'Search facility' on 
my website and explore Lucene :-)

Thanks & Regards,
Rohit.
