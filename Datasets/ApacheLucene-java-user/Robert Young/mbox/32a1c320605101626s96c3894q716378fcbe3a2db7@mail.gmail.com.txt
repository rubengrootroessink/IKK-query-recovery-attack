Yes, I looked at the synonym sollution from Lucene in Action but, as
you point out, I have to know about it ahead of time. The only
sollution I've had so far is to index the term without the spaces as
well and then run two searches, one with spaces and one without. It
would work but it just seems like quite a ratty sollution.
