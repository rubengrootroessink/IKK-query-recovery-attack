SUBJECT: boosting querys closer to the current date
DATE: 16 Nov 2005






Providing that I have indexed documents with the following fields:

 Keyword:   lastmodifiedDate
 Unstored:  contents

And that I run a simple query only using just the contents field.

Is there anyway to change the way Lucene presents results, so documents
with a high score and lastmodifiedDate closer to today are presented first?
Note that I do not want to reverse sort by lastmodifiedDate, what I want is
to take the date into account in the scoring.

Regards,

Daniel
