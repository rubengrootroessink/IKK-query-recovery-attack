SUBJECT: Why there is no IndexWriter.deleteDocument(int docNum) method?
DATE: 16 Jan 2008

Hi!
I'm curious, is there any particular reason why Lucene offers
IndexReader.deleteDocument(int docNum) but not
IndexWriter.deleteDocument(int docNum)?

Rather typical (I think) potential use case:

for (int i = 0; i < indexReader.maxDoc(); ++i) {
  if (!indexReader.isDeleted(i)) {
    Document doc = indexReader.document(i);
    if (/* some criteria to delete document */) {
      indexWriter.deleteDocument(i);
    }
  }
}

One can say that it is possible to do the same currently using IndexReader
but it is not true if at the same time index is opened by IndexWriter (and
if index is frequently updated this is its normal state).

        Alexei
