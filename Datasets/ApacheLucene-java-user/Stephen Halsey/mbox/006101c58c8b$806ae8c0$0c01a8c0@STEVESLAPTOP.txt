Hi,

I'm just writing to ask if you know if the the change discussed below is likely to be in the
next version of Lucene as a default for StopFilter.   I'm happy to apply the diff supplied
by Mike Barry on my own source code to stop "climate control" matching "climate of control",
but if its likely to go into the new version soon I'll hold off and and download that.

thanks a lot

Stephen Halsey

  Making it optional is ok by me, though I'm curious about a use case  
  that would prefer it the way it is now.  Searching for "lucene in  
  action" and having it match documents with "lucene action" in them  
  seems awkward to me in a precision context.  Google allows  
  wildcarding of words with an asterisk:

       <http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=%22lucene+* 
  +action%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8>

  Erik
