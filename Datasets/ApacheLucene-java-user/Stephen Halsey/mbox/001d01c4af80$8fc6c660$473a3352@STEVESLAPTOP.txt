Hi Doug,

Thanks for your email and sorry for not trying 1.4.2 before emailing in.  It works great since
trying the latest version and I now have a fully working test program which regenerates the
Searcher object in the background and then when that thread is finished any new searches use
the new Searcher object with the new Sort.  The searches stay fast even while regenerating
(as I give the background thread low priority) and the updates are reflected in the search
results at regular intervals.   There don't seem to be any memory leaks or anything either.
Thanks again for your help and next time will definately try latest version first :-)

Steve

  A number of bugs with the sorting code have been fixed since that 
  release.  Can you please try with 1.4.2 and see if you still have the 
  problem?  Thanks.
