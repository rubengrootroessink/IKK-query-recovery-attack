SUBJECT: Lucene search clusters
DATE: 7 Jun 2005

I'm writing this message trying to find some people interested in creating a 
'general purpose' lucene search results' clustering extension.
I wrote a simply implementation of clustering, and I would like to 
contribute to lucene development by releasing an open source clustering 
implementation. I know that maybe each project need a different 
implementation but that would be a useful basis for everyone to develop his 
own project.
Is anyone interested in it?
Lorenzo
