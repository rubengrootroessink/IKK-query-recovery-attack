SUBJECT: Re: Lucene search clusters
DATE: 8 Jun 2005

I see some noise about clustering and lucene, but I'm still waiting for 
someone that will help me creating a clustering extension.
I know both carrot2 and weka (the first can be integrated with Lucene, the 
latter may be - Falko can you tell me?) but would like to write something 
that could be included in the sandbox (or similar) with an implementation 
that we'll find the better for a general purpose environment. Maybe carrot2 
or other will be the best one (I really hope, I'm a lazy coder;-) ) and so 
we will simply ask David to extend his code, but first want to make some 
tests.
bye
