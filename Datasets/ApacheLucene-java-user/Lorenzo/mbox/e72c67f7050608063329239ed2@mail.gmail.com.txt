DATE: 8 Jun 2005

First, thanks for your reply.
I was wondering about adding some extra clustering functionalities to 
Lucene. I wrote a clustering engine, based on hac/ahc and k-means algorithms 
based on Lucene search results. That work is based on a customized solution, 
and so I decided to write some general code . Right now I'm looking at this 
class com/mwroblewski/carrot/filter/ahcfilter/AHCFilter from carrot2 and 
found it to be very similar to my work;-)
My aim is to provide some basic clustering functionalities to lucene search 
results. Carrot2 offers a lot of functionalities, like many inputs, I'm just 
trying to offer a simpler (much simpler!) clustering opportunity for lucene 
users.
Hope I can get some good advices from you!
ciao,
Lorenzo
