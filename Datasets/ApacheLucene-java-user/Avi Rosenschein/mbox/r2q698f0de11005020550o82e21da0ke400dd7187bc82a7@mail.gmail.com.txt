Hi Grant,

Sure. On http://wiki.answers.com/, we use search in a variety of
places and ways.

In the basic search box (what you get if you look stuff up in the main
Ask box on the home page), we generally want the relevancy matching to
be pretty fuzzy. For example, if the user looked up "Where can you see
photos of the Aurora Borealis effect?" I would still want to show them
"Where can you see photos of the Aurora Borealis?" as a match.

However, the advanced search page,
http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Special:Search, is used by advanced users to
filter questions by various facets and searches, and to them it is
important for the filter to filter out non-matches, since they use it
as a working page. For example, if they want to do a search for "Harry
Potter" and classify all results into the "Harry Potter" category, it
is important that not every match for "Harry" is returned.
