For scoring to take into account the non-analyzed token stream.

That is, if a field is analyzed (stemmed, lowercased, maybe even stop words
removed), that is fine for indexing. But tokens in the query matching the
original form could still get a higher score than those that only match when
analyzed.

Also, this would maybe allow a flexible, run-time, decision of what
analyzers to include. For example, I might want stemming turned on for
normal search, but not for a PhraseQuery.
