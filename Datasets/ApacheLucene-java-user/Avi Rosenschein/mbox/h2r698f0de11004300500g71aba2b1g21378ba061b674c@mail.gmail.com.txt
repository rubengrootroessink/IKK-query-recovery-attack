The idea is to get the relevancy to fail on a smaller and smaller percent of
the queries, as the corpus grows larger. Facets can definitely help, but
they don't solve the basic problem of search, when there is no facet for the
particular way the user is looking for something. The strength of search is
that it can help the user to find things even when other forms of navigation
fail.

Of course relevancy matters.... but it's only ONE of perhaps a three pronged

I would prefer to say that data quality can directly contribute to relevance
(besides being important for other reasons as well). Basically, search
relevancy is a combination of quality of data + quality of algorithm. In
general, they are both important, and data even has the potential to be more
important than algorithm, if you structure it right.

Also, tuning the algorithms to the users can be very important. For
instance, we have found that in a basic search functionality, the default
query parser operator OR works very well. But on a page for advanced users,
who want to very precisely tune their search results, a default of AND works
better.
