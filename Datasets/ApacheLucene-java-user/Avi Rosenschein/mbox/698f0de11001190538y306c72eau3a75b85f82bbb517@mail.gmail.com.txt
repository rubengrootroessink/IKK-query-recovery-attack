SUBJECT: Re: PhraseQuery with term positions
DATE: 19 Jan 2010

Index is pretty large (50GB, divided into 8 shards). I'm afraid I would
start running into memory issues by adding the stop words (though it is
definitely something I would like to test at some point).

My question was more to try to understand if this was known behavior in
lucene, since I can't really think of a situation where this would be
desired (maybe if the user was knowingly searching for "a
[one-word-wildcard] b"; but a better way to do that would be with slop, not
with term positions). Wouldn't it be better to have the ExactPhraseScorer
not allow unmatched holes (i.e. terms in the document that are not matched
in the query)?
