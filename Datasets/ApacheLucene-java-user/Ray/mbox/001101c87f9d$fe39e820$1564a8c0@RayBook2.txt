SUBJECT: MultiSearcher to overcome the Integer.MAX_VALUE limit
DATE: 6 Mar 2008

Hey Guys,

just a quick question to confirm an assumption I have.

Is it correct that I can have around 100 Indexes each at its
Integer.MAX_VALUE limit of documents, but can happily
search  them all with a MultiSearcher if all combined returned
hits don't add up to the Integer.MAX_VALUE themselves ?

Kind regards,

Ray.
