Thanks for your answer.

Well I want to search around  6 billion documents.
Most of them very small, but I am confident to be hitting
that number in the long run.

I am currently running a small random text indexer with 400 docs/second.
It will reach 2 billion in around 45 days.

I really hope you all who are saying 2 billion docs
will bring lucene to its knees are wrong... 

Ray.
