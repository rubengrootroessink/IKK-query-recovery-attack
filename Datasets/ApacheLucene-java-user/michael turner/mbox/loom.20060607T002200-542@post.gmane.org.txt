DATE: 6 Jun 2006

Hi Everyone!

Working on a project that requires a Search query similiar to what is 
seen on"amazon.com" in that after searching for and displaying an item, 
the system shows:

"Users that have searched for "AAAAA" AND "BBBBB" have also searched 
for "CCCC".

Where "BBBBB"  and   "CCCC" are other related entities.


1. Has anyone used or heard of this algorithm? 
2. Is Lucene capable of executing "learning searches"?
3. Is Lucene capable of executing suggested Searches?

Any assistance rendered would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
