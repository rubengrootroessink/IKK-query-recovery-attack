SUBJECT: Cleanup of partial merges?
DATE: 11 Jun 2003

Merges take an appreciable time. If the operating system (windows in this
case)
is rebooted during a merge I get a lot of files in the catalog directory
(partially created new merged catalog) where these files (names)
are not referenced by 'segments' or 'deletable'. Is there any cleanup
process to remove all files from the catalog directory which should not be
there. If so, what triggers this operation.

Thanks

Gareth (BridgeHead Software)
