SUBJECT: setting Similarity at search time
DATE: 15 Nov 2004

Hi,

Is there a way to set the Similarity at search(...) time, rather than
just setting it on the (Index)Searcher object itself?  I'd like to be
able to specify different similarities in different threads searching
concurrently, using the same IndexSearcher instance.

In my use case, the choice of Similarity is a parameter of the search
request, and hence may be different for each request.

Can such a method be added to override the search(...) method?

Thanks,
-Ken
