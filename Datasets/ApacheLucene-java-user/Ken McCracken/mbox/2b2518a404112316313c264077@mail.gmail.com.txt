Hi,

Thanks the pointers in your replies.  Would it be possible to include
some sort of accrual scorer interface somewhere in the Lucene Query
APIs?  This could be passed into a query similar to
MaxDisjunctionQuery; and combine the sum, max, tieBreaker, etc.,
according to the implementor's discretion, to compute the overall
score for a document.
