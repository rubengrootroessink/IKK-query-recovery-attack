Hi Doug,

Thanks for the reply.  

idf is a function of the individual terms in the query.  I think that
the grouping in the Similarity formula would be off with it at the
end.  It currently looks like
    ( SUM_t in q ( tf * idf * getBoost * lengthNorm ) ) * coord * queryNorm
whereas I think what you are describing is
    ( SUM_t in q ( tf * idf * getBoost * lengthNorm ) ) * coord *
queryNorm * idf
This doesn't make sense, since idf is a function of each t in q, and
it is outside the sum.

Since coord and queryNorm are computed across the query, maybe the
formula should then look like
    ( SUM_t in q ( tf * idf * getBoost * lengthNorm * coord *
queryNorm * idf ) )
or 
    ( SUM_t in q ( tf * idf * getBoost * lengthNorm * idf ) ) * coord
* queryNorm
These are equivalent formulas.  coord and queryNorm are functions of
the entire query and can appear either inside or outside the sigma
SUM.  I'm shaky on what would be the best or most-easily-understood
ordering.

Cheers,
-Ken
