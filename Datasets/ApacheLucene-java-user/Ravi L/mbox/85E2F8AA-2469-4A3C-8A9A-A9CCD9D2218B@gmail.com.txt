SUBJECT: Storing part of the field
DATE: 14 Nov 2008

Hi,

I am simple question.

I want a string to be indexed, but stored part of that string.

For example, if my string is "foo bar", I want to index whole  
string("foo bar") but store the first 3 characters("foo") of it. How  
can I do this with the lucene APIs?


thanks
ravi
