SUBJECT: About the search efficiency based on document's length
DATE: 21 Sep 2007

Hi everyone,

There is a question about the documentâ€™s length and search efficiency.

Think of this situation:

Two ways to index some html pages(ignore some information): one is both
store and index the html content in lucene dictionary, the other is just
index the content . For the first method is there a efficiency problem
compare to the second besides the folder size increase?

Thanks,
		Jarvis
