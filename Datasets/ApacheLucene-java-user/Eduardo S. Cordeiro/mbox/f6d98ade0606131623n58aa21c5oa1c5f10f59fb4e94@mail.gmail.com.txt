SUBJECT: Detecting index existance
DATE: 13 Jun 2006

Hi there,

I'm just starting up with Lucene after reading bits and pieces from
Gospodnetic and Hatcher's "Lucene in Action" (and noticing the API has
changed for 2.0.0).

My question is this: is there a way to detect whether or not the index
exists? I'm currently developing a web application that will use
Lucene for searching, but all indexable data will be entered by admin
users of this webapp, so there is no initial index. My hope is to be
able to create an empty one "on the fly" as it is first needed...is
this possible?

Thanks and regards,
Eduardo Cordeiro
