thanks for the response Otis!
I'm a novice with this, so I'll appreciate your patience. 
I'm using a batch program for doing the additions and deletions while a
separate web app for searching. How can I ensure that these two different
apps (one making the changes to index and the other just searching) don't
run into each others' paths? Or am I ignorant of something really basic
here?

Thanks
