SUBJECT: Re: Is there an easy way to have indexing ignore a CVS subdirectory in the index directory?
DATE: 5 Nov 2004

You may also want to investigate the CVSIGNORE environment variable. 
You can tell CVS to ignore any files and directories specified in this
variable (it is space seperated)

So you could tell CVS to ignore all directories named lucene with:
export CVSIGNORE=lucene
