Actually, that isn't how hyperthreading works.  The "second" CPU in a
hyperthreaded system should only run threads when the "main" cpu is
waiting on another task, like a memory access.  The second, or sub CPU
is only a virtual processor.  There aren't really two chips on board. 
New multicore processors will actually have more than one processor 
in one chip.

Problems can arise when you are using a HT processor on an operating
system that doesn't know about HT technology.  The OS should only
schedule jobs to run on the sub CPU under very specific circumstances.
 This is one of the major reasons for the scheduler overhaul in Linux
2.6.  The default scheduler in 2.4 would assign threads to the sub CPU
that shouldn't have been, and those threads would suffer from resource
starvation.
