You could always modify your own local copy if you want to change the
behavior of the parameter.

or just do:
IndexWriter w = new IndexWriter(indexDirectory,
                                                new StandardAnalyzer(),
                                               
!(IndexReader.indexExists(indexDirectory))
                                                );

If you do that, then if an index exists then it will not be created,
otherwise it will be...

an existing index, it should always append.  So I want create set to false.  But when I am
starting a brand new index, then I have to change the create flag to keep it from throwing
an exception...  I guess for now I will have to write code to check if a index actually has
content yet, and if it doesn't, change the flag on the fly.
