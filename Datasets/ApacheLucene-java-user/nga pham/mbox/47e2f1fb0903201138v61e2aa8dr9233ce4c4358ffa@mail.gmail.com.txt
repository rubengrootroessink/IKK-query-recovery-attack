Hi All,

I recently purchased Lucene in action 2nd edition.  When i ran the suggested
command
"ant indexer" (located in Chapter 1: Running Indexer, page 21) it was able
to run for a while until it froze.

The last thing that was printed on my screen was

"[input] Directory for new Lucene index: [indexes/MeetLucene]
[indexes/MeetLucene]"


My anticipation was that the indexer would print out the name of the file it
indexes and the time it took.  I also never got a "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"

Can you please tell me what the problem is?

I'm running it on CENTOS 4.7.

I downloaded :

   - java (JDK) version 6, updated 12
   - Ant 1.7.1
   - JUnit


Thank you for your time,
Nga Pham
