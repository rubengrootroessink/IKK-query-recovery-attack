Is there away to not factor in norms data in scoring somehow?

I'm just stumped as to how Luke is able to do a seach (with limit) on the docs but in my code
it just dies with OutOfMemory errors.
How does Luke not allocate these norms?

Its used for length normalization (shorter documents = more important) and index time boosting.
If you want either of those, you need norms. When norms are loaded up into an IndexReader,
its loaded into a byte[maxdoc] array for each field - so even if one document out of 400 million
has a field, its still going to load byte[maxdoc] for that field (so a lot of wasted RAM).
 Did you say you had 400 million docs and 7 fields? Google says that would be:

Just to avoid confusion, that should really read a byte per document per field. If I remember
right, it gives 255 boost possibilities, limited to 25 with length normalization.
