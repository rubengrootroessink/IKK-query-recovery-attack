Hello, 

As an update to this problem:

It seems Luke is also failing on a segment with so much documents in it (norms enabled). 
I was probably too tired to notice that the hits i was getting was coming from a very small
segment not the big segment.

So I was back at square one; For testing I created a file without norms in it and luke did
not throw any exception. 

Knowing that, I proceeded to investigate any other ways to avoid the norms problem without
having to regenerate the new index with norms disabled.

So far, in my local testing the following query code does not seem to fail.
The main thing being ConstantScoreQuery. 
Using this query, processing of norms does not seem to be invoked.
I'll still have to check more on this in detail..

Filter dateFilter = new RangeFilter("timestamp", DateTools.dateToString(start, DateTools.Resolution.SECOND),
                         DateTools.dateToString(end, DateTools.Resolution.SECOND), true, true);
ConstantScoreQuery dateQuery = new ConstantScoreQuery(dateFilter);
        
BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount(1024); 
BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();        
query.add(dateQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
        
Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();

QueryParser parser;
        if (!isEmpty(content)) {
            try {
                parser = new QueryParser("content", analyzer);                
                ConstantScoreQuery contentQuery = new ConstantScoreQuery(new QueryWrapperFilter(parser.parse(content)));
               
                query.add(contentQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);                
            } catch (ParseException pe) {
                log.error("content could not be parsed.");
            }
        }

Hello Mark, 

As of the moment the index could not be rebuilt to remove norms.

Right now, I'm trying to figure out what luke is doing by going through source code.

Using whatever settings I find, create a very small app just to do a bit of search.
This small app has 1600 mb heapspace while luke just has 256 max for heap space.

On reading the same big 1 segment index with 166 million docs, 
luke fails during checkIndex when it checks the norms, but searching is okay as long as I
limit it to say a few thousand documents.
However it's not the same for my app, been trying to limit it It still reads way too much
data.

I'm wondering if this has anything to do with Similarity and Scoring. 
I was wondering if you could lead me to some settings or any clever tweaks. 

This problem will haunt me this christmas. :O

We don't know those norms are "the" problem. Luke is loading norms if its searching that index.
But what else is Luke doing? What else is your App doing? I suspect your app requires more
RAM than Luke? How much RAM do you have and much are you allocating to the JVM?

The norms are not necessarily the problem you have to solve - but it would appear they are
taking up over 2 gig of memory. Unless you have some to spare (and it sounds like you may
not), it could be a good idea to turn them off for particular fields.

Its used for length normalization (shorter documents = more important) and index time boosting.
If you want either of those, you need norms. When norms are loaded up into an IndexReader,
its loaded into a byte[maxdoc] array for each field - so even if one document out of 400 million
has a field, its still going to load byte[maxdoc] for that field (so a lot of wasted RAM).
 Did you say you had 400 million docs and 7 fields? Google says that would be:

remember right, it gives 255 boost possibilities, limited to 25 with length normalization.
