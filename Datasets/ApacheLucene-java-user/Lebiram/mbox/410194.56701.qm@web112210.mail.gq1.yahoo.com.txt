SUBJECT: Extract the text that was indexed
DATE: 30 Dec 2008

Hi All, 

Is it possible to extract the text that was indexed but not stored for a field in a document?


Right now, reader.document() returns only fields that was stored. However I'd also want to
get the text on the indexed only field...

I'd appreciate your help
