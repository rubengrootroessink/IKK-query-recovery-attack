Hi Hoss, 

Before posting this question, I did try FieldNormModifier approach.

It did modify it.
>From one big segment it added 7 more small segments per field.

However, upon testing this index, the norms problem still occurs with the same stack trace
error.

This leads me to believe that FieldNormModifier doesn't actually remove the norms but just
modifies it so that the norms will be a constant 1 byte value which acts similar to that of
fakeNorms.

This was the execution:

java -Xmx1280m -Xms1024m -cp ./lucene-misc-2.3.1.jar;../../lucene-core-2.3.1.jar org.apache.lucene.index.FieldNormModifier
C:/index -n field1 field2 field3 field4 field5 field6 field7

: If you want to create an identical index but without norms use
: FieldNormModifier in contrib/miscellaneous.

and that ladies nad gentlemen is *exactly* the definition of an "X/Y 
Problem" ...
