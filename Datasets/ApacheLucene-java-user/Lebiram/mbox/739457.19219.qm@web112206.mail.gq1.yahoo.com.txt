DATE: 23 Dec 2008

Hi All, 

Thanks for the replies, 

I've just managed to reproduced the error on my test machine.

What we did was, generate about 100,000,000 documents with about 7 fields in it, with terms
from 1 to 10.

After the index of about 20GB, we did an optimize and it was able to make 1 big index of the
size 17GB...

Now, when we do a normal search, it just fails. 

Here is the stack trace:

The search code is quite simple in fact. 

2008-12-23 16:56:05,076 [main] INFO  LuceneTesterMain  - query.toString()=+content:test

and the code to search.

Filter filter = new RangeFilter("timestamp", DateTools.dateToString(start, DateTools.Resolution.SECOND),
                                         DateTools.dateToString(end, DateTools.Resolution.SECOND),
true, true);
Searcher = new IndexSearcher(FSDirectory.getDirectory(IndexName));
TopDocs hits = Searcher.search(query, filter, 1000);

I really have no idea why this is breaking.

Also, what are norms and 
how do I turn off norms and where is it set? 

This is code on adding documents:

Document doc = new Document();
                    doc.add(new Field("id", String.valueOf(i), Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));

                    doc.add(new Field("timestamp", DateTools.dateToString(new Date(), DateTools.Resolution.SECOND),
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
                    doc.add(new Field("content", LuceneTesterMain.StaticString, Field.Store.NO,
Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
                    doc.add(new Field("field2", "sender" + i, Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
                    doc.add(new Field("field3", LuceneTesterMain.StaticString, Field.Store.NO,
Field.Index.TOKENIZED));

                    doc.add(new Field("field4", "group" + i, Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
                    doc.add(new Field("field5", "groupId" + i, Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));


                    writer.addDocument(doc);

I've had reports of OOM exceptions during optimize on a couple of large deployments recently
(based on Lucene 2.4.0)
I've given the usual advice of turning off norms, providing plenty of RAM and also suggested
setting IndexWriter.setTermIndexInterval().

I don't have access to these deployment environments and have tried hard to reproduce the
circumstances that lead to this. For the record, I've experimented with huge indexes with
hundreds of fields, several "unique value" fields e.g. primary keys, "fixed-vocab" fields
with limited values e.g. male/female and fields with "power-curve" distributions e.g. plain
text.
I've wound my index up to 22GB with several commit sessions involving deletions, full optimises
and partial optimises along the way. Still no error.

However, the errors that have been reported to me from 2 different environments with large
indexes make me think there is still something to be uncovered here...

How many indexed fields do you have, overall, in the index?

If you have a very large number of fields that are "sparse" (meaning any given document would
only have a small subset of the fields), then norms could explain what you are seeing.

Norms are not stored sparsely, so when segments get merged the "holes" get filled (occupy
bytes on disk and in RAM) and consume more resources.  Turning off norms on sparse fields
would resolve it, but you must rebuild the entire index since if even a single doc in the
index has norms enabled for a given field, it "spreads".
