Sorry, I might have misunderstood what my coworker told me.

If HitCollector only returns a document once then he might be referring to an application
ID that is assigned to a field that has been indexed twice or more with different document
IDs.

I'll clarify this with him.

However is there a way to somehow do a group by field on the results? That field being the
application ID?

Thanks.

I don't understand your question. From the API docs for
HitCollector.collect:

<<<Called once for every non-zero scoring document, with
the document number and its score.>>>

Can you ask your question another way? Because the
only answer I can come up with is
"HitCollector.collect only sees each document once by definition".
