SUBJECT: Field method problems in first lucene program
DATE: 22 Mar 2010

Hi,

     I am writing my first lucene program and  following the 1st
edition of lucene in action book and the blog article by grant on the
lucid imagination blog . Now,if i am using the doc.add(field.text())
method with arguments,it says,cant resolve ..
  If i follow the blog,it is asking for an extra argument(i am using
just three as i am wondering what the second one should be)  . What am
i missing in both the cases?
Rohit
