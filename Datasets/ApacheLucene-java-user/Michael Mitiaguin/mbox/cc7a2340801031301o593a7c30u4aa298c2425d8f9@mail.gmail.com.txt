SUBJECT: Re: Reading field parameters from XML
DATE: 3 Jan 2008

My initial concern was not about efficiency , but that using xml to
make code more generic results in  far  from from elegant if/else
checks  for each of Field.Store , Field.Index , Field.TermVector.  I'd
prefer suggested way to make initial preparations to create the maps
and then  have an assignment in a single statement.
