SUBJECT: Access Scoring Values of Lucene for Post-Processing
DATE: 8 Oct 2008


Hi everybody,

I am using Lucene for searching items in a online shop. E.g. I search the
shop for "shirt" I get a resultset from lucene. Now I want to improve the
sort order by calculating the lucene score with my business data, e.g. sales
or margin. Is there any possibility to get the scoring value of lucene, so
that I can put it into my own formula and re-sort the products?

The method getScore() sounds great, but is unfortunately marked as
deprecated.

Regards,
ExComm2
