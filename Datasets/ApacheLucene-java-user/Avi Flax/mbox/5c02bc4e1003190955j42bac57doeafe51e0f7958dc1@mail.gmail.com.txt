Sorry for the spam, I'm hoping this is relevant enough that you all
won't mind too much.

Please see our post here: http://jobs.37signals.com/jobs/6312

It doesn't mention search, but we have a big search project coming up
— we're going to start evaluating platforms and technologies soon.

If you're interested, please get in touch!
