SUBJECT: Using Lucene to search Multiple Databases
DATE: 14 Jun 2007

HI,

 My requirement is to search multiple databases which are present on
different machines all of which are indexed using lucene
 Can it be done using the web interface of lucene ?
 If yes what is the procedure for that and what other tools are requried?

 To make it more clear, i'm giving an example

Say, i have two machines having IP address x.x.x.10 and x.x.x.11
and i want a client which can search both of them and retrieve all the
records matching the keyword
Can this be done?

I am using Tomcat as server with lucene-2.1.0 as the searching application
All ideas are welcomed...

Thanks and Regards,
Rajat Mahajan.
