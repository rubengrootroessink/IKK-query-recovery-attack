Don't know if this helps, but I indexed over 600,000 150k html files on W2K
and linux, then I did 40,000 2mb html files and didn't have any issues.  I
used the demo html indexer class.

A question I'd like answered is, why do I now have to be concerned about
having too many files open when before I didn't? What has changed to
cause this? This sounds like a bug to me.
