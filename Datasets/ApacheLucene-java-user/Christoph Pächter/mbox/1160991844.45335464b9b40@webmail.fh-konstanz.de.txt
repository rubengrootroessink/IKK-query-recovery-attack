SUBJECT: Searching pdf, getting page number
DATE: 16 Oct 2006

Hi,

I know that I can index pdf-files (using a third-party library).

Is it possible to search the index for a phrase, getting not only the
document, but also the page number in the (pdf-)document?
Or is it even possible to get a bookmark, leading to this page?

I am thankful for any information you can provide me, either how to do 
this indicing and searching, or where I can find further information or 
example code.

Kind regards
Christoph
