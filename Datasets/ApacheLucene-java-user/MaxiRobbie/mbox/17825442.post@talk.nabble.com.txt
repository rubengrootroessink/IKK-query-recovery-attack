SUBJECT: [BEGINNER]Query on index with number
DATE: 13 Jun 2008


Hi all, 

I've worked just a little with Lucene and now i need some stuffs to be done
but i can't find responses in faq or how-to.

My index contains products title like Nikon d300, nikon d200, nikon d3

i'm using SimpleAnalyzer and when i query for title:d300, it's transformed
in title:d and the results contains d200 and others kind of stuff.

How can i correct this ? somes links would be helpfull.

Thanks for share your experience.
