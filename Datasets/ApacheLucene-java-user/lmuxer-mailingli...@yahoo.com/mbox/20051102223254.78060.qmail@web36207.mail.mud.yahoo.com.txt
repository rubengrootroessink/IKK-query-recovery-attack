SUBJECT: Lucene or DB?
DATE: 2 Nov 2005

Hi,

I am looking at Lucene to index and search file metadata - filename,
size, permissions, mtime, ctime, atime, etc.

I do not need to index and search the contents of the file. I was
wondering if Lucene is the right choice for such an application. This
will be at enterprise level so there could be millions of files. 

What are the pros and cons of using Lucene vs a DB like MySQL and
creating  indexes on it?

Any comments/suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Andy
