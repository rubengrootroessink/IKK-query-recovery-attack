SUBJECT: Input File Format
DATE: 10 Nov 2005

Hello,

I am new to Lucene. I was trying to use Lucene with TREC-6 Data. The
question is that each input file given by TREC have multiple documents
(some files contain over 200 documents) tagged by DOCID. The result given
by Lucene to a query is a list of files and not documents.

Q1) Is there a way of getting the query results in terms of documents
within the files rather than files ( without modifying the code)?

Q2) If the above is not posssible, what would be the best way to modify
the code?

Thanks and Regards,
Ashwin
