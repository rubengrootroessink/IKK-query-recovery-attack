SUBJECT: Calling indexWriter.close() in web app
DATE: 9 Jul 2007


I'm developing a web app with struts that need to embed lucene
functionalities. I need that my app adds documents to the index after that a
document is added (documents are very few, but of large size). I read that i
have to use a single instance of indexwriter to edit the index. Suppose i
use a singleton or store indexwriter in the application scope to grant all
users to use that single instance. 
My questions are: 
- when i can close indexwriter to flush changes? 
- How to know that an indexwriter has been closed before adding documents to
it? 
- What does it happen if users continue adding documents to the index after
one user action closed it?

Please help!

Sorry for my bad english.
