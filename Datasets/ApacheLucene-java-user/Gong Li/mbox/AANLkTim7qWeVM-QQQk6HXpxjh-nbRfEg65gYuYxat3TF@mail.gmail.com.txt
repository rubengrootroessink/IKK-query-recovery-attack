Hi,

I use PDFBOX to extract the text in the PDF and then use Lucene to index and
search. Finally, I can find the context of the keyword but in String.

Question: I need to create a new PDF which contains the context of the
keyword. The format is like the original one, but only contains the context
of the keyword. HOW???

Thanks.
