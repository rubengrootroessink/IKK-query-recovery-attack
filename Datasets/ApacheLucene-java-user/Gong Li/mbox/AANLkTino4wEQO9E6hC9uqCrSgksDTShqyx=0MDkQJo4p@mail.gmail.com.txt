Hi,

I need to generate executable JAR.

In my code, it has some lines as following:

String path = "d:\\project\\";
File f = new File(path);
Directory dir = FSDirectory.open(f);

In the path, there is a wordnet index which is used to search by synonyms.
When I run the JAR, it needs local directory d:\project in my computer. So
how to do to wrap the directory and the files in it into JAR that the
program can run independently.

Thx.
