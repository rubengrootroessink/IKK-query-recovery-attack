SUBJECT: Question about Case Sensitive?!
DATE: 10 Feb 2011

Hi,

I use standardAnalyzer, queryParser, highlighter in my program, but they
lowercase the keywords. Now i need to search the keywords CASE SENSITIVE. Is
there any methods to achieve this and also use standardAnalyzer and
queryParser? Or some other ways? HOW???

Thx.
