SUBJECT: Lucene: If I have picture, table, or somthing others in the PDF
DATE: 18 Feb 2011

Hi,

I am developing a PDF search engine, locally. I have used API: pdfbox and
lucene.

I must show the user the PDF page containing the keywords(if highlight, it's
great) and sort by relevance(default in lucene). HOW???

Maybe, if there are some pictures in the PDF page, how could it display to
the user after index and search the extracted text???

Thanks
