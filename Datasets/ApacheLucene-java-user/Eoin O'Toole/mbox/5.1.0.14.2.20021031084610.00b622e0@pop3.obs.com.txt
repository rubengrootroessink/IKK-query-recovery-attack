SUBJECT: Alphabetical sorting of results
DATE: 31 Oct 2002

I am indexing documents (about 7 different document types) and must display 
the results alphabetically by title field... which is generally not one of 
the search fields.

Currently I am calling hits.get(i) on each document to find the title, and 
then sorting by title. Sort is fast, but calling hits.get(i)  n times is 
too slow beyond about 400 objects... and this approach means I have to do a 
"full scan" of the Hits collection.

Anyone have any suggestions/strategies on solving this? (Or is there 
functionality already in place I have overlooked?)

Thanks for any input,

Eoin
