SUBJECT: Phrase match with wildcards e.g. "search for st*"
DATE: 10 Oct 2002

I would like the phrase "search for st*" to return matches which expand the 
wildcard... but it doesn't seem to work.

right now I can get "search for stuff" and "search for stars" to return 
hits, but "search for st*" doesn't.

Any ideas on how to implement this functionality?

Thanks,

Eoin
