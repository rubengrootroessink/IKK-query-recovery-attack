SUBJECT: Phrase queries taking more time
DATE: 1 Jun 2011

Hi all,

we have a 20gb lucene index size. We are using lucene 3.1. For
business reasons, if a user searches  suppose for java, we also have
to search its synonyms "core java".
so the query looks like below:
title:(java "core java")
we have approx 500 synonyms set, each having 3 to 5 phrases.
Now the  problem is these kind of phrase queries taking more than 10 sec
time.

can any one show some light how to reduce the search time.
