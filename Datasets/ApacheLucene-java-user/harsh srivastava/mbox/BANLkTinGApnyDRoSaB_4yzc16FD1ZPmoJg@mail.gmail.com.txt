SUBJECT: How to fix the number of searched terms for a field
DATE: 3 May 2011

Hi All,


I want to know any inbuilt method in lucene that can help me to fix the
number of searched terms for a given field e.g.
Suppose I have given content:(text1 text2 text3 text4 text5) to search and
want to limit it to 3 words only i.e. content:(text1 text2 text3)

Please help.

Thanks,
Harsh
