So is IndexModifier opening an IndexReader when someone calls .delete()
then closing the reader and opening an IndexWriter when someone calls
addDocument() (for example)?

Sounds like that could get fairly inefficient.  Is IndexModifier for
more convenience (and less performance) than using reader and writer
separately?

Thanks

The reader and writer are closed automatically if needed, so they cannot

easily be given to the outside. If you want to give it a try anway: 
IndexModifer was designed to be extendable, so you can just create your 
own subclass of IndexModifier that adds these methods.
