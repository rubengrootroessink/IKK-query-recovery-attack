SUBJECT: IndexModifier and finding records
DATE: 29 Sep 2006

Hi...

 

            I was just looking at the IndexModifier class, which seems
like a nice consolidation for some of our operations.  There is one
question I have though.  The class says that it internally contains an
IndexReader and an IndexWriter and has examples of operations doing
both.  But it doesn't appear that a) there is access to either the
reader or writer internal fields and b) some things don't support an
IndexModifier in place of a reader or writer.

 

            We have a metadata record that we put in and update when we
change the index, so when we do incremental updates, I need to find that
record which is currently done with an IndexSearcher(IndexReader).  It
would be nice if I could do IndexSearcher(IndexModifier) or
IndexSearcher(IndexModifier.getReader()) or something.

 

            Am I missing the point or something?

 

Thanks

-Mark
