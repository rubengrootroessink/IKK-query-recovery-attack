SUBJECT: Lucene displaying results in the order they were added

Is there a way to update a document in the Index without causing any change
to the order in which it comes up in searches?

I have a bunch of search results being returned as a result of a query. 
This is done in order to allow users to "request boost" - they have a
drop-down box with options slight/average/high boost to select from for
every search result.  Selecting an option results in a field being added to
the document called "BOOST_REQUEST", which is alter used to review requets
and add boost.

The problem is, the document gets overwritten when users request boost. 
This results in that document automaticallty jumping to the end of search
results that have the same score.

Is there a way to update a document in the Index without causing any change
to the order in which it comes up in searches?

Thank You.
