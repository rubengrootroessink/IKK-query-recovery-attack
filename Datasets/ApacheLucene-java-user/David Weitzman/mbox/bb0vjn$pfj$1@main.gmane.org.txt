SUBJECT: Sort results by date alone?
DATE: 28 May 2003

I think it's possible, but I'm not sure how Scorers work.  I just want to
place the most recent hits at the front and the oldest ones at the back
(where "date" is a field in the documents).  Is there a simple way to do
this?

Thanks,

David Weitzman
