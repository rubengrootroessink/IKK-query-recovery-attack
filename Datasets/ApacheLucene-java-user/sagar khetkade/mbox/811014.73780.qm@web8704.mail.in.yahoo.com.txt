SUBJECT: multi field search
DATE: 11 Jun 2007

right now there is field level search avilable.
   
   But if we dont want to search on field but on the whole document then to the query parseer
 the whole contet is to be passed. 
   
  If we append the titles (captions or fields) to say 
index content(which is having all the captions or fields) for every caption 
indexcontent is created.(which could be found on the limo software) to avoid the index content,
so for a query without the "field:quey" how is it possible and what to pass to the query 
analyser as a input so it searches on the whole document and not on the fields.
