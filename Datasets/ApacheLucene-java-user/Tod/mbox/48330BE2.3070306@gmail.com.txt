SUBJECT: Treatment of Metadata
DATE: 20 May 2008

I have a couple of quick questions about how Lucene indexes metadata:

- Does it do anything special with metadata or treat it as a supplement 
to the words in the document?

I have a feeling that the answer is that out of the box lucene does 
nothing special with metadata and that its treated just like any other 
regular words in the document.  It would be up to the developer to 
design in its special treatment.

- If a particular document contains metadata is there a way after the 
indexing process to query a specific document to determine what metadata 
was indexed for it?

Simple example, I have a word document that has a specific title and a 
number of other properties.  Once that document is indexed I'd like to 
be able to call a method that would identify all of the properties 
Lucene indexed from the document, completely separate from the 
document's actual content.


Thanks!
