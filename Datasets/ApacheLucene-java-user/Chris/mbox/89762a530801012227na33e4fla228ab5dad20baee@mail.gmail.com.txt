Dear CowBoyX .

    if you use lucene query function with boolean query . You can try to use
the BooleanQuery to create the logic with yourself.

    Like the codeï¼š
   BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
   query.add(new TermQuery() , BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);  // for +

    or
    query.add(new TermQuery(), BooleanClause.Occur.MUST_NOT); // for -

you can find the information with lucene javadoc
http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/

Classes with BooleanQuery  and BooleanClause.Occur

above
