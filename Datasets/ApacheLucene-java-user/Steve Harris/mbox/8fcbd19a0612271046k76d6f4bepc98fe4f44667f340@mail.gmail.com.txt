Some quick questions/points:

What is the update rate?

The number of nodes you described is no problem, the query rate would be
no problem too (because they use read locks and act independently).

Do all nodes do updates or just 1? How often do these updates occur?

Probably best thing to do is give it a try and run a few tests.

Cheers,
Steve
