SUBJECT: Lucene OpenCms search - Xpath notation?
DATE: 30 Jan 2009

Hi,

 

I am using OpenCms 7.0.5 with Lucene search engine.

I need to index XML content for which I have a following field
configuration in the opencms-search.xml

 

            <fieldconfiguration>

                <name>DESC_FIELD_CONFIG</name>

                <fields>

                    <field name="Description" store="true" index="true"
excerpt="true">

                        <mapping
type="item">country[1]/record[1]/description[1]</mapping>

                    </field>

                </fields>

            </fieldconfiguration>

 

With the above field configuration, only 1st description node of the 1st
record of the 1st country gets indexed.

I need to index all the description nodes, of all the records of all the
country nodes, in my XML file.

I tried different XPATH notations, but it seems OpenCms does not
recognize those.

 

Does anybody have a solution to this?

 

 

Thanks,

Dipak
