SUBJECT: Wich way would you recommend for successive-words similarity and	scoring ?
DATE: 3 May 2010

Hello,

Lucene core doesn't seems to use relative word positioning (?) for scoring.

For example, indexing that phrase "a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r
s t u v w x y z", these queries give the same results (0.19308087) :
 - 1 : phrase:'e f g'
 - 2 : phrase:'o k z'

I'm a bit familiar with lucene and snowballs, but I never (really)
needed this feature before, and didn't browse the lucene contribs.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but, what can I do to obtain
query 1 get a better score than the second ?

Should I implement a Scorer and or a Similarity, or can an analyser
and a specific stemmer be sufficient?


Thanks, [I first wrote to dev, wasn't the right place.]

Pablo
