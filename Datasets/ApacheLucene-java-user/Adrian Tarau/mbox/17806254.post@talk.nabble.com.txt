SUBJECT: Re: Does lucene support distributed indexing?
DATE: 12 Jun 2008


I've started an year ago a different implementation of ParallelMultiSearcher
using a ThreadPoolExecutor where everything is parallelized.
Unfortunately, I had to interrupt this and work on something else, but this
month I'll start working again. Right now there are some dependencies so it
cannot be used outside my infrastructure(like discovering new nodes,
notifications between nodes), but I'm thinking to extract this as a separate
project(maybe latter) so can be used as an Lucene extension.

I will post some code as soon as I will have something to show :)

Thanks.
