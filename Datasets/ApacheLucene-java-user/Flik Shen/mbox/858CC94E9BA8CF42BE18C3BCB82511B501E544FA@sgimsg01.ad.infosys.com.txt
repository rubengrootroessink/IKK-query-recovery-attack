Hi,



I am freshman to Lucene and I am reading the book "Lucene In Action".

Just as that we know, there are two kinds of directory to hold index,
one is File System and the other is RAM.

There is a sample to compare performances of these two kind directories
and there is also a piece of code about "Batch indexing by using
RAMDirectory as a buffer".

When I follow some samples, I found an interesting thing about indexing
performance.



I combine these two pieces of codes and time each kind directory
indexing. (Please refer the attachment for details processes)

I load 3000 docs and 5 words per doc. I use File System Directory and
RAM Directory to indexing these docs directly. The time of these two are
10737ms and 1575ms.

Then I use a RAM directory as a buffer for indexing and use method
"addIndexes" of a new Index writer which finally holds index in a File
System directory.

The time it consumed is 1348ms.

How could this be?

I think the time that buffered indexing consumes should base on the time
of RAM indexing.

I wonder why a buffered indexing even has a good performance than a ram
indexing.

So interesting!



Best regards,

Flik Shen
