SUBJECT: Locking issue
DATE: 8 Nov 2004

The attached Java file shows a locking issue that occurs with
Lucene.

One thread opens and closes an IndexReader.  The other thread
opens an IndexWriter, adds a document and then closes the
IndexWriter.  I would expect that this app should be able to
happily run without an issues.

It fails with:
  java.io.IOException: Lock obtain timed out

Is this expected?  I thought a Reader could be opened while a
Writer is adding a document.

Any help is appreciated.
