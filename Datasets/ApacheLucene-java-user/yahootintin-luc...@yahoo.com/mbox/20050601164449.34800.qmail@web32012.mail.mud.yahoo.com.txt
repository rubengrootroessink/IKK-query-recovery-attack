SUBJECT: Re: SpanTermQuery issue?
DATE: 1 Jun 2005

Hi Erik,

Here is the bug report with the test case:
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35157

The scoring algorithm doesn't seem to work correctly when
SpanTermQuerys are in a BooleanQuery.  I will look for the
problem.  Any advice on what I should look for?

Thanks,
Reece
