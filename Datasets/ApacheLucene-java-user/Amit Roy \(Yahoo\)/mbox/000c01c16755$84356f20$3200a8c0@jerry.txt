Yeah, of course, we are developing a Content-Manager and we have made a
Lucene implementation to index and search and our Documents. We have now the
Gold version and the final version will be ready in www.ubicua.com in a few
days.

I´m just a member of the Development team but I think it will be absolutely
free for developers. If you want to get more info please write me.
