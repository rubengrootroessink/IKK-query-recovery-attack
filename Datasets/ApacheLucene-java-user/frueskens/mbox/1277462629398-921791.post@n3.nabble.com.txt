SUBJECT: searching for wildcard as valid character
DATE: 25 Jun 2010


Dear all,

I have to solve the following problem but without success yet.

We need to search for a content in a field 'name' that contains the wildcard
symbol appearing somewhere in a string. E.g. indexed string "1234*abc". 
The query should ignore all others that does not contain this symbol. 
A query like "name:*\**" does not work - it finds everything. 

Although if I would search for a symbol like '[' (which is also part of the
query syntax) in "1234[abc" using the query "name:*\[*" finds exactly the
indexed string.

BTW: the string  "1234*abc" was indexed as is - checked with Luke

Any clue?
Thanks
