Hi Vin!

With JPedal you process one page at a time by calling the method decodePage
and supply the number of the page you want to process as argument.

In the example ExtractTextObjects the total number of pages is hard-coded to
1 (the variable end is set to 1 in the constructor), try to set the number
of pages by using the getPageCount method instead.

Best regards

Mikael Söderman

PS. Don't forget to always call flushObjectValues when done with a page.
This will make JPedal reuse memory.
