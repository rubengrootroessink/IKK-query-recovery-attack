Hi,

 

I'm indexing a field using the StandardAnalyzer 2.9.

 

field = new Field(fieldName, fieldValue, Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED);

 

Let's say fieldName is "name" and fieldValue is "something in the
index".  When I perform the query...

 

name:"something in the index"

 

... I don't get a hit.  I'm using the StandardAnalyzer for searching.
I've tested this with Luke and it doesn't work there either.  What am I
missing?

 

Thanks,

 

Paul
