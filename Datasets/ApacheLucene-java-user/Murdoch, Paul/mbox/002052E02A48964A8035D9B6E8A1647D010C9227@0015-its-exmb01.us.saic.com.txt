SUBJECT: RE: NumericRangeQuery in BooleanQuery
DATE: 20 Apr 2010

Yes and no.  I extended the QueryParser and overrode the getRangeQuery method to let it build
NRQ.  When parsing a BooleanQuery containing NRQ using the extended QueryParser the overridden
getRangeQuery was never being called.  I think it was still using the QueryParser's.  In the
end I'm building my queries in code directly.  That's working for me so far.

Thanks,

Paul

Thats not true, do you build the NumericRangeQuery in code, or do you use QueryParser. The
latter is not able to produce NRQ without customizing!

Else numeric RangeQueries are no magically converted they stay and are rewritten to CustomSCoreQueries.
