Thanks for the input.  I'll give the WhitespaceAnalyzer a shot.  Also,
AFAIK, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED means that the content you index is not
split into separate tokens so it is searchable, but only for exact
matches.  I may be able to get what I want with the WhitespaceAnalyzer
and Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED.  Thanks again.

Paul

Personally punctuation matters in my queries so I use
WhitespaceAnalyzer.  I
also only want exact hits, so that analyzer works well for me.

Also, AFAIK you don't set NOT_ANALYZED if you want to search through it.
