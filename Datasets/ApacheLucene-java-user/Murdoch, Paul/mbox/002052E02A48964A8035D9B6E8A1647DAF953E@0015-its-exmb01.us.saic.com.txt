It still fails even when there are no stop words.  I'm going to try a
PhraseQuery instead of relying on the QueryParser.

Since it is not analyzed, your text is stored as a single term in the
index
[something in the index].
But the query 
	name:"something in the index"
is translated as :
  find 4 consecutive terms which have values "something", "in","the" and
"index"  respectively.
or if stop words are removed 
  find 2 consecutive terms which have values "something" and "index"

You should either index it ANALYZED or use TermQuery while searching.

Hi,

 

I'm indexing a field using the StandardAnalyzer 2.9.

 

field = new Field(fieldName, fieldValue, Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED);

 

Let's say fieldName is "name" and fieldValue is "something in the
index".  When I perform the query...

 

name:"something in the index"

 

... I don't get a hit.  I'm using the StandardAnalyzer for searching.
I've tested this with Luke and it doesn't work there either.  What am I
missing?

 

Thanks,

 

Paul
