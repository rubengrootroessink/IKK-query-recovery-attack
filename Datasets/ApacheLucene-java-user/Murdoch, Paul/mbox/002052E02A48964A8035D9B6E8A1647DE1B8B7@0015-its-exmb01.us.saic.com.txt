Hi,

 

I have a quick question. If I have an index where some text values are
indexed under the same field name, but some are ANALYZED and some are
NOT_ANALYZED, does the last value's flags change the flags for the whole
field name?  For instance if I index 3 sentences under a field name as
ANALYZED and then index a 4th sentence as NOT_ANALYZED under the same
field name, are all 4 sentences now viewed as NOT_ANALYZED in the index?

 

Thanks,

 

Paul
