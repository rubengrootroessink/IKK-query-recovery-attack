SUBJECT: fitler vs query
DATE: 21 Feb 2006

Hello,

Before I learned about filters in lucene I was building my initial query
as a stringbuffer and then I use that with a queryparser.    Is there
any difference/advantage to separating out the "filter" part of my query
into a proper filter in lucene or does it just add requirements the same
to the query as I am doing (+field:blah AND field:blah)?
