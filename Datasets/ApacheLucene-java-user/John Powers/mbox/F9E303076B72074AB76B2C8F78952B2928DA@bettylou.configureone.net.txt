SUBJECT: problem updating a document: no segments file?
DATE: 27 Jan 2006

Hello,

I have a couple instances of lucene.  I just altered on implementation and now its not keeping
a segments file.  while indexing occurs, there is a segment file.    but once its done, there
isn't.    all the other indexes have one.     the problem comes when i try to update a document,
it says "segments file not found" and that stops it.    this code was working fine on my development
box, but now i go to production its not keeping that segments file.    and, it searches just
fine.    i can reindex over and over, and it keeps disappearing.

any ideas?
