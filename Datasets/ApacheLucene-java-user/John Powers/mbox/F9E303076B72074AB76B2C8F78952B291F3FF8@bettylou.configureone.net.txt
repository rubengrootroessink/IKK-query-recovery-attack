What do you mean by "use index and search analyzers".  Don't you always
have to pass in an analyzer?   I am using the standardanalyzer in both
cases.

Which analyzer are you recommending I use for this?

 Hi,
I would use index & search analyzers in this case..
"b-trunk" is analyzed & indexed as b,btrunk,trunk
Search term "b-trunk" is anlayzed using search analyzer as "btrunk" and
searched. U will find the result..

Similarly for 12412-235, 12412-121, 12412-etc , indexed as
12412,12412235,235 etc....
So obviously it will find 12412 search term.


Good luck,
Jelda
