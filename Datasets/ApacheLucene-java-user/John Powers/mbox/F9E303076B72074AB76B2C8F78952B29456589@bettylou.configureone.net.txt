Lucene 1.4 is what I use for the application and how I compile things
But in the help/about it says "null"
And I usually use the webstart, ya.  But I've tried from a downloaded
jar as well.  and I'm using java1.6 from sun

That's a strange one ... Which version of Lucene are you using with Luke

(you can check this in Help -> About box, look for "Lucene version:"). 
Are you running this from Java WebStart? Which version of JDK is this?
