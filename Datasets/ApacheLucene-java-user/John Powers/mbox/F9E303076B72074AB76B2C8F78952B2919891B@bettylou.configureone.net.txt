I'm sure you've taken care of this, but I am curious myself:

If the 301 document only has a single term "batteries" (and thus is so
far low on the Hits), but has a price of seven cents, then the sort of
all the documents with "batteries" would put this near the top, but by
eliminating all documents above 300, this one doesn't appear in the
solution you are working for, correct?    Why is that a good thing?
It seems you would want to sort on the full document list, and then
return on the 300 top that you want the user to see.      

I think I'm just curious why getting rid of some that could (in a new
sort) be of higher relevance is a good thing.

When I do a search for example on "batteries" i get 1200+ results. I 
would like to show the user lets say 300. I can do that by only 
extracting the first 300 hits (sorted by decreasing relevance by 
default) and displaying those to the user.

Now on the search results page, I have a drop down box that lets the 
user sort the results by price. When the user selects the "Sort by price

low to high", i would like to be able to sort the same 300 hits I got 
above (sorted by decreasing relevance by default) by price.

Essentially I want to be able to sort the first 300 relevant search 
results by price. (in other words I would like to be able to get search 
results by relevance, limit the results and sort the results by some 
criterion).

What would be a good way to do this in lucene?

-Thanks.
