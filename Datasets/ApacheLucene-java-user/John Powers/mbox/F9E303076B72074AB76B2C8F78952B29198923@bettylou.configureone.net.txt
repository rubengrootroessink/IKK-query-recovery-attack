It seems to me that the "X" then is a problem for you.. like you said
"coming up with the X" is hard.     Maybe you want another tag then.
We call those ones you are trying to not return "related items" on our
search system.    So you do a search that has +related:0   or something
like that.    

Then you can return only primary products instead of "bolts & screws"
and other ancillary items.

And you don't have to use an arbitrary number to achieve what you want
ideally.       I imagine that the number "x" would differ greatly
between product lines as well.       Then you have "pen" and "pencil".
A search for "pen" would bring back both "product lines", but you don't
want to limit them to either the 300 for the pens or the 300 for the
pencils.   So in this case you'll get back all the primary pens and
pencils, which makes sense.

In my case when we search for lets say cameras , my top x results are
all sorts of cameras and then i get documents that match camera casings
etc.

As a company we want to show as many cameras as possible and not other 
camera
related products for this one web view on a specific page we have. On 
this same page
we also want to provide a way that the user can select "price high to 
low" or price low to high" and sort these top x results. Essentially the

hard part is to come up with the X so that you ideally dont prune any 
cameras.
As a business we want to strive to get as many cameras in the search 
results, but at the same time we dont mind if a few cameras do not 
appear in those results if we can really fine tune our search results to

only show cameras and not camera casings and camera batteries etc.

I have been looking at QueryFilter and the Sort API, but havent yet 
figured out a way to do what I am trying to do .. any pointers are 
greatly appreciated.

-Thanks,
