So by me building a new query instead of a filter, I'm missing this
caching part?    Seems pretty fast to me right now.   But sounds like I
should use the filter anyway.   

Thanks.

Hoss, come on, where are you - Filters! ;)

John, filters are handy for situations where you want to run your query
multiple times against the same sub-set of your indexed documents.  For
instance, if you have Documents that span several years, and want to be
able to search individual years, you create a filter for each year,
cache it, and run the new query against the appropriate year's filter.

Look at the very first line of the very first snippet here (section
5.5.5):

Hello,

Before I learned about filters in lucene I was building my initial query
as a stringbuffer and then I use that with a queryparser.    Is there
any difference/advantage to separating out the "filter" part of my query
into a proper filter in lucene or does it just add requirements the same
to the query as I am doing (+field:blah AND field:blah)?
