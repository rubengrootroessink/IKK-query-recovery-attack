Thanks to the "hitcollector" suggestion.  It worked very well!    we
have such a small index, but the categories are complicated, sequenced
and can be related in various ways that their structure is very
important to the users.    so now I can get a list of "used categories"
with a hitcollector instead of pulling a Hits that was costing me an
enormous amount of memory.     Thank you for the suggestion and thank
you lucene for rockin!
