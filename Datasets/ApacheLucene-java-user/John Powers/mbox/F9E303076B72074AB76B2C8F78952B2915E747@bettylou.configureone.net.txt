Ya, you'll want to close and open your open searcher.

I have the indexer create random directories to work in. then when the
indexing is done it assigns the searcher a new location and fires off
the "close/open" command to the searcher.

If I have a reader and searcher on a indexdata folder and another 
indexwriter writing documents to the same indexdata folder, do I need to

close existing reader and searcher and create new so that newly indexed 
data comes into search effect?

I have checked through google, got some pointers but some important 
links are not opening now, so If you can give me a pointer or clear 
picture about this it will be great.

I am looking at implementing lucene searching for a site having millions

of user records so even looking for best way to keep my indexes uptodate

while searching is going on.

thanks
Amol
