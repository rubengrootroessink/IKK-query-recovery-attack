Thank you all for your comments!
In general I understand your suggestions - mostly because of scaling issues.

My application will deal with "small" data sets. The problem is, that I want
to index the content (String) of some objects. I want to refer to that
object once I found this by a keyword or whatever.  So, using a simple map or
tree? 

Another problem is, that my objects can change their content and must be
"reindexed". Is it possible to remove the single index for that object and build
a new one without reindexing all?

Thank you for help!
Best regards, Markus
