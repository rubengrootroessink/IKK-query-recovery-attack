Thank you for your answers!

However, I have problems with "reindexing". 
First, I index all my object contents. Then some of these objects can change
and need to be re-indexed. 

I did it with IndexWriter(Dir, Analyzer, FALSE). With the boolean value
"false" the new document will be added to the index, but the old document still
remains in the index :-/ 

Any suggestions? THANK YOU!
