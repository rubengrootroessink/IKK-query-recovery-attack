SUBJECT: What do I have to do with files in the sandbox?
DATE: 3 Aug 2006

Hello, 
 
 I'm pretty sure my question is stupid but i'm gonna ask you anyway :)
 
 I'd like to use analyzers from the sandbox but I don't know what I have to do with files
? Do i have to extract the lucene jar file and add files I want to use ? or something else?
 
 Do you have an exemple with this file example http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/analyzers/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/nl/DutchAnalyzer.java
?
 Do i have to add this file in my project and that's it?
 
 thanks
