SUBJECT: RE : Re: index articles with groups
DATE: 25 Jul 2006

Here more details because it seems that I did not give enough information :)
 
 I want to index my messsage board and each topic contains several posts. So my idea was to
index each post with 3 fields (ID, title, post_content) 
 
 then I can search in each post and have a link with the title of the topic. However i got
a problem with this method.
 Imagine I have a topic named "Linux better that Windows?" which contains 10 posts. I want
to retrieve only one post from that topic if someone is searching topics which contains linux.
You know what I mean?

This sounds very suspicious. My guts tell me you are attacking your
problem -- whatever it might be -- the wrong way. 

But OK, which one of the documents would you want as a result? Any of
them? Create a HitCollector, and if the the field with the group is
already collected, ignore the current document.
