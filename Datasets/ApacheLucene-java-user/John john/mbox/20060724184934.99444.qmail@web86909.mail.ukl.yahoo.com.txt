SUBJECT: index articles with groups
DATE: 24 Jul 2006

Hello, 
 
 I'm pretty new to lucene so I hope my question is not stupid :)
 
 I'd like to index articles but I want them to be in a group.
 such as:
 
 article1, article2 and article3 are in the group1
 article4 and article5 are in the group2
 
 Then if I search for a word which is present in article1 and article 2, i'd like to retrieve
only one result because they are in the same group.
 
 Is it possible?
 
 Thanks
