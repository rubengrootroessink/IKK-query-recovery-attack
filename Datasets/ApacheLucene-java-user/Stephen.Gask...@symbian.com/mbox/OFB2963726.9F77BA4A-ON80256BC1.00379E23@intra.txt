SUBJECT: Lucene Index File Names
DATE: 22 May 2002

Can anyone give me some guidance on the following issue?

I'm using Lucene to provide search facilities over fixed sets of HTML 
documentation. As part of our build process, each night the HTML 
documentation is created, and afterwards the Lucene index files generated. 
This files are then automatically put into our product and are ready to 
deliver the next day. The problem is that the files that Lucene creates 
that represent the search index are named in a seemingly arbitrary way 
that changes each time the index is created. This causes problems for the 
automatic creation of our product because our build system needs to know 
the names of the files in advance.

For example, on the first night these files are created:

5l3.xxx

whereas on the second night, the files might have this name:

5kr.xxx

Can these names be fixed, or can someone tell me the naming conventions 
involved?

I've noticed that if I rename the index files the search no longer works. 
Can this be tweaked somehow?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.
