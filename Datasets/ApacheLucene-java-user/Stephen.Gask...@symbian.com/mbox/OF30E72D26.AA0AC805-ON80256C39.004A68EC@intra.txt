We have a proprietary build system that needs to know every file that is 
going into the product. This is why we cannot blindly pick up the entire 
index directory.

Is there anyway of knowing these filenames in advance or changing them 
after they have been produced?

What build system are you using?  Why can't you just blindly pick up the
entire index directory and incorporate that?  This is what I do with a
webapp build that indexes documents during the build and rolls them into 
the
WAR file.  All using Ant, of course!  :)
