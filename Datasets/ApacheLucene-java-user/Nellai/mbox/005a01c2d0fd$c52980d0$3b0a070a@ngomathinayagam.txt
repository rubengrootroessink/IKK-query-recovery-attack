SUBJECT: regarding display order
DATE: 10 Feb 2003

Hi All,

i am using the lucene web based demo application to search and display the result. can anyone
tell how is the order of display?

Is there any specific class which handles the order. if we need to sort the display based
on modified date or based on the size of the document, then how to do?

can anyone guide me to proceed further?

Thanks a ton
Nelllai...
