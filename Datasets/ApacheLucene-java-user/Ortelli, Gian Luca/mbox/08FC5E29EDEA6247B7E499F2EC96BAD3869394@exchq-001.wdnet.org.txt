Well, the exact definition we're going to find out empirically, 
as we run an implementation through our data and look at the quality 
of results... For now, I would use the number of tokens between the
finding ("abc@def.com") and the word that gives context ("Contact").

Anyway, replying to karl: I'm not searching for a given
email/street/time interval/etc., I need to extract EVERY
email/street/time interval/etc. from the text. The kind of need for
which you suggest a natural language processing tool.

Before answering, how to you measure "proximity"? You can make
Lucene work with locations (there's an example in Lucene In Action)
readily enough though....
