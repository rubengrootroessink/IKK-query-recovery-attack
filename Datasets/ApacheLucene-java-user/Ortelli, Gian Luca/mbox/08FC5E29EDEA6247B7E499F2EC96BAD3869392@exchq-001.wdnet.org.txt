SUBJECT: Extracting contact data
DATE: 13 Jan 2010

Hi community,

 

I have a general understanding of Lucene concepts, and I'm wondering if
it's the right tool for my job:

 

- I need to extract data like e.g. time intervals ("8am - 12pm"), street
addresses from a set of files. The common issue with this data unit is
that they contain spaces and are not always definable through regexes.

 

- the extraction must take into consideration the "proximity": for
example, a mail address which is close to the work "Contacts" will
receive a higher rank, since I'm looking for contact data.

 

Do you think I can get any advantage from building a solution on Lucene?

 

  Gianluca
