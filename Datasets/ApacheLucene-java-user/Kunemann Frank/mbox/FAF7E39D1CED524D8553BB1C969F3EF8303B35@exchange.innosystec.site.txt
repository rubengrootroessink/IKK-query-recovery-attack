Hi,

HitCollector sounds very interesting - do you have an example for how to use it?

Hello (redirecting to java-user@),

If you want to have more control over scoring and dealing with hits,
use HitCollector.  Then you can break out when you accumulate enough
results.  Note that scores in HitCollector are not normalized as are
the one coming from IndexSearcher's search(...) methods.
