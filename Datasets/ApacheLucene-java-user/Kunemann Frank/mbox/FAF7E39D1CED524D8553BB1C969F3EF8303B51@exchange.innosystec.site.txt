This depends on the analyzer you are using. You can find the standard
analyzers in org.apache.lucene.analysis. To find out what they do, I
recommend the example in Lucene in action in 4.2.3 called
"AnalyzerDemo". If you don't have the book, you can also download the
examples from http://www.manning.com/books/hatcher2 (look for source
code).
