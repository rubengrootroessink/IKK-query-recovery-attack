Maybe you should write your own analyzer for this case that changes all letters to lower case
but keeps all the numbers and signs as they are.
The other solution is not to use an analyzer for this field.

Subject: Problems in standard Analyzer


Hi Mark and other Gurus,

I am indexing one value as a key field (rtf & txt indexing) , value is like
12345 or 123-09-34 or it can be like MN12345.
Problem is if the value is like 12345 or 123-23-98 , Standard Analyzer is
able to search it, but if the value is like MN12345 search will not return
any results, and more over if I search for MN12345 through WhiteSpace
Analyzer I am getting the results.

Can any body help?
