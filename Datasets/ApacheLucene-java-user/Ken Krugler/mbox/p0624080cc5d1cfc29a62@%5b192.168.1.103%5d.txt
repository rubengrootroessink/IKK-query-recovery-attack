Well, 10K is actually a small number of docs.

And the real question is how many documents will typically be part of 
the found set, and thus in the set that needs to be filtered.

So try that first, as that's the obvious approach (to me, at least). 
Note that for this type of filtering, the way that you do the 
calculation will have a performance impact - e.g. you might want to 
use bitfields versus iterating over group names in the stored field.

Since the set of a document's groups has to be a complete subset of 
the user's groups, you can't use the typical approach of having a doc 
field with every group in it, then adding a required subclause to 
your query with every group as a boolean OR term.
