Some additional clarification below:

Just U+00A0-> U+00FF would be considered Latin-1 by Unicode.

Unicode calls the block of Unicode code points from U+0000 -> U+007F 
"C0 Controls and Basic Latin".

 From U+0080 to U+00FF is "C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement".

There's an ISO 8859-1 charset (combination of character set, code 
points and encoding) that matches Unicode code points for 0x00 -> 
0x7F and 0xA0 -> 0xFF. Or rather, the Unicode code points for these 
two ranges were selected to match ISO 8859-1.

This isn't really about the "original encoding" - by the time 
ISOLatin1AccentFilter is called, it's dealing with Java strings, 
which use the UTF-16 Unicode encoding.

I think what Michael is asking for is the implementation of one of 
the Unicode-defined normalization forms (see 
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/) along with diacritical 
stripping and other folding. Basically it's a way of mapping 
characters to a primary sort key.

This is pretty complex, especially when you start considering 
locale-specific details - we used ICU support for this in the past, 
which is where I'd probably start. ICU needs a lot of data to handle 
this properly across most locales, so it's not lightweight, but it 
would give you a general (albeit slower) solution.
