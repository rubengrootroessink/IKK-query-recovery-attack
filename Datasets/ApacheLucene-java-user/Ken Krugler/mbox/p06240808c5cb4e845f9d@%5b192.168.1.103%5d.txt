SUBJECT: Re: How to compute the simlarity of a web page?
DATE: 25 Feb 2009

FWIW, we did something similar with our vertical 
crawl for Krugle. For each web page, we'd 
generate a TreeMap of terms/frequencies. Then 
we'd calculate the angle between this term vector 
representation, and a target term vector we 
generated by analyzing many "good" pages.

Since we were using Nutch, we'd use this score to 
adjust the OPIC weights for the outlinks, thus 
focusing the crawl on pages referenced by what we 
considered to be "good" pages. Though the way 
Nutch used OPIC made it highly susceptible to 
spammy link farms, so you'd need to add code to 
guard against that if you take this approach.

Note that most of the work here will be in 
analyzing the results and then tuning your target 
term vector - e.g. which terms (stop words) do 
you ignore, should you use unit vectors (all 
frequencies set to 1), what set of data do you 
use to generate the target term vector, etc.

Something we didn't do, which seemed valuable, 
would be to use phrases vs. single terms, along 
the lines of Amazon's SIPs (statistically 
improbable phrases).
