You could use Katta for this, as another option - it's an open source 
distributed Lucene search system.

Under the hood Katta uses ZooKeeper to handle distribution of data to 
multiple servers. Once Katta has added an index to both systems, then 
you can switch to it (and eventually remove the old index).

The fact that you'd need two Katta "masters" makes things a bit more 
interesting, as you'd have to coordinate when they both decide to 
switch to using the new index(es).
