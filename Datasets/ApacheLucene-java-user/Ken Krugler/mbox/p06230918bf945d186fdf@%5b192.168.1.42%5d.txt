Subclipse is the Eclipse plug-in for Subversion. Though I've found 
that things work best if I:

a. Use the command line or a client like SmartSVN to get the project 
files - and I don't put them into the Eclipse Workspace directory.

b. Then launch Eclipse and create a new Java project, importing the 
files from the external (SVN-controlled) location.
