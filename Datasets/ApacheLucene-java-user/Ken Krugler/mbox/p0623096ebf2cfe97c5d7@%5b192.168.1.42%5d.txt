Recently I'd posted the following to the Nutch mailing list, since 
the topic of determining web page languages had come up there as well:

Prager also uses an n-gram approach, so you might be able to take 
advantage of some of his research into optimal values for <n>.

The code to Linguini doesn't seem to be available (you have to 
purchase some IBM product(s) to get it) so what you've done is great 
for the open source community - thanks!

Also I could post to the Unicode list re training data in multiple 
languages, as that's a good place to find out about multilingual 
corpora.
