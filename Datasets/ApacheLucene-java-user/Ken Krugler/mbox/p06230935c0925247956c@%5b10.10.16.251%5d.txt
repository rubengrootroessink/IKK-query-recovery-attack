I believe they are blindly merged.

Which means that the IDFs for terms between multiple indices must be 
relatively equal, otherwise the results will be skewed.

The simple approach that most people take when dealing with this 
issue is to generate a larger set of smaller indices from the total 
data set, then randomize the selection of indices that get merged to 
form the N final indices. This randomization helps avoid the IDF skew 
problem.

There's an Jira issue on the Nutch side (see NUTCH-92) around this 
same problem.
