Back in March 2007 there was a similar thread, where Philipp Nanz 
pinged this list about his "FuzzyPhraseQuery". Search on subject == 
"alternative scoring algorithm for PhraseQuery".

I believe Paul Elschot gave him some useful input, but then Philipp 
seemed to have dropped off the list...and he didn't respond to my 
email asking him if he was able to complete this work.
