For a hard-core approach to this problem, you could try converting 
all text to Unicode first, then use the ICU package to create a level 
0 "sort key" (the C API is col_getSortKey). This will be a string 
suitable for comparison to determine weak equality, but you can also 
just index it as a regular token.

There are some subtle issues w/locale-specific behavior of the sort 
key generation step, where you could guess at the right locale to use 
for the conversion, but in general that shouldn't matter.

Two other issues are code/data size (ICU can be big) and the 
performance hit while indexing documents.
