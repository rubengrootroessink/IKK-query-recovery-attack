SUBJECT: Search for more than one term
DATE: 27 Jan 2010


Hello:
IÃ„m working with Lucene for my thesis, please I need answers to
these questions:
1. How can I tell Lucene to search for more than one term??? (for example:
the query "house garden computer" will return documents in which at least
one of the
term appears) What classes I need to use?
2. Lucene works well in Windows, Mac OS X, Linux y Unix??? what other
platform?

Thanks in advanced,
Carmen
