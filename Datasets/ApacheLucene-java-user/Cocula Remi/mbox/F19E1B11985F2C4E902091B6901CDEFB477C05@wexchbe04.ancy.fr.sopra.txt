Note that as far as one of the threads keep a reference on the IndexSearcher it can not be
garbage collected.
Perhaps you meant that you do not know how a thread can declare that it does no more need
the indexSearcher.

To cope this that I created an IndexSercher pool.
The pool contains a list of IndexSearchers and each one is associated with a counter. 
To get an IndexSearcher reference one must request it to the pool and then the counter is
incremented.
(To make it cleaner I had the idea to replace IndexSearcher references in the pool with proxy
objects thus the pool will never distribute references of IndexSearchers to clients objects.
The counter can be manage inside the proxy.)

The pool has the ability to close and dereference an IndexSearcher when it is no more used
(counter=0).

Hope it helps.
