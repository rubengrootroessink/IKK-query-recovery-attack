I have created a tool that could respond to your question.
It is called "Lucene Server" (http://luceneserver.sourceforge.net/)
It is a tool for integration of Lucene in distributed environnements (via RMI). 

A new release is under developpement. It will include a paginated search service using XML.

If you are interested by this project just try it; I will support you.

Regards.

Objet?: Searching and indexing from different processes (applications)



Hi.

I just started to play around with Lucene.  I was
wondering if searching and indexing can be done
simultaneously from different processes (two different
processes.)  For example, searching is serviced from a
web appliation, while indexing is done periodically
from a stand-alone application.

What would be the best way to implement this?  

Thanks.
