SUBJECT: Question about multi-searching [re-post]
DATE: 22 Nov 2004




> Hi,

> 
> 
> I want to search into several indexes (indices ?).
> For that, I parse a new query using QueryParser or MultiFieldQueryParser.
> Then I search my indexes using the MultiSearcher class.
> 
> Ok, but the problem comes when different analyzer are used for each index.
> QueryParser requires an analyzer to parse the query but a query parsed with an analyzer
is not suitable for searching into an index that uses another analyzer.

> Does anyone know a trick to cope this problem.
> 
> Eventually I could run a different query on each index to obtain several Hits objects.

> Then I could write some collector that collects Hits in the order of highest scores.
> I wonder if this could work and if it would be as efficient as the MultiSearcher . In
this situation does it make sense to compare  the scores of two differents Hits.
