I have run my code with eclipse debugger and the IndexReader is closed (I mean it steps into
the reader.close() statement)
but the search over this IndexReader still works.

Should a query work on a closed indexReader or should it throw an IOException ?

IndexSearcher.close:

   public void close() throws IOException {
     if(closeReader)
       reader.close();
   }

However, you open it with a String:

Which should close the underlying IndexReader.

Maybe this was a bug that has since been fixed in CVS (which is the 
code I'm referencing)?
