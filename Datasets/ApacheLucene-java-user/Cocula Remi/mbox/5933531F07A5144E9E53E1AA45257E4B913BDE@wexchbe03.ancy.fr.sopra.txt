Lucene is not dedicated to a special application type. 
Your can integrate it's fonctionnalities in any program that can invoke java APIs.

In particular I don't think that Lucene can be invoked from an applet as the applet API does
not permit to read and write local files.

I want to create a knowledgebase but it needs to be something that does
not require a server to run constantly (like with using jsp). I just
needs to run on the Windows platform.  Lucene works well with Windows
using an applet right?
