What is LucenePDFDocument ?
Is it a sample class ?

However  LucenePDFDocument.getDocument(myPdfFile) should create a document containing an indexed
field.
You can achieve  that for instance by using Field.Text().

			writer = new IndexWriter("c:\\tmp\\index",ana,true);
			Document doc = new Document();
			doc.add(Field.Text("text","toto li toto"));
			writer.addDocument(doc);
			writer.close();

please refer to the static methods of the Field class.

Hi Karthik/Cocula,

Luke didn't work but Limo helped.I seem to get results when i use Limo for my text/xls files.
Now the problem with pdf search
The problem that i see is the "summary" field as seen through LIMO is not indexed and hence
no hits.
I'm using the default document got by 
 LucenePDFDocument.getDocument(myPdfFile);
So how do i ensure that a few of the fields in this which are not indexed are set to indexed.
As far as I can see I can only probe whether a field is indexed or not by using 
Field.isIndexed() but is there a method by which i can set to indexed.
can someone provide any help or pointers in this regard?
 
Thanks & Regards,
Chetan

Hi ,

It might seem elementary to most of you.
I am trying to build a search tool for internal use using lucene.
I have used the following
for
.pdf --> PDFBOx
.html --> demo file of lucene(HTMLDocument)
.xls --> poi

The indexing seems to work without throwing up any errors.
But,when i try to search i end up getting with zero hits always.
I have tried to use the same string that i see (System.out.print(Document))
but in vain.
Can somebody let me know where and what could be wrong.
Regards,
Chetan
