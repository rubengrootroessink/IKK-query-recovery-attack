SUBJECT: RE: need info for database based Lucene but not flat file
DATE: 27 Apr 2004

As lucene implements its own concept of document it is not dedicated to index a particular
type of data source.
It's up to you to write a tool that is able to browse your database and then submit the data
as Lucene documents to the Lucene indexer.

For example if your database contains a "customer" entity and you want to index all informations
about these customers, you can create a module that will perform a select on the customer
table an for each row  returned create un Lucene Document and then add it to the indexWriter.
It is recommended that your Lucene Document contains a keyword Field  that represent the unique
id of a customer in the database.

As a first step you should be familiar with the concept of Document and Field. See Lucene
short intro documentation.

Objet : need info for database based Lucene but not flat file


As known, currently Lucene uses flat file to store information for
indexing. 

Any people has idea or resources for combining database (Like MySQL or
PostreSQL) and Lucene instead of current flat index file formats?
