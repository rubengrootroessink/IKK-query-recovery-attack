A keyword is not tokenized, that's why you wont be able to search over a part of it. You'd
rather use a Text fied.

About creating a special field  : 
....
IndexWriter Ir = ....
....
File f = ....
Document  doc = new Document();
if (f.toString.startsWith("C:\tomcat\webapps\Root\Group1")
{
	doc.add(Field.Text("group", "Group1"));
}
if (f.toString.startsWith("C:\tomcat\webapps\Root\Group2")
{
	doc.add(Field.Text("group", "Group2"));
}
doc.add(Field.Text("content", getContent(f)));
Ir.addDocument(doc);

....

Then you can search in group1 with query like that : 

     group:Group1 AND rest_of_the_query.

Well in my case the path is KeyWord. I had tried that earlier and it does not seems to work
in a single index file. 
 
Can you explain a bit more about adding group1 and group2 ?

Well you could add a field to each of your Documents whose value would be either "group1"
or "group2".
Or you could use the path to your files ...

I am clear with looping recursively to index all the file under Root folder.
But the problem is if I want to search only in group1 or group2.Is that possible to search
only in one of the group folder ?

You just have to loop recurssively over the C:\tomcat\webapps\Root tree to create your index.
Yes you can index databases; you will just have to write a mechanism that is able to create
org.apache.lucene.document.Document from database.
For instance : 
- connect JDBC
- run a query for obtaining a ResultSet
- loop for each row of that ResultSet :
Create a new org.apache.lucene.document.Document from ResultSet data
and add this document to the Index.
end loop.

For incremental indexing, I suppose you have to store some timestamp field in your index;
but it's up to you.
Note that Lucene is very fast and I don't think that incremetal indexing is required for small
or medium amout of data.

Hi

I have implemented Text based search using lucene. I was wonderful playing around with it.

Now I want to enchance the application.

I have a Root folder, under that I have many other folder, that are group specific, say (group1,
group2, .. so on). The Root folder is in C:\tomcat\webapps\Root and group folder within that.

Now I am index for these groups separately, ie , I have index as C:/index/group1, C:/index/group2,
C:/index/group3 and so on

I want to know if I can have only one index for all these say C:/index/Root (this has index
for all the folder) and I should be able to Search using C:\tomcat\webapps\Root\group1(if
want to search for group1) similarly for the other groups.

Let me know if this is possible and have anybody tried this.

2nd question

Is lucene good to index databases ? How do we support incremental indexing ?

(Right now I am using LIKE for searching )

Thanks in Advance

Mahaveer
