SUBJECT: About counting term hits
DATE: 12 Nov 2008

Hello:

I am new to LUCENE and I am testing some issues about it. I can retrieve
the number of documents which satisfies a query, but I don't find how to
obtain the number of terms which match it.

For example, if I search for the word "house", I want to obtain the
number of times the word occurs (not the number of documents).

Is it possible to do it in LUCENE?

Thanks in advance,

  Mario Barcala
