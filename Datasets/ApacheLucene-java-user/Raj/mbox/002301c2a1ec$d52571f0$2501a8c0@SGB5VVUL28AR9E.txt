Hello All,
               My program indexing a string---
London/Bristol/LondonEast/Scotland   using standarad anlyser.
when i seach with a word   london    it doesnt comeup in the hits.  If i
search for "london"   it is coming.
Where would be the problem?
should it requires a custom tokenizer  which should tokenize the  /  s in
the input string while indexing. Or is that facility is available in
StandardTokenizer already.
Thanks..
