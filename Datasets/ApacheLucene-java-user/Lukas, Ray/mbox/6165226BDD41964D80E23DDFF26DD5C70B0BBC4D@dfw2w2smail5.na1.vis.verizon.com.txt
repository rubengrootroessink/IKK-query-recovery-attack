SUBJECT: Query against newly created index.. Do not work
DATE: 27 Feb 2009

 

I can now create indexes with Nutch, and see them in Luke.. this is
fantastic news, well for me it is beyond fantastic.. 
Now I would like to (need to) query them, and to that end I wrote the
following code segment.

		int maxHits = 1000;
		NutchBean nutchBean = new NutchBean(nutchConf);
		Query nutchQuery = Query.parse(nutchSearchTerm,
nutchConf);
		Hits nutchHits = nutchBean.search(nutchQuery, maxHits);
		return nutchHits.getLength();

In Luke if I do a query string like:

title:credit union

I receive 6 hits. The code above returns zero hits. I think that I am
doing this correctly, indeed coping this code directly from the WIKI
(thanks Chaz for giving us this).. 

searcher.dir, and plugin.folders inside of nutch-site.xml are correctly
set.

<property>
  <name>searcher.dir</name>
  <value>outputDir</value>
  <description>
 	 Path to root of crawl.  
  </description>
</property>
<property>
  <name>plugin.folders</name>
  <value>plugins</value>
  <description>
	Directories where nutch plugins are located.
  </description>
</property>

Any ideas? Oh and thanks for any help, of course..
