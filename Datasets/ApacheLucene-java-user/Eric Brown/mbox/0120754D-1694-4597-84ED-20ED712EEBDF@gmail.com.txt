SUBJECT: How important is closing an IndexSearcher/IndexModifier on application exit?
DATE: 29 Nov 2006

I'm the only application accessing my index. Is there any chance the  
lucene index might remain in a locked state if I don't call close()  
my IndexSearcher or IndexModifier on applicaiton exit?

I'm several layers down in a webapp, so using Runtime.addShutdownHook 
() is unreliable if my webapp is undeployed by my container. And  
using finalizers for this seems unreliable. I don't have access to  
the ServletContext. I suppose I would write some kind of lifecycle  
thing.

Cheers,
Eric
