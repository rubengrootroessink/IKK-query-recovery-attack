SUBJECT: Making Highlighter.mergeContiguousFragments() public
DATE: 23 Oct 2007

I was wondering if people thought that making
Highlighter.mergeContiguousFragments() public (and non-final) would be
acceptable. In my application, I want to strip all fragments with score == 0
before merging the fragments (to get the minimal matching section, but still
in order), and the easiest way to do so would be to override that method.
Not a big deal, but I thought other people might find it useful. Making the
method public static would also achieve the same result, allowing me to call
the function separately.

Thanks,
