SUBJECT: Re: Internationalization - Arabic Language Support
DATE: 28 Jun 2002

Lucene is an extensible API that allows for multiple language support.
However, some languages or style of languages have not yet been supported
with the current code.

The biggest part that is usually changed per language is the analyzer. This
is the part of Lucene which transforms and breaks up a string into distinct
terms. These terms are then added to the index (as well as which documents
they are in). Currently there are analyzers for English and German style
languages (see org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard and
org.apache.lucene.analysis.de) as part of the source.

Once you have created (or use a current) analyzer which meets your needs,
Lucene will index the content and provide the search results.

If you do create another analyzer, please contribute it back to the project
so others may take advantage of your work.

I hope this helps.
