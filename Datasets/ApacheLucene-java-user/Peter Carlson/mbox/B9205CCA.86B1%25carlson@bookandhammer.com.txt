There should be no problem, especially if you are working on a unix based
machine.

Since the reader will be using the current index and the optimizer will be
creating a new index there should be no problem. However, you will have to
close the reader and reopen it to have it use the new index.

There has been some mention on the list about the optimizer deleting the old
indexes, but if you are using a unix machine then the index files will still
be available as long as one process is using them. I don't know how this
would work on Windows (my guess is it wouldn't be able to delete the index
files in use).

At least this is my understanding.
