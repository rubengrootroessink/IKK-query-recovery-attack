You are correct in using the "-" symbol to remove a term from a search
result, but you cannot have that as your only query.

That is Lucene does not support returning all results but the ones that do
not match a certain criteria. If you want to do this, you must add a field
that always exists and then add the no term to that.

So something like

exists:true NOT pradeep
