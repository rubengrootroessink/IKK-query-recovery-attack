SUBJECT: Re: indexing and searching different file formats
DATE: 13 Feb 2002

Hi pradeep,

The Lucene Document is not document type specific. It is a Lucene class
which is made up of fields (which have different options).
Data in a document is parsed and put into a one for more of these fields.

So Lucene can really handle any kind of document, their just needs to be a
document parser that puts the document into the Lucene Document format.


I hope this helps.
