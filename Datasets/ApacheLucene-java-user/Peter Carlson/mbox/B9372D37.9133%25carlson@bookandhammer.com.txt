Sorry about that, I meant the id in the Lucene class Hits.

You are really accessing the id data member from the HitDoc class, but that
class is in Hits.

The code would be

    /** Returns the id for the nth document in this set. */
  public final float id(int n) throws IOException {
    return hitDoc(n).id;
  }

Just like getting the score.
