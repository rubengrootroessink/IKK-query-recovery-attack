HI,
The AND is not quite the same as +, the AND puts a + next to the previous
and next word.
That is foo AND bar is equivlent to +foo +bar
If you just said foo +bar then you have foo optional and bar required.

Slight difference.

>From looking at the queryParser a while ago the {} characters are exclusive
(or maybe it's inclusive) range query operators, similar to [].  I don't
think they make sense here.
