SUBJECT: Re: is there any way to create and manage a controlled vocabulary	in lucene?
DATE: 26 Feb 2002

Hi,
Are you just trying to have Lucene index terms that are in your Vocaulary.

If you, then you can great your own analyzer returns words in your
vocabulary.

Also, you could use the StandardAnalyzer, and then you could create your own
Lucene Document and only add words that match your vocabulary.

If you just want to see if it works, you might try to just add code on top
of your own document. There are many examples of Lucene Documents. The
HTMLDocument in the demo or just the text document.

Hope this helps
