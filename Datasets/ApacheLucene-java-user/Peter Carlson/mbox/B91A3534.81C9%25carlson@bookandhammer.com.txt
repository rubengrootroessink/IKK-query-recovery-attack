Hi Christian,

You will need to create your own Tokenizer.
Use the StandardTokenizer.jj file as a guide and instead of using a tokens
like


  // basic word: a sequence of digits & letters
  <ALPHANUM: (<LETTER>|<DIGIT>)+ >


Use

<ALPHAONLY: (<LETTER>)+>

And

<NUMONLY: (<DIGIT>)+>


I don't know what your patterns are, but this will help you out.

Also, you may have to change the QueryParser.jj to do the same thing.
