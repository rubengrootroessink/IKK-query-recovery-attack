SUBJECT: Query Parser Syntax documentation now available
DATE: 16 May 2002

Lucene supports creating your own query syntax, but also provides a default
QueryParser implementation using JavaCC to parse query strings into Lucene
Query objects.

In hopes to provide some better understanding, there is now a Query Parser
Syntax document available which describes the features of this
implementation and some examples.

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html

It is also located in the resources menu on the Lucene web site.

I hope this proves helpful.
