Hi Bernhard,

I think this is a very interesting issue.

I think that changing the scoring algorithm is one part of it, the other is
to get the information from the Document to use in the ranking. Since this
is an expensive operation, there will have to be an alternative approach.

Do you have any suggestions to start?

Thanks
