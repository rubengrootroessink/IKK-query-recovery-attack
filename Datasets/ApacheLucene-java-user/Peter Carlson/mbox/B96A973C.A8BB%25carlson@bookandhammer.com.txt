Thanks for the feedback.

get more people to help and hopefully help other too.


I think if you change the SortedField.addField method to

    /** adds the data from the index into a string array
     */
    private void addSortedField(String fieldName, IndexReader ir) throws
IOException{
        int numDocs = ir.numDocs();
        fieldValues = new String[numDocs];
        for (int i=0; i<numDocs; i++) {
            if(ir.isDeleted(i) == false){
                fieldValues[i] = ir.document(i).get(fieldName);
            } else {
                fieldValues[i] = "";
            }
        }
        ir.close();
    }


I think this will work. I'm not yet sure if this is the best way to go, but
I think it will get around the bug. It removes any field values you are
sorting on in the field so you should never run into a problem.

I don't have an unoptimized index at hand, and unfortunately no time to
test. Please let me know if this works.


Thanks
