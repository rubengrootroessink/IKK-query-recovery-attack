Please send questions to the users list, you will get  a faster and 
more varied response.

To answer your question Yes,

Lucene uses it own internal format called a Document made up of fields 
and data. By adding the content you want into a Lucene Document you can 
index most any text. If you want to parse the content in a special way 
you may need to create your own parser.

There are many Document creators available in the contributions section 
of the site or in the example code.
