Phil,

Lucene returns results in the same order as they were added to the  
index. So if you want to sort by date, and only by date then add  
documents to your index in chronological order.

If you want to sort by more than one field, then one solution (and  
probably the fastest) is to get all terms of a given field and sort  
them along with their unique Lucene ID. Then, when you want to sort the  
subset of results, so the sort yourself based on the ID without using  
the index (using the index to get the values to sort will be much  
slower then getting all the values first and storing them). This was  
done in SearchBean in the contributions area if you want to see an  
example.

I hope this helps

--Peter
