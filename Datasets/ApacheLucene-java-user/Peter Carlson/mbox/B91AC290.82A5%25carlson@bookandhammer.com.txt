SUBJECT: Date Range Searches using QueryParser
DATE: 30 May 2002

Hi,

Has anyone used the Range Search built into the queryParser to search by
date?

For example, something like

April 1, 2002 -> 0czi1cego
April 10, 2002 -> 0czuu5woo

Then do a search using like

date:[0czi1cego-0czuu5woo]


I am running into a problem where I get the correct start date but I always
get the last date in the system (for me this is 6/1/02).

What is looks like is happening is it takes the first date in the range and
goes until the end.

Does anyone else have experience with this?

Thanks

--Peter
