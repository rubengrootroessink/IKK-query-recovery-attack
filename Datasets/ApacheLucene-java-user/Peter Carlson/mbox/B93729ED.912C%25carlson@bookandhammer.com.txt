Hi,

Nader, if you can find a faster way to sort the results I would be excited
to see it.

Just for reference I have not done anything to optimize the sorting yet,
such as using the TopDocs method currently used in Lucene to sort by score
and I am getting very acceptable results sorting by getting the results and
sorting them all.

My current numbers are .098 sec to get 8377 results with out sorting
With sorting by date .373 seconds.
Yes it's 3 times longer, but from a users perspective, it's hardly
noticeable.

You are right that as the number of results increase, the current method
gets much longer.
For 15205 records in the result, .074 seconds without sorting .736 sec with
sorting. Still from a user's perspective, this is hardly noticeable.

Again, any suggestions on how to make this faster would help everyone.
