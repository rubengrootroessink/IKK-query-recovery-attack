I don't know the actual algorithm, but when you type in the search

title:hello^3 AND heading:dolly^4

Will product different document scores than

title:hello AND heading:dolly^4

Lucene will get the score for a given document, not a field. So it does
combine the results of the two fields together. Again, I don't know how it
combines them.

I just tried it on my project and depending on what the boost factor is per
field, it changes the overall score.

I hope this helps
