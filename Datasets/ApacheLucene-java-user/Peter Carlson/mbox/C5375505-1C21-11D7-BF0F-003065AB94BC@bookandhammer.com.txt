SUBJECT: Re: Querying for documents that have a field
DATE: 30 Dec 2002

I don't know if the core API provides this feature since I don't think 
you can search just using a wildcard.

However, you may want to provide 1 or more fields which describe the 
fields available in this document.

field1exists:true

or

add the field names of the fields that exist in 1 Lucene field 
separated by spaces so the tokenizer breaks them into multiple terms.


Then search the exists field for the fields you want

exists:field1 OR exists:field2

Just some thoughts.
