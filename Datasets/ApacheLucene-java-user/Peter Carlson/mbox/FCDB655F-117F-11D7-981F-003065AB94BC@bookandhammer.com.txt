I don't think so.

One approach to look for everything, or not something is to add a field 
to each document which is a constant value. Like a field named exists 
and a value of true.

Then you can do search like

exists:true NOT microsoft

This will find all documents without the term microsoft in them.

Just to have it find documents with nothing might be a little tricky. 
You might want to put a field in the document which indicates the size 
or something like that. Or just create an empty field and look for

empty:true

I hope this rambling helps
