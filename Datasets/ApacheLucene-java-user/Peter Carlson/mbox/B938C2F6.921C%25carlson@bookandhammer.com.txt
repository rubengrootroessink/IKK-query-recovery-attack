Lucene supporting boosting of terms in a query which will increase it
relative weighting in the search results, but this is not supported on a
index level.

So you could get the users query and add a boost factor to those fields you
want to have higher relevancy. There has been some discussion on how to do
this at the indexing level, but nothing has started yet.
