SUBJECT: Lucene Release 1.2-RC5
DATE: 22 May 2002

Hello all Lucene users,

Lucene Release 1.2-RC5 was released last week. We are hoping that this (or
some minor fix of this) will be the final release for Lucene 1.2.

Please test this release out and let us know about any issues you have. The
goal is to release within the next week so it would be great if people could
test sooner than later.

Thanks

--Peter
