This depends on your analyzer. Currently it splits on words.

How do you want it to split? Is there other text around this? I guess you
could write your own analyzer that if it finds a special phrase it would add
it as a phrase. If you did it this way, you would have to use similar
methodology to parse the query string itself.


Another option I can think of if you are just indexing text is to have
something that filters out your product names that looks for such things.

So if only OrthoMed is in the query string and not Cathflo then add the
query clause 

NOT Cathflo.

This seems like it might get very complicated though.

I hope someone else comes up with more elegant solutions.
