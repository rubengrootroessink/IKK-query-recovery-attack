Hi,

If you are using the queryParser and the standardAnalyzer you would use a
querystring like


title:lucene AND summary:engine


So the pattern is <field name>:<search string without spaces (unless your
searching a phrase)>

Also, you don't have to explicitly put the field name if you are searching
the default field.  That is if title is the default field the search would
be 

lucene AND summary:engine

Hope this helps.
