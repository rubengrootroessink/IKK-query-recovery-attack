SUBJECT: Lucene Site Updated
DATE: 30 Oct 2002

The Lucene Website has been updated with some new content.

A Lucene File Format that was originally just an attachement from Doug 
Cutting was transformed to xml/html by Otis Gospodnetic. This document 
is available in the left hand nav area.

Also, the LARM project now has html documentation. Originally by 
Clemens Marschener  in PDF, .doc format, it is now in xml/html format 
by Otis Gospodnetic and is available under lucene-sandbox/larm in left 
hand nav area.

Please let us know if there are any issues with the site.

Thanks

--Peter
