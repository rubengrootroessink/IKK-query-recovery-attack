I see, it's not a single letter, it really a contains.

I think that the best way to do this would be to write your own Query,
similar to WildcardQuery.

Just a warning, this will be really slow compared to other searches Queries
since you will have no defined begin or end points in the set of terms that
you are enumerating. You have to go through the complete list of terms.

Also, you will have to either write your own QueryParser or modify the
current QueryParser to look for the pattern:

*xyz*

and create a ContainsQuery and pass it the text your are looking for.

If you end of adding this functionality, please submit your code so other
who need the same functionality can use it.

I hope this helps
