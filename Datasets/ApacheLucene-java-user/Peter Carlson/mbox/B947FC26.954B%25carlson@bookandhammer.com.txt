SUBJECT: Integration with Struts
DATE: 3 Jul 2002

Hi,

I don't know much about Struts, but it seems like a web app framework using
taglibs. I don't know if anyone has created a search based functionality
using Taglibs for Lucene, but it is definitely doable.

Otherwise, Lucene is a Java based Text Search API that integrates well with
other Java applications.

You might want to look at the SearchBean in the lucene-sandbox/contributions
area for a start toward creating a unified frontend.
