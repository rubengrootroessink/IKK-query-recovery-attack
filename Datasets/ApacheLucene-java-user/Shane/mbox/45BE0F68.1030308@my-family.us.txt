Not sure if this is what you are after, but there is a projet call 
File2XLIFF4j which converts a number of file formats to XLIFF (an XML 
structure) using OpenOffice.org.  And if I am not mistaken, Lucene has 
code available for indexing XML.  The project is located at 
http://file2xliff4j.sourceforge.net.
