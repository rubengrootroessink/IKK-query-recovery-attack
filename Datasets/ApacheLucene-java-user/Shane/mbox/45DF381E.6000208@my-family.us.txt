SUBJECT: Determining if index exists Lucene 2.1
DATE: 23 Feb 2007

Hi,

Prior to Lucene 2.1, I was using FSDirectory.getDirectory(String path, 
boolean create)|| inside of a try block to determine whether or not a 
directory existed.

With the deprecation of the above class call in Lucene 2.1,  I need a 
new method for determining the existence of an index.  I can just check 
to see if either of the files INDEX_PATH/segments or 
INDEX_PATH/segments.gen exist, but that doesn't seem like the best route.

Is there a function call to determine whether or not an index already 
exists?

Thanks,

Shane
