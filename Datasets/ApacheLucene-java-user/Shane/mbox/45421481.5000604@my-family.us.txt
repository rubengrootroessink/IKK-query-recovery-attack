SUBJECT: Re: Indexing slows down considerably after a few million documents
DATE: 27 Oct 2006

Are you doing all 7 million docs with the same writer?  The call to 
optimize will take longer as your index size increases.  So if you are 
actually indexing your docs in smaller chunks, the speed will decrease 
due to the call to optimize.
