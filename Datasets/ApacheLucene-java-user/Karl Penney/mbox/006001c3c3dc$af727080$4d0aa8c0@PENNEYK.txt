One of the token patterns defined by the StandardTokenizer.jj is this:
<NUM: (<ALPHANUM> <P> <HAS_DIGIT>

| <HAS_DIGIT> <P> <ALPHANUM>

| <ALPHANUM> (<P> <HAS_DIGIT> <P> <ALPHANUM>)+

| <HAS_DIGIT> (<P> <ALPHANUM> <P> <HAS_DIGIT>)+

| <ALPHANUM> <P> <HAS_DIGIT> (<P> <ALPHANUM> <P> <HAS_DIGIT>)+

| <HAS_DIGIT> <P> <ALPHANUM> (<P> <HAS_DIGIT> <P> <ALPHANUM>)+

)

So basically if you have some sequences of characters separated by a "-"
character, sequences that contain a digit will be combined with sequences
which are adjacent to it to form a single token.  That explains why the WS
and YYMM sequences got separated out.  You can alter this behavior this with
some simple changes to StandardTokenizer.jj.
