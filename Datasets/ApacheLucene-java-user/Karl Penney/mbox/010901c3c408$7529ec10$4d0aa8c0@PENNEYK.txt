SUBJECT: How to get TokenStream from Field?
DATE: 16 Dec 2003

Is there any way to get a TokenStream for a given Field of a Document (is that information
even stored in the index)?  I want to use the startOffset / endOffset information for hit
highlighting.  Do I have to tokenize the text value for the field again to get this information?
