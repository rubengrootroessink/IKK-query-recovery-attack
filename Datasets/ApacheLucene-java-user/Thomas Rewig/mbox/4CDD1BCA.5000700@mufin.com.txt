SUBJECT: Deleted File Handles - Index Writer
DATE: 12 Nov 2010

  Hello,

I use the searcherManager for LiveIndexing. With  watch -n 60 "lsof | 
grep indexname | grep deleted | wc -l" I see the number of deleted file 
handles. The number of handles fluctuates during the indexing.  0 -> 35 
-> 53 -> 135 -> 40 -> 85 ... Uwe said that this is expected because 
segments are still referenced by the open IndexReaders, but files were 
already deleted by IndexWriter.

But something puzzles me:

Let's say we have a deleted file handle number of 85. If I switch the 
NearRealTime Searcher to the readOnlySearcher the file handle number is 
still 85. If i close afterwards the no more used indexwriter, the number 
drops to 35.  I think that means, that the indexwriter referenced 
deleted files that are not referenced by the readers.  It seems, that 
with every commit the number of deleted file handles (which maybe are 
"caused" by the indexwriter) grows.
Is that possible and if yes why does the indexwriter do it? Is there a 
max Value of deleted handles an IndexWriter could own, because I don't 
want to chrash the system because of too much open filehandles?

Thanks in advance.
Thomas
