SUBJECT: Re: File Handle Leaks During Lucene 3.0.2 Merge
DATE: 10 Nov 2010

  Hello,
please excuse that I hijack this old thread but I have the same problem 
with the deleted file handles, so I think this is the right place for.

I also integrated the searchManager in our Code and see the file handles 
fluctuate up and down. At first glance the situation seems stable but 
the count of the deleted file handles never drops to zero and I think 
the deleted file handles are constantly rising. About +50 handles stay 
per day by refreshing the searchers every 2 minutes and committing after 
10 minutes. I think some deleted handles remain open after the 
committing, but I could not figure out why. The max value of deleted 
handles until now was about 250, because the Index will be changed after 
a few days. Jamie could you achieve that all deleted handles have been 
removed? Do you have some information how to repair this or is that an 
expected behavior and the amount of the deleted file handles will be 
stable - but first at a amount of 500 or so.

Thanks in advance

Thomas
