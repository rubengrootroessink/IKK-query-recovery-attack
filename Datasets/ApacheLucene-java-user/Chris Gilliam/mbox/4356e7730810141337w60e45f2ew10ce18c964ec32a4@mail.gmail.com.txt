Hello Everyone,
New to Lucene..

We currently roughly 100Gig of log files.  We are needing to build a search
application that can return rows of data from the files and combine the
results?

Does Lucene index the content in the files?

Will it be able to find  matching criteria say a date and then return the
next X number of lines?

The indexing piece, how does it work if I am looking for something that has
been added to the file since the indexing has taken place?

Thanks,
Chris
