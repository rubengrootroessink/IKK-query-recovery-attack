Hi, new here.

I recently started using lucene and had encounter a problem.I crawl and
index a number of documents. 
When i perform a search, lets say "tall fat", by right the results that
matches all the keyword should be on top and display first. 

But in my search results, some of the document with only 1 matches of the
keyword like 'tall' is display first. Why is that? What had i done wrong?

can anyone advise me on this? thanks
