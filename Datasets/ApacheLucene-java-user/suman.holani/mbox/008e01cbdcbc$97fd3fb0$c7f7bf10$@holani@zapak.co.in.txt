SUBJECT: performance issues in multivalued fields
DATE: 7 Mar 2011

Hello,

 

I am facing an issue for multivalued fields in lucene

 

I am generating lucene doc , where page is multivalued .

So my doc will be like this having more than n fields( which can be more
than 1500 also ..) per doc in case page attribute

 

 

 

Example


<doc> 
                <media> 
                                <id>12345</id> 
                                <title>A title</title> 
                                <description>My description</description> 
                                <page> 
                                                <!-- The page element can
contain up to 15000 entries!!!! --> 

                                                            page1

Page 2                                                . 
                                               . 
               .n 
               

 </page> 

   </media> 

 

 

</doc> 




 

Will this structure can give a performance hit..?? as number of fields ar
dynamic for every doc..and can be huge.

 

 

 

Actually I am using same structure in clucene and its running awesome. Bt
lucene , is taking huge performance hit 

Specially in . "Document D = searcher.doc(hits[i].doc); "
