SUBJECT: Passing XML objects to the analyzer ?
DATE: 19 Apr 2005


Hi,

I am working on an index to search XML data in a fixed format that I 
master well...
The idea is that the XML content (which I have as JDOM object) actually 
carries the semantic which would be best converted directly into tokens 
by something like an analyzer. However, adding fields is done not using 
the result of the analysis (or a stream thereof) but using readers or 
strings.

I have two choices and would like to know what's the best:
- make the text passed to the analyzer a simple "instruction" which 
will fetch the XML objects and do the analysis there
- make a pre-analysis step which converts it into tokens of text which 
then my analyzer catches again.
I'd be more inclined for the first solution but I fear there's a catch.

Is there one ?

paul
