Nifty question... I'm working on indexing text with math formulae... 
there may be similarities !

So it really seems chem_H2 is the only choice, or ?

What's your requirements or expectations ?
- match a formula in the middle of a sentence ?
- or simply match documents that contain both the sentence's words and 
the formula (in the latter case, I think solution 1 is valid)
- how would you do wildcards with formulae ?

A related question, at least for me, is how to match a+(b+1) when the 
query is X+Y, ie. subtree cut.
Does this occur in chemical formulae as well?
