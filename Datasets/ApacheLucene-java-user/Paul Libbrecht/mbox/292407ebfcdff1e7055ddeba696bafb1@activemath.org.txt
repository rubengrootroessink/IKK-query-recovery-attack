SUBJECT: Querying things "close to" a gang of terms ?
DATE: 22 Apr 2005


Hi,

Many people speak about the cosine distance or variation thereof (even 
probably n-gram things)... nice...

All this geometry has some power but a typical requirement of embedding 
such power is to be able to query documents that are close to this 
query's terms or to this document in the sense of this metric..

As far as I can see, Lucene provides me nothing for this...
The LuceneBook only shows an example where all distances a pre-computed.

Did I miss something ?
Is there another tool ? Maybe infomap ?

thanks

paul
