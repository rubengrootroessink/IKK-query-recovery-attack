SUBJECT: Re: How to know the matched field?
DATE: 24 Mar 2009

Here's my first approach but I note that, typically, I have fields  
(which are not stored) which may be the matching field but still not  
be the one I want to return.
Typically, I have a field "names in all languages along the standard- 
analyzer" which is not the one I want to "see as matched".

         query = query.rewrite(this.getReader());
         QueryScorer scorer = new QueryScorer(query);
         String found = null;
         float maxScore = 0;
         for(Field f: (List<Field>) doc.getFields()) {
             String text = f.stringValue();
             scorer.startFragment(new TextFragment(new  
StringBuffer(text),0,text.length()));
             TokenStream tok = analyzer
                     .tokenStream(f.name(),new StringReader(text));
             System.out.println("Field: " + f + ":: " +f.name() + ": "  
+ f.stringValue());
             Token t=new Token();
             while(tok!=null && (t=tok.next(t))!=null) {
                 float s = scorer.getTokenScore(t);
             }

             float score = scorer.getFragmentScore();
             if(score > maxScore) {
                 maxScore = score;
                 found = text;
             }
         }


I still don't grasp why there's TextFragment(stringbuffer) and the  
pass through the tokenizers but removing any of them breaks my unit- 
test. I guess this is the whole idead behind LUCENE-1522 which I would  
up-take later.
