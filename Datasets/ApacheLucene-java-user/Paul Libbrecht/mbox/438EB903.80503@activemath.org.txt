We're also thinking about implementing something similar to LSI within 
ActiveMath which is lucene-powered where both formulae and text 
searching would benefit of the latent-semantic-similarity. I've been 
refrained of doing "exactly this" at least since LSI is patented. This 
might also be a reason why there's no implementation in Lucene's sandbox.

Have you looked at other vector-based approaches which are not exactly LSI ?
Have you looked at InfoMap NLP ?
