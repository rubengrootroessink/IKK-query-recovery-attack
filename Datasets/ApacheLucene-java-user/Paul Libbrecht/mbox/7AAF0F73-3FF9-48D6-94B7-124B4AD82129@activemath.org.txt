SUBJECT: Lucene index exchange format?
DATE: 9 Nov 2010

hello list,

more and more I seem to encounter situations where the delivery of a prebuilt lucene index
is desirable.

The binary format probably works (experience hints would be welcome) but I fear it would be
fragile with versioning (it certainly fails at version-downgrading).

Did anyone work on a lucene import-export format? Something like XML that would load fairly
fast provided I/O goes fast?

thanks in advance

paul
