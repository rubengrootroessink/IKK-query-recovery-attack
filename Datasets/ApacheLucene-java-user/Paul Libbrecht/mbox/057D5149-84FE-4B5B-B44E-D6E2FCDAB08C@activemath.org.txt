Very interesting, finding the field name is enough for me.
What's cute is to wrap in this Flag-queries because, indeed, I don't  
want to know the details of each matched query just some of them.

two terminology questions:

- is multiplier in the mail mentioned there the same as boost?

- I intended to use prefix and fuzzyqueries. I believe this is  
contradictory to this or?
