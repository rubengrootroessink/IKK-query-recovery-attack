SUBJECT: Re: TR: How to search on all fields with one query ?
DATE: 18 Dec 2008



I would do query expansion:
- receive the query, parse it the way you want (e.g. use QueryParser)
- then expand your query along the various fields
If using different analyzers per field (e.g. soundex), you'll have to  
adjust things when coming into the term-query.
