Hello luceners,

In our project, we are building queries from long list of possible  
terms (expanded through ontology deduction). I would like, however,  
that the rank is unaffected by the number of matches: one or thirty  
occurrences of one of the many words should give the same score.

Did someone make such a query already?
Should I "just craft the Similarity"? (I'd rather avoid it if possible)

thanks in advance

paul
