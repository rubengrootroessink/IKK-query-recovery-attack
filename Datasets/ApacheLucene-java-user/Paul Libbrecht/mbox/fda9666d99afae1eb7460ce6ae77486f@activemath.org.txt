SUBJECT: Re: Sentence boundary storage
DATE: 28 Oct 2005

One thing that I know has bogged me is when matching a phrase where I 
would expect mathematical formula (which is "just a subphrase"). I 
would have liked the phrase-query to extend as far as it wishes but not 
passed a given token... would this be possible ?
Presumably a period token and this feature would have provided the same?
