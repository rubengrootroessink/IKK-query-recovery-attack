?? not in all situations, or ?? You couldn't render it back otherwise 
as is done search-result highlighting.

One thing that tackles me is how much this parameter could, again, be 
something different...

In particular, I'd much prefer to have it a tree-path instead of a 
plain number. I don't have reader plain numbers and they are, often, 
lost in an XML content-base.

hopeable ?
