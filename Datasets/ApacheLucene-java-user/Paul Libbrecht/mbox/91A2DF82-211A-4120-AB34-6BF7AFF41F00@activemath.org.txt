SUBJECT: Re: How to know the matched field?
DATE: 23 Mar 2009

Thanks Erick,

I browsed but no full answer yet.

The closest seems to be the explain method with which I could find the  
exact term-query or prefix-query that matched it, so I would be able  
to find the name of the field. I am still left with iterating through  
the (stored) fields and try to find the individual fields that matched.

I could also make a token-stream with all fields' contents and find  
the field (the fragment) which gets the best score with  
QueryScorer(query)?
(provided query is "rewritten" so that no prefixquery appears anymore,  
right?)

Sounds doable but please confirm this is a correct usage of  
QueryScorer, I am feeling a bit unsafe here.
