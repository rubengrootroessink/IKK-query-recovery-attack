'not treating xml file as text file' is quite fuzzy it doesn't say how 
you treat the files that you wish to perform retrieval on.
It may be of interest to you that I am in the process of allowing 
search for mathematical formulae based on lucene-index built from OMDoc 
encoded documents (an XML syntax extending OpenMath). There, the XML 
nature is tokenized appropriately so that we can match formulae. I can 
manage to search sin(X) where X can be any sub-term, I cannot, yet 
search with joins, i.e. search terms such as f(A,B)=f(B,A) where the 
first and second occurrences of A and B are equal XML trees.

But maybe there's something else in your XML that you wish to 
retrieve...
