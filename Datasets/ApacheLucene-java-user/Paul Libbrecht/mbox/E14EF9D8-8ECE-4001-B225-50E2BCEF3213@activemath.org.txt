sorry, had overseen. Yes, that seems realistic to me.

I'm having an NPE with the query who's toString gives:

  QueryMatchMonitor (QueryMatchMonitor ((title-fr:segm~0.5 title- 
phonetic-fr:SKM~0.5^0.8)) QueryMatchMonitor (((title-en:segm~0.5 title- 
phonetic-en:SKM~0.5^0.8))^0.95) QueryMatchMonitor (((title-de:segm~0.5  
title-phonetic-de:SKM~0.5^0.8))^0.9025) QueryMatchMonitor (((title- 
en:segm~0.5 title-phonetic-en:SKM~0.5^0.8))^0.85737497))

(but note that I removed explain from my FlagCombiningQuery; what's  
null is the delegateScorer).
Any clue?
