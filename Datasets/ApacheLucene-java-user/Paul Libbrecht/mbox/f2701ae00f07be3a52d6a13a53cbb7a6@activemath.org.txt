The way I've solved this is to make a different field-name per-language 
as our documents can be multilingual.
What's then done is query expansion at query time: given a term-query 
for text, I duplicate it for each accepted language of the user with a 
factor related to the preference of the language (e.g. the q factor in 
Accept-Language http header). Presumably I could be using solution 2/ 
as well if my queries become too big, making several documents for each 
language of the document.

I think it's very important to care about guessing the accepted 
languages of the user. Typically, the default behaviour of Google is to 
only give you matches in your primary language but then allow expansion 
in any language.

This one may need particular treatment.

Tell us your success!
