SUBJECT: GWT port of Lucene's QueryParser
DATE: 11 Dec 2008


Hello again list,

has anyone tried to port or simply run the QueryParser of Lucene to GWT?
It would look like a very nice thing to do to provide direct rendering  
of the query interpretation (it could be made into a whole editor  
probably, e.g. removing or selecting parts of the query).

thanks in advance

paul
