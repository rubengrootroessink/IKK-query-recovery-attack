SUBJECT: Re: multi word synonym
DATE: 26 Apr 2005

If I understand well... it would be easy to do so if you do not wish to 
use phrase matches... you could just add a field (with the same name) 
for each token...

I think that, if you wish phrase-matches (or the span-ones) then Lucene 
can't help you... but I'm quite a newbie on this topic.

Is there a hope this becomes different in Lucene 1.9 or 2.0 ??

My dream would be to have the position increments living in a tree... 
you know.... and... XML tree...

thanks

paul
