You'd only need position-increment if using phrase-query... 
otherwise... positions are quite much ignored and you can expand the 
query with an or.
Eg, I'd do expand the query for breath to:

Term(breath)^2 or (Term(breathes) or Term(breathe) or Term(breathing))

I am not sure you can make a phrase-query with possible synonyms for 
phrase-constituents, you'd need to OR the queries with each set of 
possible variations (that grows quick! but do you know many people that 
put large phrase queries?)
