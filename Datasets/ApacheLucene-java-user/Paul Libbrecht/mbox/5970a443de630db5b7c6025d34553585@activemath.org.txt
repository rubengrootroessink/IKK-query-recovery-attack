SUBJECT: work on joins ?
DATE: 24 May 2005


Hi,

from time to time it really looks like it would be useful to be 
searching for something that has, say, term-x, which is the same as the 
term matched in another part of the query...i.e. joins.

Has there been work done on this in Lucene ?

thanks

paul
