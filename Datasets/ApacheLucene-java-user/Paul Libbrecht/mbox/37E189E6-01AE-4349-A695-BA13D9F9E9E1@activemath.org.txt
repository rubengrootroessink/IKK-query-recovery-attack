SUBJECT: Re: underscore a word separator in StandardAnalyzer?
DATE: 15 Mar 2009

Sure, all this is possible, I would know how to make my analyzer.
I just faced this on an existing solution which takes StandardAnalyzer  
for almost everything because it's generic. Therefore I wanted to know  
if there was a rationale.
Of cours URIs have trivial analyzers.
