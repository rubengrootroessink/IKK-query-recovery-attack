You can in both cases. In the second, you need to expand the query (ie 
searching for carrot would search text_en:carrot or text_cn:carrot", 
which, I think is fair as long as you don't a two kilometer's list of 
languages.

If you separate the indices you won't, as far as I know, be able to 
query simultaneously (e.g. some text which, as well, is new 
enough....).
