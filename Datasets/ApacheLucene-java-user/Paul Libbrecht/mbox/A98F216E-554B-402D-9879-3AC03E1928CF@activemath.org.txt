What's funny here is how "uncertainty" can be pushed to different level.
I believe automated translation only makes sense if you know the exact  
source language, often not the case at me so I'm merging all results  
matching all languages, add it with the possibility of typos and  
phonetic matching...

Btw, can a lot of people report on successful language matching on  
using soundex, metaphone or double-metaphone for phonetic matching?

thanks in advance
