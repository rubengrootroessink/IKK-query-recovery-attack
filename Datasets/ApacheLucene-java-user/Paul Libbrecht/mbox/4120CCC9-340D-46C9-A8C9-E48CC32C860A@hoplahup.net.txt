Stephane,

I think that you have the freedom to put what you want in the stored value of a field.

The simplest would even be to make it that the fields that you want to use for display are
stored, preformatted, xml-ished, owl-ified, or json-ized, to be separate from the indexed
fields (where you are only interested to the plain text). 
Payloads seem to be doing a similar job as a separate stored, non-indexed field.

The best approach I had thus far was to use a multiplexing analyzer (which is called for indexed
fields only anyways) that recognizes the language by the suffix of the field name.

As to the difference between one index and several fields or one field in many indices, I
think it is just a programming difference. The tf and idf are always done at the term level
so they make no difference. 

I tend to prefer multiple fields because it's easier to expand a query for, say, Fourrier
sent by a browser that says English but also accepts french and German into:
- a query for Fourrier in the whitespace-tokenized track (always prefer that one)
- a query for fouri in the French field
- a query for fourier in the English and German fields
My current experience is that many users appear or claim to speak many languages (they do,
a little bit).

hope it helps.

paul

PS: not that my code is ideal but here are the ones I have:
 - i2geo, based on an ontology of concepts in OWL, 
	http://i2geo.net/xwiki/bin/view/About/GeoSkills
   and http://svn.activemath.org/intergeo/Platform/SearchI2G/
 - ActiveMath, fed by XML, http://www.activemath.org/javadoc/org/activemath/omdocjdom/index/package-summary.html
and
