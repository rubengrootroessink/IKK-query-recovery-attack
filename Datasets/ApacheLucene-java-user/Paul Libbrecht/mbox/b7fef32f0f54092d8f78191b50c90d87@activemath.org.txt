SUBJECT: no EnglishAnalyzer ?
DATE: 28 Jun 2005

Hi,

I've been looking around at analyzers for use in Lucene.

Among the contributions, the Snowball projects' output seem quite 
nicely usable.

However, right in the box of lucene-1.4.3.jar, there's a 
GermanAnalyzer, using a stemmer, and a RussianAnalyzer. Several other 
languages can be found in the contribs directory.
Any reason I cannot find an "EnglishAnalyzer" and an EnglishStemmer ?
I don't think the other analyzers I could find (e.g. StandardAnalyzer) 
are based on stemmers.

thanks

paul
