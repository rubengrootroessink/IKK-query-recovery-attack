SUBJECT: Lucene scoring bounds ??
DATE: 18 Jun 2005


Hi,

I read the lucene-book about scoring and read a bit of the javadoc but 
I can't seem to find somewhere expectations of the bouds for the score 
value.
I had believe the score would end up between 0 and 1 but I seem to keep 
having values under 0.2. It may be due to my special requests but... 
how can I be sure of this ?

thanks

paul
