Zhou,

Lucene is a back-end library, it's very useful for developer but it is  
not a complete site-search-engine.
A lucene-based site-search-engine is Nutch, it does crawl.
Solr also provides functions close to these with a large amount of  
thoughts on flexible integration; crawling methods are rather based on  
feeds or other acquisition methods (see DIH for example).
