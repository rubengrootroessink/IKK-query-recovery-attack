DATE: 21 Oct 2009


I'm interested to this analyzer.. it had escaped me and solves an old  
problem!
Could you report about its usage:
- did you have to feed words in a dictionary?
- does anyone have user-measures already?
... and the last question for the research fun: is there any approach  
towards preferring Überwachunggesetz as a concept than, say,  
Fleischüberwachung? (again, that could be based on a dictionary  
probably).

thanks in advance
