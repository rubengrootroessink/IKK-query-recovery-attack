SUBJECT: Re: UTF-8 indexing and searching
DATE: 1 Jul 2005

Careful that in the http world, there's an amibuity: 
x-www-form-url-encoded does not specify the content-encoding that the 
byts represented in the %-escaped sequences are written with.
That's fixed by the very recent URI spec where absence means utf-8...

My experience was that Tomcat simply converted the bytes of this into 
the first bytes of the 16-bit unicode, therefore working with 
iso-8859-1.
We succeeded receiving forms from pages utf-8-encded by packing an 
inputstreamreader in utf-8 at the end of an inputstream that reads the 
bytes of the string of request.getParam...

Hope that helps.
