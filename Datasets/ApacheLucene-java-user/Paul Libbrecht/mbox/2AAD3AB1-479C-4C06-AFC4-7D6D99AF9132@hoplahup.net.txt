Correct, there was no plan for such operation yet. It can sure be a useful thing.
I wonder if there's a lot of literature about such best practice btw. 
This I would be very interested to hear.

I think that one of the keys here is that we would need external linkable queries, and in
the ActiveMath engine I've been working on there was none such unfortunately.

It sure is desirable but the toolset was not right-away available for this.

The simple log counts as François Schiettecatte just responded in the solr list would even
be useful but again, it needs a little extra programming.

All people I met would recommend Google Analytics for this. I tend to dislike their approach
and do not know open-source, "my server side", solutions. Hence I made this thread public
to hear about "satelites" (which are somewhat lucene related).
