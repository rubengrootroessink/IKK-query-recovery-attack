SUBJECT: Re: Are Okapi BM25 scores normalized into 0 and 1 ?
DATE: 29 Apr 2011

Patrick if the question is about the code snippert at the page you mention, which I copy below,
I believe the answer is no and the author is aware of it since he is adding a comment about
not-normalized in the second example.

ScoreDocs and TopDocs are not returning normalized scores.
Normalized scores tend to be rare in Lucene nowadays, I believe earlier strategy was to divide
by max-score when the latter was bigger than 1.

paul

	IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher("IndexPath");

	//Load average length
	BM25Parameters.load(avgLengthPath);
	BM25BooleanQuery query = new BM25BooleanQuery("This is my Query", 
		"Search-Field",
		new StandardAnalyzer());
	
	TopDocs top = searcher.search(query, null, 10);
	ScoreDoc[] docs = top.scoreDocs;
	
	//Print results
	for (int i = 0; i $<$ top.scoreDocs.length; i++) {
	      System.out.println(docs[i].doc + ":"+docs[i].score);
	}
