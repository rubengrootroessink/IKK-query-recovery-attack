SUBJECT: Comment in query-parser?
DATE: 30 Dec 2010


I'm more and more involved into preparing dedicated pages that list resources of our servers
according to an elaborate query I received in a human description and "implement" as a query-parser
query. Doing this I regularly use "indexed-doc" views.

The implementation is thus a query that could be somewhat long and would enjoy illuminating
comments.

Is there anything in the query parser that would be considered ignored till the end of the
line?
Currently I'm using a fancy field but it introduces a useless query.

thanks in advance

paul
