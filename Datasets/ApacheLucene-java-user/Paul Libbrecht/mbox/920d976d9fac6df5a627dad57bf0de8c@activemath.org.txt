SUBJECT: updating an index... with existing documents ?
DATE: 28 Jul 2005


hi,

My mission is currently to update an index by marking adding a flag 
field on some documents.
For this, I seem to have the only following possibility:
- search for the documents in question, store them, filter them
- modify the documents in accordance
- delete the modified documents
- put back the documents

However, I seem to experiment and fear that unstored-fields will be 
lost underway... I, of course, do not wish to re-run the analysis 
process here (which is complex because of the xml-nature on the back).

Will these fields indeed be lost ?
Is there no way to "copy the token-streams" (as it's anyways stored in 
the index in some way) ?

thanks

paul
