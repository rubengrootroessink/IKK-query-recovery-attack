from here:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_1/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardTokenizer.html

I can only conclude that it handles correctly the characters variety but does not stemming.
The default constructor of StandardAnalyzer comes with a bunch of stop-words but they are
easily deactivatable.


I think it's quite precise, and certainly a lot more precise than removing the aux of chevaux!

I am not sure I have these.
I did several changes of this sort and the precision and recall measures went better in particular
in presence of language-indication failure which happened to be very common in our authoring
environment.
