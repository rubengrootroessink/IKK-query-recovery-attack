Various servlets or various webapps?
Various servlets is trivial, indeed using ServletContext.getAttribute().
Various webapps is more difficult:
- you need to set cross context so that context.getContext("/ 
otherpath") is accessible (a config of context in tomcat)
- you need classes to be shared (put jars in lib in tomcat)

Instead of context.getAttribute() you can always use statics....
