SUBJECT: phonetic encoders for other languages?
DATE: 23 Aug 2009



Hello list,

I will need to use phonetic analyzers to do "phonetic search". I know  
of the Metaphone analyzers and use them but they're really only known  
to work for English.

Does anyone have pointers to projects that encode phonetically words  
of other languages?
I'm interested to French, Spanish, German, Dutch, and Hungarian thus  
far.

thanks in advance

paul
