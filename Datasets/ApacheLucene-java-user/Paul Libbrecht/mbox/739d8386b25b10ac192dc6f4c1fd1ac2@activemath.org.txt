SUBJECT: lock directory system property is read too early!
DATE: 13 Sep 2005


Hi,

I am facing the problem that the system property LOCK_DIR in 
FSDirectory seems to be loaded too early, that is, at classloading 
time, whereas I am setting this property myself later...

Dare I request that its initialization is done lazily ?

thanks

paul
