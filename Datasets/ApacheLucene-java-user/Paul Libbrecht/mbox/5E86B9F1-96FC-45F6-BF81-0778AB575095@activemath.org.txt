Thom,

Lucene support binaries and arbitrary strings... this is far enough to  
store JSON or XML... (much independently of its size!).

E.g. we store some objects in JSON using xStream serialization (that  
is we add a field which is stored containing the object  
serialization... it could be XML or native serialization), it would  
make no big difference (especially since compression is there).
