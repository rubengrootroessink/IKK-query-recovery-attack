I'd love to see a bit more about this.
One more ambiguity is the javadoc of Field.getBoost:

 > Returns the boost factor for hits on any field of this document.

In any case... what I'm not clear about is wether there is the 
possibility to set the boost for all fields of this name for all 
documents...
Reading the book didn't help me there but I may have overlooked.
