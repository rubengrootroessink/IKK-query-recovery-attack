SUBJECT: Updating a Document without re-analyzing
DATE: 8 Sep 2005


Hi,

some times ago I posted a comment which asking this question (which is 
by no means new) about updating a Lucene document without re-analyzing, 
that is, where we expect the token-streams to be copied into the new 
document and where I intend to change only a few keyword values.

I cannot find this answer anymore, sadly... It was something like "look 
in Nutch" but I didn't find it there, at least.

Could someone repoint me to this bit ? Updating a document this way 
would be a very important optimization for us as we could unload most 
of the content into lucene's document and modify, later, the document 
with results which need to have swallowed the whole repository first.

thank you much.

paul
