SUBJECT: best way to interest two queries?
DATE: 31 Mar 2010


Hello list,

I've been wandering around but I see no solution yet: I would like to  
intersect two query results: going through the list of one query and  
indicating which ones actually match the other query or, even better,  
indicating that "passed this, nothing matches that query anymore".

What should be the strategy?

paul
