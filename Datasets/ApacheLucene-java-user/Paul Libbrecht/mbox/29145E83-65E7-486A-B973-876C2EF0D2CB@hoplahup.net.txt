But for this, you need a skillfully designed:
- set of fields
- multiplexing analyzer
- query expansion
In one of my projects, we do not split language by fields and it's a pain... I'm having recurring
issues in one sense or the other.
- the "die" example that Oti s mentioned is a good one: stop-word in German, essential verb
in English
- I had recently issues with the contribution of the word Fourier (for the name of series):
in English it stays fourier, in French in becomes fouri. So: if the resource is contributed
in French, the indexed value is fouri, English seekers won't find it; if the resource is contributed
in English, French seekers won't find it.
So my last lesson: always have a whitespace-lowercase unstemmed field also at hand and prefer
it over the others in your query expansion.

A wiki page should probably be made.
