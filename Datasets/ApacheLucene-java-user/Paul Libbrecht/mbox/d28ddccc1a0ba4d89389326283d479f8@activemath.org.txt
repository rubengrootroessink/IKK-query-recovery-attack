SUBJECT: Re: Lucene issue tracker moved to JIRA
DATE: 14 Sep 2005

I always had issues with some browser of mine with this URL which has a 
tendency to be mistaken with the bugzilla URL (they only differ in 
path) and hence lets browsers provide wrong passwords...

Are others experiencing the same ? I'll request a virtual host then...
