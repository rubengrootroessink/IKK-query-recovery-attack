Isn't this relatively easily done using current indexReader methods?
My 2p would be (I intended to do it):
- have each of your words get analyzed in each flavour (eg stemmed, 
phonetic...)
- get a tokens in each flavour and compare to that
- map back (that's the part I haven't done yet).

This is away from frequent search but realizes the "Did you mean" 
paradigm and is quite enough in many cases, I believe.
