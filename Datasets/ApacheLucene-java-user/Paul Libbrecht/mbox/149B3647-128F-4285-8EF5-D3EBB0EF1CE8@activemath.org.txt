SUBJECT: Re: Beginner: Best way to index and display orginal text of pdfs in search results
DATE: 12 Dec 2008


I also encountered these options of the Field constructor but I never  
found a way to be sure that the field is really not loaded in RAM and  
only return with Field.reader(). There seems to be no contract in the  
javadoc.
Moreover the reader access methods went away between 1.9 and 2.2 if I  
don't mistake... so I had the impression it was not wanted to store  
"blobs" in the index.

Also, reader is not enough to do a decent job to store PDFs.
It should be a binary format (so getBinaryValue() should be used) and  
it should be an input-stream and not an in-memory array!

Echoes of a long frustrated user which implemented its own "mass- 
storage" because of that.
thanks for hints and even contradictions!
