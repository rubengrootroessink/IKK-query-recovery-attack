Madhu,

Analyzer is the magic word here.

Lucene's StandardAnalyzer has a whole grammar to split words into 
tokens. There are many more analyzers, most of which are language 
specific (e.g. based the Snowball or Porter-stemmers, see contribs or 
javadoc of core).

For which language do wish to use that ?
