SUBJECT: Reverting QueryParser ?
DATE: 14 Apr 2005

	
Hi,

I am currently evaluating the need for an elaborate query 
data-structure (to be exchanged over XML-RPC) as opposed to working 
with plain strings.

One thing that would heavily vote for strings would be to have query 
objects returned by Query-parser reconvertible to a string (and back).

did anyone did this ?

thanks

paul
