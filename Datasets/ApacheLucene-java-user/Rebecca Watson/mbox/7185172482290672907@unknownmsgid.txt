There are index time boosts ie calculated at index time and search
time boosts. The field f always relates to the field(s) that the term
t appears in.

My understanding is that--
Norm(t,d) includes the index time boosts for each field but I think t
is only included in this calc in terms of field.getboost() -- because
you effectively get the product over each field in which the specific
term occurs. But you don't have s norm value for e every term- field -
doc combo.

Similarity (defaultsimilarity by default!) method computeNorm is used
to compute this factor at indexing time so have a look at that code to
see what I mean!

IndexReader.norms(fieldname) gives a norm array the size of the number
of docs so norm[docid] is actually used to get the index time boost
for the given field/doc in which the term occurs.

t.getboost() is the search time boost for the particular term --
practically this is the query boost for the term (or I think product
of query boosts if the term is also a sub- query (where the
surrounding query has a query boost too).

I may be wrong but when I dug into the docs + code these were my
conclusions!
