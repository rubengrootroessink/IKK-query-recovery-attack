Hi,

if you want to store word+value pairs then use lucene scoring to weight
the words with higher vaules against them, you should look at using payloads
and the DelimitedPayloadTokenFilter which lets you specify e.g.
word1|value1 word2|value2 ...
and the values are stored as payloads against the word tokens (which can
still be analyzed using stemming etc if you put the payload filter at the
beginning of the tokenizer stream set).

then at query time you'd need to use a payload query type to get the weights
included in the scoring for docs --
see the article by lucid imagination here:
http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2010/04/18/refresh-getting-started-with-payloads/

not sure if that's the sort of thing you're after?

bec :)
