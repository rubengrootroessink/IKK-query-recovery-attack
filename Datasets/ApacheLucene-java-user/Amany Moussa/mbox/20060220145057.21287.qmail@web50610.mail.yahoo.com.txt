SUBJECT: Lucene CPU Utilization
DATE: 20 Feb 2006


Hello,

I am building a Lucene index with over a million   
documents retrieved from database. I am running the
application on Unix, I am getting a 100% CPU
utilization the moment the application start.
The application creates a list of small indices in a
temp directory then merge them all in the main index
file.                                                 
Is there any way I can tune the indexing process and
reduce the CPU utilization.                         
Thanks much.                              

Amany M.
