SUBJECT: MAX Index Size POLL
DATE: 27 Feb 2003

Hello friends,
If it is not much of a trouble, I would like to ask as many of you as possible, to post some
statistics.
This would preferably include 

1. Size of the index.
2. No of documents indexed.
3. Time taken to index new documents.
4. Time taken for a typical query.


thank you,
Samir
