Hello,
you could have each node build a separate index, and then merge the
result back in a single consistent index using

org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory...)

partitioning the indexes will lead to results being different from the case where you have
all in one partition, due to Lucene currently not supporting distributed idf. Is this correct?
Is there a way to make it work seamlessly?
