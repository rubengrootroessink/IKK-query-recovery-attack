SUBJECT: Inserting a document into an index at a specified position
DATE: 6 Jul 2006

All,

For performance reasons we keep our index of over a million documents ordered 
alphabeticaly.  This way for an alpha sort we can just use the index order.  
This works very good, but I'm now looking for a way to insert a single 
document to the index in the correct position.  

Is there any standard way to do this?

--Jason
