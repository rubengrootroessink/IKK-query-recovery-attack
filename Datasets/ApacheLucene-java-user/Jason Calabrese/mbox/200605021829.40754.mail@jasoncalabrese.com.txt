I think the best way to tokening/stem is to use the analyzer directly.  for 
example:

TokenStream ts = analyzer.tokenStream(field, new StringReader(text));
				
Token token = null;
while ((token = ts.next()) != null) {
	Term newTerm = new Term(field, token.termText());
	//do something with the new newTerm
}

If your just stemming then there will be only a single token so you probably 
won't need the while loop.
