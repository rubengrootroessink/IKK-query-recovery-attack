SUBJECT: Performing a query on token length
DATE: 21 Jan 2011

Hello all,

Does anyone know if it is possible in Lucene to do a query based on the
string length of the value of a field?

For example, if I wanted all index matches where a specific field like
'first_name' was between 10 and 20 characters.

Thanks!
