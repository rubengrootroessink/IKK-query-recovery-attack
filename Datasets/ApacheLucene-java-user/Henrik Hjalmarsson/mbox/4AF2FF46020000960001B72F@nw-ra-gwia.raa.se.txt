So basicly there is no effective way of doing this?
The only solution I've come up with is

Pseudo code:

for( every index )
{
    create term(index, "*")
    create wildcard query with term
    rewrite query to primitive query
    extract terms from primive query
    for( each term extracted )
    {
        create query with term and query string from request
    }
}

for( each query created above )
{
    search with query asking for 1 result.
    check total number of hits for query
}

print result

Something like that. Is that a totaly idiotic way of doing it?

If the query is a very selective one, you can go through the XML 
document and do the counting.

If the query is not so selective, which is usually the case, and the 
number of matches are large, basically all the values need to be loaded 
into memory, or solid state disk, to do a fast counting.
