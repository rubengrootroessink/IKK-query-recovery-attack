Hello
 
I am trying to develop an API for a search application that is using Lucene 2.4.1
The search application is maintained by RAA (swedish goverment organization that keeps track
of historical and cultural data).
 
I have gotten a demand for an API method that returns an XML response, listing all the indexes
in this application and the number of unique values these indexes can have, filtered by a
query that is recieved in the method request.
 
The application contains a large amount of indexes and some indexes contains a very large
amount of unique values. Is there some way to achive this in an effective way?
 
With regards Henrik
