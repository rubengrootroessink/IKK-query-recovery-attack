We've had the same request a number of times, but when we discuss the
scenarios in detail, they can always be scaled down to "The first X
values", instead of "all values", where X is < 1000.


While you can build efficient handling of the faceting on fields with
many terms, simply returning the Strings for the terms (ignoring all the
grunt work of extraction) poses problems.

5 million values of 20 characters each takes up about 
 5M * (20 * 2 + ~40) bytes ~ 400MByte
of RAM. If you wrap that in nice XML and send it using SOAP, memory
usage goes through the roof. Streaming, as Ian suggests, seems to be the
answer here.

It is definitely possible in the case where you limit the number of
returned values. Well, at least we've tested it for 1000M unique values
in 100M documents. But before we go there, it would help to know what
you mean by "large".

Ok. To be honest, I don't know what is considered "large" for Lucene. But its significanly
larger than what examples I've managed to find so far. Its roughly around 100 different indexes
at the moment and every index (from what I know) can have everything from 2 unique values
up to 50 000 or 200 000 unique values.
