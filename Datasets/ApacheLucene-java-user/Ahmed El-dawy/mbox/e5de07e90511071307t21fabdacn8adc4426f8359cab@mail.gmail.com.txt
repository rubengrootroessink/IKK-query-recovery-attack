Thanks very much all of you
I have just checked out the SVN version using SmartSVN and it worked
very fine. I will investigate it more carefully as I can use new

I see that PhrasePrefixQuery is becoming @deprecated. Good! It made
many problems when I tried to use it. I have switched to
MultiPhraseQuery.

Thanks again
