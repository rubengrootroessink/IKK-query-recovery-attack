SUBJECT: Re: Multiple terms with the same position in PhraseQuery
DATE: 6 Nov 2005

I have used the PhrasePrefixQuery but it has some problems. It
sometimes throw an exception (OperationNotAllowed) when it is added to
a boolean query with required flag set. Also it sometimes throws a
null pointer exception and I don't know why.
  I am trying to get the latest version (from SVN) but I can't do it.
I need your help. How can I checkout the project?
  I use eclipse and it asks me for these information
Host: -----
Repository Path: -----
User: -----
Password: ------
Connection type: (pserver | ext | extssh)
port: (default | custom)

Thanks very much
