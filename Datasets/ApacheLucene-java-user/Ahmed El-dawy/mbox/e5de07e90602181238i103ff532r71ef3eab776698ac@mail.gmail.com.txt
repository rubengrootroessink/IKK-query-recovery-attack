SUBJECT: Accessing Lucene Index stored in a jar file
DATE: 18 Feb 2006

Hello,
  Is there a way to access a Lucene Index which is stored inside a
.zip or .jar file?
This is important because my indexes are very large (> 200 M.B.) and I
need to compress them. I tried to store documents using
Store.COMPRESSED, but the compression ratio wasn't satisfying.
  I need to add the index to a jar file and access it (for read-only)
without extracting the zip file.

Thanks in advance
