Awesome that FAQ entry confused me and I didn't look at IndexWriter
javadoc thinking that it wouldn't be there since deleteDocument is
there in IndexReader.

What is the best way to update a document? Search and do an update if
the document is found/else insert or just try an update whatever be
the case - the update will delete in case a document exists or will
just insert a new document if the document doesn't exist in the index.
