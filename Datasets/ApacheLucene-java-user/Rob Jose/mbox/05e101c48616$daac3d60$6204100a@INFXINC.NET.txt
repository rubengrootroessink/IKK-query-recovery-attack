Thanks for your response.  I have fixed this issue.  I have indexed 5 MB
worth of text files and I now only use 224 KB.  I was getting 80 MB.  The
only change I made was to change the way I merge my temp index into my prod
index.  My code changed from:
prodWriter.setUseCompoundFile(true);

prodWriter.addIndexes(new IndexReader[] { tempReader });

To:

int iNumDocs = tempReader.numDocs();

for (int y = 0; y < iNumDocs; y++) {

Document tempDoc = tempReader.document(y);

prodWriter.addDocument(tempDoc);

}



I don't know if this is a bug in the IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
method or something else I am doing that caused this, but I am getting much
better results now.



Thanks to everyone who helped, I really appreciate it.

How many fields do you have and what analyzer are you using?

I upgraded to 1.4.1.  I deleted all of my old indexes and started from
scratch.  I indexed 2 MB worth of text files and my index size is 8
MB.
Would it be better if I stopped using the
IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader) method and instead traverse the
IndexReader on the temp index and use
IndexWriter.addDocument(Document)
method?

Thanks again for your input, I appreciate it.

Just go for 1.4.1 and look at the CHANGES.txt file to see if there
were
any index format changes.  If there were, you'll need to re-index.
