SUBJECT: Doing a join?
DATE: 22 Apr 2004

Is it possible to do a join on two fields when searching a Lucene Index.
For example, I have an index of documents that have a "StudentName" and a
"StudentId" field and another document that has "ClassId", "ClassName" and
"StudentId".  I want to do a search on "ClassId" or "ClassName" and get a
list of "StudentName".  Both of these documents are in one index, but are
loaded from seperate files, so I can't join at creation time.  Any help is
greatly appreciated.

Rob
