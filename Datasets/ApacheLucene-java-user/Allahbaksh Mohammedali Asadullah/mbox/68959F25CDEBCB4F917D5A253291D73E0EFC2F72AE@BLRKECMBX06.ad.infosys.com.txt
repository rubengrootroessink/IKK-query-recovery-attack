HI Mike,
I think adding this in Lucene 3.0 contrib would be the best we could do. I think we could
add it in Lucene 2.9 Release as it would grow the community and we would also able to find
some nice practices, bugs, improvement and that would make it better in upcoming release.


Regards,
Allahbaksh
