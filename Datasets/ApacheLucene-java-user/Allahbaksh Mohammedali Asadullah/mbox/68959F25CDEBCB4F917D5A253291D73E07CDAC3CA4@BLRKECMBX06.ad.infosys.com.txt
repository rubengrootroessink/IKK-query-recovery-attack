SUBJECT: Boost value corrupted "read eof exception"
DATE: 15 Feb 2008


Hi,
I am getting read past eof  exception when I am adding Document. The things works fine but
while I read the Boost value I get it as default value i.e 1.0. I tried using RAMDirectory
then also I am getting the same error.
Can someone throw some light on this.

Warm Regards,
Allahbaksh
