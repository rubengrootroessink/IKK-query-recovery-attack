Subject: Creating lucene index from databases

Hi all,

 I am new to lucene. I want to build a search engine. The entire content on
which I want to search is stored in Mysql database.

Is it possible to use the content in sql database  to build an index using
lucene? If it is possible, please give a few tips on how it can be done.

Thank you for your help.

Regards,
kranthi
