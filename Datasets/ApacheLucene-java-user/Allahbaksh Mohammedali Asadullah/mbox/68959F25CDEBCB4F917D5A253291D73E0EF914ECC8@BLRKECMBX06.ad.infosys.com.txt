SUBJECT: Tutorial on Lucene on S3
DATE: 1 Aug 2009

Hi,
Is there any tutorial on how to store Lucene Index in S3. How do we access the index from
S3. Are there any wrapper  of amazon S3.

The other question is how do I store and access existing lucene index on Google App Engine.

Thanks in advance.
Warm Regards,
Allahbaksh
