Hi,
It is really nice idea to have something like if I am doing a query like amount >15 something
depending upon the field and do query parsing. Basically we need have pluggable query parser
which can convert different queries like amount >15  to lucene specified query.

That is what I think. I am using Lucene for long time and love to see this kind of stuff.
Though Minin provided this I am not really happy with performance nor the GPL and probably
it is love toward using things from Apache Foundation (Tomcat, Lucene, Common, HTTPD etc)
.

Could we add APIs to QueryParser so the application can state the  
disposition
toward certain fields?

EG QueryParser now tries to guess whether a range query's upper/lower  
bound
should be parsed as dates, and there are methods exposed to set the  
resolution
on a per-field basis.  Maybe we could do something similar to declare  
that a
given field uses Trie*, and with what datatype.

Just thinking aloud really... but since we haven't yet released Trie*,  
now (for 2.9)
is a good time to think hard about how we expose/integrate it... and  
making it
easier to use ootb seems important.
