Hi Erik,
Thanks a lot for your reply. You are right I want different analyzer on same field depending
upon the other fields in the document.

For Example
Doc1
Text:"Some text here"
type:html

Doc2
Text: "Some jsp text here"
type:jsp

Now depending upon the type I wanted to use different analyzer for extracting and searching.
Is there any way to do this?

I am using the way which you suggested. 

Warm Regards,
Allahbaksh

I'm assuming that you want a different analyzer to handle extracting
the relevant information to put into a "text" field of the Lucene document.
I know of no way you can attach different analyzers to a single field.
You can certainly attach different analyzers to *different* fields...

The first thing I'd try would be to write your own analyzer that keeps
track of what kind of file it's currently analyzing and knows how to
"do the right thing" to extract the next token for the text field.

A cruder way would be to detect the type of document yourself,
extract the text into a string (or some such) then feed that into
your document.

Best
Erick
