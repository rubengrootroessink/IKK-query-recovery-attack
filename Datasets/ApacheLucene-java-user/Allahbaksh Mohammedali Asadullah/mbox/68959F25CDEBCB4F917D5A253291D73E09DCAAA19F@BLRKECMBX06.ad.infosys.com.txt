SUBJECT: Analyzer
DATE: 25 Nov 2008

HI All,
I am indexing a set file type (html, js,jsp,xml etc). All the file type have a common field
called as text. This field contains all the file data. Can I have different analyzer for depending
upon file type.

Note: I am indexing all file type with same indexer.

Regards,
Allahbaksh
