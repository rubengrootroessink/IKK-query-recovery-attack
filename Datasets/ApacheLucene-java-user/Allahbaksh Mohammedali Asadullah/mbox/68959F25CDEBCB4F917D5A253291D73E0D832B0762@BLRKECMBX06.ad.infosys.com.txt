DATE: 9 Mar 2009


Hi,
I was not aware of TrieRangeQuery but whether syntax for numberical query will change. For
example I want to search 
amount >= 15 rather than doing it amount:[ 15] or something?

Is there any open source queryparser which converts something like amount >=15 into lucene
number format query.

Regards,
Allahbaksh

The additions for QueryParser to support this are done in Solr (because in
contrast to Lucene alone, Solr knows the datatype and encoding) of each
field: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-940

You can do it in the same way. Maybe we should supply some "plugin" for the
QueryParser in TrieRange contrib?
