Hi all,
Can any one explain How function integer2String works.


  public static int int2sortableStr(int val, char[] out, int offset) {

    val += Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    out[offset++] = (char)(val >>> 24);

    out[offset++] = (char)((val >>> 12) & 0x0fff);

    out[offset++] = (char)(val & 0x0fff);

    return 3;

  }
