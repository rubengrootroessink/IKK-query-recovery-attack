Hi,
I didn't get what exactly does shifiting 24 times and shifing 12 times does. Is there any
Character at that value or is there some differenciator?
Can some one go in bit details.
Regards.

This maps MIN_VALUE to 0 and MAX_VALUE to 0xffffffff, making the bits
sort lexicographically the same as the full integer range.  It's the
same as flipping the sign bit.

This chops up the bits to fit in char sized pieces to make a string,
avoiding invalid character ranges.
