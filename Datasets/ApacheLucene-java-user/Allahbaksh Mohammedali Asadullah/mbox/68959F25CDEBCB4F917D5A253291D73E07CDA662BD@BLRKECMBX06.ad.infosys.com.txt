You would have to collect the payloads from matching terms by
extending a query.

See this recent thread:
http://www.nabble.com/Faceting-with-payloads-td15322956.html#a15322956

Are you sure this is what you want to do? What is it you store in the
payloads, and how do you plan to use this information once you have
retreived it?
