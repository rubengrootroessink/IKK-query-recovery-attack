i think thats meant to be "partition" which would definitely make sense in the context of 
using a multisearcher to search logical domain-specific partitions within  an app.

I don't understand the question.  Using a MultiSearcher is the same  
as using IndexSearcher except in how its constructed.  Searching is  
identical - call a search() method and work with Hits (or TopDocs).
