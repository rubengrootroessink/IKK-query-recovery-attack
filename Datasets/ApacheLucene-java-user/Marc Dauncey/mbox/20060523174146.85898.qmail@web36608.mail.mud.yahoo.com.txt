SUBJECT: Web services for querying and return of results

Has anyone used this as a delivery mechanism for Lucene query results?

A quick search on Google reveals a Lucene Web Service project on SourceForge, but what i want
to know is whether people on the list know of any big drawbacks, specifically, how well could
I expect this to perform, as compared to passing back a Hits object to clients.

The advantages I can see advocating SOAP are light coupling of search clients and servers,
plus ease of consumption with lots of systems, devices, cocoon etc.

Does anyone use this in their application and how have you found it?

Many thanks


Marc
