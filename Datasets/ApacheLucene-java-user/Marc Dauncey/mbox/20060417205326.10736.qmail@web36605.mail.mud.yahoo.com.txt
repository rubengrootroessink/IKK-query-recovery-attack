SUBJECT: Indexing - scheduled batch process or server?
DATE: 17 Apr 2006

Hi everyone,

I'm currently designing a Lucene search system and i'm
considering the indexing side of things.

Just wondered what kind of architecture people have
adopted for indexing - are CHRON jobs sufficient for
high volume drip feed indexing or has anyone
implemented a more sophisticated solution with web
services to index on demand?  

And has anyone used Quartz to schedule Lucene index
updates?  Sounds like an interesting product in this
context.

Many thanks


Marc Dauncey
