Thank you for all your thoughts on this - I think we will go the route of having two copies
for each index, a working copy and the one the searchers use.  If we start off indexing like
this it shouldn't be too hard to keep them in sync.

Thanks again,

Marc

: As for backing up, you could try making a backup using IndexWriter's
: addIndexes method, and I imagine hard-links would work, too.

Hardlinks do in fact work quite well.  This is how the Solr backup scripts
work...
