SUBJECT: Re: Offset Questions (Follow-Up)
DATE: 7 Mar 2008

OK, I think I understand what's going on - it looks like I am able to set 
the token for the full author name (Say, "Steve Suppe") with the correct 
offsets, but the analyzer takes it once step further and tokenizes 'Steve' 
and 'Suppe' which is giving me a lot more generated offsets and is 
confusing me.

I like the tokenization, as it allows me to just search for Suppe and get 
results.  However, I don't want those "sub-offsets" returned.  Is there a 
way to distinguish the 'main' offsets for the whole field?

Thanks again,
Steve
