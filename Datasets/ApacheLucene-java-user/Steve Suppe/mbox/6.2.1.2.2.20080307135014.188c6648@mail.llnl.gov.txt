Hi Erick,

Thanks for the response.  I think I'm starting to get the hang of 
this.  That's a really good insight, but I'm wondering how to handle that 
if a document can have multiple instances of the same field.  So, instead 
of Author, say, City names that are mentioned.  But, as you said, I control 
everything, so I may be able to work this out...

Still thinking :)  Thanks so much so far!

Steve
