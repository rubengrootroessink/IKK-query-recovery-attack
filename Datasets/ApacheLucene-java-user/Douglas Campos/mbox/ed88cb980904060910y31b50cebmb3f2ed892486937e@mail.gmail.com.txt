SUBJECT: Re: Multiple Analyzer on Single field
DATE: 6 Apr 2009

What I've done is to put copies of the same field, built with different
analyzers, and later use a MultiFieldQueryParser matching all fields.

eg: "name", "name_phonetic", "name_keyword", ad nauseum

To define which analyzer will go to which field, use PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper
