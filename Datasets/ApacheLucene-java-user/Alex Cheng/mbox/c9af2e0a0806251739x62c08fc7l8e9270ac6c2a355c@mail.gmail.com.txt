SUBJECT: IndexDeletionPolicy to delete commits after N minutes
DATE: 26 Jun 2008

hi,
what is the correct way to instruct the indexwriter (or other
classes?) to delete old
commit points after N minutes ?
I tried to write a customized IndexDeletionPolicy that uses the
parameters to schedule future
jobs to perform file deletion. However, I am only getting the
filenames through the parameters
and not absolute file names.

thanks.
