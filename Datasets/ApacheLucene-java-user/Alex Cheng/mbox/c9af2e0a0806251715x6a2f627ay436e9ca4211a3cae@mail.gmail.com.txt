SUBJECT: instruct IndexDeletionPolicy to delete old commits after N minutes
DATE: 26 Jun 2008

hi,
what is the correct way to instruct the indexwriter to delete old
commit points after N minutes ?
I tried to write a customized IndexDeletionPolicy that uses the
parameters to schedule future
jobs to do file deletion. However, I am only getting the filenames,
and not absolute file names.

thanks.
