So，you'd better to start the program soon. There is annother suggestion: you can construct
the index by more than one IndexerWriter, 
as long as I know, you can use indexs to construct the index seperately, then conbine them.
It will save many time. 
I am new to Lucene, I can't remember the syntex clearly, you can return to the Docs. good
luck!

Hi, experts

I had a program running for 2 days to build an index for around 160 million
text files, and after program ended, I tried searching the index and found
the index was not correctly built, *indexReader.numDocs()* returns 0. I
checked the index directory, it looked good, all the index data seemed to be
there, the directory is 1.5 Gigabytes in size.

I checked my code and found that I forgot to call *indexWriter.optimize()*and
*indexWriter.close()*, I want to know if it is possible to
*re-optimize()*the index so I don't need to rebuild the whole index
from scratch? I don't
really want the program to take another 2 days.

Thanks!
