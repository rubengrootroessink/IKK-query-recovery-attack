SUBJECT: Does Lucene compress postings (or posting lists) in its inverted index?
DATE: 17 Oct 2010

Hello,

We're currently evaluating utilizing Lucene to index a large English corpus
and we were are optimizing for space. We're basically concerned that the
size of the postings lists will become extremely large. Does Lucene provide
some kind of compression for the generated posting lists within the index?
If not, is there a way to force Lucene do this?

Thanks for the help in advance,
Mahmoud
