Thanks, Doug, that is a huge help.

BTW, the fileformats.html page on the Lucene web site is incorrect
with regards to the segments file.  The description should read:

Segments --> Format, Version, Counter, SegCount, 
             <SegName, SegSize>^SegCount

That is, the Counter field is missing.  The Counter field is a UInt32.
Counter is used to generate the next segment name (see
IndexWriter.newSegmentName()).

Speaking of Counter, I have a dumb question.  If the segments are
named using an integer counter which is incremented, what is the point
in converting that counter into a string for the segment filename?
Why not just name the segments e.g. "1.frq", etc.?

Ian
