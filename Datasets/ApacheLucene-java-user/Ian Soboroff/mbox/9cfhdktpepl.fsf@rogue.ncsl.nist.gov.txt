SUBJECT: Re: which HTML parser is better?
DATE: 3 Feb 2005


One which we've been using can be found at:
http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/ftp-area/html-parser/

We absolutely need to be able to recover gracefully from malformed
HTML and/or SGML.  Most of the nicer SAX/DOM/TLA parsers out there
failed this criterion when we started our effort.  The above one is
kind of SAX-y but doesn't fall over at the sight of a real web page
;-)
