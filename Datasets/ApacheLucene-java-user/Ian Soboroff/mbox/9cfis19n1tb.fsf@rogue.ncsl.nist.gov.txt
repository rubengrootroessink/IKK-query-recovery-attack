It's out of print, and is rather out of date... for example, the
chapter in indexing is neat for the early 90s but not necessarily
relevant when disk is fast and cheap.

There's a web page at
http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~rbaeza/iradsbook/irbook.html with a table of
contents and some code from the book.
