We at NIST have code to do this, integrated with Lucene.  We have a simple
SGML/XML parser and a simple reader which walks the documents... that's most of
what you need.  You could probably hack it together with NekoHTML in a day or
two, actually.  It can index TREC newswire corpora in a couple hours on a pretty
stock Dell workstation, and the TREC "Terabyte" collection (actually 480GB, 25
million web pages) in a weekend on a handful of workstations indexing in parallel.

It's not quite ready for prime-time release yet, though.  I hope to have some
time this summer to clean it up enough that we're not embarrassed to give it out
;-).  If your need is desperate, drop me an email and I'll see what I can do.

Ian
