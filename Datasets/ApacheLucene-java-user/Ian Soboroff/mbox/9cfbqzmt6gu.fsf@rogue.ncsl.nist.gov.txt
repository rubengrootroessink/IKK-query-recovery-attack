I have one.  I've been thinking about the problem with doing relevance
feedback in Lucene, and I appreciate seeing your code on getting the
top terms from a single document.

However, the real problem for RF and pseudo-RF techniques is forming
the query.  You can obviously add terms to a query, but how are you
handling the weighting?  With boosts, or something more sophisticated?
