Depends on your search infrastructure.  Doug Cutting has sent out some
basic optimization guidelines on this list which should be in the
archives... simply, you need to think about how many CPUs and spindles
are involved.

1.5m documents isn't a challenge for Lucene to index or search on a
single machine with a monolithic index.  I indexed about 1.6m web
pages in 22 hours on a single machine with all data local, and search
with a single IndexSearcher was instantaneous.  We've also done some
testing with a larger collection (25m pages) and
ParallelMultiSearchers on several machines, and likewise on a fast
network haven't felt a slowdown, but we haven't actually benchmarked
it.
