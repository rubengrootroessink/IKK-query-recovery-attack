SUBJECT: Reconstruct segments file?
DATE: 4 Feb 2005


Idiot question.  I've managed to blow away the "segments" file.  This
is an optimized index, so there's only one segment.  Is there an easy
way to reconstruct the segments file?

I've looked over the file formats web page, and poked at a known-good
segments file from a separate, similar index using od(1) and such.  I
guess what I'm not sure how to do is to recover the SegSize from the
segment I have.
