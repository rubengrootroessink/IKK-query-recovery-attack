Not only hard to get ahold of these days, but really really really out
of date.  This book should be of historical interest only.

Frakes and Baeza-Yates book "Modern Information Retrieval" isn't bad,
but is a bit sparse on particular algorithms.  It has nice references,
so you'll know where to go for details.

Managing Gigabytes is also a bit outdated, but has wonderful
implementation details.  No theory whatsoever, except regarding
compression.

Grossman and Frieder's book, "Information Retrieval, Algorithms and
Heuristics", is out in a second (and much cheaper, too!) edition,
probably the most up-to-date textbook.

The proceedings of ACM SIGIR is where the most cutting-edge stuff in
text retrieval is done.  Available online via ACM's digital library if
you're an ACM member.

The TREC proceedings are free online at http://trec.nist.gov/.  Some
classic theory papers that appeared in SIGIR have the implementation
details in the TREC paper (for example, Robertson's OKAPI paper in
TREC-3).  For straight "Lucene-style" text search, look for the ad
hoc, robust, web, and genomics tracks.
