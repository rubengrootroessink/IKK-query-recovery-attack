SUBJECT: Multi-field query - determining which fields are hit
DATE: 3 Jun 2008

Hello,

In performing a multi-field query, is there a way to determine which 
field(s) the query matched in short of running a query against each of 
the fields independently?  Could payloads be utilized for something like 
this?

Thanks,

Michael
