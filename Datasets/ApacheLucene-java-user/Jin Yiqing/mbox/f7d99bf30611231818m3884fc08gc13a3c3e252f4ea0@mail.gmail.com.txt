You are right,. I think it's better to implement it using DB. But my project
is build on lucene and i think it would be better if i could find a way to
sovle this inside lucene. But as you have mentioned updating a lucene index
is not a easy nor fast job. you have to rebuild the term table as it is
sorted, . also you need to make sure this is transactional, that's the
hardest part. Or i think may be i could just make direct operation on lucene
index (mainly .tis file), insert a new tag-term may cost some time but add a
doc after that does not. Still how to make it transactional bothered me a
lot .
