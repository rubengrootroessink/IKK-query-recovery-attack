SUBJECT: labels search like google mail?
DATE: 23 Nov 2006

Hi,all
     Maybe lots of u guys have used google mail. i noticed google mail has a
good feature called labels. you could select a mail then just put  labels on
it by select <more actions>-><apply label>.  The labels could be  created by
users dynamicly . Then you could list your mails just by these labels, very
fast. And one mail could have more than one label.

     I always wondering how google did this. considering the mail amont this
must be a search technology. Can Lucene also implement the same function by
now?

     i have thought about this but got no solution.  :(   So i wrote this
mail, if anyone have good suggestions i'll appreciate it very much.

     Richie
