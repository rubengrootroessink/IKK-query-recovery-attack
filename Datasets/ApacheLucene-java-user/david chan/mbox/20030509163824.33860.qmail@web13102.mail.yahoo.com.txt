SUBJECT: Lucene index on multi-node websphere?
DATE: 9 May 2003

Hi,
 What's the best approach to deploy Lucene search
engine to multi-node (two nodes) Websphere application
server?
 The multi-node is for load balancing, so web user can
hit any of the app. server, them it needs index file
on both machine. 
 What's the best way to index my documents (not in
these multi-node machine). I guess web crawler
approach is good for this, but do I need to do that on
both node?
 
Thanks.
David
