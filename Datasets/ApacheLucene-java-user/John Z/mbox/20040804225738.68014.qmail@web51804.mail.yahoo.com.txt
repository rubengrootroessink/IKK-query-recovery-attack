Thanks
I was looking at some older email on the list and found an email where Doug Cutting says that
fields not analyzed, we need not store the norms , nor load them into memory.
 
That change in the indexer will help a lot in this situation, where we might have 24 fields
indexed but not analyzed.

During search one byte of RAM is needed per searched field per document
for the normalisation factors, even if a document field is empty.
This RAM is occupied the first time a field is searched after opening
an index reader.
Supposing your queries would actually search 50 fields before
closing the index reader, the norms would occupy 50 bytes/doc, or
1 GB / 20MDocs.
