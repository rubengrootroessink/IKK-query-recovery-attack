SUBJECT: Question on number of fields in a document.
DATE: 4 Aug 2004

Hi
 
I had a question related to number of fields in a document. Is there any limit to the number
of fields you can have in an index.
 
We have around 25-30 fields per document at present, about 6 are keywords,  Around 6 stored,
but not indexed and rest of them are text, which is analyzed and indexed fields. We are planning
on adding around 24 more fields , mostly keywords.
 
Does anyone see any issues with this? Impact to search or index ?
 
Thanks
ZJ
