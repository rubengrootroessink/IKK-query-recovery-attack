SUBJECT: C++ as token in StandardAnalyzer?
DATE: 4 Mar 2008

I saw some discussion in the archives some time ago about the fact that 
C++ is tokenized as C in the StandardAnalyzer; this seems to still be the 
case; I was wondering if there is a simple way for me to get the behavior 
I want for C++ (that it is tokenized as C++) in particular, and perhaps 
for other more ideosyncratic terms I may have in my own application--
Thanks
Donna
