I don't think this question makes a whole lot of sense in isolation-- 
precision and recall is all about the *query* and that is the art of the 
developer; what is the appropriate query for your particular application. 
Lucene does just great telling you which documents had which terms and 
which term combinations, and does a very good job of scoring them and 
ranking them once you give a query. But *you* have to decide what the 
appropriate query is for your application. The simplest approach, and 
perhaps what you are looking for, is the MoreLikeThis query generator, 
which uses (pretty good) heuristics for telling you which documents are 
"like" a given document, but I don't know if that's the direction you are 
looking for.
