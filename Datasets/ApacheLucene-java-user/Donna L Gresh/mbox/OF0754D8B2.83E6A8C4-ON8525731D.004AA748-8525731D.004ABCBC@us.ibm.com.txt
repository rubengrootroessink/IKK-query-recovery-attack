SUBJECT: Re: question about flush(), optimize(), and deleted documents

Thank you-- this is what appeared to be the case, but I wanted to check if 
there 
was something simple I wasn't understanding--

>All deletes should be removed after an optimize. Otherwise, I think 
you'll

>not include deletes, but the document() call will retrieve deletes. You
>might try using maxDoc() instead of numDocs().
