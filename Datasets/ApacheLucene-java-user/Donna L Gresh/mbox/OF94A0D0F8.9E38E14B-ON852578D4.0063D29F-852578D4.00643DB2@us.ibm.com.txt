This is really not the forum for questions like this (which are not 
related to Lucene but rather to Java) but for a very simple checklist of 
what you need, try this: 
http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/win32.html

But I ask that any further questions which are purely java related NOT be 
asked here. If you want a real development environment (rather than a text 
editor) you might look into Eclipse http://www.eclipse.org/. But again-- 
no Eclipse questions here please!
