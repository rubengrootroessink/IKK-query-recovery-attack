SUBJECT: tell snowballfilter not to stem certain words?
DATE: 16 Aug 2007

Apologies if this is in the FAQ or elsewhere available but I could not 
find this.

Can I provide a list of words that should *not* be stemmed by the
SnowballFilter? My analyzer looks like this:

analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(stopwords) {
        public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, java.io.Reader 
reader) {
          return new SnowballFilter(super.tokenStream(fieldName,reader),
                "English");
        }
};

It is removing the trailing "S" from some words which I don't want to have 
this happen for--
