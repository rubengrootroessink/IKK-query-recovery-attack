SUBJECT: Re: Adding attribute to index
DATE: 2 Apr 2008

This is "fast and loose" code (from my head; check the syntax). I *highly* 
recommend you get a copy of the book Lucene in Action; it will really 
help.

To create the index, add a document with two fields; one for the sender 
and one for the email text.

IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter(...... 

Document emailDoc = new Document();
Field senderField = new Field("sender", senderEmailAddress, 
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED);
emailDoc.add(senderField);
Field textField = new Field("emailText", textOfEmail, Field.Store.YES, 
Field.Index.TOKENIZED);
emailDoc.add(textField);
indexWriter.addDocument(emailDoc);


Then when you are searching, search in the email text field:

Query query = new TermQuery(new Term("emailText","searchTerm"));
Hits hits = searcher.search(query);
Document doc = hits.doc(0); //best fit document
String emailSender = doc.get("sender");
String emailText = doc.get("emailText");
