As it is probably more likely that you're doing something incorrect than 
that Lucene is reporting incorrect results :), it might help if you 
reported the exact query that is being submitted to the IndexSearcher, and 
then showing us the document that was incorrectly returned. My guess is 
that either looking at the query itself will immediately reveal the 
problem to you, or that the query in combination with the document and 
knowledge of which analyzers you are using will reveal the problem-
