I found this page extremely helpful in finding out EXACTLY what Lucene is 
doing (and how, if I wanted to, to change it). Like Erik said, it does 
pretty darn well just as it is. I'm not sure if anyone has already pointed 
you to this page yet.

You'll have to spend some time diving down in to each component of the 
score, as it's composed of a number of different factors, but it's all 
described on this page, and it tells you what the default behavior is 
using DefaultSimilarity.
