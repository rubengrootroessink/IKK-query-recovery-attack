SUBJECT: Re: Question about highlighting returning nothing
DATE: 15 Aug 2007

Well, in my case the highlighting was returning nothing because of (my 
favorite acronym) PBCAK--

I don't store the text in the index, so I have to retrieve it separately 
(from a database) for the highlighting, and my database was not in sync 
with the index, so in a few cases the document in the index had been 
deleted from the database--thus a score, but no document text.

But I guess my original question remains; under what conditions would the 
highlighter return nothing? Only if no terms matched?
