thanks.
In this case it actually looks like I was trying to solve a problem
that doesn't exist (not an unusual occurrence in my experience)
since the StandardAnalyzer does not appear to split the terms
if the period has no white space following. I was a bit misled by
the additional complication that I am using the MoreLikeThis
class to construct the query, and it seemed to be dropping the
SAP.FIN term, apparently because it actually never appears in
my index to be searched, only in my input queries. In fact I may
decide to do some acronym expansion of this to allow it to
match things that *do* appear in my index.

But your point about the StandardAnalyzer being slow is 
well-taken, and I'll keep that in mind. Also, the straighforward
substitution before indexing and searching is a reasonable
approach to keep in mind.

Thanks-
Donna

Some possibilities...

     you'll have to maintain it in later releases.
> use some simple transformations for the input *before* tokenizing.

   the Standard* beasts) are slower than the other analyzers, so you
   may be better off eschewing them.
