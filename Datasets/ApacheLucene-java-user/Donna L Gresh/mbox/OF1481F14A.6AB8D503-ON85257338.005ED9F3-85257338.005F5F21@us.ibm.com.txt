SUBJECT: Question about highlighting returning nothing
DATE: 15 Aug 2007

I'm working on refining my stopwords by looking at the highest scoring 
document returned for each search, and using the highlighter to show which 
terms were significant in choosing that document. This has been extremely 
helpful in improving my searches. I've noticed though that sometimes the 
highlighter returns nothing, even though there is a non-zero score for the 
match. Could someone explain why this is so? A recent discussion I found 
spoke about the usefulness of returning, say, the first bit of text when 
this happens, but there wasn't any discussion of *why* this occurs--
Thanks

Donna
