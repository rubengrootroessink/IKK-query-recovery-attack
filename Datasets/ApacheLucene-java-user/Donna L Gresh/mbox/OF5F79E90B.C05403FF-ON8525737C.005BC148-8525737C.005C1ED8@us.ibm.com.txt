SUBJECT: Miles Efron asked about "IncompatibleClassChangeError" last december
DATE: 22 Oct 2007

I am seeing a problem reported in the archives last december; I'm getting 
the same one, also on a redhat java--same version 
gcj as his


It does not appear on our windows systems or another linux system. Hoss 
suggested that it may be a duplicate defination of lucene core in the 
classpath, but I don't see that this is my problem. Miles, did you ever 
solve this?

Miles Efron wrote (last December):


i have successfully compiled, installed, and run lucene-based applications 

on several machines, but i am currently trying to get lucene to run on a 
sever that i do not administer and am having an odd problem... perhaps 
someone can decipher it?

if i try, for instance, to run the basic lucene demo (IndexFiles) I get 
the following output, then stacktrace:

$ java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles ../data/medline/docs/
Indexing to directory 'index'...

I've googled this Exception, but haven't found much.  For futher 
reference, here's version info on java on the machine:

java -version
java version "1.4.2"
gcj (GCC) 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-3)

If anyone has thoughts on what might be the matter, I'd be most grateful. 
Thanks,
-Miles
