I believe he meant that in one place (with no error) you have
"E:/eclipse/310307/objtest/crawl-result/indexes/part-00000";

but in the other you have
indexDir="E:/eclipse/310307/objtest/crawl-result/index/"

Notice the difference between "indexes" and "index".
The error message is explicitly saying that the index directory does not 
exist.
