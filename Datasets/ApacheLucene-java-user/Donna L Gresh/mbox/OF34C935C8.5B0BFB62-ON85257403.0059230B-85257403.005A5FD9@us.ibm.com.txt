SUBJECT: applying patch in Eclipse to get SpanHighlighter functionality
DATE: 5 Mar 2008

I have downloaded the Lucene (core, 2.3.1) code and created a project 
using Eclipse (pointing to src/java) to use it. That works fine, along 
with the contrib highlighter jar file from the standard distribution.

I have also successfully added an additional Eclipse project for the 
(standard) Highlighter, pointing to ..contrib/highlighter/src/java . I can 
use this project instead of the standard highlighter jar file and that 
works fine too.

I am having trouble figuring out how to apply the patch (assuming that's 
possible) to get the SpanHighlighter functionality. When I try to apply 
the patch using team->apply patch and pointing to the patch xml file, I am 
getting errors that seem to imply that the patch is looking for things 
under contrib/highlighter.... which it can't find. 

I admit to knowing very little about patches; I am just interested in 
getting the SpanHighlighter functionality. 

Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thank you.
