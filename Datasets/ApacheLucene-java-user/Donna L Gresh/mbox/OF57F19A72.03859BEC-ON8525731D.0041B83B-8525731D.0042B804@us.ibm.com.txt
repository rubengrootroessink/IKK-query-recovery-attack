SUBJECT: question about flush(), optimize(), and deleted documents
DATE: 19 Jul 2007

I have run into problems with an error that I am trying to access a 
deleted document when doing something along the lines below; my brief 
question is, what is necessary to avoid "seeing" deleted documents? Is an 
optimize() necessary? Or will a flush() or close() accomplish the same 
thing? 

IndexReader ireader = IndexReader.open(directoryName);
int numdocs = ireader.numDocs();
for (int i=0; i<numdocs; i++) {
        Document doc = ireader.document(i);
        Field field = doc.getField("id");
