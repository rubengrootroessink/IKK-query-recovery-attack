SUBJECT: Obtaining the (indexed) terms in a field in a particular document
DATE: 20 Mar 2007

My apologies if this is a simple question--

How can I get all the (stemmed and stop words removed, etc.) terms in a 
particular field of a particular document?

Suppose my documents each consist of two fields, one with the name "my_id" 
and a unique identifier, and the other being some text string consisting
of a number of words.
I'd like to get all the terms in the text string given the unique 
identifier.

(My basic reason is to do a sort of document similarity between the text 
string and some other text string, doing a boolean query with
a number of SHOULD clauses, if this makes sense; I'm welcome to 
suggestions of better ways to do this)
