SUBJECT: RE: Is there a way for me to handle a multiword synonym correctly?
DATE: 7 Aug 2009

I have to think about this a bit, but that may work. I just have to make 
sure no "undesirable" side effects occur. I certainly want to be able to 
search for a phrase and not have it match all the individual bits, but 
that should already work using the mechanism I already have in place.
