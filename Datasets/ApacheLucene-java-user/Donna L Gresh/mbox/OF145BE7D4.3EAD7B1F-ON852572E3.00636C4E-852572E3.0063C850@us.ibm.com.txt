SUBJECT: MoreLikeThis?
DATE: 22 May 2007

Hello,
I'm sorry if this is a naive question, but I have implemented my own 
"MoreLikeThis" functionality, and 
in re-reading the FAQ saw that it looks like something like this is 
already built, so I wanted to try it out and see 
if it would simplify my code:

How do I find similar documents?
See the org.apache.lucene.search.similar package from the contrib area. It 
is part of Lucene starting with Lucene 1.9. 

I'm using Lucene 2.1 so I'm definitely at that level, but in the contrib 
area in my Lucene distribution, I couldn't figure out what I need to 
include.
What do I need to do to try this package out?
thanks in advance--
