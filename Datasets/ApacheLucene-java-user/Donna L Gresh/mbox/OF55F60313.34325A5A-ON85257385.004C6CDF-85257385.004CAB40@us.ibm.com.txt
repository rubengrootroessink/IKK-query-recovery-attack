DATE: 31 Oct 2007

I am not an expert but I think you can solve problem 1 by overriding the 
coord function in the similarity class:

1.      coord(q,d) is a score factor based on how many of the query terms 
are found in the specified document. Typically, a document that contains 
more of the query's terms will receive a higher score than another 
document with fewer query terms. This is a search time factor computed in 
coord(q,d) by the Similarity in effect at search time. 

the default similarity class defines coord as thus:

coord
public float coord(int overlap,
                   int maxOverlap)
Implemented as overlap / maxOverlap.
