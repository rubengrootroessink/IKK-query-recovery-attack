Hi

I dont know much about lucene's scoring, but my intuition tells me that
a boost of "2" tells lucene to regard that field/document as
"double-important", while a boost of "0.5" tells lucene to regard the
field/document as "half-important". Thus the boost is exponential, is
that right !?

If not, at what other scale does the boosting occur !?

Or, to put it more simple, what does a boost of "2" or "10" _mean_ in
contrast to a boost of "0.5" or "0.1" !?

TIA,

Sebastian.
