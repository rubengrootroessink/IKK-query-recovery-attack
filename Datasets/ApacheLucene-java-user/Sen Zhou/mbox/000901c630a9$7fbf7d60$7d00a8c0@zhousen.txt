SUBJECT: Can the score be changed dynamically?
DATE: 13 Feb 2006

Hi,all
  We have a requirement that the clicked-number of the document will be a
factor in the score's calculation. For example, a search operation returns
10 documents ordered by score. But the 2nd document are more frequently
choosen and clicked by users than the 1st one. Of course, I will record the
click number. I want the 2nd document to bubble up and become the first one.
How can I integrate the function to Lucene.
Any suggestion? 

Best wishes,
Sen Zhou
