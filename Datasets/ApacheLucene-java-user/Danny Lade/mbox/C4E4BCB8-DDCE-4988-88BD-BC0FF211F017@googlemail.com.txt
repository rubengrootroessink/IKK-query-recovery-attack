IMO, a "reversed word Index" does not work in this case, because he's looking for a word in
the middle (See curi*). 

Another idea is to build word chunks and save them in a second index plus docID of the first
index. 

e.g. security go to "security ecurity curity ... ity"

This is much faster to search (just "curi*") but getting much bigger in index size. So it
depends what is needed ...

Greetings Danny

on your application profile I guess and what you want, but an additional index may not be
too bad in some cases to speed up the search.
