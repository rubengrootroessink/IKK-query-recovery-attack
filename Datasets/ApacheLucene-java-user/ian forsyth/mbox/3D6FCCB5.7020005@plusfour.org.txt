Hi,

two questions.

1. off-topic in the demo SearchFiles..  Is there a way that I could put 
the result set into a 2-d associative array, then serialize the array, 
then read the stdin out put via another language like php, then 
unserialize still having the 2-d array.. ? I have not been able to get 
the Hashtable/array to work yet, so I have not been able to try it 
myself. .

2. I remember reading some mention of a class that generated a 
description for the search result based on the search query.. so the 
result set for array looks something like googles result set.. with the 
query term bolded, or highlighted in some way in the result description..

regards,
Ian
