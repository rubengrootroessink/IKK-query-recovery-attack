SUBJECT: All Terms Unique
DATE: 14 Dec 2008

I have an index with these terms defined for each document:
language
author
religion

Is there a simple way to get from the index a unique list of all the authors
?

How about all the authors that also have "english" and "baha'i" set?

I'm creating the UI and need 'pickers' for these items.

Thanks!
Ian
