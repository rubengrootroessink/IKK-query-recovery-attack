SUBJECT: "Near" force in query server side?
DATE: 19 Feb 2009

Once my app gets the query string from the user, is there a way to tell the
query engine to only return documents where these words are at most 5 words
apart? I can't tell the user to change their query, I have to do it server
side.
Is so do I have to add anything to my index to let Lucene know about
positions of the terms when it indexes?

Thanks,
