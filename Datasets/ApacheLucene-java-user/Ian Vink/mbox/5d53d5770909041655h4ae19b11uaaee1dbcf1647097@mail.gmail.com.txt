SUBJECT: Newbie: Luke and fields
DATE: 4 Sep 2009

I have created an index and each document has a contents field and a
language field.

contents has the flags: Indexed Tokenized Stored Vector
language has the flags: Indexed Stored

In luke I can search contents fine, but when I try to search the field
language, I never ever get results.

Every document has a language field populated which I can see in Luke's
document browser.

I have tried language:english and even made language the default field.

I gotta be missing something simple....
