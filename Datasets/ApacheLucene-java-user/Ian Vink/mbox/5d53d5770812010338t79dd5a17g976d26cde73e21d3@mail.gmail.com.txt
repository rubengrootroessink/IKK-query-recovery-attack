SUBJECT: Hits Max # of documents?
DATE: 1 Dec 2008

(I'm using Lucene.NET but the APIs are close enough)
I'd like the search to always return all documents always. I notice that it
'seems'  to return a percentage of them.

Hits myHits = searcher.search(query);

Is what I use.

Is there a way to force the searcher to give me everything?

Ian
