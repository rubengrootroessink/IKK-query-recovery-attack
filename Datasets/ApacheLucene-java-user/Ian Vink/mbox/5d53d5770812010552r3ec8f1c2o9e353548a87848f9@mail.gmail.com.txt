SUBJECT: ID field - hundreds?
DATE: 1 Dec 2008

Each document has a field "DocID" with a unique int in the index.
I want to search the documents with DocID of 1 or 2 or 5 or 8 etc (hundreds
long list)

When I specify a query like: [  contents:Hello DocID:1 DocID:2   ]
 etc it is slow.

Is there a more efficient way to limit my search to books in the set
 [1,2,3,5,8] ?
