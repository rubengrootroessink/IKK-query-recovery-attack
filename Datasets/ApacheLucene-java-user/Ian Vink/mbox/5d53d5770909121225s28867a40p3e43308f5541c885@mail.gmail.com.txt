SUBJECT: field with single quote <baha'i> being split
DATE: 12 Sep 2009

My index has a field <religion> with the source of the document. In luke I
can see that religion has baha'i or islam or Tao etc....

The problem is that when I construct a query in luke with "religion:baha'i"
luke thinks it's 2 terms "baha" and "i"

Is there a way to construct a query to make it search <religion> with the
single term "baha'i" ?

I've tried escaping the single quote but still luke splits the query into 2
terms.

Thanks,
ian
