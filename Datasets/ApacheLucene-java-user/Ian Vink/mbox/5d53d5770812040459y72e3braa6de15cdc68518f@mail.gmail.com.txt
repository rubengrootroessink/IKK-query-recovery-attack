SUBJECT: Design guidance - search strategy
DATE: 4 Dec 2008

I have documents with this simple schema in Lucene which I can not change.
docid: (int)
contents: (text)

The user is given a list of 10,000 documents in a tree which they select to
search, usually they select 5000 or so.

I only want to search those 5000 documents. I have the 'id' fields. That is
all.

I do this now:

Get the 'Hits' for all documents.
Loop through all Hits looking for any 'docid' that is in the 5000 selected
by the user
Add found docs to a collection of found documents and return that to the UI.


Is there a better way of doing this?
