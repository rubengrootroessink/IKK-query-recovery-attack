SUBJECT: Distinct terms values? (like in Luke)
DATE: 10 May 2009

I have tagged each of my documents with a term "religion" and values like
"Baha'i, Christian, Jewish, Islam" etc.
In Luke it shows me that I have a term count of 8 for the term "religion"

How do I get a list of the 8 distinct values for the term religion from an
index?
