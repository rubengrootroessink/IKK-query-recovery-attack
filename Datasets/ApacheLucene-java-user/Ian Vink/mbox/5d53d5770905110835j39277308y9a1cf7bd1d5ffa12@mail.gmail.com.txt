SUBJECT: IndexReader.Terms - internals
DATE: 11 May 2009

            IndexReader rdr = IndexReader.Open(myFolder);
            TermEnum terms = rdr.Terms((new Term(myTermName, "")));

(from .NET land, but it's all the same)

This code works great, I can loop thru the terms nicely, but after it
returns all the myTermName terms, it goes into all other terms.

Is there a way to limit the rdr.Terms to return only those whose field is
myTermName
