Hi Ganesh,

I'm not sure whether this will work for you, but one way I got around
this was with multiple searches.  I only needed the first 50 results,
but wanted to sort by date,hour,min,sec. This could result in 5
results or millions of results.

I added the date to the query, so I'd search for results only in the
past hour first. If that returns 51+ results then I can stop
searching. If not, then I'd search the past day, past week... until
51+ results have been found, or I've searched the entire index.

50 results are displayed, +1 so that I know to display the next page link.

Sorting was such a performance hit versus multiple searches, that this
worked really well, for this application.

Cheers,
Phil
