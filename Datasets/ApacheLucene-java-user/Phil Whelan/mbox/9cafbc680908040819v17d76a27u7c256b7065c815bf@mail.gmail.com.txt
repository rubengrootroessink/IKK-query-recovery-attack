I do not have a solution to this, but it strikes me as very similar to
they way you traverse Japanese to break words, since that has no
spaces. Is there a Japanese tokenizer and, if so, does it handle this?
If so, you could replace the Japanese dictionary with an English
dictionary. Just a random thought had that might / might not help.
