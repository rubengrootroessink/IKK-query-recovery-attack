If there are only have a few thousand documents, and the number of
results quite small is this a case where post-search filtering can be
done?

I have not done anything like this myself with Lucene, so is this a
bad idea? If not, what would be the best way to do this?
org.apache.lucene.search.Filter?

Thanks,
Phil
