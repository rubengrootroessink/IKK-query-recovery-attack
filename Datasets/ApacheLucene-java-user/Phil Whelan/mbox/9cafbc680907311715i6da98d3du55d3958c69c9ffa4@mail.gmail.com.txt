SUBJECT: Is it possible to retrieve Terms from a Document?
DATE: 1 Aug 2009

Hi,

I know you can use Field.Store.YES, but I want to inspect the terms /
tokens and their order related to the field name at search time. Is
this possible? Obviously this information is stored in the index, but
I can not find any API to access it. I'm guessing the answer might be
that Terms point to a Document and not the other way around. Is this
right?

eg.
Document doc = .... ;
Term[] terms = doc.getTerms();

Or...
String[] values = doc.getTermValues();

Thanks,
Phil
