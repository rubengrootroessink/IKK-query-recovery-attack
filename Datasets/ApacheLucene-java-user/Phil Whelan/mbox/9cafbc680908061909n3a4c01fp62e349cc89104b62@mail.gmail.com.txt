This query will also pass through the same (hopefully) Analyzer and
will be broken into terms. So the query will actually be for
"file-1-2" and "dat" where "file-1-2" is followed immediately by
"dat".

In indexing the terms position is stored, so
"C:\dir1\dir2\file-1-1.dat" becomes...
[0] c
[1] dir1
[2] dir2
[3] file-1-1
[4] dat

"file-1-1" is followed by "dat", so there is a match.

Does that make sense?

Cheers,
Phil
