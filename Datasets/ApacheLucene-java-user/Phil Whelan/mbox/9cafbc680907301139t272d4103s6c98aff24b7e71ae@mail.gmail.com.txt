Thanks, I really appreciate your help with this. That's great to know.
Can I take this a little further...

If I have "foo@bar.com bar@foo.com com@bar.foo" and analyze it I get
"foo bar com bar foo com com bar foo", so perhaps I need a different
way of delimiting the emails, as it will match some other combinations
here, eg. foo@com.com which is not one of the emails.

Has anyone done anything similar? I can imagine that one option would
be to filter the returned docs based on the original content of the
string I'm analyzing. Does Lucene do this for me?

Thanks,
Phil
