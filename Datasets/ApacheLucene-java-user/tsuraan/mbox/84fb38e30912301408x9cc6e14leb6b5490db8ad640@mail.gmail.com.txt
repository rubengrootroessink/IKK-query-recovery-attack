SUBJECT: Copy and augment an indexed Document
DATE: 30 Dec 2009

Suppose I have a (useful) document stored in a Lucene index, and I
have a variant that I'd also like to be able to search.  This variant
has the exact same data as the original document, but with some extra
fields.  I'd like to be able to use an IndexReader to get the document
that I stored, use the document's add method to put my extra fields
in, and then add that document to the index using an IndexWriter.
This doesn't seem to work, in general.  Non-stored fields of the
original document are not in the variant document.  This makes sense
from an OO point of view (how would that document object possibly have
the non-stored data of the original doc), but is there some
lower-level way to do what I want to do?

It's somewhat expensive to completely re-create my document, as it
relies on data parsed from (often large) pdf and MS Office files.  I'd
like to be able to use the already-stored terms that are in my index
and associated with my existing document.  Can I iterate through the
terms of my index and add references to my newly-added document?  Is
there any utility to make this work nicely?
