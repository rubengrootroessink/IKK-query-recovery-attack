Well, that does sound like a ton of fun.  It's not terrible for me to
create new documents; the biggest issue is that they can be a bit on
the large side, and I thought that if I could use what's already
stored in the index rather than having to make lucene re-analyze it,
maybe things could be faster/easier.  It sounds like that isn't the
case :)

Yeah, that works.  I'll stick with feeding documents in the good old
fashioned way.
