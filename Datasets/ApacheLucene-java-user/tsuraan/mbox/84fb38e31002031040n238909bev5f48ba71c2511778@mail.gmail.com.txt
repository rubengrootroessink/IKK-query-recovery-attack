SUBJECT: Sort and Collector
DATE: 3 Feb 2010

Is there any way to run a search where I provide a Query, a Sort, and
a Collector?  I have a case where it is sometimes, but rarely,
necessary to get all the results from a query, but usually I'm
satisfied with a smaller amount.  That part I can do with just a query
and a collector, but I'd like the results to be sorted as they are
submitted to the collector's collect method.  Is that possible?
