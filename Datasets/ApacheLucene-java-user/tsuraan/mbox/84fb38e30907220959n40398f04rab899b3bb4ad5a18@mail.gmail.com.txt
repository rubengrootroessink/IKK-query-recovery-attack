SUBJECT: Batch searching
DATE: 22 Jul 2009

If I understand lucene correctly, when doing multiple simultaneous
searches on the same IndexSearcher, they will basically all do their
own index scans and collect results independently.  If that's correct,
is there a way to batch searches together, so only one index scan is
done?  What I'd like is a Searcher.search(Query[], Collector[]) type
function, where the search only scans over the index once for each
collection of (basically unrelated) searches.  Is that possible, or
does that even make sense?
