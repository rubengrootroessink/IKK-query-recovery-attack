Thanks!  We'll be switching to 2.9 once it's ready.  From past
experience, lucene upgrades are simple and painless, but I don't think
I can do a 2.4.1 upgrade right now.  My code's (for some reason) doing
an optimize right after the addIndexesNoOptimize call, so it's
definitely not a problem to just switch to using plain addIndexes
instead.  Funny how code seems to grow warts like that...
