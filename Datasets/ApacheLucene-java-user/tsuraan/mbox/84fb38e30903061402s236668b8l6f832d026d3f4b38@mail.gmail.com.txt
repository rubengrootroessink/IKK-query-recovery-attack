SUBJECT: ZipFile directory implementation
DATE: 6 Mar 2009

I wrote a really basic read-only Directory implementation for indices
contained in zip files.  It's read-only because that's what Java's API
supports, and it has no documentation or anything else because I
haven't gotten to that yet.  It also claims its package is
org.apache.lucene.store since that's how I was testing it.

Anyhow, it's really ugly, but seems to work.  I was wondering if
anybody wanted to have a glance at it to see if there's anything
obvious that I'm doing wrong, simple off-by-one errors, that sort of
thing.

The code is on github,
http://github.com/tsuraan/zipdirectory/tree/master .  If anybody wants
to have a look, test it out a bit, whatever, I'd be grateful.  There's
no license headers on the source either; I figured public domain, bsd,
apache-2.0, whatever works would be fine.  I'm also open to better
methods of packaging it; I assume that putting it in the lucene
package like that myself isn't quite the right way to do things...

Thanks!
