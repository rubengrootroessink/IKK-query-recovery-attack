SUBJECT: Lucene in Action Rev2
DATE: 26 Aug 2009

In the free first chapter of the new Lucene in Action book, it states
that it's targetting Lucene 3.0, but on the Manning page for the book,
it says the code in the book is written for 2.3.  I'm guessing that
the book is the authority on what the book covers, but could somebody
maybe change the Manning page to reflect that?
