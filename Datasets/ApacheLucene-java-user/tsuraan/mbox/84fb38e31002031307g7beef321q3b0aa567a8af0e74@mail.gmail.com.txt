SUBJECT: Sort memory usage
DATE: 3 Feb 2010

Is the cache used by sorting on strings separated by reader, or is it
a global thing?  I'm trying to use the near-realtime search, and I
have a few indices with a million docs apiece.  If I'm opening a new
reader every minute, am I going to have every term in every sort field
read into RAM for each reader that I have open?  Or, is the cache
smarter about that, and at least the strings are interned, or does it
work completely differently from that?
