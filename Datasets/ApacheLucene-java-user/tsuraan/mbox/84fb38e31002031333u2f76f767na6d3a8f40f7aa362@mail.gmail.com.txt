Ok, so the cache is tied to the index, and not to any particular
reader.  The actual FieldCacheImpl keeps a mapping from Reader to its
terms, so are the cached values shared just because the Readers
actually wrap the same Indices, so the termDocs for all the readers
are actually almost entirely the same?
