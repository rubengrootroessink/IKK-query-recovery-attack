Hi Rob,

One possibility might be to use the IndexReader's termDocs(Term) method 
and then use the skipTo(int) method on the TermDocs object.  Iterate 
over your document list and then your term list for each document.  Each 
time skipTo puts you at the document you are looking for, you can add 
that term to the document's term list.  This probably isn't the most 
efficient method but it should work.
