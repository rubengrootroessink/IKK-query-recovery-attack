SUBJECT: Relevance Feedback
DATE: 29 Mar 2002

Hello,

I'm a graduate student in the Information School at the University of 
Washington.  I'm currently in the process of developing a prototype 
online IR system and I have been making use of Lucene's API.  I'm just 
beginning to plan out some mechanisms for query expansion and relevance 
feedback.  I haven't seen any mention of manual or automated query 
expansion or user relevance feedback in the Lucene documentation or FAQs.  

Does anyone have any experience with these processes in general and/or 
specifically with Lucene?  If so, did you have to reimplement Lucene's 
Scorer to incorporate the relevance measures?  Any pointers to 
information on how practical this redesign would be?  Will I be able to 
implement query expansion and/or relevance feedback without 
reconstructing some of Lucene's underlying scoring code?

Any information pointers you can give would be great.

Thanks,
Nathan
