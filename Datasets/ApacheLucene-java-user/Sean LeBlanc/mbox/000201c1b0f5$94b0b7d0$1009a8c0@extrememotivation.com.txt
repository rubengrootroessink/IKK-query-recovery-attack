Hi,

I was reading over the docs and reading up in general on Lucene. I want to
know if I can do the following:

1. Select one column from a subset of tables in a MS SQL Server database I
have, and index those...with some mechanism to keep the index in sync with
data as rows are added.
2. Run a query against one or many of the index columns.

Is this possible? I see that Lucene *can* index database data, but something
needs to be coded to handle this? Has anyone built any thin framework or
have code snippets available? Has anyone ever used Lucene to replace
Fulcrum?


TIA,
Sean
