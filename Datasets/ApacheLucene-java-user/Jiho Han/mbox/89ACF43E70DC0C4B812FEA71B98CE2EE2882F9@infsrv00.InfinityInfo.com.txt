SUBJECT: Another MultiFieldQueryParser question...
DATE: 15 Jan 2007

I looked through the archive a bit and found some Q & A's regarding this
but I didn't see anything definitive so I thought I'd ask again...

Basically, I have a web page that can search through a database table
across multiple servers.
So imagine that there are 100 different databases spread across a number
of servers but the schema is same.
I created an index with fields specific to each row in a particular
table such as NAME, TYPE, COMPANY, etc. in addition to SERVER, DATABASE
so I can capture where they are from.

Ultimately, what I want is a single HTML input field that can capture a
query expression and instantiate a searcher and return a result set.
This querystring should be in any number of forms:

Ex)
John Doe ABC Company (which would search for each word OR'ed in all of
the fields)
"John Doe" And "ABC Company" (which would search for "John Doe" AND'ed
with "ABC Company" in all of the fields)
NAME:"John Doe" COMPANY:"ABC Company" (which would search for results
where either NAME contains "John Doe" OR COMPANY contains "ABC Company")
NAME:"John Doe" And COMPANY:"ABC Company" (which would search in each
field but must match both fields)
+NAME:"John Doe" +COMPANY:"ABC Company" (which I understand is same as
the previous line - if not please correct me)

So I am wondering if a single instance of Query and
MultiFieldQueryParser can do this.  Do I need any other special
processing?

Here's what I have right now (C#):

        string[] searchFields = new string[] {
            "SERVER", "DATABASE", "NAME", "COMPANY", "TYPE"
        };

        MultiFieldQueryParser parser = new
MultiFieldQueryParser(searchFields, new StandardAnalyzer());
        parser.SetDefaultOperator(QueryParser.Operator.OR);
        Query query = parser.Parse(querystring);

Then I pass 'query' into MultiSearcher.  Well, it's not returning the
results as I expect.
Can some show me what I need to change?
Thanks
