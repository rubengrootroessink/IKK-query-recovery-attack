It works perfectly. It is implemented in a GPL project, aka 
"simexplorer-is", in class LuceneDatabase (createFilter) :
<https://labs.libre-entreprise.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/trunk/simexplorer-is/simexplorer-is-storage/src/java/fr/cemagref/simexplorer/is/storage/database/lucene/?root=simexplorer-si>
I think that this class is a good sample of what is possible to do with 
Lucene as a metadata database.
Hope it will help.
