SUBJECT: RE: Using multiple analysers within a query
DATE: 24 Nov 2004

Hi again,

Thanks for everyone who replied.  The PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper was a good
suggestion, and one I had overlooked, but for our particular
requirements it wouldn't quite work so I went with overriding
getFieldQuery().

You were right, Paul.  In 1.4.2 a whole heap of QueryParser changes were
made, mostly removing the analyzer parameter from methods.

In the end I built my changes on top of the NewMultiFieldQueryParser
which was shared here recently and works wonders -- thanks Bill Janssen
and sergiu gordea.  I added support for slops and boosts to build
together with the multi-fields array, and then overrode getFieldQuery to
check the queryText for a start char ("=" for example) and if found
remove it and switch to a non-tokenising analyser.

Then I found that because that analyser always returns a single token
(TermQuery) it would send through spaces into the final query string,
causing problems.  So also in getFieldQuery I check if it needs breaking
up and converting into a PhraseQuery.

Seems to work, just needs thorough testing.  If anyone would like a copy
I could post it up here.

Regards, --Leto
