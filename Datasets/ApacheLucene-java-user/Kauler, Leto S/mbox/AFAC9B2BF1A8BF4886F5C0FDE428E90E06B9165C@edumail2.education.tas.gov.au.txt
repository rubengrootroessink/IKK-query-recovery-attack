SUBJECT: RE: Using multiple analysers within a query
DATE: 25 Nov 2004

Actually, just realised a PhraseQuery is incorrect...
I only want a single TermQuery but it just needs to be quoted, d'oh.


-----Original Message-----
Then I found that because that analyser always returns a single token
(TermQuery) it would send through spaces into the final query string,
causing problems.  So also in getFieldQuery I check if it needs breaking
up and converting into a PhraseQuery.
