Because you are build from QueryParser rather than a TermQuery, all
search terms in the query are being lowercased by StandardAnalyzer.

So your query of "olFaithFull:stillhere" requires that there is an exact
index term of "stillhere" in that field.  It depends on how you built
the index (index and stored fields are different), but I would check on
that.  Also maybe try out TermQuery and see if that does anything for
you.
