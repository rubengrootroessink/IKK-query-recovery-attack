SUBJECT: Follow-up to "sorting tokenised field"
DATE: 10 Feb 2005


Have been reading this thread

Praveen Peddi (or anyone else), did you ever try the patch?  I would be
interested to know what sort of performance difference it makes.

I have been trying to create a "most-simple" solution to indexing and
sorting.  I was hoping that it would be possible to sort on our fields
without requiring the use (and therefore prior knowledge of) specific
sort fields.

Useful would be the ability to add a sort term to fields, along with
their regular terms.  If the field is not tokenised then a sort term
might not be necessary so the sort engine performs as normal, but if the
field is tokenised then the engine could use this defined sort term,
thus allowing all terms to be kept together in the one field.

I don't know what the technical implications of this is though.  Just a
thought.
