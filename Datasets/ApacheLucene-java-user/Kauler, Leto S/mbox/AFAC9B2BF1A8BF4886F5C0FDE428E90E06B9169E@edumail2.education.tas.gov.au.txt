Thanks for the replies!  It would seem best for us to move to specifying
the sort type--good practice anyway and prevents possible field
problems.  I plan to run the stress testing again today but turning off
the sorting (just using default SCORE) and see how that goes.

Seasons greetings to you all.

Each page on our website gathers content from Lucene using predefined
queries, kind of like a database.  The odd thing: I can not replicate
the problem if I browse the site casually.  It's only under this stress
testing that the problem occurs.  It does not happen on specific
pages/queries, but more random--about every second to fourth query has
the exception.

Makes me wonder if our code is crossing over somewhere when multiple
queries are performed at the same time.

That makes sense. Our titles would sometimes contain, even start with,
numbers.

Will RangeQuery still work with that?  We do have separate date fields
which are indexed like the following code, but a move to the YYYYMMDD
format might be good as then we could apply a blanket String-type sort.

public static Date parseDate( String s )
   DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss");
   return dateFormat.parse(s);
}
doc[0].add(Field.Keyword(field, parseDate( dateInString )));
