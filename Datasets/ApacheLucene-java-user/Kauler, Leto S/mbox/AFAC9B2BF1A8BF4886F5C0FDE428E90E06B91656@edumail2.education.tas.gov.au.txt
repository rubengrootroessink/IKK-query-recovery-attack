SUBJECT: Using multiple analysers within a query
DATE: 22 Nov 2004

Hi Lucene list,

We have the need for analysed and 'not analysed/not tokenised' clauses
within one query.  Imagine an unparsed query like:

+title:"Hello World" +path:Resources\Live\1

In the above example we would want the first clause to use
StandardAnalyser and the second to use an analyser which returns the
term as a single token.  So a parsed result might look like:

+(title:hello title:world) +path:Resources\Live\1

Would anyone have any suggestions on how this could be done?  I was
thinking maybe the QueryParser would have to be changed/extended to
accept a separator other than colon ":", something like "=" for example
to indicate this clause is not to be tokenised.  Or perhaps this can all
be done using a single analyser?
