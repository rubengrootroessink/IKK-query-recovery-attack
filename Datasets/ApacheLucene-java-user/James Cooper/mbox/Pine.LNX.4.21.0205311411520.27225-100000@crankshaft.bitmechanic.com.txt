hi,

yeah, I agree.  Lucene is definately useful outside of Java
applications.  I'm currently using it as the search engine for a PHP based
web site.

I'm not doing anything super-smart.  Just using exec() to fork a JVM that
runs the search, prints the results to STDOUT, which I then parse in PHP.

I could see having a standard XML format for search results being
useful.  The only issue is that the format will likely need to change
given the structure of your index.

cheers
