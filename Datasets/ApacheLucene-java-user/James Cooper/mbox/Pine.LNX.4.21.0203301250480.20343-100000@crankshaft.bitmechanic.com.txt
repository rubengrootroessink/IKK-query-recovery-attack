SUBJECT: announce: web spider/search tool built w/Lucene
DATE: 30 Mar 2002


hi,

I've recently released a free web spider/search tool that uses
Lucene.  It's available from:

http://www.bitmechanic.com/projects/spindle/

It's the first project I've built with Lucene, so there's probably room
for improvment as far as how indexes are built and whatnot, but hopefully
others may find it useful.

cheers

-- James
