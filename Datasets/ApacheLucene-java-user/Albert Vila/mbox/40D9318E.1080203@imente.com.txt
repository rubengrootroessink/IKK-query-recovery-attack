SUBJECT: Re: Clustering question: searching two diferent indexes
DATE: 23 Jun 2004

Thanks Otis, but I can merge two indexes with different fields?

My big index has this fields, code, title, content, language and date. I 
add the new documents incrementally.

The clustering index only contains the fields code, and cluster. Merging 
the big index with the clustering one will preserve the order of the big 
one? For example, if I have the following indexes:
Big index
code_1, title_1, content_1, language_1, date_1
code_2, title_2, content_2, language_2, date_2
...

Clustering index
code_1, cluster_1
code_2, cluster_2
...

then the new merged index will be:

Merged index
code_1, title_1, content_1, language_1, date_1, cluster_1
code_2, title_2, content_2, language_2, date_2, cluster_2
...

If I can do that then fine, but I think the merging process uses the 
lucene internal ID to match the documents. I wanna use the code field to 
do that matching, is that possible?. I cannot be sure the lucene 
internal ID's are the same for the same codes in both indexes.

Thanks again,

Albert
