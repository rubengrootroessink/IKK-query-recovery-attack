SUBJECT: how lucene search?
DATE: 25 Jun 2003

Hi.

I have read some documents about lucene. I have questions about how lucene 
search for matching words.

I think I got it wrong, but here is what I get out of the text I read:
Documents contents fields. In one of the field-value there are terms that are 
searchable. When the searched term is found in the field it returns the field 
which says where the document is.

Questions:
To search if there are more terms that match, you have to search through all 
documents?????? 
So every time you search for a word you have to search through all documents??


I thought that when you create a inverted index, you go through all words in 
the documents and make a list. The list contents words that only appeare once 
in the list. Each word in the list points out those documents that content that 
word. And there are a table that says where every document is located. In this 
way you don't have to search through all documents everytime you do a search.

I'm confused...
sorry for my English
