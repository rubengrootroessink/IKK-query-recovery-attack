SUBJECT: What is the best practice of using synonymy ?
DATE: 23 Mar 2010

Hi all,

I'd like to use the synonymy in my project. And I think there's two
candidates solution :
1. using the synonymy in the indexing stage, enhance the index by using
synonymy
2. using the synonymy in the search stage, enhance the search query by
synonymy .

I'd like to know which one is better, any help is appreciated.
