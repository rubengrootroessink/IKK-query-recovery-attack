SUBJECT: How about lucene's delete performance ?
DATE: 13 Oct 2010

Hi all,

I only want to index the latest one week's data, the previous data can
be deleted. So I'd like to know about lucene's delete performance and
whether it will has impact on the search performance when I do lots of
delete operation in the meantime.  Thanks
