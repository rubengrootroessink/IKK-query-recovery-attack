SUBJECT: Prioiritze new documents
DATE: 30 Dec 2007

Hy,
I got a large index and when searching for a term I want the newer
documents be at the begining of the result set. I dont need a real order
by time but lucene should prioritze the newer documents.
I got the time of the document creation as a index-field but it takes
very long if I would force lucene to sort by this field, so I want to
avoid this and instead use a less sharp priority based ordering.

Can anybody give me a hint?

Thanks
