SUBJECT: Reuse of IndexReader
DATE: 12 Jul 2006

Hy,
I got the following situation:
A Servlet runing in Tomcat5. When starting the servlet up it automatically 
creates a IndexReader and stores it in a static variable. For searching this 
variable is used. When adding a document to the index, I create a 
IndexWriter, write the Document, and close the IndexWriter again.
This leads into a problem: The IndexReader only searches in documents which 
were in the index when the Reader was created. Every Document added 
afterwards is not searched in. When I restart the Servlet I can search in 
those documents.

Is this a normal behaviour and how can I avoid this?

Thanks
