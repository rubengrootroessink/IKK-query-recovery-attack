SUBJECT: Re: Prioiritze new documents
DATE: 30 Dec 2007

Hy,
a solution came into my mind: 
Every document gets boosted by a integer which I increment each time I
add a new document to the index. So the newer documents should get a
bigger boost than the older ones. 

I tried it out and ran into a problem: 
Although I set the Boost via doc.setBoost(value) for each document before writing it to the
index it doesnt change anything. Even worse if I look at the index using Luke (Version 0.7.1)
each document got a boost of 1 not of the value supplied.

Who can help me?

Thanks
