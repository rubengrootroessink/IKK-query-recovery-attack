SUBJECT: Re: Concurrent Indexing + Searching
DATE: 3 Feb 2008


Hi. Sorry if I seem a stranger in this thread, but there is something that I
can't resist clearing myself on.

Mark, you say that the additional documents added to a index, won't show up
until the # of threads accessing the index hits 0; and subsequently the
indexwriter instance is closed.

But I suppose that the autocommit=true, asserts that all flushed (Added)
documents are immediately committed ( and hence visible ) in the index, and
no explicit cclosing ( releasiing ) of the Indexwriter instance is required.
( Of course, re-opening an IndexSearcher instance is required ).

Am I being dumb ?

Looking eagerly for you to shed some light on my doubt.

Thanks
Ajay Garg
