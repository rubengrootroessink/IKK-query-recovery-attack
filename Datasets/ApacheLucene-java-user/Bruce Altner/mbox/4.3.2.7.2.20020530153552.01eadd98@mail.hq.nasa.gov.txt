SUBJECT: RE: MS Word Search ??
DATE: 30 May 2002

This is a good lead but it prompts me to ask this: if tools like openoffice 
and others (like Acrobat Distiller) know how to reformat Excel, PowerPoint, 
and Word it means that the data formats of these files, as streams, must be 
public knowledge. If so, where do you get this information? I would use it 
to try to build my own parser with JavaCC if I knew what bytes in the the 
input stream I needed to tokenize.

Obviously it's not that easy, otherwise we wouldn't need projects like POI. 
But is this correct, at least conceptually?

Disclaimer: I'm new to JavaCC but the topic interests me so I'm willing to 
put in the time to learn it.
