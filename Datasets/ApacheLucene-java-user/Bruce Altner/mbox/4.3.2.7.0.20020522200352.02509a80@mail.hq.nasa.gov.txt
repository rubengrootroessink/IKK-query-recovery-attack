SUBJECT: powerpoint: sometimes it works...sometimes it doesn't
DATE: 23 May 2002

Greetings:

I am brand new to Lucene so please forgive me if the following is too naive 
for polite replies...

I have built a web-based application to schedule and archive brown bag 
talks. The system uses a database
for the scheduling and searching by title, author, topic, abstract, etc. 
but I want to add full text searching of the powerpoint
files actually presented during the seminars.

So I ran a quick index (using the demo API) on the ppt file of  a past talk 
I'd given and Lucene handled it very well, finding hits 95% of the time. I 
was quite impressed and excited about the possibilities but then I indexed 
a more recent talk and Lucene failed completely, never once finding a term.

Any idea why it would work on one ppt file but not on another? The first 
was created using powerpoint from Office 97 and the latter (failed) example 
from Office 2000 so that's a strong possibility but I wanted to run this by 
folks on the list for opinions.

Thanks!

Bruce

PS My brown bag app is my second go-round with the jakarta Turbine 
framework. Ai'nt open source great!
