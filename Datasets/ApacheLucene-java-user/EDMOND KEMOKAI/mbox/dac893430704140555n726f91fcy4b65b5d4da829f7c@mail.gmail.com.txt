DATE: 14 Apr 2007

You'll have to implement your own ranking on top of Lucene.  Lucene only
gives you document scores, which is a measure of how well your query match a
document. Page rank determines how relevant a document is to your query, a
document might score well by having a lot of the query words, but it might
not be what you're looking for.
