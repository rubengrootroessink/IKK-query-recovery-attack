When you construct a Term manually, no analyzers are applied, it'sconstructed
with whatever you put in there, just as you specify it. So,
indeed, it "looks" like a KeywordAnalyzer is being used, but in reality
no analysis is being done.

So what's happening is that when you index with StandardAnalyzer,
your tokens are getting lower-cased and, I assume, you construct
your Terim with upper case, so it's not found.

You probably want to use KeywordAnalyzer for your document IDs
as it's intended to pass through the input without change. Then, as you
see, you'll be able to find things.

See PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper for the way to use different
analyzers on different fields, both an index time and
search time, it might help.

See Luke (google Lucene Luke) for a wonderful tool that
allows you to look at your index and see what's actually
stored as well as what the effect of different analyzers is.

Best
Erick
