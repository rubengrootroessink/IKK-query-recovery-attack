SUBJECT: Re: Best Way To Index Database Using Lucene?
DATE: 7 Nov 2005

I forgot to mention that if I use php-java-bridge to
use Lucene to index at the same time I input the data
into the mysql db, I don't even need to use JDBC.  If
I  index inside the business logic layer which is
java, then I will have to use JDBC.
