SUBJECT: Best Way To Index Database Using Lucene?
DATE: 7 Nov 2005

Hi,
  I use php and mysql.  The visitors enters data
through the web and the data is stored in the
database.  I want to make portions of that data to be
searchable using Lucene.  

I am thinking of giving that data to Lucene for
indexing at the same time of inputing that same data
into the database.  Is it a good idea?  or should I
just make php to input all the data into the mysql db
without indexing, and then just periodally update the
index?  

What's your suggestion?   Many thanks.
