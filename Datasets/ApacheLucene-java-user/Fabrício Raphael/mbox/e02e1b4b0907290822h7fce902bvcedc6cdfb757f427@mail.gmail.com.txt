DATE: 29 Jul 2009

I don't have the .jar of other lucene version.

But, in a moment I used the code of the lucene 2.9dev, that is at the svn,
in my classpath. And after I return to use the lucene-core-2.4.1.jar.
With the code of the svn, I did other code to get the Directory instance,
and it was work.
The code follow:
FSDirectory.open(dirIndex);

But, I want to return to use the lucene 2.4.1, because at the 2.9 the
structure the similarity, score and collecters is much different to 2.4. and
I need customize starting as a baseline on the structure.

Thanks!
