SUBJECT: - possible bug in lock timeout
DATE: 7 Nov 2007

In Lucene 2.x, in method Lock#obtain(long lockWaitTimeout) I see the 
following line:

int maxSleepCount = (int)(lockWaitTimeout / LOCK_POLL_INTERVAL);

Since I wanted to set the lock timeout to the largest possible, I called 
the IndexWriter#setDefaultWriteLockTimeout(Long.MAX_VALUE). This 
produces the effect in the quoted line that we get maxSleepCount a 
negative number.

Is this intended?

Cheers,
   Nik
