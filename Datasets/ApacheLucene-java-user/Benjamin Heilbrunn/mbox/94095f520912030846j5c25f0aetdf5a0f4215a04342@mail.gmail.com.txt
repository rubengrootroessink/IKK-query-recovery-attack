SUBJECT: Norm Value of not existing Field
DATE: 3 Dec 2009

Hi,

I'm using Lucene 2.9.1 patched with
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1260
For some special reason I need to find all documents which contain at
least 1 term in a certain field.
This works by iterating the norms array only as long as the field
exists on every document.
For documents without the field the norms array holds the byte-value 124.
Where does 124 come from - and is there a way to change it to an other
value like -128 (0xFF) for not existing fields?


Benjamin
