SUBJECT: Re: TooManyClauses and maxClauseCount question
DATE: 20 Jan 2010

Isn't maxClause count just a "best practice" limit to asure that
performance doesn't decrease silently if big queries occur?
Performance and memory consumption should depend on how many clauses
are really used / number of matching documents
I think that there is no (significant) difference in memory
consumption (or performance) if you run the same query with two
different maxClauseCount settings.

But don't believe me. I'm not familiar with the corresponding code.
