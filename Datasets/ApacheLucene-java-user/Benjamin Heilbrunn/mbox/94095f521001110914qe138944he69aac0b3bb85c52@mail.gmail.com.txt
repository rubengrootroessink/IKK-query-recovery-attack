SUBJECT: Field creation with TokenStream and stored value
DATE: 11 Jan 2010

Hey out there,

in lucene it's not possible to create a Field based on a TokenStream
AND supply a stored value.

Is there a reason why a Field constructor in the form of
   public Field(String name, TokenStream tokenStream, String storedValue)
does not exist?

I am using trees of TeeSinkTokenFilter's for the creation of many
fields, based on a source string.
That's the reason why I can't use the "standardconstructor"
    public Field(String name, String value, Store store, Index index)


Regards
Benjamin
