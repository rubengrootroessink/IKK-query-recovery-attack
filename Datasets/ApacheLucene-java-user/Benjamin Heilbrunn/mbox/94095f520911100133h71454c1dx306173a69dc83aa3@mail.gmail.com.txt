Hi,

I applied http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12411342/Lucene-1260.patch
That's exactly what I was looking for.

The problem is, that from know on I'm on a patched version and I'm not
very happy with breaking compatibility to the "original" jars...
So is there a chance that this patch becomes a part of lucenes upcoming changes?
