SUBJECT: docBase Parameter in Collector.setNextReader
DATE: 12 Nov 2009

Hello everyone,

I'm a little bit confused about the docBase parameter of
Collector.setNextReader.

Imagine the following:
  - Create new Index
  - Index 5 docs
  - Call IndexWriter.commit()
  - Index 7 docs
  - Call IndexWriter.commit()
  - close Writer

Now I have a 2-segment index right?

I have implemented an own Collector. If I execute an all docs matching
query on the above case the Collectors setNextReader method is called
twice (as I expected).
But docBase both times equals 0. Shouldn't it be 0 and 5?

What mistake could trigger such behaviour?


Benjamin
