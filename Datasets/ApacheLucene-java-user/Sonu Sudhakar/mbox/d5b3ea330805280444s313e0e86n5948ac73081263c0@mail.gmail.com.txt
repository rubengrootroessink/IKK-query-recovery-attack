SUBJECT: Boolean Query Issue
DATE: 28 May 2008

Hi,

I have some issue with boolean queries.

I am using Lucene-core-2.3.1.

I have done test on boolean query with 3 terms (data, store, variable) in my
TTL field. The TTL field is indexed and searched using StandardAnalyzer.

The three terms when searched individually gave the following result

1. TTL:data  => 3,733 results
2. TTL:store  => 76 results
3. TTL:variable  => 1,496 results

But found issue when combining these terms with boolean operators.

e.g.
1. TTL:data AND TTL:store OR TTL:variable => 3,733 results
it considered the TTL:data part only.

2. TTL:store AND TTL:data OR TTL:variable => 76 results
it considered  the TTL:store part only.

3. TTL:variable AND TTL:data OR  TTL:store => 1,496 results
it considered  the TTL:variable part only.

But I am getting correct result when combining terms with 'AND' operator. I
think the issue is with 'OR' operator.


Could anybody give an explanation for this behavior of lucene?
Could you give suggestions to rectify this?

Thanks,
Sonu
