SUBJECT: memory management style
DATE: 8 Mar 2010

Hi all,

I'm not sure if this is the right list, as it's sort of a development
question too, but I don't want to bother them over there. Anyway, I'm
curious as to the reason for using "manual memory management" a la
ByteBlockPool and consorts in Java. Is it for performance reasons
alone, to avoid the allocation and garbage collection of many small
objects or is there some residue of C-style thinking in the early
years?

Even then, shouldn't there be a more Java-ish solution using the
existing streams classes? Would that be the way to go if one started
over? I realize this is not very realistic, I'm asking out of
curiosity.

Thanks,
Chris
