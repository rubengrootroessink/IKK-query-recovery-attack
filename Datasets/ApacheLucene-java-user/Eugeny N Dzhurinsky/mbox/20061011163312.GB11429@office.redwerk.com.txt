Thats great!
Looks like the solution I needed, because each record will definitely has
unique ID, I need to just index document  and it's comments - not store 
contents etc, and I don't need any constraints!

I just need to search for something, which search will return set of that
unique IDs (those IDs are obtained from a database).

Thank you very much for all your help!
