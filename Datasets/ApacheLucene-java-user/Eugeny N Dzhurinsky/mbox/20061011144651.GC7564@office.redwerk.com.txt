Hi there!

I have a index structure like this:

document_id
some_text
.....

when searching for some set of documents, there could be a case when several
comments for the same document match the search criteria. In such case I need
to get single hit for all such cases, in other word - perform a "group by"-like 
operation based on document_id. For example, if I have records

1 : 10 : some text here
2 : 10 : some another text here

and the search string was "+some_text:some" - I need get only one hit for both 
these records (return only document_id).

I know I could collect all hits and then filter them, but I need also paging
functionality, so if I need to collect 1.000.000 hits into 50.000 of records -
I need to traverse all 1.000.000 of records, put 50.000 of unique items into
helper array, then get last page with 10 results - and it will take a lot of
time.
