Integersting. We have some kind of set of privileges, required to access the
object (let's say rows in table(s)), I thought if it is possible to use 
kind of "injection" of access control statement to SQL query for extraction
of only allowed data... But if Lucene needs to index anything, how could I 
define the access privileges for data?
