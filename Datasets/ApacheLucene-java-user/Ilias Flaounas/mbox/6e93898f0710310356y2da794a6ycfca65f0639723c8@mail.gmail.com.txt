SUBJECT: Get term id from dictionary
DATE: 31 Oct 2007

Dear experts,

I need to store and index a string of text into Lucene, and later I
want to get the Id of each term inside this string. Is it possible?
How can I do that?

I want a unique association, term (in my case a word) -> Id. I know,
that If I delete a document, the dictionary changes. Does the term id
change?


Thanks a lot
Ilias
