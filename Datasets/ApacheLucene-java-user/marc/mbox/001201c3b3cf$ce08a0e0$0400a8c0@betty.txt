SUBJECT: unexpected results from query
DATE: 26 Nov 2003

Hi,

assume a field has the following text

"Adenylate kinase (mitochondrial GTP:AMP phosphotransferase) "

the following searches all return this document

AMP
&AMP
&AMP;

can someone explain this to me..i figured that only the first query would be successful

Thanks,
Marc
