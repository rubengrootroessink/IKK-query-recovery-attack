SUBJECT: want to know, java search engine which can crawl local and remote websites and cr indexes
DATE: 4 Nov 2002

Hi,

I am developing an search application which needs a
Java search engine with ability to crawl local and
remote websites and create indexes.

I tried using i2a.WebSearch but not sure about support
and stability...?

need your input ASAP?


If not can I use Lucene to implement required
features.

thanks and regards
Nandkumar
