SUBJECT: indexwriter and index searcher
DATE: 24 Oct 2005

If I have a directory open and I open an index writer and add a document
do I have to close the directory and re-open it before I can open a
searcher and have the new document be included in the search?

In general, is it good to keep the directory open or is it better to
open the document each time you need a searcher or writer or something.
