SUBJECT: lock file race conditions
DATE: 1 Nov 2005

I have 2 junit tests. The first opens on index writer and then simulates
have an IOException get throw when trying to add a document. The test
that runs after than is just a normal test of the search. After the
first test completes a lock file is left in /tmp. Now, if I run the test
suite normally I get a "couldnt delete the lock file" exception from the
second test. If I run it again and set a breakpoint at the beginning of
the second test, wait a second, and then let it continue it runs fine.
What is causing this?
