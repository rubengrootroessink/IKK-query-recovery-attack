SUBJECT: Looking for "Exact match but no other terms"... how to express it?
DATE: 30 Oct 2007

I want to match on the exact phrase "foo bar dot" on a
specific field on my set of documents.

I only want results where that field has exactly "foo bar dot"
and no more terms. I.e. A document with "foo bar dot alu"
should not match.

A phrase query with slop 0 seems resonable but how do I
express "but nothing more than these terms".

Thankful for your feedback on this!
Tobias
