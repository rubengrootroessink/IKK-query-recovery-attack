SUBJECT: 2/3 of terms matched + coverage filter
DATE: 31 Oct 2007

My documents all hava a field with variables number of terms
(but rather few):
Doc1.field = "foo bar gro"
Doc2.field = "foo bar gro mot slu"
Now I would like to search using the terms "foo bar gro"

Problem 1:
I like to express that at least any two of the three terms
must match. Do I have to construct this clause myself - i.e.
"(foo & bar) | (foo & gro) | (bar & gro)", or is there some
clever way to do this?

Problem 2:
I like to express that if the doc.field has too many terms
that wasn't matched it should not be included at all in the
result. In the example above Doc2 might have too many
terms that was not matched to be included in the result.
Is this kind of query possible, and how?

The general case:
I want to find those docs that has X% of the search terms
matched and that the acctual match covers at least Y% of
the available terms on the document.


I am very thankful for any feedback on this.
Tobias
