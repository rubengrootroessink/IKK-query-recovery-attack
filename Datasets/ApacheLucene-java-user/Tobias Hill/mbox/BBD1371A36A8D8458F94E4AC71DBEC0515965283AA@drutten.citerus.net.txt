SUBJECT: NO_NORM  and TOKENIZED
DATE: 5 Mar 2008

Hi,

I am quite new to the Lucene API. I find the Field-constructor
unintuitive. Maybe I have misunderstood it. Let's find out...

It can be used either as:
new Field("field", "data", Store.NO, TOKENIZED)

or:
new Field("field", "data", Store.NO, NO_NORM)


As I understand it NO_NORM and TOKENIZED are not settings for
a one-dimensional behaviour - on the contrary they are rather
orthogonal.

I.e. it is quite likely that I would want _both_ TOKENIZED and NO_NORM.
This is especially true for fields that are of approx. equal and short length
over the doc-space.

- Am I right in my reasoning (which means that the API is a bit unclear)?
Or
- Have I misunderstood something fundamental about TOKENIZED and NO_NORM?

Thankful for any feedback on this,
Tobias
