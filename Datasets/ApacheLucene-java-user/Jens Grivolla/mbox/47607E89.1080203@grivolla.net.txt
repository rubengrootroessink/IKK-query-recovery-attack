I actually investigated this to some degree in my thesis, comparing 
different participating systems from the TREC campaigns.  It turns out 
that some systems' scores (e.g. the top scores for a given query) 
correlate quite well with the quality of the result (relevance of the 
returned documents), whereas for others this is not at all the case.  I 
don't think there was a Lucene-based system in there, though.

So in some cases comparing scores across queries can be used (to a 
limited degree) as a confidence measure, an indicator of expected 
usefulness of the results for the user.
