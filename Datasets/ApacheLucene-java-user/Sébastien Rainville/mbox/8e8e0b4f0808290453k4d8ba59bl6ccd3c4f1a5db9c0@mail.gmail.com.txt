SUBJECT: Re: Clarity: Is there a Query boosting 50-50 over 1000-1 ?
DATE: 29 Aug 2008

I'm curious... what do you mean by "It's not perfect (there is no such
thing) but it works pretty well in most cases, and works great if you spend
a little time figuring out the right length normalization factors." ? Can
you plz elaborate a little more on what are the length normalization factors
exactly and what makes them good or bad... it's a part of lucene that is
really confusing me as I'm still a newbie :P

Thanks,
Sebastien
