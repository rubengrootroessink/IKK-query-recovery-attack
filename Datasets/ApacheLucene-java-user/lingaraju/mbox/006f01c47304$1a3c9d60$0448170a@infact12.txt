DATE: 26 Jul 2004

Dear Daniel

Thanks a lot.
I do have the last-modified column in my database.
But how to know how many records are modified.
If it is new record  through which class we have to check that record is
present in the index
In the mean time I will look into IndexHTML in lucene demo

Regards
Raju
