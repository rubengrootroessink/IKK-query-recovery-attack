SUBJECT: MoreLikeThis across multiple fields question...
DATE: 21 Oct 2007

hello--

i'm using MoreLikeThis. i'm trying to run the document comparison across more than one field
in my index, but i'm not at all sure that it's actually happening -- when i examine the constructed
query, only one field is mentioned! here's my code:

FileReader reader = new FileReader("/Users/onpause/aTest.txt");
IndexReader ir = IndexReader.open(index);
IndexSearcher is = new IndexSearcher(index);
MoreLikeThis mlt = new MoreLikeThis(ir);
String [] mltFields = new String[] {"conceptSearch","abstract","contents","conceptDisplay"};
mlt.setFieldNames(mltFields);
Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
mlt.setAnalyzer(analyzer);
Query mltQuery = mlt.like(reader);
Hits hits = is.search(mltQuery);

System.out.println("query: "+ mltQuery.toString() + "   ; fields: " + mlt.getFieldNames().toString()
 + " ::: params: "+mlt.describeParams());



here's what that last println prints out:


query: contents:rainbow contents:edinburgh contents:actress contents:festival contents:end
  ;

fields: [Ljava.lang.String;@199939 ::: 

params: maxQueryTerms  : 25
        minWordLen     : 0
        maxWordLen     : 0
        fieldNames     : "conceptSearch, abstract, contents, conceptDisplay
        boost          : false
        minTermFreq    : 1
        minDocFreq     : 1


why does the query only contain references to the field "contents"? i expected it to contain
references to all 4 fields i assigned, something like:

(contents:rainbow contents:edinburgh contents:actress contents:festival contents:end) (abstract:rainbow...
etc etc

when the field "contents" is in the list, it ends up being the only one visibly used in the
printed query -- the others seem suppressed, at least from the print...

i really want to make sure i'm MLT-ing across all 4 fields, because i indexed then with different
boosts, hoping this would influence the MLT result scoring...

also, and i'm sure this is because i'm such i naive java user, how can i convert this object
reference [Ljava.lang.String;@199939  to something more useful to read?


thanks in advance for any advice!


best--
