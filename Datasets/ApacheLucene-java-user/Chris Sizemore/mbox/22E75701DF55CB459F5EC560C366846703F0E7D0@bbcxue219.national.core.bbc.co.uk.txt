hmmm, that seems a shame, esp. if a term matches in a non-most-hits-occur-here field, and then
that field's boost doesn't get called in computing the score...

so, not a bug, then -- but i question the design of the class...

i'd much rather see:

conceptSearch:foo abstract:foo conceptSearch:blah abstract:blah

because matches to conceptSearch should be weighted much higher than the other field...

any further advice?



best--

Actually looking at MoreLikeThis.createQueue() it's supposed to use only 
that field where most hits occur for that term, so you could end up with a 
query like:

conceptSearch:foo abstract:blah
