SUBJECT: What's the differents between QueryParser and Query
DATE: 19 Jan 2006

Hi all!
I've a question about the lucene search method. What is the different between a search with
the class lucene.queryParser.QueryParser and the class lucene.search.Query and their subclasses?
For example: With the WildcardQuery I can search for * at the beginning of a term, but not
with the method QueryParser.parse(). But I get the same search string with Query.toString().
Why?

Some background about my project:
I have to decide if I build a Query with the Query class and their subclasses or if I build
it with the static method QueryParser.parse()
The sizes of my indexes are pretty different. They might reach a size of 100,000 docs and
more. Unfortunately the index changes frequently.
What is the best way to search in such an index, and why?

Pleased for every kind of help!

Matt
