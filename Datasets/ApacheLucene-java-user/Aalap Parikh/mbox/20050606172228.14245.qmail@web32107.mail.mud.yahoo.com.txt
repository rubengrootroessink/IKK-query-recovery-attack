SUBJECT: Re: searches and updates concurrency problem
DATE: 6 Jun 2005

Hi,

As per my understanding of Lucene, I think concurrent
search and update to an index should not corrupt the
index, given that only a single index-modifying
operation is executing at any point of time. So in
short, you can have multiple search operations and not
more than one index update (add and/or delete)
operation in progress at any time and that should not
corrupt the index.


Thanks,
Aalap.
