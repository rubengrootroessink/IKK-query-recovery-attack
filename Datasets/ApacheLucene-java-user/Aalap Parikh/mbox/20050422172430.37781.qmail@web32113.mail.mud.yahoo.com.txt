I am using the StandardAnalyzer (tried using
SimpleAnalyzer too, but not much affect on
performance).

I am using -Xms32M -Xmx200M . I have tried giving more
but doesn't help much.

Here is what my code looks like:

Document doc = null;
IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(indexDirPath, 
                         new StandardAnalyzer(),
true);

for (int i = 0; i < dataArrayToIndex.length; i++) {
    doc = new Document();
    doc.add(Field.UnIndexed("ID",  
        
String.valueOf(dataArrayToIndex[i].getId())));
    doc.add(Field.Keyword("claimCode", 
             dataArrayToIndex[i].getClaimCode()));
    doc.add(Field.Keyword("insuredName", 
             dataArrayToIndex[i].getInsuredName()));
    doc.add(Field.Keyword("claimantName", 
             dataArrayToIndex[i].getClaimantName()));
    ....
    //and so on with about 27 fields in total, most of
 
    //them indexed as Field.Keyword with text not more

    //than 10-20 character each.

    writer.addDocument(doc);
 } //end of for loop

 writer.optimize();
 writer.close();

Thanks,
Aalap.
