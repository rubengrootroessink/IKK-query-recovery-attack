Hi,

I have similar issues in indexing time.

I am doing a SELECT from database and getting back
10,000 rows. I then start indexing each row and hence
would have 10,000 documents in my Lucene index. Each
doc has 27 fields.

I added some timing code to my indexing process. The
DB select call takes around 23 seconds and the
indexing process takes 567 seconds. Also, I profiled
the app using JProfiler and found out that 90% of time
is spent in the IndexWriter.addDocument call. As
expected, there were 10,000 invocation of that method
(one for each doc) and the profiler showed that the
method took 90% of the processing time.

I am concerned that it is taking around 9.5 minutes
for 10,000 docs and I am expecting to have around
600,000 docs to index. So that would take 570 minutes
(9-10 hours) to index and which is HUGE!!!

My machine: Pentium 4 CPU 2.40 GHz
            RAM 1 GB

Any help appreciated.

Thanks,
Aalap.
