Hi Volodymyr,

About the trick you described about wildcard search
replacement, you mentioned:

terms.)

When you index "123214213" as sequence of individual
terms, what is the name of the the fields you use for
each of the individual terms?

Also, can you post your custom analyzer class?

Thanks,
Aalap.
