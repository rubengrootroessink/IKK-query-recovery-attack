SUBJECT: Re: WildCard search replacement
DATE: 22 Apr 2005

Hi,

The idea about begin marker sounds good. And the
prefix could be anything and could be made really
small by just using may be 2 or 3 or even less
characters.

In terms of the PrefixQuery for 123* wildcard search,
wouldn't such a query be rewritten to a BooleanQuery?
I tried using PrefixQuery and it did give me the
TooManyClauseException.

Thanks,
Aalap.
