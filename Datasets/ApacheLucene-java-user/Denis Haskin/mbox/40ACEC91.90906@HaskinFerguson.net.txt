I really don't know much about this, but I would disagree with Will's 
assumption that because non-ascii show up as entities when you do "Save 
as HTML" that implies that they are stored *internally* within 
Word/Excel/Ppt files a entities.  That just seems unlikely to me.

Maybe somebody over at the Poi project [1] knows something about this?

My 2 cents...
