SUBJECT: Fields with the same name
DATE: 15 Oct 2008

I didn't quite understand the Document documentation so well, the
documentation says:

"Adds a field to a document. Several fields may be added with the same
name. In this case, if the fields are indexed, their text is treated
as though appended for the purposes of search."

Would

    doc.add(new Field("foo",
                              "bar1" + "bar2",
                              Field.Store.YES,
                              Field.Index.ANALYZED));

be different in any way than

    doc.add(new Field("foo",
                              "bar1",
                              Field.Store.YES,
                              Field.Index.ANALYZED));
    doc.add(new Field("foo",
                              "bar2",
                              Field.Store.YES,
                              Field.Index.ANALYZED));
?
