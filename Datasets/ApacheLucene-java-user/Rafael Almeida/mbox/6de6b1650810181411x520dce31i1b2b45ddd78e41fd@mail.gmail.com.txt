On queryparser's documentation says:
"Note that QueryParser is not thread-safe."
it only means that the same instance of QueryParser can't be used by
multiple threads, right? But if each thread has its own QueryParser
instance, then it's OK, right?

BTW, the link http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html
on http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/queryParser/QueryParser.html
seems to be broken.
