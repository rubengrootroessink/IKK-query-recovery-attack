SUBJECT: Overriding Lucene's term weights computation
DATE: 23 Jun 2010

Hi,

Is there a way for an application to index a document along with its "term
weighted vector" (Lucene's TermFreqVector). I.e., override the term
frequencies computed by Lucene, with an application's computed term weights
(non frequency based) ?
I don't think I want to use Scorer#score() for applying score changes as
this one is activated at search time which won't work for me.

Thanks for any insight,
Naama
