SUBJECT: Scores equality
DATE: 13 Jun 2010

Hi All,

I wanted to ask regarding search results scores equality:
In case two documents get an equal score - how does Lucene "break" equality
?
I.e. by which criteria one document would be ranked before another ? Random
? Indexing time ? Anything else ?
Can I control this one somehow ?
(I am using Lucene 3).

Thanks for the input,
Naama
