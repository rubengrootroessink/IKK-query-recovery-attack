SUBJECT: Re: Problems with IndexWriter#commit() on Linux
DATE: 8 Feb 2010

Hi All,

I am back to this one after some while.
It appears the file system I was using resides on software RAID disks. I ran
the same code on the same Linux machine, but on another file system residing
on SCSI disks. I didn't observe the problem there.
Both file systems are ext3.
So I am guessing the problem relates to the RAID disks.

I looked again at commit() API, and the following comment may be explaining:

"Note that this operation calls Directory.sync on the index files. That call
should not return until the file contents & metadata are on stable storage.
For FSDirectory, this calls the OS's fsync. But, beware: some hardware
devices may in fact cache writes even during fsync, and return before the
bits are actually on stable storage, to give the appearance of faster
performance. If you have such a device, and it does not have a battery
backup (for example) then on power loss it may still lose data. Lucene
cannot guarantee consistency on such devices."

Well, for me, running on the SCSI disks is just fine, I wanted to anyway
share my experience.
