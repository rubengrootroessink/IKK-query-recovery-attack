David, Bruce, Otis,
Thank you all for the quick replies. I looked through the BooksLikeThis
example. I also agree, it's a very good and effective way to find
similar docs in the index. Nevertheless, what I need is really a
similarity matrix holding all TF*IDF values. For illustration I quick
and dirty wrote a class to perform that task. It uses the Jama.Matrix
class to represent the similarity matrix at the moment. For show and
tell I attached it to this email.
Unfortunately it doesn't perform very well. My index stores about 25000
docs with a total of 75000 terms. The similarity matrix is very sparse
but nevertheless needs about 1'875'000'000 entries!!! I think this
current implementation will not be useable in this way. I also think I
switch to JMP (http://www.math.uib.no/~bjornoh/mtj/) for that reason.

What do you think?

Best,
Christoph
