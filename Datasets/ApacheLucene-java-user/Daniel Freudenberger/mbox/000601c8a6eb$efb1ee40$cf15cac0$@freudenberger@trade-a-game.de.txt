SUBJECT: boosting relevance of certain documents

Hello,

 

I'm using lucene within a new project and I'm not sure about how to solve
the following problem: My index consists of the two attributes "id" and
"searchable". "id" is the id of a product and "searchable" is a combination
of the product name and its category name.

 

 example:

 id     searchable 

 1     fifa 08 - playstation 3 

 2     fifa 2003 fifa 03 - playstation 3 

 3     playstation 60gb hdd - playstation 3 

 4     playstation i like you - playstation 3 

 

When searching for "fifa", lucene returns the product with id 2 at first,
whereas id 1 ("fifa 08") would be the much more relevant result (from the
user side of view). the same problem arises when searching for "playstation"
- the customer expects products having "playstation" in their names at
first, ideally the console itself. in reality however, he gets all possible
products which are in the "playstation" category as well.

 

my idea was to introduce another attribute relevance, which may increase the
relevance of an entry. the actual relevance shouldn't be suppressed
completely though, but should only be taken into account with products that
are similarly relevant for a specific search term.

 

Does anybody have an idea on how to solve this problem?

 

Thank you in advance,

Daniel
