Thanks for your response. I already knew that the relevance is based on the
term frequency but in some cases it's just not what the user expects. 
As I already mentioned, "fifa 2003 fifa 03" vs. "fifa 08" is such a case -
searching for "fifa" would return the "fifa 2003 fifa 03" document first but
the "fifa 08" document is more important (from the user's point of view).

Any suggestions?

Best regards,
Daniel

Ok. So I'm not an expert of the scoring algorithm, but based on tf*idf you
can tell that the returned document is more relevant because it has more
term frequency.

Using the explain you can see the following:

Doc 1
0.643841 = (MATCH) fieldWeight(searchable:fifa in 0), product of:
  1.0 = tf(termFreq(searchable:fifa)=1)
  1.287682 = idf(docFreq=2)
  0.5 = fieldNorm(field=searchable, doc=0)

Doc2
0.68289655 = (MATCH) fieldWeight(searchable:fifa in 1), product of:
  1.4142135 = tf(termFreq(searchable:fifa)=2)
  1.287682 = idf(docFreq=2)
  0.375 = fieldNorm(field=searchable, doc=1)
