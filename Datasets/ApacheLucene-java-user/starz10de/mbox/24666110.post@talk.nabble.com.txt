SUBJECT: Index html sites using IndexHtml
DATE: 26 Jul 2009


Hi,

I am indexing a set of html websites using lucene (IndexHtml). The indexer
work fine and I can also find the indexed term but the problem this class
(IndexHtml) index all text inside the html site even the advertisements. I
am interested just in the body text and not interested in the advertisements
or side links text.

Any help how to solve this problem? Did I use the class wrongly?
