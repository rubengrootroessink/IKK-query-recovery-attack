SUBJECT: RE: High frequency term for the searched query
DATE: 5 Nov 2010


Hi,

I did as it is explained in the website:

 final Set<Term> terms = new HashSet<Term>();  
       
        query = searcher.rewrite(query); 
         query.extractTerms(terms); 
         
        for(Term t : terms){ 
            int frequency = searcher.docFreq(t); 
        } 



however I can't understand why this error appeared:

"the method extractterms(Set<Term>) is undefined for the type Query"




any idea
