SUBJECT: Re: High frequency term for the searched query
DATE: 5 Nov 2010


HI Mike,

I implemented MoreLikeThis but I couldn't figure out where or how to print
the related term to the given query. All what I got is the relevant
documents to the query with their scores.

Any idea how to get the related terms?
