SUBJECT: RE: High frequency term for the searched query
DATE: 5 Nov 2010


Hi,

I need to expand the query with the most terms occurred with it in
documents. For example:  the word credits, tax, withdraw have high appearing
with Bank. So my query is “Bank” and the result should be ranked list of the
most frequent terms with "Bank"

I could do that as I explained but not in efficient way.
