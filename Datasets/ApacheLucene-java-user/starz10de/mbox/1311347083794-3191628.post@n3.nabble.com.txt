SUBJECT: Re: Index one huge text file
DATE: 22 Jul 2011

I am interested to search in sentence level. 
It is a parallel corpora , each sentence in the first language is
equivalence to sentence in the second language. I want to index each
sentence and have some id for each sentence in order when I retrieve it I go
easily and retrieve its equivalence in the second language.

This I did by splitting the file and consider each sentence as text file.
However, this really takes long time to do for many huge text files.
