SUBJECT: Store the documents content in the index
DATE: 17 Jul 2011

HI, 

Currently my text source files (800 000) are stored in folder which make
retrieving it by many users some how slow. I heard it might be possible that
these files content can be stored in the index it self although I found this
unrealistic. 

Is it possible storing the source text files content in the index instead of
just “doc id” which is assigned with each term in the index?
