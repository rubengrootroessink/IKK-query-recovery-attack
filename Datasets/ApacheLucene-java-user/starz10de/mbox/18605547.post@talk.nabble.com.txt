SUBJECT: Re: storing the contents of a document in the  lucene index
DATE: 23 Jul 2008


Hi Erik,

 I don't remove the stop words, as I index parallel corpora which is used
for learning the translations between pair of languages. so every word is
important. I even develop my own analyzer for Arabic which is just remove
punctuations and special symbols and it return only Arabic text.

I guess in the   FileDocument.java   the whole text is already stored

doc.add(Field.Text("contents", IN)); 

where IN is 

IN = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(f))

if this is not the case yould you please how to store the whole text inside
the index ? 

I am new to lucene and I don't know how to use this "Field.Store.YES" to
store whole text.

 

Best regards
Farag
