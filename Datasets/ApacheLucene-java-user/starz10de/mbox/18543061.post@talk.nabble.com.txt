SUBJECT: Return the sentence number in the indexed files
DATE: 19 Jul 2008


Hi All,

I have a text files that contain several sentences, there is space between
each sentence.
When searching the index  , i get the path for the documents that match the
query

 String path = doc.get("path");


 Is it possible to get the number of the sentence that match the query
inside the matched documents?

Thanks in advance
