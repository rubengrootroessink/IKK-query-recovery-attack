SUBJECT: Print the text files before indexing them in lucene
DATE: 15 Jul 2008


Hi All,
 It might be easy question, but for new one as me in lucene it is not that
easy.  I want to print the text files before indexing them in lucene , I did
try to do it , but i could just print the index content where we see the
kewowrds and document nr and frequency.  I need beside that to print the
text files content plus their pathes.

thanks in advance
