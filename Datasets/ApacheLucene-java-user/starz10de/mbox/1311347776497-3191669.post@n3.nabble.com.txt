SUBJECT: Re: Index one huge text file
DATE: 22 Jul 2011

I have no problem with indexing performance. I indexed the 60 000 (sentences)
text files with only few minutes. 

I have performance problem split the huge file that contains 60 000
sentences into 60 000 text files even I can have an index in sentence level. 
I asked if I could read the one huge file and index sentence by sentence. Is
it possible to do so?
