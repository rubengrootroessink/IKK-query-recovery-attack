SUBJECT: Re: high frequent terms in the search result set
DATE: 9 Nov 2010


Thanks for the answer. My request is might easier. 

I will describe it in basic way:

1- I submit a query
2- I retrieve the matched documents
3- From this matched document I need to ´have a list of terms based on their
high co-occurrence.

Currently I could do this for the whole index but I still can’t for the
matched documents. What I do is to index the matched documents but this is
very slow and not applicable.
