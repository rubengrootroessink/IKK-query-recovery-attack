SUBJECT: Index one huge text file
DATE: 22 Jul 2011

Hi,

I have one text file that contains 60 000 sentences. Is there a possibility
to index this file sentence by sentence where each sentence is treated as
one document? What I do now is splitting the huge text files into 60 000
sentences then index them. This work is not easy because I have few huge
documents and it take long time to split each file.

Thanks  in advance
