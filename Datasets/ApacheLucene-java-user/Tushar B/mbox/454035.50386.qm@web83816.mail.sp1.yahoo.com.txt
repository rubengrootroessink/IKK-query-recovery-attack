Hi Doron,

Just filed an issue in JIRA.

Here are the requested stats:
Index size-> around 11 million documents 
Query      -> fieldname:[009 TO 999] (using CSRQ)
Result      -> 11475 documents
Delete      -> All the returned documents (11475)

I can get the time statistics for you if that helps.

And, btw, I can still see the terms from the deleted documents when I do the top terms etc...
when will they be gone?

thanks
