SUBJECT: How to get the "context" of the searched word ?
DATE: 17 Jan 2005

Hello all

When i search a word on documents, i want to get also the "context" of the word, for examples
the 10 words before and after.
Like in search engine like google or yahoo.

So i have tried to use the Highlight modules, but Highlight need to get a String of the contents.

I use this function :

highlighter.highlightText(myString);

myString must to be the contents of the whole document !

But of course i don't want to store all the contents in the index files !

How can i do ?

I'm  sure i'm not the first lucene's user who want to get the "context" of the searched word.
I need to use Highlight or do you know a better way ?


Thanks in advance.
