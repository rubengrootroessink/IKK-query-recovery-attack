SUBJECT: Which field cause a hit in multifield query
DATE: 17 Oct 2006

Hi,
If I do a search such as "field1:jim OR field2:bob" is there any way to
determine for each document that was a hit, which field caused the hit?

Or rather, since they both might, is there any easy way to find out
which fields definitely cause a hit?

Regards,
  --Mukesh
