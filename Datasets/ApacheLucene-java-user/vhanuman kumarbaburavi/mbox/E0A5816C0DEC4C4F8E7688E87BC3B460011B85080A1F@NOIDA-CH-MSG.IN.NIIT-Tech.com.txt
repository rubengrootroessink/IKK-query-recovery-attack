Hi Paul,

I need some help on Lucene prefix search. I have implemented prefix search in my application
but it is return different result like following way.

E.g. three products see below

Abc def zse,
def sde sed,
fed fer def.

I entered the characters like "def" and I performed prefix search, I got following results.

Abc def zse
def sde sed
fed fer def.

But I want only one result instead of above result i.e. "def sde sed"

Please help me.


Thanks & Regards
