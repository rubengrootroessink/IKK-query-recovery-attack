SUBJECT: Prefix And Fuzzy
DATE: 19 Mar 2010

Dear Paul,



Still I am fighting with Prefix and Fuzzy search. Based on archive post I have noticed once
thing i.e. when the prefix search will work only for "Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED" type. I have
changed that one prefix working perfectly. But the fuzzy search is working stopped, I hope
because of the Index type when I changed to "Field.Index.ANALYZED" it starts working. I am
using "lucene 3.0"version.



I have implemented these two searches in my application following way.



IndexSearcher is = new IndexSearcher(FSDirectory.open(new File("index11")));

is.setSimilarity(Similarity.getDefault());

Analyzer analyzer = new StopAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_30);

QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(Version.LUCENE_30, "name",analyzer);

parser.setLowercaseExpandedTerms(true);

parser.setEnablePositionIncrements(true);

parser.setAllowLeadingWildcard(true);

parser.setFuzzyPrefixLength(4);

parser.setFuzzyMinSim(0.8f);



BooleanQuery booleanQuery = new BooleanQuery(true);

parser.setAllowLeadingWildcard(true);

booleanQuery.add(parser.parse("Tick*"), BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);

booleanQuery.add(parser.parse("Tick~"), BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);



ScoreDoc[] hits = is.search(booleanQuery, 1000).scoreDocs;

for (int i = 0; i < hits.length; i++) {

      Document hitDoc = is.doc(hits[i].doc);

      System.out.println(hitDoc.get("name") + "\t" + i);

}



Please suggest me ASAP.



Thanks & Regards



Veera.
