You're right if the source query consist of a non atomic query. If it's a
combined one it does allready function quite well. Because of the last
check in Query(String) of QueryParser it returns firstQuery then and
getBooleanQuery is never called. As I'm not able to overwrite
Query(String) I'm not quite sure how to handle searches like: foo.
