I thought it would be allready available somehow since it's supported in
other major textsearch engines for example NSE from IBM, why not in
lucene?

DEBUG Query: MyCoReDemoDC_derivate_0014-->Hühnerstall
DEBUG Set DerivateID to MyCoReDemoDC_derivate_0014 for next query...
DEBUG parsing query using: org.apache.lucene.analysis.de.GermanAnalyzer
DEBUG adding clause: content:huhnerstall
DEBUG preparsed query:(+DerivateID:MyCoReDemoDC_derivate_0014
+content:huhnerstall)

It's the GermanAnalyzer. It doesn't matter what I choose in luke it will
allways find documents for "Hühnerstall", but I'm not able to find it the
self programmed way. My extended QueryParser overwrites parse. It put out
the Analyzer and then parses the String with super.parse(String). The
resulting Query is put in a BooleanClause and later combined withe the
first part (fieldquery using WhiteSpaceAnalyzer) you see above to a new
Query.
So there is one query part with the WhiteSpaceAnalyzer and the other with
GermanAnalyzer. But I dont' know why Hühnerstall get's to huhnerstall.
