This is just the solution for the example in real world I really don't
have noc documents containing "foo" or "bar". What I meant was: Make
Lucene think, that all Documents with the same DocID are ONE Document.
Imagine you have a big book, say 1000 pages. Instead of putting the whole
book in the index, you split it up in single pages and index them. Now
it's faster if a page changes or is deleted to update your index instead
of doing it over and over again for all 1000 pages. So you problem starts
when you're searching on the book. You search for (foo bar), foo is on
site 345 while bar ist on 435. You want to get a hit for the book. So I
need a solution matching this more generic example.
