SUBJECT: umlaut normalisation
DATE: 27 Jan 2004

Hi,

is that possible with lucene to use umlaut normalisation?
For example Query: Hühnerstall --> Query: Huehnerstall.

This ofcause includes that the document was indexed with normalized umlauts.
This issue is very important, because not every one starting a search
against german documents may have a german keyboard.

This brings me to the next problem. Currently only Luke delivers result
for "Hühnerstall", my selfed implemented solution allways makes
"huhnerstall" out of it in the query (Why?). But ther is no "huhnerstall"
indexed.

regards Thomas
