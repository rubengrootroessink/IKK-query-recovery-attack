SUBJECT: Lucene AND queries
DATE: 25 Sep 2008

Hi,
I was wondering when lucene queries two or more terms, does that mean the
time it takes will be twice as long? For example if I search +lucene
+apache, then does lucene get all the documents that match 'lucene' and all
the documents that match 'apache', and then combine them together? Or can it
limit the amount of things it needs to retrieve from the index for 'apache'
based on what it has already retrieved for 'lucene'?

Is there documentation on how queries work in lucene in regards to how it
deals with the actual index files?

David
