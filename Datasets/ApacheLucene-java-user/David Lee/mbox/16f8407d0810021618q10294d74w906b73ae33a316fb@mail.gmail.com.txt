SUBJECT: Extracting Dates
DATE: 2 Oct 2008

What should I use if I want to try to extract events (dates/times) out of an
HTML page? I looked at Tika since it's a parsing project. Am I on the right
track or is there something better to use? It also seems like Apache UIMA is
kind of doing that, but I'm not sure. I thought since a lot of these
projects are associated to lucene, someone might know.
