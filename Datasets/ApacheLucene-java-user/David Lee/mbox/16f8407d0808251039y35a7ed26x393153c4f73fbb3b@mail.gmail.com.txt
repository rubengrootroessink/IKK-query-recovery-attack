ok, thanks. I knew that the documents were buffered in memory until they
were flushed, but I thought that in memory, they were still separate
documents/segments until they were merged together at the appropriate time
(dependent on the mergeFactor).

Do you mean that when the IndexWriter flushes the documents in memory to the
disk, it will merge all the documents in that flush to one segment?

Thanks!
David
