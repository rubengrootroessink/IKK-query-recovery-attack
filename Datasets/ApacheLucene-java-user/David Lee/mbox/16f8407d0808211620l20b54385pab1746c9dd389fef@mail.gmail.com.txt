Clarification question:

If I don't store term vectors, then I:
-- won't have information on the position of matching terms
-- I don't have the term frequency vector

-- but I should still have the frequency of terms per document in the .frq
file, right?

So what's the difference between the term frequency vector and the
information saved in the .frq file?

Thanks!
