SUBJECT: about the ezlm program-Nathalie Harbonne
DATE: 10 Jan 2005

Hi, 

I'm very sorry, but i just wanted to receive an answer
to my question: where is the runable file to make the
software lucene work.
You told me that it is the ezlm program but i don't
see it anywhere.
If you could tell me where it is, it would be very
kind from you.

I don't really want to suscribe to the user list
because i will not be a frequent user of this
software; i; just wanted to see if there is a
thesaurus integrated inside and how it works( tables
and indexes etc...)

Thanks a lot for your help.

Cordially.

Nathalie Harbonne
