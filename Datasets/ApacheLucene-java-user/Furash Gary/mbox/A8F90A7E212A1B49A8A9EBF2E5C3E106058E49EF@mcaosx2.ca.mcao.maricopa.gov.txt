Thanks.  Sort of what I was thinking of was the fact that document X,
field N, was built via tokenizer/analyzer N.  If I need to search an
index of document Xs, then I should be using tokenizer/analyzer N
without having to "know" that it was built that way.

There has been a long-running thread on the java-dev list about how to
allow application-specific "extra stuff" to be placed in the index, at
multiple levels of granularity.  Some of this conversation is captured
on the Wiki at:

http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/FlexibleIndexing

Maybe you could modify the above page to include your requirements?
