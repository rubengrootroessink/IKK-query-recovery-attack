Thanks.  It sounds like putting tokens in the same spot for names makes
sense, so I end up with:
	Gary 			Furash
	[Soundex Gary] 	[Soundex Furash]
is the way to go.  I had seen a quote that mention positioning at the
same spot but it didn't make any sense at that point.

It sounds like the slop value is the way to go on first pass.
