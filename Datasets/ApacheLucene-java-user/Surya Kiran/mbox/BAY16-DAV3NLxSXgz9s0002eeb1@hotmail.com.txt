SUBJECT: Segments file get deleted?!
DATE: 26 Apr 2004

Hi all, we have implemented our portal search using Lucene. It  works fine. But after a certain
period of time "Lucene segments" file get deleted. Eventually all searches fails. Anyone can
guess where the error could be.

Thanks a lot.

Regards
Surya.
