SUBJECT: Problems understanding QueryParser + WildcardQueries
DATE: 16 Jun 2008

Hi,

I have a small problem regarding QueryParser and WildcardQueries.

Basically, I'm indexing documents like this:
doc.add(new Field("title", "_FooBar", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));

Afterwards I expected that this query would return the document above:
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("title", getAnalyzer());
Query q = parser.parse("_Foo*");

But instead no hit is returned (yes, I'm using StandardAnalyzer for indexing+searching).
If I search for "_FooBar", it works.

Obviously, I did not understand thorougly what Lucene does with my query.

Can anyone shed some light on this?

Thank you very much
fs

PS: Maybe it's just a stupid coding error. The complete test case is available, too:
