Hi,
I've just release an indexing framework based on Lucene witch is named LIUS.
LIUS is written in Java and it adds to Lucene many files format indexing 
functionalities as: Ms Word, Ms Excel, Ms PowerPoint, RTF, PDF, XML, HTML, 
TXT, Open Office suite and JavaBeans. All the indexation process is based 
on a configuration file.
You can visit this links for more informations about LIUS, documentation is 
available in English and French:
