Hi,

I'm trying to put together an Analyzer that doesn't separate tokens on
the underscore character. What's the best / easiest way to achieve this?

I've tried removing the references to char code 95 in
StandardTokenizerTokenManager, but it doesn't seem to cut the mustard.
Should I be looking at modifying StandardTokenizer.jj and having javacc
generate my own tokenizer classes?

thanks,
jim
