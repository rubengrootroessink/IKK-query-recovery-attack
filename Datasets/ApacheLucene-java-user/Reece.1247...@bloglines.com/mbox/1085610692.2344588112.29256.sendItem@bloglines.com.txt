SUBJECT: Number query not working
DATE: 26 May 2004

Hi,

I have a bunch of digits in a field.  When I do this search it returns
nothing:

  myField:0000001085609805100

It returns the correct document
when I add a * to the end like this:

  myField:0000001085609805100* <--
added the *

I'm not sure what is happening here.  I'm thinking that Lucene
is doing some number conversion internally when it sees only digits.  When
I add the * maybe it presumes it is still a string.  

How do I get a string
of digits to work without adding a *?

Thanks,
Reece
