SUBJECT: Unicode support
DATE: 30 Apr 2002

Hello. What are the necessary steps that I need to take in order to support 
UNICODE? I recompiled with JAVA_UNICODE_ESCAPE turned on. I am using demo 
classes, IndexFiles and SearchFiles, to test UNICODE but still unable to 
search words encoded in UTF-8. Any suggestions?
Thank you.
