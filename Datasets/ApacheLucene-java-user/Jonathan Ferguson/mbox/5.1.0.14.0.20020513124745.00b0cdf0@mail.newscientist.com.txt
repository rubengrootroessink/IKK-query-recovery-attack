SUBJECT: Sorting results by Field
DATE: 13 May 2002

Hello,

Regarding the post [1] Peter Carlson made to the Lucene users mailing list 
on the 30 April about sorting by fields, primarily date.

I was wondering if a Lucene release with this feature was due for release 
soon and / or if anyone had implemented this or something similar ?
