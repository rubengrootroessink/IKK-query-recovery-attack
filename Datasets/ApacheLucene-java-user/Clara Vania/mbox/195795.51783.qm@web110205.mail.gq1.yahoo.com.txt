SUBJECT: Range Score in Lucene
DATE: 27 Apr 2010

Hi all,

I am new to Lucene and I want to ask about range score that Lucene used, because I got score
greater than 1.
I'm using lucene-3.0.1 and using 
MoreLikeThis to do document similarity and ScoreDoc class to get hits of my search.

 Thanks,


-Clara Vania-
