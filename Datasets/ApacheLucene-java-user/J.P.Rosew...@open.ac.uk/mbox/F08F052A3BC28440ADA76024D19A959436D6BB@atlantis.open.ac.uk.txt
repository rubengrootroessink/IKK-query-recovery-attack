Ie the system property solves the read-only media problem, but not if you
are writing an applet based solution. The "CD-ROM and search applet" seems a
natural pairing, so I was hoping there could be an alternative way of doing
this.

Yes, that issue has been addressed and taken care of.
This is from CHANGES.txt:

 3. Added the ability to disable lock creation by using disableLuceneLocks
    system property.  This is useful for read-only media, such as CD-ROMs.

I remember somebody following up on this change and warning of a downfall of
this solution, and I remember thinking that the comment was valid or
semi-valid, but I can't remember who made the comment, nor what exactly the
comment was. Maybe this solution needs to be fixed, but for now this should
work.
