SUBJECT: Applet search
DATE: 6 Aug 2002

I've been investigating using Lucene to search html pages on CD-ROM, using
an applet as the search interface. It isn't as easy as I'd hoped...

One problem is that lock files are written while searching to prevent
concurrent updates of the index -- clearly that doesn't work too well on
read-only media! But I notice there are current changes which will make the
use of lock files configurable.

Another problem is security restrictions on applets. Unfortunately one of
these is not being able to read system properties and the new mechanism for
turning off lock files uses a system property, so that ain't going to work
well in my case...

So I've been looking at plans B, C, D, ... These would mean writing some new
classes to specialise the existing Lucene classes to my particular case (eg
a version of IndexReader that doesn't use a lock). But I'm not making much
progress here since I can't extend classes because they are final or because
they have package access.

Writing an application to do the same job was straightforward and gives a
good product, so I feel I should persevere. But I do feel that everything I
try goes across the grain of existing code.

Anyone got any thoughts? I would have thought that the scenario (html on
CD-ROM + applet search) was a natural one for Lucene.  I've searched the
archives and found several people trying to do it, but not much in the way
of solutions.
