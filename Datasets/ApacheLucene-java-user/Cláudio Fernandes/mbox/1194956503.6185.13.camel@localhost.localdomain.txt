SUBJECT: Lucene  search question
DATE: 13 Nov 2007

Hello all, 

I don't know if this is a somehow naive question, but here we go:

Does Lucene support index by sections? Like having a text document with
three sections divided by XML tags indexed in a way we could do a search
by work and section. Does Lucene itself support this kind of indexing or
should it be used with other engines like Cocoon?

Thanks in advance for your time,
