SUBJECT: Improving GeoSort from Lucene in Action Book
DATE: 15 Jul 2008

Hi,

I read the chapter about custom sort methods and hacked around with  
the GeoSort. Are there ways to improve the algorithm? Espacially  
calculating the distance for ALL documents in the index is a bad idea  
because only the distance for hitted documents are of interest. That  
could save lots of time because the number of hits compared to all  
documents in an index usually is pretty small.


Thanks,
Sascha
