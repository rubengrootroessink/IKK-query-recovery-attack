There is a big difference between GeoSearch and GeoSort. GeoSearch  
means you are looking for data within a certain range. To implement  
this index structures like R-Trees help, because they make it a lot  
easier to think in "boxes". GeoSort is just to sort the data in  
relation to a given point in a 2D environment. So you always have to  
compute the distance from the given point to the locations of the  
documents. I think this is the only possibly approach?
