SUBJECT: Requesting MultipleIndeces
DATE: 23 Jun 2008

Hi,
I have around 10 different indexfiles to request. Is it better to do  
this via one request to one MultiReader or is better to request the 10  
indeces one after another?
Especially for doing some filtering on the result with a HitCollector  
it might by easier to use the multi request approch I think.
