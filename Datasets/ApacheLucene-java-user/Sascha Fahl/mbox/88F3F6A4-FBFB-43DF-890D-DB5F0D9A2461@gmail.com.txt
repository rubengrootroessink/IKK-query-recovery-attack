SUBJECT: Problems with reopening IndexReader while pushing documents to the index
DATE: 30 Jun 2008

Hi,

I see some strange behavoiur of lucene. The following scenario.
While adding documents to my index (every doc is pretty small, doc- 
count is about 12000) I have implemented a custom behaviour of  
flushing and committing documents to the index. Before adding  
documents to the index I check if wether der ramDocCount has reached a  
certain number of if the last commit is a while ago. If so i flush the  
buffered documents and reopen the IndexWriter. So far, so good.  
Indexing works very well. The problem is that if I send requests with  
die IndexReader while writing documents with the IndexWriter (I send  
around 10.000 requests to lucene) I reopen the IndexReader every 100  
requests (only for testing) if the IndexReader is not current. The  
first around 4000 requests work very well, but afterwards I always get  
the following exception:

java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 37389
	at org.apache.lucene.search.TermScorer.score(TermScorer.java:126)
	at org.apache.lucene.util.ScorerDocQueue.topScore(ScorerDocQueue.java:

	at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:46)
	at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:38)

This seems to be a temporarily problem because opening a new  
IndexReader after all documents were added everything is ok again and  
the 10.000 requests are all right.

So what could be the problem here?

sascha
