SUBJECT: Limit number of search results
DATE: 25 Jul 2006


Hello,

I am looking for a way to limit the number of search results I retrieve when
searching.

I am only interested in (let's say) the first ten hits of a query.. maybe I
want to look at hits ten..twenty to, but usually only the first results are
important. 

Right now lucene searches through the entire index, returning way more than
the desired ten documents. 

Any way to limit this?

Thanks for answers,
Johannes
