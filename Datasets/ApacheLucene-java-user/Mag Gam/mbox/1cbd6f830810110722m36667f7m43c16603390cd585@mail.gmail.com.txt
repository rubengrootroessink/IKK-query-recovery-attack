SUBJECT: Is lucene right for us
DATE: 11 Oct 2008

Hello All,

At my university we have over 20,000 small file ranging from 20k to
500k per directory and we would like to index them. I was wondering if
Lucene is the right tool for this? The information we would like to
keep is: filename, filesize, filedate, filecontent. Also, is it
possible to run the initial index in multithreaded mode since we are
talking about many directories with similar contents?

TIA
