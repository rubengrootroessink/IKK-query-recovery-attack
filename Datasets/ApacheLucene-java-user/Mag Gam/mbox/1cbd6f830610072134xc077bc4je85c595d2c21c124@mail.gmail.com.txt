Hi folks,

After some latenight google searching, I came across this interesting
website, http://static.compassframework.org/docs/latest/jdbcdirectory.html
Is this framework free?  Is anyone using this? If so, how is it for newbies
to Lucene/Derby/Java? I always wanted to have a lucene index in a RDBMS ...

TIA
