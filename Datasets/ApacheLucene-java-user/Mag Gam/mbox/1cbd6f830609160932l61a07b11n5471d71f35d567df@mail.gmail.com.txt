While looking at the example's Index and Search code, I have noticed in the
search, there is a :

out.println (doc.get ("path"));

I am not sure how is "path" is getting into the index. If you take a look at
the Index code, there is no mention of "path". My question are: what is this
path (I know it prints out the filesystem path)? Is this a reserved word, if
so, where can I get a list of reserved words? How can I list all hashes like
"path" ?

TIA
