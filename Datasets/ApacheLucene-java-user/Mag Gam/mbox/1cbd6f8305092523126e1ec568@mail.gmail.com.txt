SUBJECT: Can Lucene do this?
DATE: 26 Sep 2005

I have a document called "foo.txt" and it has a LOT of information on,
various computer tips, programming code, phone numbers, addresses,
etc..etc...

The document is set up something like this

----------------foo.txt-----------------
Phone number for Pizza: 1800-999-9999

To cook rice:
Put rice on the cooker, and just cook it

To see what processes are running:
ps -ef

and it keeps on going on.......

------------foo.txt---------------------


Can I use lucene to index this document only, and display blocks of
information if I need it? Like if I type in this query, "cook rice" I should
get the "To Cook rice:" statement and block...


TIA!
