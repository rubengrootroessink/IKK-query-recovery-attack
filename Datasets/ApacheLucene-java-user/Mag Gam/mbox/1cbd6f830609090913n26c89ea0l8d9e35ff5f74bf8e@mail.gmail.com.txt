SUBJECT: getCurrentVersion question
DATE: 9 Sep 2006

Hi All,

I am trying to get the exact date when my index was created. I am assuming
getCurrentVersion() is the right way of doing it. However, I am getting a
result something like this: 1157817833085

According to the API reference,
"Reads version number from segments files. The version number is initialized
with a timestamp and then increased by one for each change of the index."

So, to get the date of this, I should be doing something like this:
date=1157817833085-1;

Any thoughts?
tia
