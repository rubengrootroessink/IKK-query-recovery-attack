SUBJECT: Using example Lucene 2.0 index class
DATE: 22 Sep 2006

Hi All,

I have been using the Lucene 2.0 distro Index to index my files, currently
it indexes filepath and contents. I want to index, lastModified() (Returns
the time that the file denoted by this abstract pathname was last
modified.), and file length, length().

Can someone please show me how to do that? I am not too strong with Java,
some example code would be nice!

TIA
