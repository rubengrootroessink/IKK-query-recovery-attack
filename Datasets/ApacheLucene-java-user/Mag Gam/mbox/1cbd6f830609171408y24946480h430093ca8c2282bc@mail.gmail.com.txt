Sorry for the confusion all.

The code i am talking about is, the lucene-2.0 API

Document doc = hits.doc(i);
String path = doc.get("path");

lucene-2.0.0/src/demo/org/apache/lucene/demo/SearchFiles.java (line 147)


I am not sure where they are getting the "path". How are they inserting it
into the index?

Basically, I am trying to index the contents of the files, and the
filesystem written date. Therefore, I started to create an index, but I am
having no luck in either. I have simply been using the example indexing :-(


TIA
