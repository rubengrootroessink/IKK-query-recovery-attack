Hi All,

I am trying to get some stats on my Index such as:

1) When it was created
2) Size in MB of the index
3) If I can get the size, date of each file in the index. For example: I
index 100 files, is it possible for me to get their name, size, and date
when the last modification of that file (similar to a unix "ls -la
/path/to/file)
