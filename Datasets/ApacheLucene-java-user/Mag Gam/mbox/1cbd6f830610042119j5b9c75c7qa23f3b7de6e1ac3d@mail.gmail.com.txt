SUBJECT: Advantage of putting lucene index in RDBMS
DATE: 5 Oct 2006

I have been reading the lists for couple of week now, and I noticed people
asking about placing their indexes into a RDBMS. What is the advantage of
that?

So far lucene was able to solve all my problems, but I am curious how else
people are using it (especially with RDBMS).

TIA
