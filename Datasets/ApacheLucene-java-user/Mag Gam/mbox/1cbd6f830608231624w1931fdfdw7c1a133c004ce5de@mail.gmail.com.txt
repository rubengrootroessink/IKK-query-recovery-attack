Hi All,

I am trying to do a Query parse line in a doGET method (J2EE).

I keep getting this type of message;
unreported exception org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException; must be
caught or declared to be thrown

Anyone have an example of a Class being thrown an exception?

I would kindly appreciate it.

tia
