SUBJECT: Use  wildcards in field names?
DATE: 24 Jun 2004

I was wondering if is it possible to use wild cards in fiel names?

this is my case: i have a file that is term as respective descriptions,
separated by a space, like this:

bed place to sleep
chair place to seat down
glass recipient of liquids
pen something to write with
hat something to protect your hed

and what i want is to perform searches in both sides of the file, the terms
and the descriptions, and be able to use wildcards in both.
Does any one know how to do this having just this file?

I thougth naming the field after the term, and put the descriptions in the
field, but then i can't use wildcards to search in fields names...

I'd appreciate any kind of help!

Thank you in advance, Hugo.
