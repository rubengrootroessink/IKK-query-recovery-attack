SUBJECT: StandardAnalyzer specifications
DATE: 3 Jun 2010


Hello,

I am sorry if this is posted somewhere else, but I think I sent it to
the wrong list and I am trying again.

Is there anywhere I can find specifications for StandardAnalyzer?

I am looking for specs that tell just how StandardAnalyzer tokenizes
search terms, and how it deals with special combination of characters,
eg:

alpo@dogfood.com becomes:

  alpo@dogfood.com

while

alpo1@dogfood.com becomes :

  alpo1
  dogfood.com

Brian's becomes Brian

etc.

Thanks,  Allasso Travesser
