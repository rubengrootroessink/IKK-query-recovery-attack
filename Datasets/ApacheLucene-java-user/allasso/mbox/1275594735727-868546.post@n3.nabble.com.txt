SUBJECT: recommendation for deprecated StandardTokenizer.next() method?
DATE: 3 Jun 2010


Hello,

Does anyone have a recommendation for implementing the function previously
done by the deprecated StandardTokenizer.next() method?

and/or, can anyone point me to where I might find the reason it was
deprecated?

Thanks, Allasso
