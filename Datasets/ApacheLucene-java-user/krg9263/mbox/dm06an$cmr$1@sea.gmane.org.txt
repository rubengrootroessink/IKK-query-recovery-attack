SUBJECT: Search Struts
DATE: 22 Nov 2005

Does anyone have any use cases for Lucene in a Struts based application. for 
instance. My current implementation (which I just got working an hour ago) 
returns results but lists the associated JSP page. My app uses Struts Tiles 
and Struts Actions so linking to an individual JSP will not achieve the 
desired results.

I am basically just trying to create a site search function.

Thanks in advance.
