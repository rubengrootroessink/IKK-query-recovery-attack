SUBJECT: Lucene and Web Context
DATE: 22 Nov 2005

I am very new to Lucene.
Does anyone have an example of a Lucene IndexWriter whose path is relative 
to a context path? All of the examples I have seen place it outside the web 
container and relative to the system path. I need something within  a web 
container because I do not have access outside of it. I tried:

IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter( m_request.getContextPath()+ 
"/data/LUCENE", new StandardAnalyzer(), true);


but this resulted in the app looking in: c:/CONTEXT_PATH/data/LUCENE

Any advice is greatly appreciated.
