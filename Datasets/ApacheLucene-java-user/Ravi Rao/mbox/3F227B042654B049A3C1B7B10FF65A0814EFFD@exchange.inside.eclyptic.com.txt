SUBJECT: Using JDBCDirectory
DATE: 15 Mar 2005

All,

I got JDBCDirectory from information on the lucene-user's mailing list.

http://mail-archives.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgId=1644063

I cannot get basic searches to work.  I tried to merge the JDBC
directory with a filesystem index and search the filesystem index.
That produced nothing in the filesystem index.  I'm investigating.
Has anyone had success with JDBC directory?

Thanks,
