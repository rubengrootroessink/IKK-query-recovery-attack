  I might be mistaken here, but why exactly wouldn't you use the facet 
approach? I don't know exactly about how to do this in core Lucene but 
with Solr it works very well also for multi-valued fields. You could 
just say "give me the 100 most frequent terms in field X" for each field 
you're interested in.

Best,

     Erik
