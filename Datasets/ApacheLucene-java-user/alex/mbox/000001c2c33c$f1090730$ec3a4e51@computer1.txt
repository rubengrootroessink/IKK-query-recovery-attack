SUBJECT: suggestion on Filtering Results
DATE: 24 Jan 2003

Hi all


i want to ask what are the number of way you can filter out results i.e
reduce documents return. I m using the Lucene demo as an index so this may
retrict my options a bit

i have so far done search    that matches all word
                                        exclude some words
                                        filter the score e.g score higher
that 0.3 can only be returned

any other suggestions ?

thxs

Alex
