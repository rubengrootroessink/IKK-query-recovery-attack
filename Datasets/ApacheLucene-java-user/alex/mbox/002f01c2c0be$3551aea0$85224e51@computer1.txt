thxs for your suggestion this is what i have written but it does not work
any suggestion on how to get it to work ?

 System.out.print("will all of the words ");
        String q1 = in.readLine();
 System.out.print("without the words");
        String q2 = in.readLine();

        BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
              Query matchall = QueryParser.parse(q1, "content", analyzer);
        query.add(matchall, true, false);
              Query exclude = QueryParser.parse( q2, "content" , analyzer);
        query.add(exclude, false, true);

        System.out.println("Searching for: " + query.toString("content"));
        Hits hits = searcher.search(query);
        System.out.println(hits.length() + " total matching documents  ");
