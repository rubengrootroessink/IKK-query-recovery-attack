SUBJECT: how to join 2 queries togther
DATE: 20 Jan 2003

hi all

I have a method which takes in a normal query breaks into token and places + in front it
I have a second method which does the same instead puts a - sign front the token

the reason i have done this is so that the user do not need to add + and - signs by themselfs
and also I cound
 not get the booleanQuery to work

this makes it so that i have 2 queries 

1) a file must contain all these words
2) a file must exclude this words

my question is how do join these 2 queries togther so it filters out words that i want and
do not want ?

Alex
