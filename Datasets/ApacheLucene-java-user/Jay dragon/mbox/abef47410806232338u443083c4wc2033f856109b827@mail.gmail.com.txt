Hi,
BoostingQuery is designed to demote the scores of documents when they match
the undesired
query by the boosting/demoting the final score. The problem I see is this
demoting factor is static/universal in the sense that it does not depend on
how much the docs match the negative query terms. Ideally, the more the doc
matches the  negative part of the query, the high the demotion.
I wonder if anyone here has thought about/encounted  the similar problem and
what's teh best way to handle that?

Thanks!

Tommy.
