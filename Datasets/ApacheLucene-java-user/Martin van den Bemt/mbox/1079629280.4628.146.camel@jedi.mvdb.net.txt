The problem with boolean data in an RDMS, is that you will end up with
huge query statements, which doesn't make the database any faster,
unless you do some real db optimalisation, which can be pretty hard when
you try to be db independent. I am confident (implementing a test
scenario already) that Lucene will give us what we need..

Thanx for the quick reply..
