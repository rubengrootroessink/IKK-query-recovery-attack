Hi there,
sorry for my late response. I was absorbed by something else.

Thanks for the info.

I want to do some mathematical operation which requires matrix manipulation,
and those matrix can be of huge size even though stored as sparse so i want
an embedded system (DB or API) which allow me to store, update, delete and
retrieve cell of matrix as fast as possilble considering disk constraints.

Any suggestion?

Thanks
miztaken
