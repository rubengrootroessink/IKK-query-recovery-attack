Hi there,
sorry for the delay

>Q. Can there be multiple addresses in a single document?
  A. Yes there can be multiple addresses in a single document in single
field.

>Q. Do you add any other data to the document that you mean to query for?
  A. Yes there can be other fields as well, if this is what you were asking.

>Q. Can you tell us how you tokenized it?
  A. I used the class EmailFilter.java from following link
http://openmailarchiva.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openmailarchiva/Server/trunk/src/com/stimulus/archiva/search/EmailFilter.java?view=markup
 as provided by Jamie-52. After tokenizing i stored each token as space
separated and indexed it.

>Q. Why do you have to store the original string?
  A. To display the original string to user. I have to search and display as
well. I cant display those tokenized strings.

>I'm sorry, but you still told us very little about what it is you try
