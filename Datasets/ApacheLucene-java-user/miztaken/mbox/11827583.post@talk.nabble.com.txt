>Can you use IndexWriter#deleteDocument instead?

No i cant use this method.
I dont know docid and i dont wanna search for it. It will only add extra
time.
I am deleting the document on the basis of unique key field.


>Can you please supply an isolated and working test case that  
>demonstrate your problem?
