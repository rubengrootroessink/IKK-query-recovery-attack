DATE: 5 Jul 2008


Hi there,

for email addresses string such as "john@wherever.com; jack smith"

I might do wild card search like john* or jack* or john@* for *wherever.com
for phrase search i can do "jack smith"
for general search i might do "john@whereever.com"

I tokenized the string and indexed it into single Field using the Java File,
as mentioned in my earlier post and did searching.
Its working fine.

I want to know what can be the pitfalls of doing like this:
One i know is.. for each string, i should maintain two fields.. one to store
the original string and one that holds tokenized string.

What else ?

Thank You
miztaken
