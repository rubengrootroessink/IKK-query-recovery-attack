The corpus is very big.  Approximately 300,000,000 documents and
growing.  I would estimate potentially a huge number of hits per search.

We currently do iterate through the hits and process them like you
suggest, but that requires some impressive kludges to work :)  Just
wondering if there was a clever way to push this logic into the
index/search process.

My other plan was to create a class that implements Searchable
interface.  This class will just forward all search requests to a
private IndexSearcher data member and post-process the results before
returning.  I will then pass an array of these customized searchers to a
ParallelMultiSearcher.  Given enough parallel processing, this might
work in a reasonable timeframe.
