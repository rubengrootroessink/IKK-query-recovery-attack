Thanks for the reply Hoss, as always.

You hit the nail on the head though: I am using a MultiSearcher.  100+
indexes, each with millions of documents.  The memory usage when
storing the strings is very, very high.

I'll do a little more research about the memory usage and expanding to
more boxes and repost to the list.
