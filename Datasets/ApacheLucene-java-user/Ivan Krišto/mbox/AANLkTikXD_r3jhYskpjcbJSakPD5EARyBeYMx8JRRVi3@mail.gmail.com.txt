As a general HTML parser I would recommend "Jericho HTML Parser" -
http://jericho.htmlparser.net/docs/index.html
It is pretty robust (this is usually very important) and easy to use
(see provided examples). At the bottom of a given page you have the
short overview of few other HTML parsers.
I haven't compared it's speed with other parsers (I was only searching
for robust parser). But, this parser is neither an event nor tree
based parser (so, even automata theory can help us here).

If you need something pretty specific, like extracting all links from
page, I would recommend you to use simple regular expressions.
