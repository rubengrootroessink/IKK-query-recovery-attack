SUBJECT: Re: Structure of .tii-file
DATE: 27 Jul 2010

Hello Mike,

thanks for your answer!
I am currently working with Lucene 3.0.1 and except the .tii - file all 
other descriptions are comprehensible.
The idea behind the tii/tis file structure is for faster retrieving the 
correct terms.
At first I lookup in memory (tii-file) and take the most nearby hit. 
With this information I can skip to the correct position in the tis-file 
and scan up to my final hit. I don't exactly understand how this 
skipping is realized.
Do I have a direct pointer to the postion on the hard drive? Or how do I 
find the term without having to much file access? :D

My intention behind this is that I want to run some performance tests on 
an created index with different block sizes of the hard drive.
Can I just copy this created index on another drive (with different 
blocksize) or do I have to generate the hole index again?

Greetings
Alex
