Hi, 

I am sorry, I don't quite understand what you meant by.. 

IndexWriter.updateDocument(...)

HTH

Let me re-phrase my question:

I need to append to an existing index. Presently, the code is structured
to check for the existing file, and exit if the file exists:

if(INDEX_FILE.exists())
{
System.out.println("Index File exists, remove existing index and
retry");
System.exit(1);
}

IndexWriter write = new IndexWriter(INDEX_FILE, new StandardAnalyser(),
true);
indexDocs(writer, FILE_TO_BE_INDEXED);
writer.optimize()
writer.close();

What files do I need to modify ? And what functions? Can you please
advise. 

Thanks,
Nitasha
