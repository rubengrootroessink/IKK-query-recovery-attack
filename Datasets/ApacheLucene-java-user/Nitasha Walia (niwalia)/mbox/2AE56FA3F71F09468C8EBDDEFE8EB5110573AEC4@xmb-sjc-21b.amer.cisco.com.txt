SUBJECT: Adding attribute to index
DATE: 2 Apr 2008

Hi, 
 
I am a new user of Java Lucene and need to learn how to add a new
attribute, such that, given a database of emails, containing sender
information, searching for a keyword, results in 
1. The sender of the email
2. The email. 
 
I am using Lucene-2.3.1, and don't know where to start in the huge code
base. 
 
Can someone please advise on the same?
 
Thanks,
