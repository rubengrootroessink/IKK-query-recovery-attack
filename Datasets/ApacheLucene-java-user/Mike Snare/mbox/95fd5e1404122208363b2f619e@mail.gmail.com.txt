Whether or not the text is stored in the index is a different concern
that how it is analyzed.  If you want the text to be indexed, and not
stored, then use the Field.Text(String, String) method or the
appropriate constructor when adding a field to the Document.  You'll
need to also store a reference to the actual file (URL, Path, etc) in
the document so it can be retrieved from the doc returned in the Hits
object.

Or did I completely misunderstand the question?

etc. The text ist german, so I tried to use GermanAnalyzer, but it stores whole text, not
terms. Please give me a tip how to index terms only. Thanks!
