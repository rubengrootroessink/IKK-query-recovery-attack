Hi,
just to give more info, I am using Lucene.Net 1.3 version, and not
1.9version. I think there is no option of setmaxBufferedDocs() in the
old
version. Can you tell me the best way to speed up the performance. What are
the parameters that I should set. I know that this depends on the system,
but which parameter exactly speeds up the indexing performance.

Thank you
