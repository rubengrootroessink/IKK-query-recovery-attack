SUBJECT: Simple QueryParser question
DATE: 2 Feb 2007

Hi,
This is a newbie-level question.

I want to construct a query, which returns the results sorted as follows:
1. Results having "all the terms" of the query string in title should be
listed first
2. Results having  "any of the terms" of the query string in the title
should be listed next.
3. Results having "all the terms"  of the query string in summary should be
listed next
4. Results having "any of the terms" of the query string in the summary
should come last.

How do I construct the query using QueryParser. The fields to be searched
are "title", "summary".
Please help me
