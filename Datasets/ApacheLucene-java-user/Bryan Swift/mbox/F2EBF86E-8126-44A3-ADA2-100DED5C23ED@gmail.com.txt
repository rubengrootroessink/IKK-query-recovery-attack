SUBJECT: Lucene-Core test failures
DATE: 19 Aug 2009

I was running the tests which lucene-core version 2.4 and I noticed a  
failure in org.apache.lucene.index.TestIndexInput for testRead at line  
89. The assertions in question have to do with reading "Modified UTF-8  
null bytes" according to the comments in the file. It seems these  
modified null bytes are not being retrieved properly.

This failure is of particular interest to me because I am getting a  
similar failure in the specs for the implementation of IndexInput I  
am  working on for the App Engine Datastore. I was wondering if this  
test failure is something to be concerned with or if it could be  
ignored/removed with relative safety?

Cheers.
Bryan
