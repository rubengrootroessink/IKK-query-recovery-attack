SUBJECT: Efficient delete
DATE: 7 Aug 2008

Dear List,

I have a rather big index around 20gb. My documents have a unique id
that I store in in an untokenized field.

Using an IndexReader I delete documents by term using the id. The
applications tries to batch as many delete operations as possible for
this.

The applications runs on a 8Core Machine with 1GB heapsize for the
JVM. Each delete takes about 3sec to complete. I have a lot of Updates
during a day so this takes a lot of time and in effect this is too
slow.

Is there anything I can do to speed things up a little?

Best,

Michael
