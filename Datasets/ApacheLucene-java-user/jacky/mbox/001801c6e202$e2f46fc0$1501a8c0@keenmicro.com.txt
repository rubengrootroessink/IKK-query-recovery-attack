SUBJECT: lock file of lucene
DATE: 27 Sep 2006

hi,
  When writing into an index, lucene will create a write lock file. 
So, if there is an error during the writing. the lock file will not be deleted. 
And also the JVM will not be closed for some time. So the program will have no chance to get
lock of this index.
Is there any method to avoid that?

     Best Regards.
