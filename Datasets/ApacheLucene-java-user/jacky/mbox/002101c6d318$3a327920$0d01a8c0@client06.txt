SUBJECT: delete operation
DATE: 8 Sep 2006

hi,
  There is a question about delete operation, i have not found  any doc in lucene api's javadoc:
   When using delete(Term term) of IndexReader and commit, at the same time, an indexSearcher
is open.So the deleted document still can be seached till reopen the indexSearcher, i don't
know how lucene did this.
  So  when the lucene database is updated, how to notify to reopen the IndexSearcher since
there may be several applications to search this lucene database?
    

     Best Regards.
       jacky
