SUBJECT: duplicate fields
DATE: 8 Sep 2006

hi,
   1. Is there an effect method to check if there exists the same field(hold a unique ID)
when added into lucene index database? Make a search for this field?
   2. Is there an effect method to check if there exists the duplicate fields(hold a unique
ID) in the lucene index database?
      Two methods: Read all documents and compare the fields, or search for each field.  Is
there a better one?

   Thanks for your help!

     Best Regards.
       jacky
