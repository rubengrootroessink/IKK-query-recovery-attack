SUBJECT: parameter create in IndexWriter
DATE: 7 Sep 2006

hi,
   Today I found a funny thing, if "create" parameter in IndexWriter set false, 
and there is no index Segements in the Directory before, then an IOException will be 
thrown.
   I am confused that why not using this logic : if there is a Segments, then append it, create
it otherwise.
   I know we can do this in the application, but it is complex sometimes.

     Best Regards.
