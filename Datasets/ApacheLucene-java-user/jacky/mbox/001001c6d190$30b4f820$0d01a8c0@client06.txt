Erik, thanks!
   You are right! It is not a good idea to hold on a hits since the index will be updated.
So, when i keep a hits, and then the index is updated, the searcher will be auto-updated,too.
rigtht?

     Best Regards.

Requerying helps avoid server-side sessions in a web application.   
Hits requires the same IndexSearcher, but in cases where the index is  
changing and a new IndexSearcher is being swapped in, it requires  
more management to keep old IndexSearcher's around until they are no  
longer needed.  I prefer the simplicity of requerying until there is  
actually a performance issue to address.  There is nothing wrong with  
the alternative of keeping Hits around, its just not as simple.

Erik
