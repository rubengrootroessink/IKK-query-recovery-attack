Dear Nick,
Thank you for your reply, but I still face some problems.
I saw the API for FilenameFilter... but I can't instantiate it because it's
abstract.

The accept method has a parameter name? Where is this? And how I call this
method? Finally what are those  " : "  in the for loop.
Sorry but if you could be more specific you could help me a lot.

Thank you in advance

Kostas
