Hello, 

I'm using the default lucene Queryparser on the search text : fleming
roofing inc., marietta ga

These items are in my index.

doc 1: fleming ga
doc 2: marietta ga
doc 3: marietta il
doc 4: marietta ok
doc 5: marietta ok
doc 6: fleming pa

The first match is always "fleming ga" even though "marietta ga" is closer
together in the search text. I'm assuming this is because of the "fleming"
has a higher idf than marietta. What should I change in the way i'm querying
or indexing to make this happen?

Also, I don't want to modify the search text by putting quotes around
"marietta ga" which forces the query parser to make a phrase query.

thanks,
Rajiv
