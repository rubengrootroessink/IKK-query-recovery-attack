To answer your questions,
1. there are only two words in the document I'm searching -- city and state
abbrev. lowercased and analyzed by whitespaceanalyzer
2. the only field and default field is text, so the query becomes text:
fleming text:roofing txt:inc. ...etc.
   Using query operator AND instead of OR gives me no results which does not
help.
3. I've been using explain in Luke and the only difference between "fleming
ga" and "marietta ga" is the idf value is higher for "flemming" ... that's
why "fleming ga" has a higher score.

Basically i'm just trying to get the "marietta ga" doc to score higher. In
the query text the two words are closer together than "fleming" and "ga".
