Otis, if you're willing to use some non-Java code for your task...

1) Wikipedia uses Lucene for their full-text searches, and the module  
is part of Mediawiki. You could use this as follows:
- Install Mediawiki
- Load your Wikipedia dump into MW (and MySQL)
- Build a search index for the Lucene Search extension:
http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/lucene-search/README.txt?revision=8535&view=markup

2) Alternately, use Mediawiki's native import parser (in PHP) and use  
that to feed Solr, etc. The code is a bit hairy, 'tho.
