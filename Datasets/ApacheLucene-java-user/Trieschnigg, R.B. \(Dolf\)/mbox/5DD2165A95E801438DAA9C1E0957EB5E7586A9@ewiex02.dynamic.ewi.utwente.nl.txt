SUBJECT: BM25 Similarity implementation
DATE: 16 Feb 2006

Hi,

I would like to implement the Okapi BM25 weighting function using my own Similarity implementation.
Unfortunately BM25 requires the document length in the score calculation, which is not provided
by the Scorer.

Does anyone know a solution to this problem?

I've tried to find other Similarity implementations than the default one used by Lucene, but
I could not find any... Any suggestions?

Thanks.
Dolf
