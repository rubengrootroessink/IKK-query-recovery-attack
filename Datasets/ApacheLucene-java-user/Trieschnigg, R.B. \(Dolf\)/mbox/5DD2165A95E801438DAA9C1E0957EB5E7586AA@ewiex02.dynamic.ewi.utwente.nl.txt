I wrote a quick and dirty implementation of a JarDirectory - it works, but a new problem is
encountered soon after: The indexWriter requires information from the System properties; an
applet is allowed to read only a limited set of Properties.

Especially with an offline applet I would stick to the solution of signing the applet.
