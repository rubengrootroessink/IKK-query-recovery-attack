SUBJECT: Index (speed) optimization
DATE: 13 Jun 2006

Hi,

I just looked at the log of my indexing program and saw that after adding 4.5 million documents
(16 Gb of text) to a newly created index, it took 7 hours (!) to carry out the optimization
(indexWriter.optimize()). I am running the indexing program on a (3.2Ghz, 1Gb RAM) desktop
computer with a 7200 RPM harddisk.

Obviously it depends on the hardware you're using, but is this a "normal" time?

Searching the archive I found a number of tips to increase indexing speed, perhaps someone
knows more?

* indexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs(1000); // default 10
* indexWriter.setMergeFactor(70); // default 10
* Write to multiple RAMDirectories and use 'addIndexes' to finally merge them to a FSDirectory
* ...

Regards,
Dolf
