SUBJECT: Re: CorruptIndexException workaround in 2.3-SNAPSHOT? (Attn: Michael McCandless)
DATE: 26 Sep 2008

Confirmed that the manifest date on the 2.3-SNAPSHOT is much older
than the file date:
Implementation-Version: 2.3-SNAPSHOT 613047 - hudson - 2008-01-18 04:1
 1:25

Is there an available SNAPSHOT of the 2.3 branch with this fix?
I've downloaded the 2.4 SNAPSHOT to see if this will resolve the
corruption issue -- based on the date in the Manifest, I'm assuming
this is a slightly later version than 2.4rc2.

2.4 SNAPSHOT
Implementation-Version: 2.4-SNAPSHOT 699151 - 2008-09-26 02:10:14
2.4 RC2
Implementation-Version: 2.4.0-rc2 698976 - 2008-09-25 10:12:47

Best,
Ari
