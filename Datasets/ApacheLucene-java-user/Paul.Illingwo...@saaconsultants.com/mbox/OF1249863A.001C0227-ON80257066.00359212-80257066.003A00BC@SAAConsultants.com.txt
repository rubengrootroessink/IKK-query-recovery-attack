SUBJECT: Re: Hierarchical Documents
DATE: 23 Aug 2005






I have been struggling with this sort of problem for some time and still
haven't got an ideal solution.

Initially I was going to go for the approach Erik has suggested for similar
reasons - it allowed me to search within categories and within sub
categories of those categories very simply. Unfortunately in my system the
categorisation is dynamic. If a user wants to rename a category then all
the documents within those categories or any of the subcategories would
have to be reindexed. Similarly, if the user moves a category from one
place to another then again this can result in lots of reindexing.

The reindexing problem can be avoided by using identifiers for the
categories. I simply index a list of the ids for the categories the
document belongs to when indexing the document. This allows me to
dynamically change and restructure the category hierarchy without impacting
the index. The downside is that for searching I need to map the category
path to the category id. This I do using a database look-up prior to
searching Lucene. To carry out sub category searching I will be looking up
all the sub categories in the database using a wildcard and then probably
building either Boolean expression (for small numbers of subcategories) or
a Lucene filter combined with the ConstantScoreQuery (from the sandbox) for
large number of subcategories - the user having to understand that
searching lots of subcategories may take some time. In my case the
subcategory searching is not the norm so this isn't too much of a problem.

There's some useful articles here

and here http://www.dbazine.com/oracle/or-articles/tropashko4 that discuss
tree structures in SQL that I found useful.
