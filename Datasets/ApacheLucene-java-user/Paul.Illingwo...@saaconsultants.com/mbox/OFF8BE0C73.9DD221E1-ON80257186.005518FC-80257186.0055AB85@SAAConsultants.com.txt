SUBJECT: Re: Converting SQL statement to Lucene query
DATE: 7 Jun 2006






You could take a look at Apaches Jackrabbit - it does this sort of thing.
Its not exactly a library but it might give you some pointers. My
understanding is that it uses an SQL like syntax for defining queries that
are converted into an abstract syntax tree which it can then convert into
any query syntax, Lucene query syntax being one. The Lucene query generated
is obviously specific to the Jackrabbit indexes.

Hi folks,

Has anyone done or do you know of an API library that will take SQL
statement and convert them to Lucene Query?  I know not every SQL statement
can become a Lucene Query but that's OK as long as the library will
highlight them.

Thanks!
