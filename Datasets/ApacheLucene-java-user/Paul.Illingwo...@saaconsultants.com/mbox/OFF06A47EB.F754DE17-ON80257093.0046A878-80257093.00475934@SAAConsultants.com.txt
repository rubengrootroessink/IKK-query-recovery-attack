SUBJECT: Committing IndexReader changes without closing
DATE: 7 Oct 2005





Hello,

I have a situation where I wish to open an IndexReader and keep it open. I
never want to add anything to this index but do want to delete from it.
Periodically I would like to flush any deletions that may have been made to
the index to disk (to protect the changes from being lost if the server
goes down). It seems that the IndexReader.commit() method does this but it
is protected.

Are there there any reasons (other than it being protected) why I could not
call commit() externally in this way?

Regards,

Paul I.
