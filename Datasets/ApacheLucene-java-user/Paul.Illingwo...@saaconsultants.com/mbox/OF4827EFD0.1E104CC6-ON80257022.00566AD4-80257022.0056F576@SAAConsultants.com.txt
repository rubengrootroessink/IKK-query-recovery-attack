I guess that if you have 10 indexes each with a merge factor of 10 with
documents evenly distributed across those indexes then on average there
will be a merge every 100 documents.

If you have a single index there will be a merge every 10 documents.

If you increase your merge factor from 10 to 100 on your single index then
maybe you'll see similar performance but bear in mind the limitations about
the number of open files and memory consumption. I have seen quoted
somewhere that this should be no bigger than 50 (where I can't remember).

Forgot to add, that it does not only indexes files, it also creates
XML documents. So don't worry if takes 30 minutes to index 450 MB.

But the difference in time is due to the fact of indexing in one index or
not.
