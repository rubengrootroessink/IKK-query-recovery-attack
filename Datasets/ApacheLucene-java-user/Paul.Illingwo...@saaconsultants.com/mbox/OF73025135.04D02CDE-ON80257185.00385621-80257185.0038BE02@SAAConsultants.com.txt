It's an invaluable book if you're new to Lucene. There have been some
changes to the Lucene API since the book was published but you shouldn't
let this put you off - they're relatively minor. I think Lucene In Action
v2.0 might be a little while in coming (checkout Otis' blog
http://www.jroller.com/page/otis?catname=%2FLucene).

Does everyone recommend getting this book? I'm just starting out with
Lucene and like to have a book beside me as well as the web / this
mailing list, but the book looks quite old now, has a 1-2 month delivery
wait time here in the UK and is quite expensive. Is it worth waiting for
a new edition perhaps?

Thanks,

Digby
