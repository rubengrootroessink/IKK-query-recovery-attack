I can only think that the problem you're having is peculiar to your setup
or the way in which you are using Lucene. A wild guess - are you reaching
quota limits on your filesystem or something like this?

The incremental query seems to work better. Thanks.

Oh Im really quite tired of trying to resolve this "Access denied"
issue. Ive deleted and recreated the index directory umpteen times!
Finally I created a brand new directory in a brand new location and ran
my index program. Lucene seemed to index the results from the first
30000 queries (increments of 10000) successfully but then finally threw
this age-old error yet again !! ..  Can you or anyone else make any
sense of this? I surely cant !

Also the indexing seems to be noticeably slow. For indexing every 10000
result sets by allocating 1.4gb of memory at run time, it takes
approximately 20 seconds. With a database of a million records the total
time in indexing will take ~ 35 mins. Is that normal?

Thanks
Rahil
