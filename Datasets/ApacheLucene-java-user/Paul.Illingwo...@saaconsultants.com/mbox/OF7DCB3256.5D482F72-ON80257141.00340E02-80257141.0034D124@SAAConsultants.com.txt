The IndexReader.terms() method gets a list of all the terms in an index.
You need to somehow limit this to the terms for your ZipCode field which I
don't know how to do. Luke has the ability to do this though so it is
certainly possible.

Hi,
Actually lucene does not provide you a straight forward  Query to get
UNIQUE
results.
But as far as I know, u can use HitsCollector & BitSet combination to
count/get unique results.

Jelda
