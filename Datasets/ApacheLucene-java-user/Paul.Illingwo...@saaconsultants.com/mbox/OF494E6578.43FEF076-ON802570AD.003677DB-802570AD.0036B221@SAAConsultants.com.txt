Hi,

Is there a way to link indexed records in Lucene?

I am working with collections and a record might be a part of a
collection and this collection can again be a part of super collection.
So if the search result has the record, is there a way to find out all
the collections under which the record falls without associating
all the information with the record?

Thanks,
Urvashi
