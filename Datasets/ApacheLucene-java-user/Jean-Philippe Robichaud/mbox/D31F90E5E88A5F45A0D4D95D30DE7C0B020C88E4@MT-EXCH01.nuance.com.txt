SUBJECT: Is Lucene Java trunk still stable for production code?
DATE: 14 Mar 2007

Hello Dear Lucene Users!

 

Back in the old days (well, last year) the lucene/java/trunk subversion
path was always stable enough for everyone to use into production code.
Now, with the 2.0/2.1/2.2 braches, is it still the case?  

 

In December, I 'ported' my app to use the lucene 2.0 release.  Now, I
have another chance to upgrade the production code (this is not
happening every month!) so I would like to upgrade the lucene library
I'm using to take advantage of performance gains.  Should I just update
my svn image from lucene/java/trunk or should I take
lucene/java/branches/lucene_2_1

 

Thanks!

 

Jp
