That's really wonderful.  Everything gets cleaner now. 

Thanks, I mean really Thanks, for all the hard work that goes in Lucene
code + Doc + Processes + Mailing list.  Lucene is really something I
refer other as "what (open source) software development should be".

I'll go with lucene_2_1 !

: Thanks for your insight, it matches my thoughts.  The only reason I'm
: wondering is because the latest change in the lucene_2_1 branch is 4
: weeks old.  So either no bugs were found since then (yeah!) or the
bugs
: gets fixed in the trunk...

The general policy that Doug has encouraged in teh past is to only
commit
to the patch branch if/when a patch release is going to be made ... that
way there are less conflicts with merging and it's easier to understand
what exactly is going intothe patch release.

In general, i would suggest that the trunk no longer be considered
"stable" ... the current momentum is for more frequent releases, one
motivation for which is so people wanting "stable" builds don't feel
like they need to ues the trunk for the latest features,taking some
burden
off commiters from needing to feel like every commit must be perfect
because users rely on the trunk being stable.

(or in short: we're moving more towards a *true* commit and review
model)
