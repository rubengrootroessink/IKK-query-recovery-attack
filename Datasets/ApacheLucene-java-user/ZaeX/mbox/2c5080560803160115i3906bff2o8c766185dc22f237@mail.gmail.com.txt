SUBJECT: how can I see the indexed,tokenized field
DATE: 16 Mar 2008

Hi, all

I got some troubles on getting expected search results, so I want to check
what info is stored (more precisely, how was it tokenized) in index for some
fields. (indexed and tokenized but not stored)
Please tell me how to get that.

Thanks.
