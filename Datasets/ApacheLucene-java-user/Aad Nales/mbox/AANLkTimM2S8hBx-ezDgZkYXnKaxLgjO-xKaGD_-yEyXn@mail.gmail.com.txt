Hi Rebecca,

Thanks a lot for your reply. It sounds like a very solid alternative.
What i miss is how you do the highlighting. Suppose that i would
search for 'strong tea'  and this would result in a hit on 'black tea'
. Where strong is an synonym to black. How do you create a highlighter
for that?

Thanks,
Aad
