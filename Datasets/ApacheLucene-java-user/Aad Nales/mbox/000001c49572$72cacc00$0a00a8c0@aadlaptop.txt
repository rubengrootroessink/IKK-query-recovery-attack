SUBJECT: combining open office spellchecker with Lucene
DATE: 8 Sep 2004

Hi All,

Before I start reinventing wheels I would like to do a short check to
see if anybody else has already tried this. A customer has requested us
to look into the possibility to perform a spell check on queries. So far
the most promising way of doing this seems to be to create an Analyzer
based on the spellchecker of OpenOffice. My question is: "has anybody
tried this before?" 

Cheers,
Aad
