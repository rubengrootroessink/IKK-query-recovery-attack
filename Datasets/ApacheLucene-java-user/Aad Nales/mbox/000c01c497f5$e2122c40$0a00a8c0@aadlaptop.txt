Yes, sure, thx, I understand now - but maybe not - the context I was 
something like this:

[1] The user enters a query like:
     recursize descent parser

[2] The search code parses this and sees that the 1st word is not a term

in the index, but the next 2 are. So it ignores the last 2 terms 
("recursive" and "descent") and suggests alternatives to 
"recursize"...thus if any term is in the index, regardless of frequency,

  it is left as-is.

My idea is to first execute the query and only execute the 'spell check'
if the number of results is lower than a certain treshhold. 

Secondly, I would like to use the 'stemming' functionality that MySpell
offers to be used for all stuff that is written to the index together
with the POS appearance.

Thirdly I want to regularly scan the index for often used words to be
added to the list of 'approved' terms. This would serve another purpose
of the customer, which is building an synonym index for Dutch words used
in an eductional context.

But having read all the input I think that using the index itself for a
first spellcheck is probably not a bad start.

I guess you're saying that, if the user enters a term that appears in 
the index and thus is sort of spelled correctly ( as it exists in some 
doc), then we use the heuristic that any sufficiently large doc 
collection will have tons of misspellings, so we assume that rare terms 
in the query might be misspelled (i.e. not what the user intended) and 
we suggest alternativies to these words too (in addition to the words in

the query that are not in the index at all).
