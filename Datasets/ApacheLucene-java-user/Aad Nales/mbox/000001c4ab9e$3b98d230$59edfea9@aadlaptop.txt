SUBJECT: what happen with an 'open' IndexSearcher when the index files are 'changed'.
DATE: 6 Oct 2004

Hi All,

Based on some recent comments that open IndexSearchers should be cached
I am implementing an IndexSearcherPool based on the pool implementation
in the jakarta.commons.

My question is this:

When I run a full reindex, i build a new temporary index and once it is
done I move it to where the previous location was. This seems pretty
much standard. My question is is what happens with an IndexSearcher
when:

1. it has been created with an File() object to the old index. It
searches a few times but does not close. The reindex occurs and the new
index comes to live? Do they crash when the next query is fired?

2. the same but now during a search?

Thanks for any insights,
Aad
