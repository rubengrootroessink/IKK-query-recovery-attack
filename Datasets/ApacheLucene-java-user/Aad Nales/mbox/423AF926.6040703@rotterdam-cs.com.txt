SUBJECT: references to large installations
DATE: 18 Mar 2005

We have been using Lucene for quite some time now but recently a 
customer asked to what level Lucene has scaled and if any public 
references to such projects exist. The (potential) customer is looking 
towards an index based on 15M (million) documents. Do any of you know of 
public sites that using lucene to search to similar amounts of documents?

Any references are received with loads of kudos,

cheers,
Aad
