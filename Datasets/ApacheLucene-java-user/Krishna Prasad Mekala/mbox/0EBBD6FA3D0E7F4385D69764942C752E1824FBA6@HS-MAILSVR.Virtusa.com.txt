SUBJECT: How to Update the Index once it is created
DATE: 14 May 2007

Hi All,

 

Thanks for your response. I have one more doubt. How can I update a
index once created from Oracle, instead of recreating the whole.
Whenever there is a change in the oracle table
(insertion/updation/deletion of a row) my application should update the
index.

 

Thanks in advance.
