DATE: 11 May 2007

Hi all,

 

I am new to Lucene. I am developing a small search utility using lucene.
I have to create the index from my Oracle database. Can anybody tell me
how to create the index from Oracle using lucene? Please send me code
snippets if possible.

 

Your valuable help is highly appreciated. 

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Thanks and best regards,

 

Krishna Prasad M
