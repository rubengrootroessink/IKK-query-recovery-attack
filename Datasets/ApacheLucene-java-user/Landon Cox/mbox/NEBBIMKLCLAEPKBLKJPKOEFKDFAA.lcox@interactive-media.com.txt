SUBJECT: RE: QueryParser question - case-sensitivity
DATE: 9 May 2002


Hi Otis,

On both the indexing side and creation of the query parser, I'm using the
StandardAnalyzer class.  Seems like it would be symmetrical w/r to case
sensitivity, but it's apparently not related to the problem or it's a
bug...I suspect the former.  I'll start looking at the source next.  Thanks,

Landon

|Wouldn't that be the Analzyer that you are using?

|Replace that piece, and you'll keep your upper cases.
