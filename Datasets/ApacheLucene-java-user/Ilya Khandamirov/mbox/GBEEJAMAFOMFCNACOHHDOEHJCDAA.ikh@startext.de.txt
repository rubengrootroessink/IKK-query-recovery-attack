SUBJECT: Release Build. Does it exist?
DATE: 22 Nov 2001

Hi,

I'm new to Lucene, but i like it very much from what i've read about it. I'm
just wondering if there is a Release Build (production quality version) of
Lucene?

Home page states - "Lucene News: Lucene v1.02 released"
(http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html). But i can find only
Milestone Lucene 1.2. Release **Candidates** 1/2 at both
http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.html and
http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-lucene/release/.

Please let me know what i'm missing and where can i find the release
version.

Regards,
Ilya
