SUBJECT: Hardware requirements for millions of document
DATE: 14 Nov 2002

Hi,

We are about to start a new project, that involves maintaining a
read/write lucene index with about 2 millions of documents. I would
really appreciate if people already maintaining such volumes could post
their configurations: CPU, RAM, Operating System, any comments you
consider useful.

Thank you.

Regards,
Ilya
