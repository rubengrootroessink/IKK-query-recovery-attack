Hi,

You could do something like this in Intranet, where you could dictate
that your users may run macros. Then you could write some VBA code,
which get the terms from Lucene and highlights them in Excel.

Another option would be working with Excel format at binary level.

For more details please ask in some Excel user group.


Regards,
Ilya
