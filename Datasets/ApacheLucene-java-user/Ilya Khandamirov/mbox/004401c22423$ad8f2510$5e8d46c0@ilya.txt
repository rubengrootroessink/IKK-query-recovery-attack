Hi Peter,

>there is a sample servlet in the servelet directory of the SearchBean
contribution

Are you sure? This directory (servlet) is empty:
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contributions/searc
hbean/src/java/org/apache/lucene/servlet/

Could you please provide me with the sample servlet?

Thank you.

Regards,
Ilya
