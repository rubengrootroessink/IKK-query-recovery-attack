Hi all,

I recently came across the Compass Framework, which is built on top of lucene. I
am interested in it because it stores the lucene index in an RDBMS and provides
transaction support for index updates (it also has several other features but
this is the part I'm mostly interested in).

I wanted to know if any people here have had any experience with compass and what
they think about it. Is the database implementation of the index fast enough and
does it introduce any additional issues/problems?

Thanks in advance,
Marios
