SUBJECT: Highlighter and complex queries
DATE: 29 Apr 2006

  Hi all,

Suppose the user enters the following query using a textbox interface: 
"rate based optimization" (as a phrase query, including the quotes). The 
query is parsed using QueryParser, then it is rewritten, and given to 
the highlighter. Then, method getBestTextFragments is called.

The method returns some fragments which contain only one of the words in 
the search phrase. Isn't this wrong? Since this is a phrase query, 
shouldn't the highlighter look for fragments which contain all three 
words, and even more, only for fragments in which the three words are 
adjascent (based on the token stream returned by the analyzer)?

Thanks in advance,
Marios
