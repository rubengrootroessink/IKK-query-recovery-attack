SUBJECT: Lucene & Transactional semantics
DATE: 16 Nov 2005

Hi all,

I am interested in developing a system which will use Lucene to implement the search functionality.
A key characteristic of this system is that certain information about the indexed documents
will be editable by the user administrators. For instance, the user administrators can manually
create "document collections" and assign some of the indexed documents to them. One way to
implement document collections would by having documents have a dedicated field for storing
the document collection id, and storing the document collection information in a database.

Ideally, such an operation as the above should have transactional semantics, i.e. if a user
wants to assign documents x, y and z to collection C, then either all three documents should
be assigned to the collection or, in case of error, none of the documents should be assigned
to the collection. Also, if the operation were to be followed by an SQL query to update the
database with the number of documents assigned to collection C, that should be included in
the "transaction" as well.

Is there a straightforward way to do this with Lucene? Or are "transactions" a no-no for a
system like Lucene and I should just go ahead without having transactional semantics?

Thanks in advance,

Marios Skounakis
