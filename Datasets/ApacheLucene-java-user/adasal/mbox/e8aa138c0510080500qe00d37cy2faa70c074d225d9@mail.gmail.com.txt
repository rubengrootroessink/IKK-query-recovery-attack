Very interesting.
Actually, reading Meet Lucene Part 2 by Otis Gospondnetic and Eric Hatcher
there is mention of Egothor and MG4J. Egothor. What is not mentioned is
Carrot" which, I think, originally has been used with Egothor but has also
been submitted to Lucene CVS. There is a helpful discussion with links that
can be found in lucene-user Re: Term Weights and Clustering from Feb 2005.
MG4J also looks very interesting. There are good resources about it on
sebastiano Vigna's web site, vigna.dsi.unimi.it <http://vigna.dsi.unimi.it>.
The mention the use of Bloom filters, an aticle about which has been written
by Maciej Ceglowski who is (largely) responsible for the LSI/ContextGraph
implementation at NITLE. Article Using Bloom Filters on
Perl.com<http://Perl.com>.
Bloom filters look a bit like the random index from Sahlgren I have
mentioned.
Much to do!
