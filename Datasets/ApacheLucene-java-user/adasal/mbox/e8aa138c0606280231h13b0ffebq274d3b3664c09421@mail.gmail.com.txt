SUBJECT: Re: Lucene indexing RDF
DATE: 28 Jun 2006

What are the issues in indexing rdf? I would be interested to see a
discusion of this.
Off the top of my head it would be one thing to index the data, regardless
of enclosing tags, but something else to employ the tags as adjunct to the
index. Has this been approached anywhere?
A third part would be pure indexing of the tags only - I wonder if there
would be any use for this, but suspect there would for optimisation and to
help guide querries, for instance there would be no sense in searching for
content that would only be surrounded by tags that don't exist in the
document instances being inspected and, conversely, there maybe a lot of
sense in searching where the tag appears frequently, or because of some
other logical or statistical property of the tag.
As far as i have researched this I know that the gnowsis project uses both
rdf and lucene, but I have not had time to determine their relationship.
www.gnowsis.org/
DSpace <http://www.dspace.org/> also supports a lucene interface but, again,
I don't know how it is used.
