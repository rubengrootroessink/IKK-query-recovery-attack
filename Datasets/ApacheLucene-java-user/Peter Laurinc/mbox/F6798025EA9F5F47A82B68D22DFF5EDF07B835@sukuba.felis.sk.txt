Maybe the solution is have to each term not only position but also
something like vector. Then you can "vectorize it":
term 1 has vector 1, 1 term 2 has vector 1, 1 (1 paragraph, 1 sentence
of this paragraph) , term 3 has (1, 2)
if you set query for searching in paragraph/sentence you only set what
portion of vector must be same. 

Is this the way?

It really depends on your needs.  If you never need proximity across  
sentence boundaries, then what's the issue?   Putting a large gap at  
sentence boundaries makes good sense for some needs.  Maybe not so for
your situation?

I'm definitely interested in what others have done with this sort of
thing.

At the extreme, if all you wanted was to find sentences and did not need
to query for terms in multiple sentences at one time then you could
index each sentence as a separate Document.
