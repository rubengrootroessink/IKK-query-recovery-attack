SUBJECT: Sentence and Paragraph searching

Hi,
 
I'm newbie to lucene.
I wan to ask, how to implement search for phrase that must be in
sentence/paragraph.
I did see som examples, that uses term position changing, but I think
that this is not the way, because it breaks classic proximity search. 
(if one word is on end and second of begining of next sentence)
 
 
Thanks for any help
 
Peter
