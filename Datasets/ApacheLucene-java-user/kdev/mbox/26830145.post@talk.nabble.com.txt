SUBJECT: Re: Scoring formula - Average number of terms in IDF
DATE: 17 Dec 2009


If I follow your approach, and produce the avg(outside of Lucene) while I 'm
building the index(due to performance reasons I can't wait for all the
documents to arrive before indexing them) for a collection, the avg will be
ready only when all the documents of the collection are indexed. 
Lucene states that the new similarity class must be set in
IndexWriter.setSimilarity(), and be used while I build the index, and in
this time the avg isn't ready yet. Is there a way to overcome this? And if
not calculating the score while the index is being created, and only when
searching the index, what will the consequence in performance be?

(Mike thank you about your response)
