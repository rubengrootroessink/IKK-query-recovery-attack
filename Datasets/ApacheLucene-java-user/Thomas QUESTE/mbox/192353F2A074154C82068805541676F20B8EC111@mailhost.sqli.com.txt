SUBJECT: Searching word in an URL
DATE: 23 Jul 2004

Hello all, 



I need to search words on URL which have been indexed. 

For exemple, I have "www.jakarta.org", If I search "jakarta", Lucene won't 
return a result. If I search "www.jakarta*", Lucene returns me the correct 
result. 

How should I proceed to make Lucene to be able to index "jakarta" ? I think 
I can write a Analyser that will break www.jakarta.org in "www", "jakarta" 
and "org" but It won't be the best way. 

Thanks for your help, 

Thomas
