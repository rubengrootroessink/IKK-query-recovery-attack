SUBJECT: Re: newbie question on querying on multiple attributes
DATE: 16 Dec 2008

Hi,

instead of the ClassBridge you can just annotate all the properties you  
want to index with
@Field and build a BooleanQuery out of the input field. Indexing the  
properties into
separate document fields is probably more extendable in the future when  
you for example
only want to search on a subset of the properties.

I recommend you read through the online documentation of Hibernate Search  
and you can also
ask question at the Hibernate Search Forum -  
http://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=9
which is probably a more appropriate then this mailing list.
