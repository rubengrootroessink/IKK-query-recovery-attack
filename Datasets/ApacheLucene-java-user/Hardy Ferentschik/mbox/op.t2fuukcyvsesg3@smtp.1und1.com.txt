SUBJECT: RAMDirectory vs FSDirectory
DATE: 27 Nov 2007

Hi there,

I am using currently a FSDirectory to build my index. The reason for using  
a file system based index is that a full index rebuild takes around 30  
minutes and I want to keep a persistent index.
In 'Lucene in Action' I've read that one can improve search performance by  
using a RAMDirectory created from an underlying FSDirectory using one of  
the parameterised constructors. Is this correct? Will a FSDirectory not  
automatically load the index into memory provided enough RAM is available?  
Do I have to explicitly use a RAMDirectory?
