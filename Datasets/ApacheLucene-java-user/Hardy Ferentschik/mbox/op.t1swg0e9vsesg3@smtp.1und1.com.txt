No doubt. The question is if it matters for this particular use case. For  
this particualt field I will ever only have a simple right hand truncated  
search. The user cannot use span or phrase queries against this field, not  
even explicit AND. I don't think this approach makes much sense when  
indexing a whole block of text. I only want to use it for indexing a  
simple name which at most consits of a few words. I guess what I want to  
do here is comparable to a single column SQL LIKE query, eg SELECT FROM  
COMPANY WHERE COMPANY.NAME LIKE 'M%'. Of course this is only the simple  
case. There are other queries where I combine the name search with other  
fields which are indexed using for example a SnowballAnalyzer.

Great. I will look into it.

Thanks again.
