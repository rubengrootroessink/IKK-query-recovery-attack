SUBJECT: RAM Directory / querying Performance issue
DATE: 26 Apr 2006

I've rewritten the RAM DIR to supprt 64 bit (still havent had time to add this to lucene, hopefully
in the coming months when i have a free second)
   
  My question:
   
  i have a machine with 4 GB RAM
   
  i have a 3GB index file,
   
  i successfully load the 3GB index into memory,
   
  the first few queries run with normal response time,
   
  but very quickly response time becomes unbearably slow (webloading with 1 con user), 
   
  how are queries expanded in memory when run (how much memory do they use up)?
   
  could this be an issue of the queries themselves talking up large chunks of RAM?
