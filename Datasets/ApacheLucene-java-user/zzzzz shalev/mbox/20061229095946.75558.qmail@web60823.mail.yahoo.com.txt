SUBJECT: comparing Ramdirectory to MMap
DATE: 29 Dec 2006

hey all,
   
  i am currently running lucene 1.43, i am loading all relevant searchable data into a ramdir
and storing display data in oracle.
   
  i have read good things about mmap and was wondering about the following:
   
  1. does it require a 'warm up' to achieve sub-second results? if so, what is the behavior
when new queries are requested that have not been cached?
  2. for a 20 million record index (each record contains about 2k data) what would be the
memory requirements in mmap (ram)?
  3. what kind of performance numbers are we looking at (response time)?
   
  much much appreciated..
