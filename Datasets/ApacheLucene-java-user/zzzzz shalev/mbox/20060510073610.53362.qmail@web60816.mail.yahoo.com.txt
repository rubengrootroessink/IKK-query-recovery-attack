SUBJECT: lowering score of doc if synonyms matched (synonyms indexed)
DATE: 10 May 2006

i am currently adding synonyms at index time (and not expanding the query), i fear that there
is a problem with this implementation:
   
  is there a way to lower the score of a document if it was found due to a synonyms match
and not due to a match of the word queried. from what i understand the synonyms are indexed
with the same placement as the original word which may make this impossible?
   
  thanks,
