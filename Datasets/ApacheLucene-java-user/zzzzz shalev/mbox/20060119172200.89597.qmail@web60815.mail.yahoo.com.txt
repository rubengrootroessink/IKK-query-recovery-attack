SUBJECT: data size limitation?
DATE: 19 Jan 2006

hey,
   
  is there a max amount of data (in gigabytes) where lucene's performance starts to deteriorate
   
  i tested with about 2 giga on two instances (2 ram dirs using the parallelmultisearcher)
and performance was great,
   
  however i think i will need to support about 10-15 times as much data (approx. 20-30 giga)
will lucene hold up?
   
  thanks in advance,
