SUBJECT: Re: Can Lucene load more then 2GB into RAM memory?
DATE: 16 Mar 2006

i wrote a patch for this and the difference is unbelievable,
   
  the memory footprint has been cut almost in half and it seems like performance is basically
the same if not better!!!
   
  if anyone is interested let me know

  RAMDirectory is indeed currently limited to 2GB. This would not be too 
hard to fix. Please file a bug report. Better yet, attach a patch.

I assume you're running a 64bit JVM. If so, then MMapDirectory might 
also work well for you.
