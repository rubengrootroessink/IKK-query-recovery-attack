SUBJECT: combining two query calls in one?
DATE: 9 Jun 2006

hey,
   
  i am using the pmsearcher to retrieve data from a number of ram indexes.  i am calling my
own search function which calls the indexsearcher.search meathod and returns the top 100 ids/scores
, however, before returning the topdocs i start a separate thread which requeries the index
and collects ALL the ids/scores and saves them.
   
  my question is, since i already queried the index is there anyway i can send only the topdocs
on the top 100 (as is in the hits class default) but somehow continue retrieving the rest
of the docs without requering? 
   
  thanx in advance...
