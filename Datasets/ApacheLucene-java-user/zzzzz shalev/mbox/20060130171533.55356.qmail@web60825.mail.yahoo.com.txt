DATE: 30 Jan 2006

hey Jim,
  thanks alot for the quick reply! much appreciated
   
  i will look a little closer into what is done in C|Net , seems more cost efficient than
what im currently doing ;)
   
  however i am not sure how scaleable the solution is
   
  if , for example, i recieved 20,000 results and i have 2000 different colors (a possible
scenario in my case)

  We're doing something very similar. Recently C|Net started using Lucene and 
there is a blog entry about how they implemented a "category" scheme that 
basically does what you want.

The idea is to generate a bunch of bitsets where the ordinal bit number is 
based on the document number in the index.

First result set: perform your search. Then generate a bitset called FRSBS 
(full result set bitset).

Next: foreach "word" you want to count generate a bitset (you do this by 
traversing the index directly for each word). Call these bitsets WBS(n) 
(word bit set n. n spans 1..m where m is the total number of words you want 
to count against)

Finally: to get a count per word bit-wise AND each WBS(n) with FRSBS and count 
up the 1s
