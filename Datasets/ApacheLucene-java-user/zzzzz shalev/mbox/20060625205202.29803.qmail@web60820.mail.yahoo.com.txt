SUBJECT: termquery beginners question
DATE: 25 Jun 2006

i apologize in advance for the question.
   
  i am running lucene 1.4.3 (prefer not to use the keywordanalyzer)
   
  i need to mix a user entered query along with a search on keyword indexed fields
   
  how would i search for an exact phrase using a term query on a keyword field while searching
for user entered text on separate 'text' fields
  ideas?
   
  i tried using the mergeBooleanQueries using the query recieved from the queryparser and
a new boolean query containing a termquery, but i must be missing something basic in the lucene
search syntax.
   
  The termquery contains a phrase, and for some reason passing the following boolean query:
   
  .add(new termquery(new term(myfield,"abc defg")) , true , false) along with the query from
the queryparser to the merge function is not returning what i would expect
   
  thanks in advance,
