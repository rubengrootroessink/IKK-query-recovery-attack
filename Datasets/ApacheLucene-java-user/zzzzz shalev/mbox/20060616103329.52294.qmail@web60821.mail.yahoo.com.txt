SUBJECT: reversing porter stemming
DATE: 16 Jun 2006

is it possible to take a stemmed token from as index and run some sort of reverse porter stemming
to get a logical word, the problem is that porter stemming is very aggressive, for example:
people is indexed as peopl , so basically my quesion is
   
  if i have peoples , people, both indexed as peopl, is there a way to go from peopl ->
people (retrieving the root word would be fine)
   
  thanks
