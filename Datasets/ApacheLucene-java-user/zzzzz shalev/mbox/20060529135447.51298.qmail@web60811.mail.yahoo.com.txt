SUBJECT: fastest way to get raw hit count
DATE: 29 May 2006

hi all,
   
  is there a faster way to retrieve ONLY the count of results for a query?
   
  lucene ranks (scores) the first batch of docs and sorts them by rank, this is functionality
i dont need in certain queries and i assume, not doing this can return the count faster then
the hits.length()
   
  any ideas???
   
  thanks,,,
