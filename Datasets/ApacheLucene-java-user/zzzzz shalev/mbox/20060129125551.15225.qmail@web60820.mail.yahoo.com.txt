SUBJECT: grouping results by fields
DATE: 29 Jan 2006

hey,
   
  i have a bit of a complex problem,
  i need to group results recieved in a result set,
  for example:
   
  my result set returns 10,000 results
   
  there are about 10 fields in each result document
   
  i need to group the most frequent values appearing in each field.
   
  if 1 of my fields is named color: then i want the 20 most frequent colors in the 10,000
results,,, 
   
  blue - occurs 1302 times
  red  - occurs  200 times
   
  and so on....
   
  any ideas will be unbelievably appreciated,
   
  thanx
