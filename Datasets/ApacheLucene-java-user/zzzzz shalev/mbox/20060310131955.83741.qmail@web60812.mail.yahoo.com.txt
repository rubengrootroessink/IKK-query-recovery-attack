SUBJECT: Can Lucene load more then 2GB into RAM memory?
DATE: 10 Mar 2006

this is in continuation of a previous email i sent
   
  i have a 6gb index containing over 12 million terms.
   
  looking at the Lucene code RAMDirectory.java
   
  i see an int cast of the index file size, meaning there is a 2GB limit
   
  did i miss something?
   
  has anyone loaded more then a single 2GB index into RAM ??????
   
  thanks,
