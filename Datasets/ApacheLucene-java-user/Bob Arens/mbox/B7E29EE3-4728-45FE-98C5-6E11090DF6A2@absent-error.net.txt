I'd want both clauses, so I'd have to write a Parser to make sure  
queries would get split up into the two different indices, right?  
Something to take "contents:germany title:medicine", send the  
"contents:germany" query to the IndexSearcher operating over the  
existing index, and the "title:medicine" query to the IndexSearcher  
operating over my new index. The Searchers get their results, I  
return the fileIDs in both.

Or is that just nuts?
