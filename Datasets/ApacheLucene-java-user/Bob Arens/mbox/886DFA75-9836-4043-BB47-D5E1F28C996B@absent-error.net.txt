True - it would be like using Lucene as a thin relational DB.  
However, I don't want to just be able to associate the new fields  
with the old, I also want to be able to search over them.

Right now, I'm thinking of rolling a custom MultiSearcher that  
operates over two indices containing identical fileIDs, and returns  
the set intersection of fileIDs returned from their respective  
searches; i.e. a search for "contents:germany title:medicine" would  
get the fileIDs containing "germany" in the contents index, the  
fileIDs containing "medicine" in the new index, find the fileIDs in  
both sets of hits, and return them.
