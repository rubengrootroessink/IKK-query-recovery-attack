SUBJECT: Re: How to speed-up index opening
DATE: 31 Aug 2007

	From what I have seen in the patch, It re-opens the segments tha  
have changed.

	So Imagine I always change the biggest sement (because that's where  
most docs are and i need to update them frequently) . Will there  
still be a benefit of IndexReader.reopen()?
