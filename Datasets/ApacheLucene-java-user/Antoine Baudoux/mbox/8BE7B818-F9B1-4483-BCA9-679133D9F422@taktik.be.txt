SUBJECT: How to speed-up index opening
DATE: 29 Aug 2007

	Hello,

	I have an application with a 2GB index. A lot of documents (up to  
10.000 per day) are added/deleted to this index.

My customer would like to have a Maximum of 7 minutes delay between a  
media added to the system and its searchability through the index.

So each 7 minutes or so i have to re-open the index.

My index takes 1.5 minute to open. Its a long time compared to the 7  
minutes.

What are the key parameters influencing the opening time?

Is it proportional to the number of documents? to the number of  
distinct terms? If i reduce the number of terms will it load faster?

Is there another way to improve index opening speed?


thanks!

Antoine
