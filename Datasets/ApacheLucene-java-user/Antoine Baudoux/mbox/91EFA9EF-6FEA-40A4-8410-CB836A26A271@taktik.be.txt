SUBJECT: Re: How to rename fields in an index
DATE: 22 Aug 2007

Re-indexing would take a lot of time.


In fact I need this change just for the Query parser class, to be  
able to make queries such as kw:blah. Now my field is called  
"org.mycompany.mediafield.keyword". Not very easy to make queries  
with this field name!


  It would be cool if QueryParser had some sort of field name  
aliasing functionality, so that kw:blah is automatically translated  
into  org.mycompany.mediafield.keyword:blah
