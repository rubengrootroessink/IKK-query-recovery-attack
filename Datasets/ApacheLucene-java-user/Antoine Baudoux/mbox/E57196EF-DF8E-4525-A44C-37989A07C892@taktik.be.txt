SUBJECT: IndexModifier delete() + add() vs IndexWriter update()
DATE: 22 Sep 2007

Hello everyone,


	I noticed that when updating a large index with IndexModifier (lots  
of delete+add), the bottlenek was the delete. If I only add, speed is  
at least multiplied by 50.
	From what i have understood, its because a new IndexReader is  
initialized for each delete.

	Is the new updateDocument() method from IndexWriter optimized for  
this kind of problem?


	Thanks!
