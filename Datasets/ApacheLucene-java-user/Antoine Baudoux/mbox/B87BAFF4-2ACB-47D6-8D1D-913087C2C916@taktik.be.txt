Unfortunately that's not the case : I also want more recent documents  
to come first, so as i said in my original post the scoring is a mix  
(ponderated sum) between document date and collection scores.

This comes from a real-world requirement from my client : He wants  
the photos from his favorite collections to come first, but at the  
same times he wants the most recent images to come first.

If only the Collection score mattered it would be simple.
