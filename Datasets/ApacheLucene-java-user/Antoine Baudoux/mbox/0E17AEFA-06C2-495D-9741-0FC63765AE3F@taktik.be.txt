SUBJECT: Maximum index size
DATE: 27 Aug 2007

	Hello,

	I'm indexing 2,5 millions docs.

	I already have added 1,2 millions docs to the index and the indexing  
speed becomes quite slow.

	my index directory is 1GB .

	Is there a limit to the indexing size?

	Is the indexing slow when the number of terms are big?
