Hi,

I am working with the lucene demo and would like to compile the demo so that
I may eventually modify it for my own use. I am using the source from
lucene-demos-1.2-rc4.jar.zip.

However, the HTMLParser class had the filename HTMLParser.jj and won't
compile.
I changed the name to HTMLParser.java, still the same problem.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Neal
