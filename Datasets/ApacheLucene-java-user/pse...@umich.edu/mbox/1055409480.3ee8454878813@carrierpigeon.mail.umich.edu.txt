hey,

I am trying to index a *.htm file but i keep getting

Parse Aborted: Encountered "\"" at line 69, column 8.
Was expecting one of:
    <ArgName> ...
    "=" ...
    <TagEnd> ...

There were a few posts about this problem a few months back.I was wondering if
anyone found a solution to this problem specially if they found a way to change
the .jj file and not use a new parser.

Thanks,
P
