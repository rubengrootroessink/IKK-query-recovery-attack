SUBJECT: Problem running 1.3demo
DATE: 5 Jun 2003

I downloaded version 1.3 yesterday and was trying to run the demo.However i keep
getting the message


Query: lucene
Searching for: lucene
 caught a class java.lang.NullPointerException
 with message: null

Then i downloaded the version 1.2 and that works absolutely fine.
I was wondering if there is something wrong with ver1.3 and if i should keep
using it and also if someoone can tell me if i'm going wrong while running the
demo1.3.
