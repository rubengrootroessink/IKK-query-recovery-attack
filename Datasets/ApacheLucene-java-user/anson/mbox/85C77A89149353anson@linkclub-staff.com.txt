SUBJECT: How to update index dynamically
DATE: 9 Apr 2007


I have build a blog project under tomcat5.5 with Lucene2.0.
And I want to search my blog by full text, but there is somthing wrong:

----------------------------------------------
The project flow:

(1) On tomcat start I wrote a listener to create a index file if the 
index is never created.(It's works well)


(2) When I create/update/delete an article on the blog, I wrote a method 
to update the index.(It's also works well)

(3) Then I want to search the new/updated article in the front of my 
blog page. But I can't get the new article. But when I restart the 
tomcat, I can get the new one that I want. Why. 


-----------------------------------------------
The index update flow:

(1) Firsrt I delete the old document in index:

IndexReader reader = 
    IndexReader.open($INDEX_DIRECTORY);

Term term = new Term("INDEX_ID", $entryId);

if (term != null) {
    reader.deleteDocuments(term);
}

//finally:
reader.close();
    
    
(2) Add the article to the index:
// Get the singleton IndexWriter instance
IndexWriter writer = 
    IndexManager.getInstance().getIndexWriter();
    
// add document
// Document() is method of make Lucene document
writer.addDocument(Document($EntryBean));

writer.optimize();


// finally:
writer.close();


Could anybody tell me anything can help me out. Or I made a wrong flow?


Best regards.
