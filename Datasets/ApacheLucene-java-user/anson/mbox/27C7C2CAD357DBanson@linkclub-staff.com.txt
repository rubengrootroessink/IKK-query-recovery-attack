SUBJECT: How to use "point-in-time" feature
DATE: 10 Jul 2007


Hi,

I saw the new feature "point-in-time" on Lucene2.2.
If I upgrade my web-app from Lucene2.0 to Lucene2.2, I want to do that 
my web-app can access the INDEX over NFS , so what should I do to change 
my old web-app.

Could anyone show me some samples or your opinions.
(i.e. what difference on making index, searching between Lucene2.0 and 
Lucene2.2)

Best regards
Anson
