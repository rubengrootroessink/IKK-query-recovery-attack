SUBJECT: Using lucene in a clustered app server
DATE: 9 Jun 2009

I am trying to figure out the best way to add to a lucene index across a clustered app server.
 I cannot grab an IndexWriter for each node in the cluster, because I would run into lock
file problems.  I am not sure if I can share one IndexWriter across the cluster because what
happens when two or more nodes update the same thing.  Anyone have any insight?

Thanks.
