SUBJECT: Debugging file lock problem
DATE: 5 Jun 2009

I am having a problem where I am getting lock timeouts when trying to write to my index file.
 It would be nice if I could turn on logging to see which server/application has the lock
and when.  Is there a way to see the lock information without changing code?

Thanks,
Billy
