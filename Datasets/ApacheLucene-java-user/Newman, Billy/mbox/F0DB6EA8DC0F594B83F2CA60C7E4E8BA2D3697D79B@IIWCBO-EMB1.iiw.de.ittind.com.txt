SUBJECT: IndexWriter update method
DATE: 17 Apr 2009

I am looking for info on how to use the IndexWriter.update method.  A short example of how
to add a document and then later update would be very helpful.  I get lost because I can add
a document with just the document, but I need a document and a Term.  I am not really sure
what a Term is since I did not use a Term to create the document nor do I see it in any of
the examples of searching/adding.

Thanks,
Billy
