SUBJECT: NativeFSLockFactory still leaving lock files around on abnormal termination
DATE: 18 Apr 2009

So I have recently switched to using NativeFSLockFactory so that when my jboss instance is
shutdown or comes down abnormally it does not leave lock files around.  My problem is that
it is not working.

I have put in debug to be sure that I am really using NativeFSLockFactory.  I have tested
this on XP, Solaris 10, and RedHat 4 with the same results.  I have also just wrote a quick
test program that obtains a lock then loops forever.  I kill the program and once again the
lock file is being left around.  Anyone run into this before?  Am I doing something wrong?

I am using version 2.4.1.

Thanks,
Billy
