SUBJECT: Waiting for lock file problem
DATE: 15 May 2009

I am trying to build my indices file while still allowing my application to add new information
and I my application cannot obtain the lock.

Here is a little pseudo code on what I am trying to do:

Build Indicies:

1.       For each element (i.e. I have n elements I want to add to the index)

2.       Create IndexWriter (this gets the lock)

3.       Add document

4.       Optimize IndexWriter

5.       Close IndexWriter

Application

1.       Application submits one new element

2.       Create IndexWriter (this gets the lock)

3.       Add document

4.       Optimize IndexWriter

5.       Close IndexWriter

So again my problem is that the application cannot get the lock file while I am building the
index file.  I am sure that the writer in the build indices loop is closed after each element
is added therefore releasing the lock.  I have set the WRITE_LOCK_TIMEOUT to 10 seconds. 
I can see the build indices process close the writer many times over those 10 seconds, but
I see the application wait 10 seconds and timeout with a lock timeout exception.  The loop
in the build indices process is running very fast but I would guess that when the application
asks for the lock it should be able to see the lock free (even for just a short amount of
time) because it should be next in line.   Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here,
or is this a problem with the way lucene locks.

Thanks,
Billy
