SUBJECT: Too many files open issue
DATE: 12 Jun 2009

I know this has been covered a number of time before but I am still confused.

I am using all the default values for IndexWriter when writing my index.

I loop over all my documents 1000 at a time.  For each 1000 I open an index writer, write
each document, optimize the index, then close the index writer.  The problems comes about
in the second 1000.  Somewhere in writing the second 1000 I start to get a Too many files
open exception.  What I don't understand is why I can write the first 1000 with no problem,
optimize and close the writer and then have a problem the next time around.

As an aside I am running redhat and I run 'limit descriptor' and see that it is set to 1024.
 Anyone have any idea if this is to low or if there is a recommended value?

Thanks.
