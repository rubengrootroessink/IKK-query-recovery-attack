SUBJECT: Indexing domain names?
DATE: 8 Nov 2009

Hi,

How do I go about indexing domain names? I currently index the domain, but
it only works if I put the exact full domain in. For example:

site:www.youtube.com (this works)
site:youtube.com (this doesn't work)

I am using the StandardAnalyzer as most of the other fields being indexed
are free form text. Currently the "site" field is stored and tokenized.

As an additional improvement it would be even better if something like this
worked:

site:youtube.com/foo

Cheers,
Chris
