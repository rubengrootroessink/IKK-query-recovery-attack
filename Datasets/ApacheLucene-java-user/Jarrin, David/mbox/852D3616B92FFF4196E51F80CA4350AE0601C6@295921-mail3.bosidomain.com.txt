Paul,

Thanks for the quick reply. Sorry I was vague in my message. We are considering using Lucene
in a commercial product that we sell and as we do with other third-party products we want
to make sure that we have timely (i.e. priority) access to technical support that can help
us resolve issues we might encounter within Lucene itself. 
I will look into LucidImagination and see what they offer.
Thanks again for you kind response,

-David.

David,

I'm sure that if you request something more precise you might get enthusiasts over here easily.
I heard several committers of Lucene have gone into LucidImagination and they offer paid services
specialized for Lucene.

hope it helps.
