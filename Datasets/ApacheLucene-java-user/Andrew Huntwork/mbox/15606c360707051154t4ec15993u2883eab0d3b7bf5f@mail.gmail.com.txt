SUBJECT: making hudson available on port 80
DATE: 5 Jul 2007

Are there any plans to make the hudson instance that hosts the apidocs
available on port 80?  My company has an traffic filter for various
reasons and port 8080 is not on the approved list of ports, so I'm
unable to see the apidocs or anything else in
lucene.zones.apache.org:8080.

thanks.
