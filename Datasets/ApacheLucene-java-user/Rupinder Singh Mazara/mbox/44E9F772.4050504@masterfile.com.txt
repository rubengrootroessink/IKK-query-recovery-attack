SUBJECT: searching for keywords
DATE: 21 Aug 2006

hi all

  I need to be able to index and search for documents based on keywords 
that are attached to a document.

  Some of the keywords have white spaces in them like "red hat"  or 
"place of worship" ,

  I need to able to search for FULLTEXT:"red hat" AND KEYWORD:"red hat" 
 

  For indexing purposes I was able to construct a NullTokenizer based on 
the lucene mailling lists but the query parse seems to intent on 
splitting any search term. Apart from writing my own parser is there any 
way so as not to get FULLTEXT:red FULLTEXT:hat AND KEYWORD:red KEYWORD:hat

thanks
