 i think the core problem in your case is the use of compound files, i would
be best to switch it off
 or alternatively issue a optimize as soon as the indexing is over.

  i am copying the file contents between <file> tags, the patch is to be
applied on TermInfosReader.java, this
 was done to help out of memory exceptions while doing indexing

 however tomcat does react in strange ways to to-many open files,
 try to restrict the number of IndexReader or Searchable objects
  that you create while  doing searches,
I  usually keep one object to handle all my user requests

 public static Searcher fetchCitationSearcher(HttpServletRequest request)
throws Exception {
        Searcher rval = (Searcher)
request.getSession().getServletContext().getAttribute(
                "luceneSearchable");
        if (rval == null) {
          rval = new IndexSearcher( fetchCitationReader(request) );

request.getSession().getServletContext().setAttribute("luceneSearchable",
rval);
        }
        return rval;
    }
