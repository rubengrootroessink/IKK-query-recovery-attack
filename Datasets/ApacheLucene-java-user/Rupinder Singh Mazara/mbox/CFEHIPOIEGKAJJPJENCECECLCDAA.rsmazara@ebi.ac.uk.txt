Hi all

  my dataset also seems to have a similar problem the chemical name
alpha-androstane-3, and several others exsists
  in the given text, can anyone point out what is the best stratergy to
employ so as to index
  words containing - _ +  to be indexed as they are and not face being
mutilated ?


  currently on my indexes the StandardAnalyzer and QueryParser  break up
alpha-androstane-3
  into TEXT:alpha -TEXT:androstane -TEXT:3 , where TEXT is the Field to be
searched

  If a enclose alpha-androstane-3 as a phrase "alpha-androstane-3" then the
QueryParser
breaks is down to ABSTRACT:"alpha androstane-3"  , some how the first "-"
disapears  ?


 regards

 Rupinder
