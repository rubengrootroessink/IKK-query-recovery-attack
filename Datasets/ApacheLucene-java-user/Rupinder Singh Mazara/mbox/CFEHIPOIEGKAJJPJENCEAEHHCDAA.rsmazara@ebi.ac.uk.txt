SUBJECT: RE: leakage in RAMDirectory ?
DATE: 7 Oct 2004

Hi 

 the major issue is that when using FSDirectory and indexing to a directory there are no missing
enteries
  where as when indexed using RAMDirectory i get missing enteries 

   currently i am investigating which are the missing enteries, since the application is configures
to shutdown in 
  the event of Exception either all get indexed or none
