Hi Erik

 I think the best solutuion is to have a NullAnalayzer class that
 allows a simple pass through

 The query parser then can be passed with a PerFieldAnalayzer that knows
 when to select NullAnalayzer or some other  based on the Field:"data... "
Field2:"pp"
format  this is something that the query parser is already geared up to do

regards

 Rupinder
