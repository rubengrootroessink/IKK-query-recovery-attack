SUBJECT: boolean/set operations  on lucene queries
DATE: 18 Nov 2004

hi all

 I needed some help in solving the following problem
 a user executes query1 and query2

 both the queries( not result sets ) get stored, over time the user
 wants to find
 which documents from query1 are common to documents in query2 , basicall a
intersect of the results of query1 with query2


 and similarly the union and difference between the results of query1 and
query2

 without having to run the queries and storing the results into some kind of
datastructure
 does lucene provide some capabilities, i was reading about QueryFilter,
does anyone have
 experience with a simialar example


 thanks

 Rupinder
