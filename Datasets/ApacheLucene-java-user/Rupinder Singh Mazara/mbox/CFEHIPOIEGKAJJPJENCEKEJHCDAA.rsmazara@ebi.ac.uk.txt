hi all 

  I want to be able to draw a venn diagramm or something similar that shows
  how results of different queries overlapp.
  the idea is to draw a diagramm using applets or gif's or the like 
   which shows how  different results match, 

   gratefull for any help in this matter 

   Rupinder
