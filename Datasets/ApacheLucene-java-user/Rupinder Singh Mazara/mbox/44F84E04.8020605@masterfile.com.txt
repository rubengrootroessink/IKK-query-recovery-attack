hi all

    the search implementation that i have requires not the top 1000 
documents but the lowest 1000 documents to be returned

       I donot want to store the entire result set in memory and go to 
the last 1000 , is there any implementation / suggestions on how to 
achieve this


  thanks

 rupinder
