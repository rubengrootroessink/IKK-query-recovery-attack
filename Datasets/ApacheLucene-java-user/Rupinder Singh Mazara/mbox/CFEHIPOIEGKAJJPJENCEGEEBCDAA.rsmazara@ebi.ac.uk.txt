hi all

   purely due to a policy decision, we would like to host our lucene search
application , in a j2ee container, preferable by means of a ejb.
Since access to java.io is restricted by the ejb specification, what would
be the best way to create desgin the application ?
  i have taken a look at ejindex@sf.net but it my relies on mbeans and not a
session bean
  does any one have pointers or samples that can be looked at
