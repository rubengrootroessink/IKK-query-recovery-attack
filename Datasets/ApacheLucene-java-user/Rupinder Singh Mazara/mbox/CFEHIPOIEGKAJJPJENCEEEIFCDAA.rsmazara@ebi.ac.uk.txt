SUBJECT: RE: QueryParsing
DATE: 19 Oct 2004

hi erik and everyone else

 ok i will buy the book ;)
but this still does not solve the problem of
 why String x = "\"jakarta apache\"~100"; is being transalted as a
PhraseQuery
      FULL_TEXT:"jakarta apache"~100

 is the correct query beining formed ?  or is there something wrong with the
 Proximity Search topic in the URL
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html


 Regards

 Rupinder
