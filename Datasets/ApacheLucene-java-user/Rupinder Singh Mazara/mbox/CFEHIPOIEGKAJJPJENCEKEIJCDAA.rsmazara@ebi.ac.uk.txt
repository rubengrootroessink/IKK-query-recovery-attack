SUBJECT: RE: Null or no analyzer
DATE: 20 Oct 2004

hi

the basic problem here is that there  are data source which contain
a) id, b) text c) title d) authors AND  d) subject heading

text, title and authors need to be tokenized

the subject heading can be one or more words,
anyone searching such datasource is expected to know the subject headings ,
if the user is trying to find all articles that have the phrases
"Jhon Kerry" and "Goerge Bush" as well as that are classified as "Election
2004"
it is possible that there are other documents that are classified as "Nation
Service Records"
or "Tax Returns" etc...

so the object is to find documents that have the above mentioned phrases as
well as one one
of the subject classifiers, so as to pull out the most meaning full
documents

the subject classifiers pretain to domain knowledge, and it is possible that
2 or more
subject classification headings are composed of the same set of words, but
the sequence
in which they appear can drastically alter the meaning hence tokenizing the
subject field
is not exactly a healthy solution.

also such search tools are meant for people who know / understand  this
classification system
Taxonomy of animals can be taken as one such example,

hope this helps define the problem
