If the term begins with * then could you expand it into a set of 36 
terms eg a*.ext b*.ext ... z*.ext 0*.ext

No idea how this would compare to the other alternatives for speed. But 
it would be simple to code and would not increase index size.

Of course if filenames can use unicode character sets then you have a 
problem. At that point you would need to do a check of what all the 
first characters are to know what terms to use (ie only create a tewrm 
for each character that is used as the 1st character of a filename).

HTH
