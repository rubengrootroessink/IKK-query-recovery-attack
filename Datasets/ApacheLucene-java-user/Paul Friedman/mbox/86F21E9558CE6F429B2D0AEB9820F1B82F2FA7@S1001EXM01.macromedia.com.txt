SUBJECT: RE: What punctuation is "legal" in a query?
DATE: 27 Nov 2001

Thanks for the suggestion.  I was not aware that QueryParser was just a convenience class,
I thought it was the recommended way of generating a Query from a user defined query string.
 Since I have never used the query classes directly, I have a couple of questions:

1. Do I just parse the query string myself (possibly using my own query syntax) then generate
the appropriate query classes and add them to a BooleanQuery?

2. If I added the documents to the index using the StandardAnalyzer, how do I make sure that
the terms contained in the query object that I created are "analyzed" properly, when I use
QueryParser I just pass in the same StandardAnalyzer and it takes care of it for me?

Thanks.
Paul Friedman

You are of course correct that the syntax should be documented, and
I'm sure in time, it will.  We've added individual elements (some at
your request), and I agree that it should be more tolerant (I'm more
used to writing parsers for compilers than for user-level tools.

Bear in mind that the query parser is a convenience, which gives you
an 80% solution for 20% of the work.  If you've got specific
requirements, maybe you should use the query classes directly?
