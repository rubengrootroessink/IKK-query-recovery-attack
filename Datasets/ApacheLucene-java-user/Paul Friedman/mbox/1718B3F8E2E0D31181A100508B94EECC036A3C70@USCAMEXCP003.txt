SUBJECT: Do range queries work?
DATE: 1 Nov 2001

Is range searching working in RC2?

I have the following documents in my index (using StandardAnalyzer):

id:doc1
age:30
FirstName:John

id:doc2
age:40
FirstName:Wendy

The following queries do not return the expected results (using QueryParser
with StandardAnalyzer):

"age:[20-35]" finds 2 documents, should find 1
"age:[35-50]" finds 2 documents, should find 1

"FirstName:[a-k]" finds 0 documents, should find 1
"FirstName:[u-z]" finds 0 documents, should find 1
"FirstName:[adam-larry]" finds 0 documents, should find 1

Thanks.
