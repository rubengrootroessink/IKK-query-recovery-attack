I don't think so (some other punctuation fails too, such as '#').  It's seems pretty random
which punctuation is allowed and which causes an error, for instance, '.' and '_' work fine.
 Is there any rule for this?  What characters are / are not valid using the StandardAnalyzer?
 It seems to me that queries containing punctuation should be valid.

I look forward to a response when I return from vacation.  I included the user list on my
response in case others have opinions or suggestions. 

Thanks for your help.
Paul

However, now queries containing "/" throw the same error.

Did they before?
