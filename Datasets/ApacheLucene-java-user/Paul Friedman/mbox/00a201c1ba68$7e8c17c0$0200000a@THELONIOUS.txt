SUBJECT: Indexing Dynamically Generated Web Pages
DATE: 20 Feb 2002

Hello Lucene Users,

I am a novice developer researching Lucene for use on a web site that
primarily uses JSPs.

How do you index dynamically generated web pages with Lucene?
Or is it even possible?

The JSPs themselves don't have searchable data, only methods to get that
data.
When parsing these files for indexing, the necessary data for the search
would not yet be in the page.
The data upon which to search is generated only after certain parameters are
passed to the JSP ( resulting in the HTML output ).

Thanks in advance.

pax et bonum. p.
