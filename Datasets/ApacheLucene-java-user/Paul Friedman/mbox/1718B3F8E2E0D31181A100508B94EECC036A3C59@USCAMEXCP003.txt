SUBJECT: Prefix query case sensitive?
DATE: 29 Oct 2001

I am using the StandardAnalyzer for both indexing and QueryParser.  If I
index the following text:  "Massachusetts"
 
The following query finds the document: "mass*"
 
But if I use this query then the document is not found: "Mass*"
 
Is this the expected behavior or am I doing something wrong?
 
Also, what is the difference between a prefix query and wildcard query?
What is the query syntax for a wildcard query?  Does the StandardAnalyzer
support WildcardQuery?
 
Note:  I'm using Lucene 1.2 RC2
 
Thanks.
Paul Friedman
