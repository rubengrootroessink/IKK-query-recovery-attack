SUBJECT: Stopping Duplicates
DATE: 17 Sep 2005

Hi,

I am storing names in my index, and am currently getting duplicates
back (quite correctly, on Lucene's part), because I am storing:

id     name
1      fred
2      fred

What I want to happen is, if a duplicate name is added to the index, I
only ever want one entity to exist with the name....

What is the best way for me to achieve this?

Thanks

Ben
