Hi luceners I'm looking "Lucene in Action" and proving the examples.
I have some questions:

If I have to index and I'm using MultiSearcher to search in my index, what I
have to do for every search?
Do I have a new Multisearcher for every search petition or Can I conserve my
Multisearcher object for every search petition (until I use IndexWriter to
add or del some documents in my index)?

What's the better option to do?

Thks in advance.
PD: It looks a powerfull tool.
