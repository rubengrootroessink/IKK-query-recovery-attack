My lucene version is 1.4.3 and always worked with this. Someday I have to do
the change to Lucene 2.0. But the problem isn't this because the problem is
something like One index have something indexed and other index is olnly
created but without any document.
It's very strange because this problem doesn't appear if I close my
aplication and restart it doing no rebuild, the problem doesn't exist.
