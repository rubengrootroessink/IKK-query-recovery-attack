SUBJECT: Re: Question about special characters
DATE: 25 May 2006

My own solution until I have another one better, I use FuzzyQuery for every
term in the phrase.
For example "My work is the worst" ->> My~ work~ is~ the~ worst
What do you think about this uggly solution? I don't have anything more
ideas.
