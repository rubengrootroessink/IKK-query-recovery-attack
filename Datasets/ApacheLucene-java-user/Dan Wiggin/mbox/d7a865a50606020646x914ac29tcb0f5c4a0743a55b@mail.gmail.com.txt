SUBJECT: Integrity of Lucene
DATE: 2 Jun 2006

I read about concurrency in Lucene but I'm not sure to understand well.
I can't do operations of delete and add simultaniouslly.If I've a writer
that I'm using to add new docs, I can't delete anything in Lucene index
until I close my opened writer. Or perhaps Did not close my writer?
Everytime that I do any add or delete elements in my Index I don't have to
close my searcher and reopen to update this.

Anyone can tell me how to know at startup of my application if my index is
corrupted and what to do?

thks to all.
