SUBJECT: Multisearch Problem
DATE: 8 Jun 2006

Hello everybody I have a new problem that I want share with you :D

The problem is doing a search in a Multisearcher.
Normally this multisearcher works well. When I start my tomcat and my two
index are empties, and if I do a search wtih this index I have no exception
and obviusly no hits, but after I do a reindex of an Index and I do a search
I obtain the next pretty message :

19:49:11,327 [ERROR] SearchResults::creacio:202 - [ERROR Indexation ]
SearchResults problem iterating hits
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1
        at org.apache.lucene.index.MultiReader.document(MultiReader.java
:108)
        at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.doc(IndexSearcher.java:74)
        at org.apache.lucene.search.MultiSearcher.doc(MultiSearcher.java:66)
        at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.doc(Hits.java:101)


It's very strange because before it, I do a hits.length and tell me that I
have some results, the problem I think it is when I'm working with all hits
(iterating) . And this problem doesn't appear when the other index is
indexed.
Anyone have any Idea what I can do?
thks for reply all my questions, It's a good tool but I have some problems.
