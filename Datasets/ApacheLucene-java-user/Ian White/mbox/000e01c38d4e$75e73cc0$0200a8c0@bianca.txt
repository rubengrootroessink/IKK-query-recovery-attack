SUBJECT: Announcing a new integration of Lucene
DATE: 8 Oct 2003


 
BroadVision tell me this is far better than their 2 attempts at using
Lucene.
Now there is absolutely no reason for any BroadVision site not to have a
pretty damn good search facility.
 
I know you guys are probably not interested in BroadVision, but it shows
how you can really make a difference with Open Source.
