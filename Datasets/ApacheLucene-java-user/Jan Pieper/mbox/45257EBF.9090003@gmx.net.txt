SUBJECT: Problem with Field.Text()
DATE: 5 Oct 2006

I hope now I am in the right mailinglist. In the -dev mailinglist Steven
Parkes said, that I have to change this:

 > Field.Text(String, String);

to

 > Field.Text(String, String, Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED);

But it seems that there isnt such a method declaration. Where is the 
mistake?
