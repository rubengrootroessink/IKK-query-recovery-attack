Hi there,

also a little comment from me about the toppic.

I am using OpenOffice what produces the best HTML results for me.

If you only want to index the documents this might be overhead except
you have no other idea how to waste the performance of your machine.

In case someone is interested: You can start OpenOffice as 
server (e.g. soffice -headless "-accept=socket,port=8100;urp;") and then
use the Java Uno Binding API to access that OpenOffice server.

Regards 
  JÃ¶rg
