This should solve most of my heartache.
Whats the suggested way to use this ? Copy a solr jar ? Or just copy
the code for this 1 query ?

Are there plans to move this into lucene core ? (or contrib area?)

There are a lot of good utils in Solr which I (and I guess most people
building a search) would want.


Are there plans to move the utils like   DisjunctionMaxQueryParser,
SynonymFilter, etc back into lucene, or would it be simpler for
someone using java 1.5 to start using solr straight away.

Are there any issues if I do decide to move to solr that I should be
aware of ? (I am using lucene 2.0 as of now)

Thanks a ton,
mek.
