SUBJECT: Question about Search formula
DATE: 11 Jan 2008


Hi,

When I am searching with lucene, the formula takes care of the number of
total words in the document.

For exemple, an indexed one power-point slide with the term "JAVA" is most
relevent than a 50 pages Word document on JAVA.

It is a problem for me, the Word document on Java should be most relevant
than the only one ppt slide... 

Is there something that I can do ?

Thanks a lot,

Fab
