SUBJECT: Getting score of explicit documents for a query
DATE: 3 Dec 2009

Hi,

Given a query, is there a way to learn score of some specific documents in
the index against this query? I don't want to make a global search in the
index and rank and sort all the matching documents. What I want to do is
learn the rank of a bunch of documents in the index that I can identify by
document id..
