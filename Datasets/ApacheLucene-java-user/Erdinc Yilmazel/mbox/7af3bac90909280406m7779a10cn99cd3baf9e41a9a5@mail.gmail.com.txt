Sorry if this is a stupid question. I want my index to contain terms that
are at least 4 characters long. So I wrote a simple analyzer and  applied
the LengthFilter. When I open the index and get a TermEnum from the
directory, I can still see terms that are less than 4 characters... What do
you think is wrong? I am using lucene 2.9.0.
The analyzer code:

   @Override
   public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
      StandardTokenizer tokenStream = new StandardTokenizer(reader, true);
      TokenStream result = new StandardFilter(tokenStream);
      result = new LengthFilter(result, 4, 20);
      result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);
      result = new StopFilter(false, result, stopSet);
      return result;
   }
