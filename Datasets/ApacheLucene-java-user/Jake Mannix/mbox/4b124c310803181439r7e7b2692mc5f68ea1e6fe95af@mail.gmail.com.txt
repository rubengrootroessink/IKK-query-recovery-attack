Ah, thanks.  So since solr-1.2.0 is using
lucene-*-2007-05-20_00_04-53.jarin its distribution,
is this why SOLR-261 is still open?

I thought that maybe it would be a simple drop in replacement, but when I
tossed in
lucene-*-2.3.1.jar to solr, it didn't fix the problem, so maybe something in
solr needs to
change to take advantage of your patch...
