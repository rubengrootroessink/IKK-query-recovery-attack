Did I do that wrong?  I always mess up the AND/OR human-readable form
of this - it's clearer when you use +/- unary operators instead:

query: "San Francisco" "California" +("John Smith" "John Smith
Manufacturing")

Here the San Fran and CA clauses are optional, and the ("John Smith" OR
"John Smith Manufacturing") is required.
