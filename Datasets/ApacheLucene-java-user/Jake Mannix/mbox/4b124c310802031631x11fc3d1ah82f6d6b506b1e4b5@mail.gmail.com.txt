SUBJECT: Re: Indexing Speed: 2.3 vs 2.2 (real world numbers)
DATE: 4 Feb 2008

Yeah, I should have mentioned - this was merely with a jar replacement, we
haven't gotten around to doing fun 2.3-related stuff like making sure our
domain-specific tokenizers use the next(Token), as well as making sure set
all of our buffersizes by RAM used.

We tried multithreading the process, as we have a multi-core, multi-disk
architecture, but for some reason we never saw more than 99% (of one core)
cpu usage during indexing, as if some internal synchronization was getting
hit... I should try it again through the profiler and see if I can pinpoint
where it was getting tripped up.   On the other hand, I'm not sure if we
*need* faster than 26 minute indexing, so once we're sure we can move up to
2.3 for production, that may just solve our indexing perf issues.

Now if I can just figure out how to speed up our query performance too, I'll
be in an even *better* mood. :)
