DATE: 15 Feb 2008

What the other posters are referring to is that you will have to
probably write some java code to do lucene indexing:  you can get
access to your model objects (with all their dependent data) in java.
- since you are using hibernate, this shouild be easy- then create
lucene documents from your model objects and index!   These documents
would be searchable in the way you want.

You will probably have to do some reading on how to write lucene
indexing code.
