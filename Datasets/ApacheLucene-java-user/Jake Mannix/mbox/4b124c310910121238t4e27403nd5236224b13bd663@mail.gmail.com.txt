So maybe since it's an "expert" feature, this is ok, but if users are used
to using
isCurrent() on their reader instances, this seems like it might get
confusing, since
now some readers are even more current than current, and in fact the NRT
readers may be current w.r.t. the most recent commit, but calling reopen()
on
them will actually still make them more current, in that they now get a view
on even more recent uncommitted changes...
