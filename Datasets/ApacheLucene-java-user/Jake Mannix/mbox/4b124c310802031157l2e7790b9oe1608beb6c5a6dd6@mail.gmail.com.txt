SUBJECT: Indexing Speed: 2.3 vs 2.2 (real world numbers)
DATE: 3 Feb 2008

Hello all,
  I know you lucene devs did a lot of work on indexing performance in 2.3,
and I just tested it out last thursday, so I thought I'd let you know how it
fared:

  On a 2.17 million document index, a recent test gave indexing time to be:

    * lucene 2.2: 4.83 hours
    * lucene 2.3: 26 minutes

  About a factor of 11 speedup.  Holy smokes!  Great work folks.
