One thing to be careful about this, which you might already be aware of:
Query (and subclasses) implement Serializable, but doesn't declare a
serialversionUID, and so when you upgrade from lucene 2.4 to 2.9 or even 3.0
to 3.0.1, you can get serialization incompatibilities between your broker
and your leaf nodes if you pass serialized Query objects over RMI (and try
to do a rolling upgrade, one node at a time).  If you pass domain-specific
objects which you control, this doesn't happen, of course.

Not the end of the world, but good to keep in mind.
