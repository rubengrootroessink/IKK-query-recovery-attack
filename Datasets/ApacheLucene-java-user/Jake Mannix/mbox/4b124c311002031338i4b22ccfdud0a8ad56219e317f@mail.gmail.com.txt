The FieldCache *is* tied to readers, but it's tied to the SegmentReaders
which
comprise an IndexReader.  When you call IndexReader.reload() or if you
call IndexWriter.getReader(), you make new SegmentReaders inside of the
outer IndexReader that you are looking at, and only the new ones need to
load up their parts of the FieldCache.  Segments which have already been
read have SegmentReader instances which stick around, and the cache
pieces which are keyed on them stay around as well.
