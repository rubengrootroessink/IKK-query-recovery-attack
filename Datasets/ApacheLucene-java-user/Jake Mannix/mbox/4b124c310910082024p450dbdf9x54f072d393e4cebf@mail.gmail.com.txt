Hi Eric,

  As I mentioned in my response to Jason, we at LinkedIn serve our roughly
50million document profile index on a real-time distributed setup (we're
serving facets in real-time also), serving tens of millions of queries a day
in the 1-10ms latency per node, based on the open source zoie project (built
here at LinkedIn) : http://zoie.googlecode.com

  Zoie doesn't handle the distributed part of the setup, it's just the
real-time side.  Distribution is done pretty straitgtforwardly in our case
though: N shards each getting a different contiguous slice of the user base,
each replicated K times, and all N*K nodes get indexing events distributed
by a message queue independently.

  If you have any questions about zoie, let me know.  The documentation
could get filled in a little further, and it doesn't touch on distributed
side of things, so feel free to ping me.
