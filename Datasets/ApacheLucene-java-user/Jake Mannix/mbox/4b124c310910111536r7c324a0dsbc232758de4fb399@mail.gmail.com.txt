Hey Eric,

  One clarification before letting the rest of this discussion sneak over to
the zoie list:

With zoie, you index to the FSDir *and* the RAMDir simultaneously (so there
is increased CPU usage for indexing because of this),  but you only reopen()
the IndexReader on the FSDir every 15minutes (or so), so the fact that
you've been writing to it the whole while is invisible to the application in
the intervening time.  This means that a) you don't need to worry about
disaster recovery any worse than a regular non-realtime setup, and b) that
when it's time to reopen the FSDir based index, you don't need to write the
RAMDir to disk, you can just throw it away, as the disk already has the docs
that are in that RAMDir.
