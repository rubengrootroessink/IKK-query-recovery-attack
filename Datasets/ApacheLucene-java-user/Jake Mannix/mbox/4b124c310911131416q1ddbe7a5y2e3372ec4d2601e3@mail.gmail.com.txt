Hi Max,

  You want a query like

("San Francisco" OR "California") AND ("John Smith" OR "John Smith
Manufacturing")

  essentially?  You can give Lucene exactly this query and it will require
that
either "John Smith" or "John Smith Manufacturing" be present, but will score
results which have these and one or more of San Fran or CA higher.  And in
fact will score highest results which match all terms.

  Does that help?
