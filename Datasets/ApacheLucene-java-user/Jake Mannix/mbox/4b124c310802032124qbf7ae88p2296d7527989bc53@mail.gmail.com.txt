DATE: 4 Feb 2008

The test in which we got the 11X speedup?  That was single threaded.  I
haven't yet found a way to make multithreaded (shared IndexWriter) indexing
perform with any better speed than singlethreaded, so that code is not
enabled in our tests.  Do you think that 2.3 would better take advantage of
multiple threads / cores?  If so, I could rerun it again multithreaded and
see if that's even better...
