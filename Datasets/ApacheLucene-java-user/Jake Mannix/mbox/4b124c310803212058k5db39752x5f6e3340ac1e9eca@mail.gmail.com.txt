SUBJECT: Re: factor in stopwords when searching
DATE: 22 Mar 2008

I think the way I've seen it done most often is to either index some
bi-grams which
contain stop words (so "the database" and "search the" are in the index as
individual
tokens), or else to index that piece of content twice - once with stop words
removed
(and stemming, if you use it), and then again in another field which leaves
stop words
in (and doesn't do the stemming).

  This can be simply done with a PerFieldAnalyzer(Wrapper?), and some
creative
query expansion: "searches the databases" =>
+(contents:"search database" orig_contents:"searches the databases")
This former query clause will always match if the latter does, so exact
matches will
get weighted higher than ones which only match the inexact ones.
