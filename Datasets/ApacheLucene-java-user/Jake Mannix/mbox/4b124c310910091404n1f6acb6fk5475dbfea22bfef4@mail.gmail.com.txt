If you are really using all of that precision (down to the second) the
short answer is YES.

If you can remove much of that precision (only keep down to the day,
for example), then you may be able to get perfectly good performance
with strings alone when the range is only over a small set of terms,
although it's possible even here you will get a performance gain with
NumericRangeFilter.
