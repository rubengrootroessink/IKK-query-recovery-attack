This is a good point (and should be mentioned in your blog, John) - for
while
custom FieldCache-like implementations (ie bobo-browse, which additionally
isn't
restricted to single-valued fields) need not have this deficiency, for they
can choose to map
empty values to MAX_INT or something like that, the FCRF in its raw form
can really bite you, performance-wise, if you didn't notice that sometimes
your queries ran across zero and there were lots of deletes.
