As long as you don't have to split up a fully optimized index, or
one with the wrong number of segments for the division you
want to do, that would be useful.  Of course, sometimes you
need to split up the big segments into smaller ones too, but
the only way I've done that in the past is basically:

   1. make two copies of the index
   2. delete the first half of the documents from one copy,
   3. delete the second half of the documents on the other,
   4. purge deleted docs from both,
   5. addIndexesNoOptimize() to add them both to a new index.

Having a generic IndexSplitter which took an index of any number
of segments and redistributed them into either any number of
different sized segments, and optionally, completely different
indexes, now that would indeed be a useful tool.
