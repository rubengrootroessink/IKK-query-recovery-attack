Peter,

   You want to do a facet query.  This kind of functionality is not in
Lucene-core (sadly), but both Solr (the fully featured search application
built on Lucene) and bobo-browse (just a library, like Lucene itself) are
open-source and work with Lucene to provide faceting capabilities for you.
