SUBJECT: Special Character Search
DATE: 6 Jun 2003

Hi,

I am trying to implement special character search. 
If I do a search with query title:java\-perl then documents with title
java-perl as well as java+perl comes up. While first result is desirable the
second one is not.
I want to know what is going wrong here ?
Also, I am using StandardAnalyzer and would like to retain the tokenizing
feature.

thanks for your help,
vikas.
