SUBJECT: Search for titlle:file\-name returns file+name too.
DATE: 9 Jun 2003

Hi,

I am trying to search for a file named file-name. When I give the query
title:file\-name result contains entries such as file+name and file[name
too.
What could be the reason for this behavior. I am using Standard Analyzer.

thanks for your help,
vikas.
