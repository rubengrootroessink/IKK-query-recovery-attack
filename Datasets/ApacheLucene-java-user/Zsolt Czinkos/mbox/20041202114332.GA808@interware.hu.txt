SUBJECT: Re: SGML Indexing
DATE: 2 Dec 2004

Hi

We transformed our SGML documents to XML with sgml2xml (part of
fedora/redhat linux distribution) and processed XML not SGML. We also
use a very very very simple "SAX-like SGML parser" (suitable for our SGML
documents; not a general purpose SGML parser) to extract data from SGML. 
But we use XML for indexing.

Best,

czinkos
