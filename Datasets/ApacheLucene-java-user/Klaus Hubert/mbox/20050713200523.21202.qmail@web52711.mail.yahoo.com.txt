Hi,

Thank you all so much for the crash course in Java for
Beginners. Indeed the
last time I used java was 1996... Lol. But I'm getting
now very close. It is
all about the right declarations of classes and
includes at the correct
location. I have almost done it. I will publish my
code to the community if
somebody is interested.

Bye,

  Klaus

Kalus,

Just a few days ago I couldn't even remember how to
compile java code. Last
time I touched java was like 2001. Don't worry, Lucene
is extremely easy,
once you know a bit of fund java. It's no different
than any other language.
Just syntax. I recommend Java from Deitel & Deitel.
Fell in love with their
practical written style back in college. 

Below is what I whipped up quick to test mysql
connections...

Just add  the following to an lucene book sample. You
need to download
ConnectJ jdbc driver from mysql site and put the jar
file in your path
variable. 

my_db db = new my_db();
db.connect();

ResultSet = rs;

rs = db.query("select * from mytable limit 100");

whiel(rs.next()) {
....... = rs.getString("mysqltablefieldname");
//return string value of
mysql row/column....
...copy code from lucene...
}.


import java.sql.*;

public class my_db {

        public Connection conn = null;
        public Statement stmt = null;
        public boolean loaded = false;

        public boolean load() {
                try {
                        // The newInstance() call is a
work around for some
                        // broken Java implementations

                       
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
                        return true;
                } catch (Exception ex) {

                        System.out.println("Cannot
load mysql driver.");
                        return false;
                        // handle the error
                }

        }

        public boolean connect() {
                if(loaded == false) {
                        loaded = load();
                }

                if(loaded == false) {
                        System.out.println("Can't load
driver.");
                        return false;
                }
try {
                        conn =
DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://ip:port/dbname?user=user&password=
pass");

                        stmt = conn.createStatement();
                        stmt.executeQuery("SET NAMES
'utf8'");

                        return true;
                }
                catch (SQLException ex) {
                        // handle any errors
                       
System.out.println("SQLException: " +
ex.getMessage());
                        System.out.println("SQLState:
" + ex.getSQLState());
                       
System.out.println("VendorError: " +
ex.getErrorCode());
                        return false;
                }
        }

        public ResultSet query(String sql) {
                try {
                        return stmt.executeQuery(sql);
                }
                catch (SQLException ex) {
                        // handle any errors
                       
System.out.println("SQLException: " +
ex.getMessage());
                        System.out.println("SQLState:
" + ex.getSQLState());
                       
System.out.println("VendorError: " +
ex.getErrorCode());
                        return null;
                }
        }

      
}
