SUBJECT: boosting results with a field from the index
DATE: 3 Jan 2006

Hi and a Happy New Year!
 
I created a lucene index with 2 fields (text and importance). The text contains the real text
and importance is a field where I manually give a number between 1 and 5 for the related document.
When I search the index I find the documents with the highest revelancy weighted automatically
by lucene. I'm just wondering if I can boost the results with the importance field I already
have stored in the index. As I result I expect the same search results just weighted differently.
Something like relevancy multiplied by importance.
 
Thank you so much,
 
  Klaus
