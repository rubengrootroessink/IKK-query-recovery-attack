DATE: 13 Jul 2005

Hi Nader,

I downloaded Eclipse and also the Hibernate plugin and
I really like this
IDE. It seems to have lots of power. What I didn't
found so far is a
Debugger where I can go line by line through the code
to see errors
eventually. It runs and I get error messages at the
line where the problem
arises. But I cannot go step by step as I was used to
when Programming
Visual Basic, PHP or Perl.

Thanks,

  Klaus

Also Hibernate, you can use Eclipse as an IDE, with
the Hibernator plugin to
create objects cleanly from your MySQL database and
then a few lines will
fetch an object which you could then be passed to
Lucene for indexing.
