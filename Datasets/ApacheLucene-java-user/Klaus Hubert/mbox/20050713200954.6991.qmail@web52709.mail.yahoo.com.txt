Hi Chris,

I've not thought about that. I'm almost done with my
program and I will give
yours also a try as suggested. I have the lasest
(recommended) JDBC 3.1.10.
But I still have to download and install Tomcat or
similar to run your .war
file. I think 5-24h is not that bad, since you can
update the Lucene index
in future and not go over this long building time
again. Your demo looks
really nice and its fast. Congratulations!

Bye,

  Klaus

Hi, Klaus, thanks.

You can simply use DBSight to create the index. It's
in Lucene's standard
format.
And you can control index field type, analyzers, how
to select data from
database, number of java threads, etc, just by web UI.
No coding is needed.
We have a user who didn't know Lucene at all, and have
3 database searches
up and running in one week.

To index a huge index, say 1 million records, it may
take 5 ~ 24 hours
depends on the record size, computer size, etc.
Actually most of the time is
spent on JDBC pulling the data.

Special warning: MySQL's JDBC driver has a bug leading
to OutOfMemory if you
do a select with lots of rows. You must download the
latest JDBC(dev
version) and use setFetchSize().
