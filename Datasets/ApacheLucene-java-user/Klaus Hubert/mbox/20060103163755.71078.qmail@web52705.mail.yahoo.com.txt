Wow, that was fast :-)

Right, why haven't I came up with the idea on just
sorting the results by
importance... Lol...

OK, I will test both solutions and see what I like
best. Such a great piece
for software...

Hi Klaus,

You might want to just set the boost value of the
Document using your 
importance number, then Lucene will factor that in
automatically when 
scoring.  See the Document#setBoost javadoc for info.

You could also sort on the field, I think, so that the
more important 
docs come to the top.

I manually give a
number between 1 and 5 for the related document. When
I search the index I
find the documents with the highest revelancy weighted
automatically by
lucene. I'm just wondering if I can boost the results
with the importance
field I already have stored in the index. As I result
I expect the same
search results just weighted differently. Something
like relevancy
multiplied by importance.
