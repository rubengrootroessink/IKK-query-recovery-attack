SUBJECT: Implementing(Indexing) as Server
DATE: 8 Apr 2005

Hi All
 
People use my webapp to load documents. I want to use lucene to index and present a search
page for them. My files are uploaded to a directory.
 
I want to write a program which runs stand alone and does all the indexing etc. My web app
just searches and displays.
 
Is there a sample app for doing this.
 
Thanks
bib
