SUBJECT: Why indexing database is necessary? (RE: indexing database)
DATE: 4 Mar 2008

Could anyone provide any insight on why someone would use nutch/lucene
or any other search engines to index relational databases? With use
cases if possible?  Shouldn't the database's own indexing mechanism be
used since it is more efficient?

If there is such a need of indexing the database content using search
engines, what would be the best approach other than de-normalizing the
database?  

Thanks a lot in advance!
