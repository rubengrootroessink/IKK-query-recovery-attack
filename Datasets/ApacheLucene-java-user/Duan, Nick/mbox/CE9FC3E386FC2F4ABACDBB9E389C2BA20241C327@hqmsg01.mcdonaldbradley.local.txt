Nutch has a ontology plugin based on Jena.
http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/OntologyPlugin

I haven't used it.  Just by looking at the source code, it seems it just
a Owl parser.  So apparently it only works with sources defined in OWL
format, not others such as RDF.  I think you need to extend the source
code to create your own Query processor to include related terms defined
in the ontology (with thesaurus being considered as a subset of
ontology).

If anyone has experience using the plug-in, I'd really appreciate any
suggestions and comments.

Subject: Using a thesaurus/onthology

Is there any possibility to use a thesaurus or an onthology when
indexing/searching with Lucene?
