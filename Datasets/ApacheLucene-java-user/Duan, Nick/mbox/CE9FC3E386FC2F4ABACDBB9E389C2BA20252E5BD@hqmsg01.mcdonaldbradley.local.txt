SUBJECT: Lucene vs. Database indexing (RE: Indexing and Searching from within a single Document)
DATE: 8 Apr 2008

I think this should be a new thread since it's a different problem.

Based on your description, I don't see any compelling reasons for you to
use Lucene just for indexing purposes, since you are not indexing text
docs as you indicated.  Claiming database of lacking performance is not
accurate and objective.  Your search queries have only the name field
and the two number fields in the where clause.  So you can perform
indexing on those two fields using database's own indexing mechanism,
i.e. the "create index ..." statement, if these fields are not already
declared as primary keys.  You will see dramatic performance improvement
of your search queries.

Hi,

I have a similar question. Not heard back from anyone yet.


Dear Lucene experts,

I'm currently evaluating options for our search tool.

The need is:
I have millions of entries in database, each entry is in such format
(more or less)

ID	Name	Description	start (number)	stop(number)


Currently my application uses the database to do search, queries are in
the following format:

Select * from table where Name like "%mymymy%"

Select * from table where start >5 and stop <50000



I would like very much to use Lucene for such search, for the reason:
1. database performance is not ideal;
2. data is growing to be too big, I want to move to file system,
3. Currently everything is on server, user access through a web
application. I want to provide rich client tool, in which case I would
rather not to bother with database installations on client machine.
Database is my last option;
4. Lucene sounds very cool, I want to use a different technology than
database, which we are very familiar with already.



I read the book, played with the demo. My question is:
As you see, I'm not indexing or querying out documents, I'm interested
in one row of data. If I want to use Lucene, how should I do it? Do I
have to store my data as documents? Since I have millions and millions
of rows in database, if I store each row as a document, it'd be millions
of documents.


What do you suggest?

Thank you!
Jing

Subject: Indexing and Searching from within a single Document


Dear Fellow Java/Lucene developers:

I am writing an application where a user is able to search for keywords
from
within a single book.  When the user conducts a search, he/she should
receive a set of results that show the sentence/phrase within the book
where
the keyword is found.  Unfortunately, all of the examples that I have
for
searching using Lucene discuss the concept of searching multiple
documents,
instead of within a single document.  I have written an application that
creates an index of this book, but I now want to search it.  In the
result
set, I would like the keyword(s) to be highlighted using Lucene's
HighLighter feature.  Once the user clicks on the hit from the result
set
list that they are looking for, the application should take them
directly
within to that section of the book where that keyword is found.  The
book
that I have indexed is in xml format.

My question is, how would I write an application that allows me to
search a
single document, and present a set of results to the user that list
portions
of text from the book that contains the user's keyword, instead of
presenting a list of document titles where that keyword is found?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks to all who reply.

Sincerely;
Fayyaz
