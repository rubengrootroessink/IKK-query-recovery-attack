DATE: 2 Dec 2002


Hi

I am using lucene to implement search on out intranet site. On the click of
one of the links on the web page i want to rebuild the index.( that is
generate index files in one of the directories). Instead on the click my a
write.lock file is created in that directory, only after stop running
tomcat all the index files are generated in that directory. How do i
generate these index files when tomcat is running?
