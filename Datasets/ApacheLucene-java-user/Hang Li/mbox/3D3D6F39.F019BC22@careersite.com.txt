I have seen a lot postings about this topic. Any final thoughts?

We did a simple stress test, Lucene would produce this error between 30 - 80
concurren searches.  The index directory has 24 files (15 fields), and
"
ulimit -n
32768
",

there should be more than enough FDs.  Note, we did not do any writings to index
while we were searching.  Any ideas? Thx.
