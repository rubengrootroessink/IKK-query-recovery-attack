SUBJECT: searching/filtering by field's value length
DATE: 12 Jul 2011

Hello,
I need some help doing a search.
Say I have a really simple document structure, just 1 field, labeled name.
I need to retrieve all the names whose length is more or less than a
specified value. By length I mean String.length().
A range filter seems close in concept, but I couldn't find a good example to
write my specific case.
Thanks for the help,
Federico
