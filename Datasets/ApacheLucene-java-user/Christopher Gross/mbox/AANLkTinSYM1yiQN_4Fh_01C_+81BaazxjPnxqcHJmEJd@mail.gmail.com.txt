I'm trying to connect to a Lucene index on a test server.  All of the
examples that I've found use a local directory to connect into the
Lucene index, but I can't find one that will remotely hook into it.

Can someone please point me in the right direction?  I'm fairly
certain that someone has run into and fixed this problem, but I
haven't been able to find a way to do it.

Thanks for your help!
