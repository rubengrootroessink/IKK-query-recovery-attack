SUBJECT: How to warm up
DATE: 26 Aug 2006

Hi,

I have read it several times that sometimes it is practical to warm up a 
searcher. What exactly does that mean? Would I simply perform a search 
for "foo bar" or something like that? What happens inside the searcher so 
that it becomes 'warmed up'?

Thank you!

Regards,
Martin
