SUBJECT: How to view deleted documents and undelete(int docID)
DATE: 11 Jun 2007

Hi,

I am wondering whether this is possible at all....
Regarding SegmentReader.document(n,..), an exception is thrown if 
(isDeleted(n) == true). So I cannot get a hold of document n if it is 
deleted. 
Despite that, is there a way to view the deleted document and undelete a 
single document? (Luke has a "reconstruct & edit" button which does not seem 
to work on deleted documents, if it ever was designed to undelete a 
document).

Thank you!

Regards,
Martin
