SUBJECT: using search instead of explain
DATE: 3 May 2006

Hi,

at the moment we match a query with a document with explain. We consider the 
document as matched if the Explanation.getValue() is above a certain value (> 
0.001)

Now we want to use Search.search(Query, HitCollection). 
HitCollection adds the document to a BitSet as soon as the score is non-zero.

Is there any relation between the value of the explanation and the score?

Thanks!

Regards,
Martin Kobele
