SUBJECT: Some documents are not added to the index
DATE: 17 May 2006

Hi,

several threads add document to the same index.
As noted in the FAQ, adding documents is thread safe.
(I even synchronize my static index writer when I add documents. just to make 
sure.)

However, after addind all my documents, the index does not contain all of the 
documents. When I run it again, I get either a different number of documents 
or in rare cases the actual number of docs which I added.
I get better results if I have only one thread adding docs.

How can I check whether a document was actually added?
Is there another way to monitor whether the doc was added?

Thanks!

Regards,
Martin
