SUBJECT: Wildcard with Words Ending in 'e'
DATE: 3 May 2006

Hi

I'm currently upgrading our version of intraLibrary from 1.3 to 1.9.1 (about time!) and have
come 
across a failure in one of our wildcard query unit tests. Previously searching for the phrase
peopl? 
would return results and now it doesn't. Further investigation has found that for any words
I could 
think of that ended with an 'e' you can't use the single character wildcard to find the word.

Has anyone else seen this problem or know of a workaround?

Many thanks

Gordon
