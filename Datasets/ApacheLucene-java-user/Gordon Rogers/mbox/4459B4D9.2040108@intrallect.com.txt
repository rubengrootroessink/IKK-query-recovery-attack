Your shot in the dark was correct, I am using Porter Stemming. Thanks to your excellent response
I 
understand now why wildcards and stemming are now very useful when combined. I'm going to

investigate other means of taking into account the wildcard queries and handling them in a
different 
way. Rest assured that if I find a solution I'll post it to the user group.
