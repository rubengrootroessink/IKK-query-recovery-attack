SUBJECT: API to retrieve search results without scoring or sorting
DATE: 19 Jul 2010

HI
Is there any API using which I can retrieve search results, such that they
are neither scored nor sorted (for performance reasons). I just need the
results, don't need any extra computation on that.
Any suggestion will be very helpful.
