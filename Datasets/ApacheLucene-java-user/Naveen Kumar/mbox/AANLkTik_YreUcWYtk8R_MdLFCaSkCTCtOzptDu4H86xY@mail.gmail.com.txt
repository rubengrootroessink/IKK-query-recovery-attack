SUBJECT: Adding a new field to existing Index
DATE: 29 Jun 2010

Hey,

I need to add a new field (a stored , not indexed field) for all documents
present in an existing large index. Reindexing the whole index will be very
costly. Is there a way to do this or any work around?

I would also like to know, if data or term vector, of a field indexed
without storing, can somehow be retrieved. This would enable a work around
solution to my problem.

Thank you
Naveen Kumar
