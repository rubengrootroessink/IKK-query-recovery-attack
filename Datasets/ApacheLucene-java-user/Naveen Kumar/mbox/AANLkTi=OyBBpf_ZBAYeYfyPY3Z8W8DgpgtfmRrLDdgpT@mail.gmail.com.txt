SUBJECT: Merge policy, optimization for small frequently changing indexes.
DATE: 30 Sep 2010

Hi
I have a Very large number (say 3 million) of frequently changing Small
indexes. 90% of these indexes contain about 50 documents, while a few 2-3%
indexes have about 100,000 documents each (these being the more frequently
used indexes).
Each index belongs to a signed in user, thus can have unpredictable index
changes, in short periods of time, or can be stagnant for a long time.
What kind of indexing policy (mergefactor, maxmergedocs) would be optimal
for this kind of index. Is optimizing for this kind of index needed? or
wise?, if yes, what would be a good way to optimize (please note number of
indexes are very large).

Any suggestions would be very helpful.
