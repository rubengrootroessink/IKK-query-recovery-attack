SUBJECT: RE: Corrupt segments file full of zeros
DATE: 28 Jun 2011

Michael

We are not using commit points unfortunately.

This was a scheduled update to our index, and on observation the index directory had two segments_N
files:

segments_4vb (modified 24 June 2011 02:05:38 size 7.61KB)
segments_4vc (modified 24 June 2011 02:20:42 size 5.91KB) 

We were not sure which one of these was the real one, so we deleted 4vb and got the following
from SegmentInfos:

Directory listing genA=6312
Fallback check: 6311; 6311
Segments.gen check: genB=6311
Index has 0 docs

We then deleted 4vc and got the following:

Directory listing genA=6311
Fallback check: 6311; 6311
Segments.gen check: genB=6311
Index has 40022898 docs 

Opening 4vc in an octal editor yields only ASCII zeros (0000000 nul nul nul nul nul nul nul....etc).
It may be that Windows is responsible for this, as our indexes are accessed through a fileserver
and we know that a delayed write occurred.

My question is: why does an index with 4vc open?

Thanks

Greg

OK, this is why Lucene (and Luke) consider the index fine, ie, if Lucene has problems opening
segments_N (all 0s is definitely not a valid segments_N file), it falls back to the last commit
(segments_(N-1)) and opens that instead.

Ie, IR.open and new IW(...) open the last successful commit.
