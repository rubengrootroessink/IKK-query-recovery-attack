Yes I have done that, and you just get "No problems were detected with
this index"

Surely there is a major problem with this index?

Also the check() procedure takes a long time - is there any way you can
just do a health check on the segments file?

Thanks

You can try the CheckIndex tool. You feed it a directory and call
.check() and it reports the results.
