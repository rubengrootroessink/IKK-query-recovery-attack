SUBJECT: RE: Corrupt segments file full of zeros
DATE: 28 Jun 2011

We don't have a -9 in the file. It isn't a valid lucene segments file,
as it only contains zeros.

We're wondering why this opens in Luke, and why the CheckIndex reports
that the index is OK.

According to the spec there should at least be an Int32 of  -9 to
declare the Format -

So where is the problem at all? Why should a segments file not contain
lots
of zeroes? If the index is not corrupt all is fine.
