SUBJECT: Corrupt segments file full of zeros
DATE: 28 Jun 2011

We have a problem with our fileserver where our indexes are hosted
remotely, using Lucene 2.9.3.

This can mean that a segments file is written which is full of ASCII
zeros. Using the od -ah command, we get:

0000000 nul nul nul nul nul nul nul....etc

If opened in Luke, the index opens successfully but has zero documents.

Why does this open correctly in luke, and is there a procedure in the
lucene code that can verify a segments file, e.g. check whether it
refers to any segments?

Thanks

Greg
