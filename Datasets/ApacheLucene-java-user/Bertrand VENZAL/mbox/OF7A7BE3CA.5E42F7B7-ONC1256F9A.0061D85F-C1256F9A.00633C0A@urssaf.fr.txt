SUBJECT: Use an executable from java ...
DATE: 31 Jan 2005

Hi all,

I ve a kind of problem to execute a converting tool to modify a pdf to an 
html under Linux. In fact, i have an executable "pdftohtml" which work 
correctly on batch mode, and when I want to use it through Java under 
Windows 2000 works also,BUT it does not work at all on the server under 
linux. I m using the following code.

scommand = "/bin/sh -c \"myCommand fileName output\" ";

Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
Process proc = runtime.exec(scommand);
proc.waitFor();


I m running my code under Linux-redhat with a classic shell. 
Is there an other way to do the same thing or maybe am i missing something 
?
Any help will be grandly appreciate.

Thanks
Bertrand
