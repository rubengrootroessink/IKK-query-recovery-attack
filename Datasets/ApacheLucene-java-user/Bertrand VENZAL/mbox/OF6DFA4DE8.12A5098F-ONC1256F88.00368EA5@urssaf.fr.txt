SUBJECT: IndexSearcher and number of occurence
DATE: 13 Jan 2005



Hi all,

Im quite new in this mailing list. I ve many difficulties to find the
number of a word (occurence) in a document, I need to use indexSearcher
because of the query but the score returning is not wot i m looking for.
I found in the mailing List the class TermDoc but it seems to work only
with indexReader.

If anyone can give a hand of this one, I will appreciate ...

Tch√µ
Bertrand
