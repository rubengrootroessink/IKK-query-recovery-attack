Great, thanks for your help, I understand things quickly but I need lots of
explanation .. ;-)

For who is interested .. I was using :

int id = hits.doc(i);
instead of :
int id = hits.id(i);

Yes, the Document id (the one Lucene uses) is not to be relied on
long-term.  But, in the example you'd get it from Hits immediately
after a search, and thus it would be accurate and usable.  You do not
need to store any the id during indexing - Lucene maintains it and
gives it to you from Hits.
