SUBJECT: How does Lucene to compute score ?
DATE: 12 May 2005

Hi,

I suppose this question has been asking before but there is no way to 
search such a thing in the archive.

Anyway, I need to merge to different type of search but I am not really 
sure that the calculus of the score is the same. So if someone can 
indicate me how does Lucene to compute it or an address that explain all 
this ....


thanks
Bertrand
