SUBJECT: Compass - Reloading Domain Object Defintiion Files
DATE: 9 Jun 2008



I am interested in changing the search configuration for grails domain
objects on a running grails instance.   Near as I can tell, I need to reload
the mappings (Domain.cpm.xml) and then reindex lucene.  Is this the correct
approach?  If so, how would I go about reloading the mapping files?  What is
the best way to force lucene to reindex?

Thank you.
