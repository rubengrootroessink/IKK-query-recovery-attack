I'm taking my first step in to coding some Lucene
stuff, specifically a custom analyzer. The analyzer
we want is one that maps accented characters to
their unaccented form, for a crude and general
Latin index/search. E.g. e accute to e.
Anyone got one already ?

If not, I can't seem to find the source for Lucene.
I've downloaded 1.02rc1.

I've read the FAQ and seen the examples, so I'm
comfortable with how to do this, I'm just insanely curious
about the code under the bonnet of the StandardAnalyzer.
