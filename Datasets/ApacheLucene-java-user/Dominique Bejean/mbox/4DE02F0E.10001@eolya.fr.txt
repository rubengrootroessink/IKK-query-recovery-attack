Hi,

Sorry for the delay, but I haven't been checking the mailing list for a 
long time.

Crawl-anywhere includes 3 piece of software : a crawler, a pipeline and 
a solr indexer.

There is a default Solr schema used by Crawl-anywhere, tested with Solr 
1.4.1 and Solr 3.1.0.

But, you can configure the pipeline stage responsible for mapping 
crawled data to Solr field. IN the absolute, you can use any schema with 
any Solr version.

Regards

Dominique
