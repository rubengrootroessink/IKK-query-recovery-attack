Hi,

I would like to announce Crawl Anywhere. Crawl-Anywhere is a Java Web 
Crawler. It includes :

    * a crawler
    * a document processing pipeline
    * a solr indexer

The crawler has a web administration in order to manage web sites to be 
crawled. Each web site crawl is configured with a lot of possible 
parameters (no all mandatory) :

    * number of simultaneous items crawled by site
    * recrawl period rules based on item type (html, PDF, â€¦)
    * item type inclusion / exclusion rules
    * item path inclusion / exclusion / strategy rules
    * max depth
    * web site authentication
    * language
    * country
    * tags
    * collections
    * ...

The pileline includes various ready to use stages (text extraction, 
language detection, Solr ready to index xml writer, ...).

All is very configurable and extendible either by scripting or java coding.

With scripting technology, you can help the crawler to handle javascript 
links or help the pipeline to extract relevant title and cleanup the 
html pages (remove menus, header, footers, ..)

With java coding, you can develop your own pipeline stage stage

The Crawl Anywhere web site provides good explanations and screen shots. 
All is documented in a wiki.

The current version is 1.1.4. You can download and try it out from here 
: www.crawl-anywhere.com


Regards

Dominique
