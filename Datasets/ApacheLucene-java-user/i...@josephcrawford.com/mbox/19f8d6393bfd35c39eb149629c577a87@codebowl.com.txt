Hello,

I would like to query based on a start and end date.  I was thinking
something like this

start_date: [20000101 TO <todays date>] end_date: [<todays date> TO
20900101]

Would this work for me?  Our dates are stored in the index as strings so I
am not sure the syntax above would be correct.

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford
