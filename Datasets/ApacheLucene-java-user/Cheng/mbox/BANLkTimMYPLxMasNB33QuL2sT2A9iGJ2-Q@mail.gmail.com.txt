SUBJECT: JobClient.runJob(job) in Fetcher.java
DATE: 25 May 2011

Hi, I notice that there are a few run() methods in Fetcher.java and that the
following statement in Crawler.java calls the JobClient.runJob(job) in
Fetcher.java.

fetcher.fetch(segs[0], threads,
org.apache.nutch.fetcher.Fetcher.isParsing(conf));

I would like to know which run() in Fetcher.java has been called by the
above statetment.

Thanks.
