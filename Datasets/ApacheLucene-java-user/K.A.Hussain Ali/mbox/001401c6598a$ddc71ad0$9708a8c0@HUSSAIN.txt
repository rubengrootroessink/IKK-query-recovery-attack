SUBJECT: searching and indexing simultaneously...
DATE: 6 Apr 2006

HI all.

i am newbie to lucene

Do lucene provides any way to do indexing ,searching and deleting simultaneously ..

I hope we could do searching and indexing which means there can be multiple indexreader and
only one indexwriter accessing the index..

Could we have two indexwriter working simultaneously...?

Any help is greatly appreciated
Thanks in advance.

regards
