SUBJECT: Document marked as deleted
DATE: 30 Oct 2008


I have an index with a particular document marked as deleted. If I use the
search method that returns TopDocs and that deleted document satisfies the
search criteria, will it be included in the returned TopDocs object even
though it has been marked as deleted?

Thanks in advance.

John G.
