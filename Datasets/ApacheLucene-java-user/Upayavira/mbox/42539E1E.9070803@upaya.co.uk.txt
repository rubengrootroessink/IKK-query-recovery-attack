It is either manual change, or a little script to sort the problem out. 
At the moment, I can't help with the latter. If you can handle doing it 
manually whenever you see it, that will be the most straight-forward 
approach.

As to the nature of the change - we upgraded from Moin 1.1(pre) to 
1.3.4. It was a huge upgrade, and means we're back with Moin's HEAD, and 
we've been much more careful about patches that take us away from what 
moin are doing, so that it will be easier to upgrade in future.

I'm sure over the coming months we'll discover the many benefits of 
having upgraded, once all of the teething problems have settled down.

Regards, Upayavira
