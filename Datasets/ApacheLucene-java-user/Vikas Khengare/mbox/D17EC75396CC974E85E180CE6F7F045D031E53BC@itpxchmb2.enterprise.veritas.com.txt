SUBJECT: How to track database changes at run time to update index in Lucene ?
DATE: 11 Jan 2006

 
Hi Friend.......
 
           I have two questions for you................ 
 
        I am doing indexing using Lucene. I am taking data from database
But for updation in index there is problem. How can I come to know that
a row or a single data cell is get changed from row ? How can I index
only that data cell ?
 
1] How to track database changes in web application from front end
processing at runtime ?
2] Can get information that database is changed...... Some events from
that I will come to know that database is changed
 
Explanation :
                I am doing indexing and searching on database. If
database gets change then I have to update index also. But how I come to
know in web application that which database record gets change and on
which table record is deleted OR inserted. So I will update that
document only from the index by uniquely identifying it.
          
         Can get information that database is changed...... Some events
from that I will come to know that database is changed............ 
 
        Can I use AJAX  OR Database Triggers OR Periodical updates OR
something different for that ?
 
       I hope I will get solution from experts like you.
 
Thanks.
