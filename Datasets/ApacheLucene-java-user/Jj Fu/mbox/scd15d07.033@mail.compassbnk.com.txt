SUBJECT: Lucene with database
DATE: 2 May 2002

I am looking for a way to make our web site researchable. I have heard a
lot about Lucene, when I visited Jakarta site there is not much document
there. I know Lucene build index in file system. But does any one has
experience or knows how to put Lucene to work with a database? Has this
topic been talked here before? Thanks.
