SUBJECT: How to filter search based on file path
DATE: 27 Jun 2005

Hi 
 
I've indexed my website from the application root. When I run a query, it beasically searches
all content below the application root folder.
 
I would like to create feature that would allow users to search specific folder/paths of this
website. (i.e I would like to limit my query search to specific folders)
 
Could you please give me some tips as to do this?
 
Thanks
K
