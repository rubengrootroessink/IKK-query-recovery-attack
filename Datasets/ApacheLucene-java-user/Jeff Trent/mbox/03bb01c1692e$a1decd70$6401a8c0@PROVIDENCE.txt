SUBJECT: Queries involving AND don't seem to work properly
DATE: 9 Nov 2001

Hi, I'm using RC1 and it seems that queries such as

"KeywordThatIKnowIsNotIndexed AND KeywordThatIsIndexed" is queried, the results act as if
I specified OR instead of AND and I get all matches to KeywordThatIsIndexed instead of getting
no results as I expected to see.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Jeff
