Not really.  A document in Lucene is a logical entity comprising named
fields.  So a row in the db would probably be represented as a Lucene
document.  Each [searchable] column on the table would be represented as a
field of the document.  However, you may find it necessary to build psuedo
fields in Lucene that span multiple columns in the database if you want to
do complex queries across multiple fields since in Lucene you typically need
to preface your search keywords with the field they are located in (eg.
Field1:SearchKey).
