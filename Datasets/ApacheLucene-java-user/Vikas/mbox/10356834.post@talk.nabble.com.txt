Hi All:

Can I make nutch to crawl and create separate indices based on scope , where
scope is determined from the querystring?

For example:

Let's assume that I'm having URL like:

http://localhost/admin/orchindex/crawl.asp?lCrpID=0&lPrjID=609&lStrtID=3605&l

then,

lCrpId=0 is one scope

lCorpid=1 is another

and for all urls with lCrpId=0 we want one index and for those with lCrpId=1
we want another


Regards,
Vikas Kumar
