Erik,

Just to make it clear for me. The last Lucene version supports interior
+/-.
So, how looks the query that deals with "BOOK NAME" as keyword fields
And I want to find C++ tutorial ?

Thanks in advanvce

What version of Lucene are you using?   There was a change that 
helped with that situation such that interior +/- was not considered 
an operator.   That changed is in the 1.4 versions - might you be 
running a  previous version of Lucene?
