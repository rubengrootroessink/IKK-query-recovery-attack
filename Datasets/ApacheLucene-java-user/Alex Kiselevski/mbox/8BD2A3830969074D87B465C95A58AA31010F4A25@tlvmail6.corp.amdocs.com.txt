org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException: Encountered "~" at line 1,

Was expecting one of:
    <AND> ...
    <OR> ...
    <NOT> ...
    "+" ...
    "-" ...
    "(" ...
    ")" ...
    "^" ...

You'll have to give us more information than that...

What is the problem you are seeing? I'll assume that you get no results.

Tell us of the structure of your documents and how you index every
field.

Concerning your syntax, if you are using the distributed query parser,
you don't need the + before name, nor the + before university as they
will be added by the parser.
