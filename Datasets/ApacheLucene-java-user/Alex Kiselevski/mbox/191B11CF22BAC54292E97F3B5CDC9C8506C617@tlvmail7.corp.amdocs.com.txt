Subject: Is there a thai language analyzer available

Does anyone know of a good Thai language analyzer for Lucene?

I saw this email out there for a Thai language analyzer:

http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jakarta-lucene-dev/200402.mbox/
%3C20040218004604.61360.qmail@web41501.mail.yahoo.com%3E

But it looks like it requires modifying the existing parser which I
would prefer not to do if I do not have to.

Thanks,
Randy Darling
