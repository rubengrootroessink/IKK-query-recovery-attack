SUBJECT: Correct query
DATE: 27 Dec 2004


Hello,
I indexed some document that included a word RPG/4.
So, when I made a search - I builded a query

Text:RPG but it didn't find a thing only Text:RPG/4 gave me the correct
result.
Tell me please what have I do to build a a dynamic (not hardcoded like
in this example )query to get right results

Thanks in advance
