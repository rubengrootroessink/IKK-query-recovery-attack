SUBJECT: Exception in IndexWriter recreating
DATE: 26 Sep 2005


Hi,

I have a strange exception when I'm trying to recreate an IndexWriter,
that was previously defined.



I did the following steps:

1.	    mWriter = new IndexWriter(indexPath, analyzer, true);
2.	    mWriter.addDocument(document);
3.	    mWriter.optimize();
4.	    mWriter.close();



In the next step I try to recreate the indexWriter by the same way I did
it in the first step

5.	    mWriter = new IndexWriter(indexPath, analyzer, true);

And I got an Exception:



java.io.IOException: Cannot delete _a.cfs
