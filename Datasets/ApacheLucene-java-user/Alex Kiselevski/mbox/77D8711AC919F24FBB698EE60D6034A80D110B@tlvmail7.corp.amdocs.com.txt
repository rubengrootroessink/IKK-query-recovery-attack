Thanks Erik,
I use StandardAnalyze to index RPG/4.
I use StandardAnalyzer and IndexSearcher with TermQuery without
QueryParser. So, I thought that as a result of query
Text:RPG I still have to get some hit, but it didn't happen.

What Analyzer did you use?   Are you using QueryParser and using the
same analyzer with it?  Please read the AnalysisParalysis page on the
wiki.  Also, running the AnalyzerDemo from Lucene in Action's source
code yields this, which should help illuminate the situation:

$ ant -emacs AnalyzerDemo
Buildfile: build.xml

AnalyzerDemo:

       Demonstrates analysis of sample text.

       Refer to the "Analysis" chapter for much more on this
       extremely crucial topic.
