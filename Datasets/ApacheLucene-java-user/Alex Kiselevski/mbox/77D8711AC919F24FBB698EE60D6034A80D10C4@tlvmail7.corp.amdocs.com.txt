Hi;

The indexReader has a delete method that can do this:

public final void delete(int docNum)
throws IOException
Deletes the document numbered docNum. Once a document is deleted it will
not appear in TermDocs or TermPostitions enumerations. Attempts to read
its field with the document(int) method will result in an error. The
presence of this document may still be reflected in the
docFreq(org.apache.lucene.index.Term) statistic, though this will be
corrected eventually as the index is further modified.

There is an example of how it can be used in the Lucene demo. Ensure you
re-create the indexSearcher for the change to be reflected in your
search queries.

Luke
