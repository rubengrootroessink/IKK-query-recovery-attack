Hello Friends,

I want to search on BOTH --> (1) "XML" data and (2) "Text" data.


(1). "Text Data" --> mostly consist of HTML pages, residing on the server...
example : hundreds of HTML, TXT file, etc...


(2). "XML Data" --> for example, Articles that was stored in XML format, lets say like
this :

<article>
<article code>  ....   </article code>
<article title>   ....  </article title>
<author>  .... </author>
<date> ... </date>
<etc> ... </etc>

<body of th eTEXT>
.
.......................... the article body, TEXT ......
.
.
.
.
</body of th eTEXT>

</article>

In this type of search, we need to search this "XML-based author file" in two different ways
:
    2.a. First Way of searching : Searching XML file through its KEYWORDS, like : date = "Jan-01-2002"
and author = "George Washington"
    2.b. Second Way of Searching : Free search on the article body. For example : All the
articles, whose body has the word 'Hello', or the sentence 'Hello Mr. President!' 


Note-1:

XML file may reside either Operating System level, or in a XML-supporting DATABASE, as well.


Note-2:

If I need to have them, I can write extra java classes to support some more functionality,
if possible...


Thank you very much,
Harun.
