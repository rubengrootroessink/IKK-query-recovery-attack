SUBJECT: Re: Strategy for making short documents not bubble to the top?
DATE: 29 Jun 2005

Hi Jian,

Thanks for the reply.  The problem with that is it completely
ignores document length.  A book that mentions "frog" 5 times in its 2,000
pages should be less relevant than a book that mentions "frog" 4 times in
its 4 pages.

I really want to lower the document length weight instead
of removing it completely.  Any ideas how to do that?

Thanks.
