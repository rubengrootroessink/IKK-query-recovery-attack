SUBJECT: Span query performance issue
DATE: 25 Jun 2005

Hi,

I'm comparing SpanNearQuery to PhraseQuery results and noticing about
an 8x difference on Linux.  Is a SpanNearQuery doing 8x as much work?  


I'm considering diving into the code if the results sounds unusual to people.
 But if its really doing that much more work, I won't spend time optimizing
something that can't get much faster.

Thanks.
