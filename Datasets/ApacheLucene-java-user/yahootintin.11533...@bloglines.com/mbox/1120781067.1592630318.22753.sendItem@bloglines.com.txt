SUBJECT: Loading large index into RAM
DATE: 8 Jul 2005

Is it possible to use a RAMDirectory to load a 5 GB index into RAM on Linux?
 I have access to a server with 6 GB of RAM and will try it next week but
I've heard that Java on Linux may only support up to 2 GB of RAM per process.
 Anyone already tried this?

Thanks.
