SUBJECT: Strategy for making short documents not bubble to the top?
DATE: 29 Jun 2005

Hi,

Short documents bubble to the top of the results because the field
length is short.  Does anyone have a good strategy for working around this?
 Will doing something like log(document length) flatten out my results while
still making them meaningful?  I'm going to try some different approaches
but any advice is appreciated.

Thanks.
