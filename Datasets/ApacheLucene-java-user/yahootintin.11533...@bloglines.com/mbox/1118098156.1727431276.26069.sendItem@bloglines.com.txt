SUBJECT: Re: Calculating idf across multiple indexes
DATE: 6 Jun 2005

Hi Daniel,

The problem is that if I tell Lucene about only one of the indexes
it has no way of knowing what the total document frequency is across the other
index servers.

Does that make sense?  I think my collator will need to
calculate the idf somehow.

Thanks.
