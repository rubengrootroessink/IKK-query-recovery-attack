SUBJECT: retrieving raw scores
DATE: 19 Jul 2005

hi,

i need to retrieve the raw scores (3.6, 2.8, etc) for a hit and not
the normalized score (1.0, 0.8, etc).  commenting out the normalizing code
in Hits.java does what i want.  is there a better way to do this?

i'm wondering
about adding a method to Similarity.java that looks like this:
  boolean
normalizeRawScores() {
    return true;
  }

is there a better way to
do this?

thanks.
