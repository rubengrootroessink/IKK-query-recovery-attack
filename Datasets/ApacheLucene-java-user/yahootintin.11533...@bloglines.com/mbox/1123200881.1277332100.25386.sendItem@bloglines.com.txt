SUBJECT: Search shortly after adding a doc
DATE: 5 Aug 2005

i want to use lucene to search shortly (within a second) after adding a document.
 closing a writer to ensure the new document is written and then opening an
index reader seems to be too slow on large indexes.

how do other people
handle this?  

(i know this can be solved with a database but i'd like
to use the tokenization/stemming features of lucene).
