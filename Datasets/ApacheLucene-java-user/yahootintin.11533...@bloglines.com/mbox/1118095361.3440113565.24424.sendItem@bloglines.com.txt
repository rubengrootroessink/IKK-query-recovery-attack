SUBJECT: Calculating idf across multiple indexes
DATE: 6 Jun 2005

Hi,

Due to the size of my index, I need to break it into several different
segments.  I have a service that gets a query from the user and contacts each
index searcher service asynchronously and waits for the results.  The results
are then collated and returned to the user.

The problem is that the idf
isn't being calculated correctly because each index searcher service doesn't
know the total document frequency for each term.  How are others working around
this issue?

Thanks.
