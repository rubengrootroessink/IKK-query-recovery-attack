You are right.

Why you have not made it in one call? 

For example -
 String result = highlighter.highlightAll(tokenStream, text).

Or:
  highlighter.setTextFragmenter(new OneFragmentFragmenter());
  String result =highlighter.getBestFragment(tokenStream,text);

I ask because in your example i should calculate the size of the initial
text in any case.
I do not want to do it :) One call will allow to write more solid and dense
code.
