Luke can help you to give an answer the question: does my index contain a
correct data?

Let do the following steps:
- run Luke
- open the index
- find the specified document (document tab)
- click "reconstruct and edit" button
- select the field and look the original stored content of this field
reconstructed from index

Does this reconstructed content contain your last 2-3 paragraphs?

Also, 230Kb is not equal 20.000. Try to set  writer.maxFieldLength to 250
000.
