Unfortunately Lucene contains API that strongly attached to internal id :(

For example - most of the TermVector API or IndexReader.delete()
The simple question - I have a document and I add it into index with
TermVector support.
How can I simply retrive the TermVector information for the document? 

	TermFreqVector vector = reader.getTermFreqVector(document)?
	reader.delete(document);
Etc..

It's not rise a claim. I don't know a good unified solution for this problem
:(
