Sorry for my English.

All russian charset is equal. 
I can't choice default charset for no-arg constructor.

My code is only example  and RussianCharsets.RussianUnicode too.
We use RussianCharsets.CP1251. But other people can use other charset.

I think that Russian Analyser must not has no-arg constructor.
The choise of default charset is not evident.
The user must specify charset.

I thin that original problem is Luke's problem, not Russian Analyser.

Do you understand me?
