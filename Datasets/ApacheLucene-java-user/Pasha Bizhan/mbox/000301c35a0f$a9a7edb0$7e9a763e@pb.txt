By the way, I hope that Lucene.Net 1.3rc1 will be available 
from http://sourceforge.net/ in this week. Lucene.Net is ready, but
sourceforge is not :)

Lucene.Net is a complete up to date port of Lucene 1.3rc1
includes samples and demos (web demo also).

A few differences between nLucene and Lucene.net are:
1. version of Lucene: Lucene.Net is a 1.3rc1, nLucene - is a 1.2
2. java code compatible: Lucene.Net only change naming notation, like
"IndexWriter", nLucene 
implement some methods as a attributes and others
3. demos: Lucene.Net contain all of Lucene demos and tests include web
demos. nLucene does not.
4. .NET Framework 1.1 and VS 2003 compatible
5. (for internal developer only): correct implement of >>> java operator
:)
