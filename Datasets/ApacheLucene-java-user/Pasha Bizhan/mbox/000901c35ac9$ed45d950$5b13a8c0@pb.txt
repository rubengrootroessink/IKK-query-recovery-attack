Hi,

Lucene.Net 1.3.rc1 now available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lucenedotnet/

Lucene.Net is a complete up to date port of Lucene 1.3.rc1 without
any modifications and extentions of original Lucene code. 

Lucene.Net includes all original Lucene demos and tests, but not all
work correct :)
For example, HTMLTest doesn't work.
