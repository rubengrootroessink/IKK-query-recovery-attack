In our tests Lucene.Net was faster than jakarta lucene. A little :)
And results for your DotLucene will be the similar. I hope. 

But it was our tests for our data and hardware configurations and by this
reason 
we aren't publishing tests result anywhere.

I think that speed difference between lucene and Net port doesn't matter.

We use standard samples for the same hardware and data as comparison tests.
