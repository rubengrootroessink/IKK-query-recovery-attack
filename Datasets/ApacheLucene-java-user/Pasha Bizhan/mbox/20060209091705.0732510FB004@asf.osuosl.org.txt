You do not need to reopen index for every single document if the new 
data doesn't contain dupes.

In any case, we use the following algorithm:
- remove dupes from new data (it's possible)
- open writer, open reader/searcher
- use reader/searcher to check for dupes
- use writer to add new documents
- close all
