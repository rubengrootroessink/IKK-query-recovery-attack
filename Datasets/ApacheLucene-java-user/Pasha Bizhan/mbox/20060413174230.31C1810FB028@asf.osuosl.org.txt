Why Lucene should solve this problem? What is your search document?
Or what is your search result? What are you going to display as result to
user?
What will your users search for?

The such query is not a full-text search query. 

For example, the query:

	select titles, yesr, etc from titles where 'Assistant Producer' like
'%....%.

is full-text search query. And Lucene can help you in this case.
