You can store the unique id in the index. Also you can store in the
index all info for results.
For example(sorry for C# syntax):

 Field.UnIndexed("id", id );
 Field.UnIndexed("title",title_str);
 Field.UnIndexed("description",description_str);
 Field.Text("value",completeValue);

We search by "value field" and show "title" and "description" fields in
results without database connection.
Also we have "see detail" link with "id" field as  parameter of link. 
Example:
Title: Lucene
Descriptoon: The full text search engine
Detail: http://lucene.net/detail?value=12345

12345 - document id from database.

We do not store real value int the index, only index it.
