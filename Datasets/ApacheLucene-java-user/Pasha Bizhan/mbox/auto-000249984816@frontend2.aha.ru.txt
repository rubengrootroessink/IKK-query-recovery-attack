It's Luke's feature. And Russian language specific - 3  (and more) charset
for one language :) 

Luke use default ctor for Analyser, but Russian Analyser doesn't contain it.
And German Analyser too -  try Luke and the error will be the same.

You can add this code into RussianAnalyzer.java and enjoy:
public RussianAnalyzer() {
	this.charset = RussianCharsets.UnicodeRussian;
	stoptable =
StopFilter.makeStopTable(makeStopWords(RussianCharsets.UnicodeRussian));
}
