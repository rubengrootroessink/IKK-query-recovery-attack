SUBJECT: sumOfSquaredWeights for lengthNorm
DATE: 10 Aug 2009

Dear all,

 

I read a very old message on the list about the use of sumOfSquaredWeights
in lengthNorm (Mon, 06 Mar 2006 19:06:28 GMT from Eugene). I just wanted to
do the same, i.e., to override the Similarity class of Lucene in order to
normalize the term weights of a doc with the sum of the squares of doc term
frequencies in the doc. 

 

Cheers

 

Claudio
