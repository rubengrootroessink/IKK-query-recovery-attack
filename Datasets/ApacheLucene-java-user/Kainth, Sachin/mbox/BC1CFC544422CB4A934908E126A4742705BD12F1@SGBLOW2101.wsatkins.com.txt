But would it still use the Java version of Lucene?  Are you saying that
unlike Lucene Web Service, Solr can be used via .NET code?  Do they both
still use the Java version of Lucene though?

Let me explain what I want to do.  I want to be able to set up a
dedicated machine for dotLucene so that indexing and searching can occur
on a dedicated machine.  I therefore need web services to handle the
message passing between our CMS machine which will receice client search
requests and the dedicated dotLucene machine.  How would I use solr or
Lucene Web Services to achieve this?  Will I have to use Java Lucene to
do the indexing and searching?  I really want to be able to use
dotLucene.  Any help would be appreciated.

Many thanks

Sachin

Hi

You could try SOLR
http://lucene.apache.org/solr/

This is obviously Java but you can access it using .NET...

Hope this helps
