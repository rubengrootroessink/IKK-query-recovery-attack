Hi all,

I have read that Lucene performs caching of search results so that if
you perform the same search in succession the second result should be
returned faster.  What I wanted to ask is whether this caching is any
good or whether it's a good idea to add some sort of caching layer on
top of Lucene to improve on it.

Any comments will be appreciated.

Thanks

Sachin
