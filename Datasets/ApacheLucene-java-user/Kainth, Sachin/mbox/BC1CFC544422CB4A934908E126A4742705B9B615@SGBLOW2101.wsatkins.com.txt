SUBJECT: 'a', 's' and 't' don't index properly
DATE: 8 Feb 2007

> Hello,
> 
> I have a database of tracks, artists and albums and I'm indexing these
> 3 attributes plus also the first letter of the track thus (incidently
> I'm using dotlucene but the implementation of dotlucene is similar to
> the Java one):
> 
>    Document Doc = new Document();
>    String Album = ...
>    String Artist = ...
>    String Track = ...
>    Doc.Add(Field.Text("album", Album));
>    Doc.Add(Field.Text("artist", Artist));
>    Doc.Add(Field.Text("track", Track));
>    Doc.Add(Field.Text("firstletter", Track.Substring(0,1)));
> 
> Problem is I don't think certain first letters are being indexed
> properly or at all, either that or there is some problem elsewhere.  I
> have noticed that the letters 'a', 's' and 't' (there may be others)
> cause me problems.  I shall explain the problem I have.  When I search
> for the documents I perform a sorting operation on the firstletter
> field but where the firstletter was 'a', 's' or 't' the returned list
> does not contain those records in sorted order (all other records are
> sorted correctly).
> 
> Here is my search command:
> 
> Hits hits = searcher.Search(query, new Sort(new SortField[] { new
> SortField("firstletter", SortField.STRING)}));
> 
> What I don't know is whether the fault lies in the indexing or in this
> or other code.  Does anyone know what could have happened.

> Thanks
