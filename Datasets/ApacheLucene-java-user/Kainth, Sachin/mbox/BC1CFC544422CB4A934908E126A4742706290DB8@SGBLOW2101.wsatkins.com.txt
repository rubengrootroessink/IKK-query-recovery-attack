Hi all,

Is it possible to search whether a term is equal to the entire contents
of a field rather than that the field contains a term?

So for example if I have a field with this text: "world cup" and I do a
search for "cup" I want it to return false but for another field that
contains exactly the text "cup" I want the result to be true.

Thanks in advance
