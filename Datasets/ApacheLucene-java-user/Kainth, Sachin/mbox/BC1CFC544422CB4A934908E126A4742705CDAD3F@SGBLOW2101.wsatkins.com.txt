Well,

I have an index with 5.2 million records (each record containing 3
fields) and it sometimes takes about a minute and a half for results to
come back.  I have noticed however, that when I run the same query the
second time the result comes back faster.  I just thought that this was
a bit too slow and that perhaps I should implement a caching strategy.

This is really an unanswerable question, since, to steal a phrase, "It
depends" <G>...

Do you have any reason to believe that the current performance is
inadequate for you application? Caching is notoriously difficult to get
right, so I wouldn't go there unless there is a *demonstrated* need. By
demonstrated, I mean that you run some tests against your actual data
with simulated queries and measure. By definition, Lucene's caching is
"any good" if your performance meets your target as is. Only if your
application does NOT meet your targets should you consider an additional
caching layer. And even in this case, I'd spend significant time looking
at exactly *where* in my application things were slow rather than jump
to caching as an answer.

I do not believe that Lucene actually caches the results of queries. I
believe that Lucene builds caches of terms, sorting information, etc.
that are then applied to all subsequent queries, and that these are the
caches that are built at the first query. So, say storing the results of
a query somewhere and returning that stored copy for the *next* query
that is identical is not something I'd expect Lucene to do.

Best
