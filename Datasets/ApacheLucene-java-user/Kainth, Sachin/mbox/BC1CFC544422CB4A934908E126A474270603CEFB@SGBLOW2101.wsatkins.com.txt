SUBJECT: Spanned indexes
DATE: 1 Mar 2007

Hi all,

Is it possible in Lucene for an index to span multiple files?  If so
what is the recommendation in this case?  Is it better to span after the
index reaches a particular size?  Furthermore, does Lucene ever span a
single record between two or more index files in this case or does it
ensure that a single record will only appear in one spanned file?

Many thanks for your advice

Sachin
