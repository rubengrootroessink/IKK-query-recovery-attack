Hi Erik, 

Thanks for the reply.  Since writing this I have in fact now implemented
the BitSet version and it works quite successfully.  However, I have now
found out that we will be dealing with millions of records and that for
this reason we can not use such a solution.  Can you tell me what solr
is as it seems to be more suited to my application?

Thanks

Sachin

There are two ways to go about this:

   1) Use Solr.

   2) If the number of unique artists and albums is reasonable enough,
build BitSet's in memory into a Map.  When someone searches for "love"
(and who doesn't?) get a BitSet of the matching documents (using a
HitCollector, or QueryFilter) and intersect it with all the ones in the
Map.  I use (but working on phasing things into a better fit with Solr
and scalability) this same scheme on Collex at <http://
www.nines.org/collex> for all the facets on the right (though I do
leverage some of Solr's goodies, my original implementation successfully
used the BitSet-Map-in-memory scheme (now I use TermQuery's-in-memory,
but leverage Solr's DocSet caching instead of  
BitSets).  Its very fast!   The cons to doing all this yourself is  
when things get bigger you gotta change how it works to scale, and Solr
already has a lot of infrastructure in place for this eventuality.
