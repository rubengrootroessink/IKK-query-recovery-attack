Hi all,

Just wondering how one would perform index maintainance.  I know how to
add new documents:

writer = new IndexWriter(IndexDirectory, new PorterAnalyzer(), false);

(incidently, I wrote PorterAnalyzer myself for the PorterStemFilter
since I couldn't find an analyzer using it)

But what I don't know is how do we delete documents from the index and
how we replace documents in the index where those documents have
changed.

Cheers

Sachin
