I might be missing something because TopDocs seems to only be about
finding the relevancy of documents and HitCollector doesn't seem to be
relavent either.

See TopDocs, HitCollector, etc. Don't iterate through a Hits objects to
get docs beyond, say, 100 since it's designed to efficiently return the
first 100 documents but re-executes the queries each 100 or so times you
advance to the next document.
