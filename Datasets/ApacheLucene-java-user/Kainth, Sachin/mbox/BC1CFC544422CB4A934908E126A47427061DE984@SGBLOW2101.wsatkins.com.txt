Hi Tony,

Lucene certainly does support it.  It just requires you to use a
tokeniser that performs stemming such as any analyzer that uses
PorterStemFilter.

All,

I'm evaluating Lucene as a full-text search engine for a project. I got
one of the requirements as following:

4) Plural Literal Search
If you use the plural of a term such as bears the results will include
matches to the plural term bears as well as the singular term bear.

it seems to me we need to build a dictionary to support it. Does Lucene
support it?

appreciate your help.

Tony
