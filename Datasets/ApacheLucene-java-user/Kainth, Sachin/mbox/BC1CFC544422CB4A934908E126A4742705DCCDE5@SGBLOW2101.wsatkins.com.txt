Hi all,

I have a few question regarding indexing documents.

1. With my experience of indexing documents with lucene so far I have
done things like:

Doc.Add(Field.Text("album", Album));

Where Album is a string representing an album name.  Now with this sort
of indexing what I do is a search such as:

"album:Thriller"

a) Does this mean that I cannot do an search across all fields  by
submitting the query:

"Thriller"?  In other words by submitting this query would my code
search all fields?

b) Is there a way in which I can index elements of a document without
naming the field.  What would the impact of such a use of the indexing
capabilities of Lucene be?

2. Is there a limit to the number of
a) named fields per document that I can store
b) non-named fields per document that I can store

3. 

a) Is it possible in Lucene to conduct searches that are very complex
such as:

((album = Thriller AND artist = (Michael OR Jackson)) OR (date between X
AND Y)) AND (label = sony OR Epic)   etc...

b) For such a query what are the performance penalties compared to a
simple search involving 1 term?

Cheers

Sachin
