Hi all,

I have an index in which dates are represented as ranges of two integers
(there are two fields one foreach integer).  The two integers are years.
AD dates are represented as a positive integer and BC dates as a
negative one  There are three possible types of ranges.  These are
listed below with example dates:

*	BC - BC (-2000 - -1000)
*	BC - AD (-1000 - 1000)
*	AD - AD (1000 - 1200)

What I want is to have a textbox in which the user enters a year (eg
1990) and all records for which that date falls within the record's date
range are returned.

What would be the query syntax for this?

Cheers
