SUBJECT: Multiple segments
DATE: 8 Mar 2007

Hi all,

I have been performing some tests on index segments and have a problem.
I have read the file formats document on the official website and from
what I can see it should be possible to create as many segments for an
index as there are documents (though of course this is not a great
idea).  Having searched around it occurred to be that the way to do this
is to set maxMergeDocs to 1.  Having tried this I found that it doesn't
work.  All documents still get put into one segment.  Any idea what I
should do?

Thanks
