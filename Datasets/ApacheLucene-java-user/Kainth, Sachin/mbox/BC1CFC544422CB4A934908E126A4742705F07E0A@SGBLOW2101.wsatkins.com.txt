SUBJECT: Index modification
DATE: 23 Feb 2007

Hi all,

I am using the IndexModifier class to perform index modification.  I
have deleted 1 document from an index and the output indicates that 1
document does indeed get deleted.  However, running the program again
reveals that the document deleted has appeared again in the index.  This
despite the fact that I close the IndexModifier after the deletion.
Does anyone know what I'm missing?  Here is my code:

       	Analyzer analyzer = new PorterAnalyzer();
            IndexModifier indexModifier = new IndexModifier("D:\\Index",
analyzer, false);
            Console.WriteLine(indexModifier.DocCount() + " docs in
index");
            //indexModifier.Delete(1);
            indexModifier.Delete(new Term("artist", "hot"));
            Console.WriteLine("Deleted a document");
            Console.WriteLine(indexModifier.DocCount() + " docs in
index");
            indexModifier.Close();

Cheers
