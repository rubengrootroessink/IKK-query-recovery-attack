I believe that this happens because "AND", "OR" and "NOT" are all
reserved words for joining together other search terms and therefore if
you don't want the exception thrown then you must capture any "AND",
"OR" and "NOT"s that are entered on their own and not pass them to the
QueryParser.

Hi All,

"When i searched for "AND", "OR", "NOT" as query, it gives me the
following Exception"

Exception in thread "main" org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException:
