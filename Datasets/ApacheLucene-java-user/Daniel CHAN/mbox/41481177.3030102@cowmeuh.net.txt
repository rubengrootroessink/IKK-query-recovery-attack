SUBJECT: Concurent operations with Lucene
DATE: 15 Sep 2004

Hi,

I'm currently developping a search engine for a few websites and would
like to use Lucene to do so. After reading some docs, a post on jGuru
states that some concurrent operations are forbidden with Lucene
(http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=913302). However, the post
dated from 2 years ago.

What I would like to know: is Lucene able to handle query concurrently
with delete operation ? (You can check the table on the jGuru page and
the posts at the bottom).

Cheers
