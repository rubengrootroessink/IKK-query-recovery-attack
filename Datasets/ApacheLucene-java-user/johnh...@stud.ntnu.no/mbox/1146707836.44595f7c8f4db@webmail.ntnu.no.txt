SUBJECT: Controlling the number of segments
DATE: 4 May 2006

Hi.

When I add new documents to my index, I sometimes end up with a larger
number of segments than i theoretically should be able to. I use all
the default settings.

If I have understood this right I should never experience more than nine
segments in my index when the mergeFactor is 10.

I would like to ensure that there are never more than nine segments in
my index. Have i misunderstood something? How can I fix this problem?

John
