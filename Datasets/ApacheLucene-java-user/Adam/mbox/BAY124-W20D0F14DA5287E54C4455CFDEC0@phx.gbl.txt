SUBJECT: Ordered Proximity searching, does it exist?
DATE: 21 Nov 2006


Dear Lucene Users,

Is there a way or has someone been able to implement an ordered proximity search. Lucene currently
uses the "word1 word2"~5 query to find tokens that are within 5 words of each other in any
order. What I've been asked to do is find only the results that are for instance within 5
words of each other in the order the query was written. 

For a scenario like


text:"blah blah blah. Section 1 of Primary Act 1976, s1. Dogs Act 1999, s3 blah blah blah"


Say  I wanted to find the Dogs Act Section 1 using text:"dogs act s1"~5 query would give the
above record when it wasn't in context. This is the reason for wanting results in order to
stop these incorrect results.


Any help would be greatly appreciated.

R
Adam
