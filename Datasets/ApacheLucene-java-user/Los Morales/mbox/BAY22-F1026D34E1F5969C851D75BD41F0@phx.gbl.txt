Hi Erik,

Thanks for the response.

So, I guess what I'm having a hard time trying to figure out is, what's the 
point of having an index when you can't search/retrieve the contents of a 
field in the index since it is not stored?  Isn't the whole point of having 
an index is to be able to search and retrieve the contents efficiently?

Basically I'm not sure the points of UnIndexed and UnStored fields types.  
Say I use a field type "unindexed" for my SSN.  I know its stored in the 
index but how am I suppose to retrieve it?
As for the unstored, its like the scenario I described above... I see the 
fields in the index but I won't be able to search/retrieve it since I don't 
have the contents.  The "text" field type makes sense to me (with data being 
a String), as well as the type "keyword".

Is there a scenario or scenarios you can describe where Unindexed/Unstored 
will be useful?  Thanks in advanced!
