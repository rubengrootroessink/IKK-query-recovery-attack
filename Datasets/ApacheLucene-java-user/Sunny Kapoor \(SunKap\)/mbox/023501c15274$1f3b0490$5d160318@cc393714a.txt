I'm interested in exploring deeper if Lucene is suitable for one of our projects and would
like to leverage specialist expertise. Is there any forum where specialist Lucene expertize
(evaluation and dev support) can be sought on commercial terms. 

not sure if this is the right forum to post this question and if so, my apologies in advance
with a request to be redirected to the appropriate forum. 

please advise..

Sun
