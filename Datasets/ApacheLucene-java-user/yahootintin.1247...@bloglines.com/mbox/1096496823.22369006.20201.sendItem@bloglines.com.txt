SUBJECT: IndexReader / IndexSearcher
DATE: 29 Sep 2004

I'm opening a new IndexReader for every search request which obviously isn't
the best option.

If I open a reader can I use the same searcher for multiple
requests that are happening simultaneously?  If I call close on the searcher
will it close for all the instances?
