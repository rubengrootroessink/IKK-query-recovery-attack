SUBJECT: Searching for asterisk in a term
DATE: 7 Jul 2004

Hi,

I'm trying to search for a term that contains an asterisk.  

This
is the field that I indexed:
- new Field("testField", "Hello *foo bar", true,
true, true);

I'm trying to find this document by matching '*foo':
- new
TermQuery(new Term("testField", "*me"));

I've also tried to escape the
* like this:
- new TermQuery(new Term("testField", "\\*me"));

Neither
of these queries return this document.  Is this type of search possible with
Lucene?

Thanks.
