SUBJECT: Re: Optimize not deleting all files
DATE: 4 Feb 2005

Yes, I believe my problem is related to open IndexReaders.  The issues is
that we can't shut down our live search application while we wait for a 10
minute optimization.  Search is a major part of our application and removing
the feature would significantly affect our end users (even though we run the
optimize during the night).

After the optimize is completed, I close and
re-open the readers so they start reading from the new index files.  I'm thinking
of adding code to delete all the old files at that point.  I presume they
will no longer be locked.
