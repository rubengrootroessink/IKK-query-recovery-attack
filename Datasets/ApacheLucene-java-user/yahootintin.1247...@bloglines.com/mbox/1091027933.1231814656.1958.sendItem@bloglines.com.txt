SUBJECT: When does IndexReader pick up changes?
DATE: 28 Jul 2004

Hi,

If I do this:

  - open index writer
  - add document
  - open
reader
  - search
  - close reader
  - close writer

Will the reader
pick up the document that was added to the index since it was opened after
the document was added?  Or will it only pick up changes that occur after
the index writer is closed?

Thanks for the help!
