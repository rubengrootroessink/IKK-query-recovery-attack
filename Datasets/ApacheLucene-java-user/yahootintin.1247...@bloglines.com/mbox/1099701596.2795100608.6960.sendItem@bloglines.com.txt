CORRECTION:

Ok, I simplified my test case a little...  I removed the UNC
share which is
a remote file share that Windows supports.

I have two processes
running
on the same Windows XP machine.
1) The first process uses an IndexWriter

to writes to the index and then closes the IndexWriter.  
2) The first process

sends a multicast event to the other process.
3) The other process receives
the multicast event opens an IndexReader.
4) Meanwhile, the first process
opens an IndexReader and performs a delete.  The IndexReader is then closed.

5) The first process opens an IndexWriter to add more documents.  At this
point the IndexWriter often gets an error: Lock obtain timed out

Any advice?
 Is this only a problem on Windows?

Here's the stack
trace:
java.io.IOException:
Lock obtain timed out: Lock@C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\lucene-9906f192fb41cc8775cf839213997b7e-commit.lock


    at org.apache.lucene.store.Lock.obtain(Lock.java:58)
    at org.apache.lucene.store.Lock$With.run(Lock.java:108)


    at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.mergeSegments(IndexWriter.java:501)


    at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.maybeMergeSegments(IndexWriter.java:458)


    at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.addDocument(IndexWriter.java:310)
