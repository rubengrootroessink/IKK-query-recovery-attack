SUBJECT: PhraseQuery with Wildcards?
DATE: 7 Jul 2004

Hi,

Is there any way to do a PhraseQuery with Wildcards?

I'd like to
search for:
  MyField:"foo bar*"

I thought I could cobble something together
using PhraseQuery and Wildcards but I couldn't get this functionality to work
due to my lack of experience with Lucene.

Is there a way to do this with
Lucene?

Thanks.
