SUBJECT: Storing dates as longs
DATE: 28 Jun 2004

Hi,

I'm storing my dates as longs.  The longs are converted to strings
and padded with zeros.

Am I going to run into issues with this?  Based
on other mailing list postings, I suspect that this may cause the "too many
boolean queries" issue when I search for date ranges.  Is this true?  What
are my options for getting around this issue?

Any advice is appreciated.

Thanks.
