SUBJECT: Optimize not deleting all files
DATE: 4 Feb 2005

Hi,

When I run an optimize in our production environment, old index are
left in the directory and are not deleted.  

My understanding is that an
optimize will create new index files and all existing index files should be
deleted.  Is this correct?

We are running Lucene 1.4.2 on Windows.  


Any help is appreciated.  Thanks!
