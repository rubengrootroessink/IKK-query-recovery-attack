SUBJECT: Exact match search
DATE: 12 Jul 2004

Hi,

I want to match documents that exactly equal a certain value, not just
contain it.

If I search for "foo" in Lucene I get back documents like these:

"foo"
"foo bar"
"bar foo"

Is there a way to just get the ones that exactly
equal the value I'm searching for?  In this case, I want to only return the
first document (ex. "foo").

I have a workaround where I store all the values
and then after I get the hits I go through them and skip those that don't
match.  But this will return result sets of hundreds of documents that I don't
need.

Help!
