DATE: 29 Oct 2004

Hi Christoph,

Thats what I thought.  But what I'm seeing is this:
- open
reader for searching
(the reader is opening an index on a remote machine
(via UNC) which takes a couple seconds)
- meanwhile the other service opens
an IndexWriter and adds a document
(the index writer determines that it needs
to merge so it tries to get a lock.  since the reader is still opening, the
IO exception is thrown)

I believe that increasing the merge factor will
reduce the opportunity for this to occur.  But it will still occur at some
point.

Thanks.

The IndexReader which gets opened by
