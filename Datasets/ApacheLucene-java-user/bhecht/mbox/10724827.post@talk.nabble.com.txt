SUBJECT: Implement a tokenizer
DATE: 21 May 2007


Hi there,

I was interested in changing the StandardTokenzier so it will not remove the
"+" (plus) sign from my stream.
Looking in the code and documentation, it reads: 

"If this tokenizer does not suit your application, please consider copying
this source code
directory to your project and maintaining your own grammar-based tokenizer."

I can't understand from this code where I should jump in, and do my change.
Can someone point me out to where I should look at in order perform my
change?

Thanks in advanced
