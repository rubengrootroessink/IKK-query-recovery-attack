Thanks Mark for the detailed explanation.
So one more question if I may:
How is the list shortened to to include <maxNumTerms> terms only?
In your example you had 2 stop words which of course are not included in the
token stream.
But what happens if you get more than maxNumTerms terms, how are the
maxNumTerms selected from the list?
Thanks.
