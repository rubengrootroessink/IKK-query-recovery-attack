I know indexing and searching need to use the same analyzer.

My question regarding "the way to go", was if it is a good solution to index
a content of a table, using more than 1 analyzer, determining the analyzer
by the country value of each record.

Couldn't find a post that describes exactly my problem, and I just want to
be sure this is how people with Lucene 
expiriance would have approached this problem.

Thanks
