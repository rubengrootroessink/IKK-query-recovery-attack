OK, thanks, I think I got it.

Just to see if I understood correctly:

When I do the search on both stemmed and unstemmed fields, I will do the
following:

1) If I know the country of the requested search -  I will use the stemmed
analyzer, and then the unstemmed field 
                                                                             
might not be found (the stemmed field will be found).

2) if I don't know the country of the requested search - I will use the
unstemmed analyzer, and then the stemmed field
                                                                                    
might not be found.

Am I correct?
