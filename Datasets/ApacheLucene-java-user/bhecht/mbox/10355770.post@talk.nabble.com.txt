OK, thanks for the reply.
The last option seems to be the right one for me, using a stemmed and
unstemmed field.
I assume when you mean "unstemmed", you mean indexing the field using the
UN_TOKENIZED parameter.

Now my problem starts, when trying to implement this with "Hibernate
Search", which allows only 1 analyzer to be defined.

Thanks, I will post my problem now in the Hibernate search forum.

Good day.
