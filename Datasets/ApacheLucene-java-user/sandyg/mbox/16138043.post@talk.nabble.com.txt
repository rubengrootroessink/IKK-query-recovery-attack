SUBJECT: Re: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space when sorting the fields
DATE: 19 Mar 2008


Hi,
And is it not passibe to sort on the result we get instead of on all the
values like
Hits       hits = searcher.search(query);
and it will be good if got sorting on the hits i.e on the result
because my sorting is based on specific  field and that field should be
sorted when i click on it.
thanks for the reply
