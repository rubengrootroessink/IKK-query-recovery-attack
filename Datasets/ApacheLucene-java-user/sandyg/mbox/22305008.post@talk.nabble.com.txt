SUBJECT: not updating caching
DATE: 3 Mar 2009


Hi All,

I had indexed some records and we found some searches are not found because
of some reason.
So again made changes and indexed it again, now we got hits for the query
from cmd prompt ,but this search is not updated in caching in server.

If i close and start the server it is works finely.Is it good to off the
caching for this purpose.(way to off caching).
Please is there any other way to come across this problem
