Thanks Folks

I'm in the business well over a decade now; Started my career in my country
of origin in Ireland, and have since lived & worked in UK and the US. I've
also traveled extensively establishing development groups in remote offices
for my company
in a few countries.

I've worked in several areas, from global publishing services, CRM's /
fulfillment systems, web server development, to technical operations and for
the past number of years have made a home for myself in search and local
search.

My background has been in CS, math and physics.
And despite the rumors my user name "pjaol" is actually an acronym of my
full name, which is only ever used
by my mother when I'm in trouble :-)

It will be a pleasure to continue working with all of you, and thank you
again for this honor.

Thanks
Patrick O'Leary
