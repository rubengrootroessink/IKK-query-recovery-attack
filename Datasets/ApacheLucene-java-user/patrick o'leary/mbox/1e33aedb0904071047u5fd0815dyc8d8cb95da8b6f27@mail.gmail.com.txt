DATE: 7 Apr 2009

You might want to play with both boosting and multiple sorting.
You might want to look at something like Solr's boost queries or boost
functions
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DisMaxRequestHandler#head-6862070cf279d9a09bdab971309135c7aea22fb3

Or if you want to go down the path of a custom score, most folks
override the customScore method of CustomScoreQuery

*//create a term query to search against all documents*
Query tq = *new* TermQuery(*new* Term(*"metafile"*, *"doc"*));
	
FieldScoreQuery fsQuery = *new* FieldScoreQuery(*"geo_distance"*, Type.FLOAT);
CustomScoreQuery customScore = *new* CustomScoreQuery(tq,fsQuery){
   @Override
   *public* *float* customScore(*int* doc, *float* subQueryScore,
*float* valSrcScore){
     .....
     return myFunkyScore;
   }
}


You can see a quick version in
