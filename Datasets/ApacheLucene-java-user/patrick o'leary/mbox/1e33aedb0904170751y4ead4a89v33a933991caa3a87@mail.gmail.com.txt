SUBJECT: Re: A Challenge!: Combining 2 searches into a single resultset?
DATE: 17 Apr 2009

I'd start by doing some research on the question rather than asking for a
solution..
What your asking for can be considered 'Federated Search'
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_search

And it can be conceived in as many ways as you have document types. Any
answer will probably end up
customized and weighted by your document silo value, usually companies
weight those by business rules
rather than head down the path of federated search, as it's just quicker and
cheaper, and you can accomplish more.
e.g
Medication = score *2  (as higher advertising incentives)
Diseases = score
Books = score * 0.75  ( thousands of books, which nobody buys etc..)

You might also want to try consolidating your data into 1 schema, and
consider layering or collapsing results
based on type.
