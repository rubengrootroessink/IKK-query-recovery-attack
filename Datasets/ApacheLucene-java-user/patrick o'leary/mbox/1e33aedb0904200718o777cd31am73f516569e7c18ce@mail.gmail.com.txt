Honestly I'm more focused on intelligent ways to do faster and more complex
GIS features.
As I said the most time consuming part is the DistainceFilter, which is

I'm playing with several ideas on how to do those better, and get a win
there.

However if anyone wants to jump in and try other improvements feel free.
