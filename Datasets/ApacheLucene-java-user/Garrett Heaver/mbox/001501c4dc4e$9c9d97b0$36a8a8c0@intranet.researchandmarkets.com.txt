DATE: 7 Dec 2004

Ok I upgraded to 1.4.3 but that didn't solve the issue - I was still ending
up with huge indexes. So I changed approach - Instead of handing the
addIndexes method IndexReaders I gave it the directory instead as the code
is slightly different - now index size is what I would expect it to be. I
haven't had time to check it out fully yet as to why - but from what I can
see the major difference in the two methods is that the
addIndexes(IndexReaders[]) uses the following

 if (segmentInfos.size() == 1)	// add existing index, if any
      merger.add(new SegmentReader(segmentInfos.info(0)));

Perhaps this is resulting in an unnecessary ballooning of the index?

I'll leave it for someone with a better understanding of the underlying file
system to answer...

Thanks
Garrett

Cheers for that Erik - believe it or not I'm still back at v1.3 (doh!!!)

Will try 1.4.3 tomorrow

Thanks

There was a bug in 1.4 (and maybe 1.4.1?) that kept some index files 
around that were not used.

Are you using Lucene 1.4.3?  It not, try that and see if it helps.
