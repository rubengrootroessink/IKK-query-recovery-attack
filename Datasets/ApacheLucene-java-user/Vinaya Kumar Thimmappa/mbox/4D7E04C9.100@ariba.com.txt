SUBJECT: Re: Indexing of multilingual labels
DATE: 14 Mar 2011

Hello Stephane,

I think a better way is to have resource file with different language 
and store pointer in the index to get to correct resource file ( 
Something like  I18N and L10N approach). Store the internationalised 
string in index  and all related localised string in resource file .

This way index size will be reduced (adding to payload would have impact 
on performance)
and help performance too.

Now your Total Search Time would be (searchtime+time to retrieve the 
language based data)

Hope this helps.
