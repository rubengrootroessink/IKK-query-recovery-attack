I am getting this problem as well, but have not been able to pinpoint the 
cause.

A tip for those who are doing a complete re-index.  You can save alot of 
time by creating a new index and then merging the old files into the new 
index.  One disadvantage here is that you may have to re-point your app to 
the new index.  I find that the bug prevents the old index from being 
deleted on Win2K.
