SUBJECT: Re: Indexing document instances and retrieving instance attributes
DATE: 15 Aug 2005

I'm still having problems finding a clean way of doing this. Currently
my index has
"_" filling in for empty fields in instances

DOC            1
FILEID         123
MIME           test/html
CONTENT    blam blam blam etc.
FILENAME   File1
DATE          090909
AUTH          _
SESSION    111111
FILENAME   File2
DATE          101010
AUTH          Jim Jones
SESSION    111112

I need to be able to search for session 111112 and return all of the
fields from the second instance. Is it possible to determine which
field a hit came from? (There could be a lot of instances, so I woud
prefer not to iterate through all of them doing String comparisons.)

Chris
