You'll probably have to provide a little more information, a little
bit of source will go a long way to being able to help.

But I can tell you that the _h59.cfs and such filenames are the index
files for lucene, so if you might want to make sure that you're not
doing am "index *" in the same directory you're storing the indexes.
