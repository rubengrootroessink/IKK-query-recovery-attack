You can write an analyzer to do your tokenizing so that you end up with 
21-MA-GAB being stored as [21magab] in the index. Assuming the codes
are formatted mostly the same. That's what I was suggesting, not use a
different analyzer. (If they're not the same then it becomes more
difficult)

The other problems you're describing with the descriptions could also
be solved with a proper analyzer. Add a "FRACTION" type to the lexical
grammar, and don't strip punctuation like the quote. Or synonym "1/2"
to "half" I guess (I haven't done much work with synonyms).

Lastly, and someone should correct me if I'm wrong, but you should
always use the same analyzer to create and to query the index.
Otherwise queries that should return hits wont. For instance the
following.

   The canoist paddles

Could be indexed as [boater] [strokes]... And the query

   contents:paddles

would be parsed to [paddle] and likely would not get the hit you expect.

Cheers,
Chris
