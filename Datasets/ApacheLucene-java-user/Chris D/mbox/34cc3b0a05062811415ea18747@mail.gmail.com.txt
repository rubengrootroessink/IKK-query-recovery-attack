There is a couple ways to do this, and I'm not sure which would be
best. (I'm also fairly new to lucene)

You can create a grammar that recognizes your product codes (see
StandardAnalyzer code for examples on how to do that) then use a
custom filter to normalize everything.

Forgive my poor lex but general idea

| <CODE: <NUM><NUM>  ("-"|"_"|""|" ") <ALPHA>+ ("-"|"_"|""|" ") <ALPHA>+

Then in the filter, normalize to strip out all of the punctuation.
This can be done with a regex or something faster but just for
reference.

   if (type == CODE_TYPE) {
      return new org.apache.lucene.analysis.Token(text.replaceAll("-",
""), t.startOffset(), t.endOffset(), type);
   } ... 

See StandardAnalyzer, it has a lot of code that would do what you need
and you can copy, paste and edit.

You could also do synonyms but that seems like it would be more overhead.

If you think of a better way, let me know, I have to do something similar.

Cheers,
Chris
