SUBJECT: Re: Indexing document instances and retrieving instance attributes
DATE: 11 Aug 2005

So I've decided I'm going to simply have empty fields, and that
brought up several other questions.

First, is there a limit on the number of fields per document?

Secondly why are fields in Document implemented with a Vector instead
of a HashSet or similar? Wouldn't retrieval be faster without
iterating through a list?

Lastly how difficult (or possible) is it to do something like extend
the Document class to have the functionality I want?

I know I'm likely missing a simple solution but I just can't see it.
