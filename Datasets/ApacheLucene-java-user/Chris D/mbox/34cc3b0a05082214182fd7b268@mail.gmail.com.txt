I did actually, mind you my index is a little strange in that there
may be 1000 fields or so sometimes (Which is why I started this thread
to begin with :-)). But when I do a getFields("author") for each hit,
it would have to iterate through all of the fields for every hit... So
for 100 hits it iterates through all 1000 fields everytime that's a
total of 100000 iterations. If the number of hits get reasonably large
it might take a fair amount of time. I don't have a test case proving
an actual time benefit but I could probably write one tomorrow if you
think it would be interesting. (It's the end of the work day here so
I'm going home now to non-lucene activities)

Cheers,
Chris
