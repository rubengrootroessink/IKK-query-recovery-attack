I did some more investigation... This method is the culprit

  public FieldInfo fieldInfo(int fieldNumber) {
    return (FieldInfo) byNumber.get(fieldNumber);
  }
 
   The fieldNumber is -1 when it's read by 

   return new Term(fieldInfos.fieldName(input.readVInt()),
            new String(buffer, 0, totalLength), false);

   in SegmentTermEnum.readTerm.

Thinking it might be my application I also ran Limo just to check,
Limo (which is also a tomcat application) crashed with the same error.
 Is there an issue with Tomcat and large indexes? Should I be looking
elsewhere for a solution?
