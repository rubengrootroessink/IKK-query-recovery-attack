Hello,
I have downloaded the required files of Lucene. I have no permissions to set the classpath
in the server. My site is running on Apache Tomcat. I have been given one root directory and
one web-inf directory. e.g

/somename
  |
  |
  /web-inf
    |
    |
    /classes
   /lib

Now where should I place these jar files? In the /lib dir?  I am having MS SQL Server, Will
this help me get my work easy?. I need to search for .jsp files and .html files. Is this possible?
Is there any website running with Lucene? Please guide me.

Thanks
Uma
