Ok, I got it to work. I can now see a list of search results. But when I
click on the links in those search results, I get that  the file is not
found. It has this URL
http://localhost:8080/webapps/tomcat-docs/catalina/docs/api/org/apache/catal
ina/deploy/Test.html

I dont even see http://localhost:8080/webapps is working either. What could
be the problem?
