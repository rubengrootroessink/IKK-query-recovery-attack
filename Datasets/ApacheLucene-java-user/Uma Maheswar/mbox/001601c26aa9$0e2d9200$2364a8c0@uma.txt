SUBJECT: I need help with lucene
DATE: 3 Oct 2002

Hello,
I have downloaded lucene-1.2.jar, lucene-demos-1.2.jar and lucene-.12.zip files.

I wanted to add search functionaly to my website www.javagalaxy.com. I do not have any idea
of how to work with lucene. What should I do now? Where should I copy and what is the form
that I should prepare to make sure that my lucene works perfectly as a normal search engine
in other sites.

Thanks
