SUBJECT: Configuration in Standalone
DATE: 15 Nov 2002

Hello,
I am trying to do search for Standalone. I made it up to configuration level. All is working
well. But when I try to search in
http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/index.jsp , I get
Welcome to the Lucene Template application. (This is the header) 

ERROR opening the Index - contact sysadmin!

While parsing query: C:\opt\lucene\index not a directory


Jakarta Lucene Template WebApp 1.0 

These are the steps that I have followed


C:\Progra~1\Apache Tomcat 4.0\java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index mysearch
..
I got a directory named "mysearch" in c:\Progra~1\Apache Tomcat 4.0\mysearch
I got a direcotory named "luceneweb" in tomcat\webapps\luceneweb after copying luceneweb.war
file to tomcat/webapps

 I have already configured the configuration.jsp and made changes to indexLocation as C:\\Program~1\ApacheTomcat
4.0\mysearch; I am attaching my configuration.jsp for your review.

I updated my .war file too. But why am I getting this error?

Thanks
