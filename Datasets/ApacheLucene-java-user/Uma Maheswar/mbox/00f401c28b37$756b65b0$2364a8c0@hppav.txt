Thanks Steve,
Can you help me get started? I have downloaded lucene-1.2.jar and
lucene-demos-1.2.jar and I have placed them in web-inf/lib directory of my
web server (http://www.javagalaxy.com). I do not know what to do next.

I read the documents that came with .zip file. But they are all for
localhost:8080, I need lucene for my website. Could any one guide me with
steps to successfully make lucene work in my website?

Thanks
Uma
