SUBJECT: Concurrent read and write
DATE: 21 Jan 2005

I am a little fuzzy on the thread-safeness of Lucene, or maybe just java.  
From what I understand, and correct me if I'm wrong, Lucene takes care of 
concurrency issues and it is ok to run a query while writing to an index.

My question is, does this still hold true if the reader and writer are being 
executed as separate programs?  I have a cron job that will update the index 
periodically.  I also have a search application on a web form.  Is this going 
to cause trouble if someone runs a query while the indexer is updating?
