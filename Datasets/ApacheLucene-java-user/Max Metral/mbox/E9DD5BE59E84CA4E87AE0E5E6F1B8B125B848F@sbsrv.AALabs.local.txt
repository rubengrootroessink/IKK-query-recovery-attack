I'm not sure this would fall primarily under recommenders... I would assume Facebook is doing
"look-ahead" on connections.  i.e. A->B, B->C, so suggest A->C.  Then they weight
the suggestions by the number of indirect links between A and C and probably other factors
(which is where the generic "recommender" stuff may come in).  I think the bigger challenge
here is storing the connections in such a way that the lookahead is easy, and I don't think
Lucene will help you much there.

I've always assumed the right approach for these systems is to "blow out" the connections
in a db, i.e. if I care about three levels, I insert a row for direction connections, connections
resulting from direct, and connections resulting from that.  Storage is cheap, disk speed
is low, etc.  But not sure if there's a more intelligent way to do that.

It reminds me a bit of another common problem I don't think I've seen an efficient system
for yet - AJAX prefix matching (I type McD and you search millions of entries to bring back
McDonalds and others).  People say use NGram for that, but there must be some sort of tree
like data structure which would be more efficient.

You might try looking in a list that talks about recommender systems.
Google hits:
