In our app, we search for businesses.  So here's an example:

 

Lululemon Athletica

 

I'd like any of these search terms to work for this:

 

Lulu lemon

Lu Lu Lemon

Lululemon

 

What strategy would be optimal for this kind of thing (of course keeping
in mind negative matches are also bad)?  Right now we're using Snowball
Analyzer.  It's a wiki, so one answer so far has been "let the user
deal," and we have a way of specifying "also known as", but for this
case I feel like that shouldn't be required.

 

Thanks!
