SUBJECT: Snowball Analyzer and apostrophes
DATE: 17 Jun 2008

So I'm using Snowball Analyzer on a field for business titles.  The
value "Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe" becomes "charli sandwich shopp".  This
happens partly because the StandardAnalyzer strips off the apostrophe-s
entirely, and then the Snowballer takes off the e.  The problem is when
someone comes in to search for Charlies, without the apostrophe, they
get no match because in THAT case, Snowballer produces "charl" as the
term.  Thoughts on best approach for solving this?  Do I expand it to
become "{charl,charli} sandwich shop"?  Should I strip apostrophe's
before feeding the beast?

 

Thanks
