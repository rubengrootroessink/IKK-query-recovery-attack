Interesting, what are your merge settings, which JDK are you
using?(there are big differences between versions). Have you tried with
hyperthreading turned off on #2? - if so did it fare any differently?

Regards,
John

| Config #1 (a notebook):
| WinXP Pro, NTFS, 1.8GHz Pentium-M, 768Megs memory, 7200RPM winchester
|
| Config #2 (a desktop PC):
| SuSE 9.1 Pro, resiefs, 3.0GHZ P4 HT (virtually two 3.0GHz P4s), 3GByte
RAM, 15000RPM U320 SCSI
| winchester
|
| You can see that the hardware of #2 is at least twice better/faster
than #1.

| Currently #2 can't amazingly outperform the notebook (#1).
|
| The question is: What can be worse in #2 than on the poor notebook?
|
| I can imagine only software problems.
| Which are the sotware parts then?
| 1. The OS
| Is SuSE 9.1 a LOT slower than WinXP pro?
| 2. The file system
| Is reisefs a LOT slower than NTFS?
