SUBJECT: scoring adjacent terms without proximity search

Hi,

Without using a proximity search i.e. "cheese sandwich"~5

What's the best way of up-scoring results in which the search terms are
closer to each other? 

E.g. so if I search for:
content:cheese  content:sandwich

How do you ensure that a document with content:
"Toasted Cheese Sandwich"
scores higher then:
"Cheese and Potato, Tuna sandwich"

Joel
