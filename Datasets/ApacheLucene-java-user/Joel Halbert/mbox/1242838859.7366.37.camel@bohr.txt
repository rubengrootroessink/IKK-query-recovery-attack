SUBJECT: RangeQuery & TooManyClausesException : Lucene 2.4
DATE: 20 May 2009

Hi,

Looking at the docs for the 2.4 codebase, for RangeQuery
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/index.html?org/apache/lucene/search/RangeQuery.html

there is a comment that a TooManyClauses exception is no longer thrown.

Does this mean that it is now safe to use RangeQuery without worrying
about excessive term expansion? Has the implementation changed such that
it is no longer constructing multiple BooleanQuery terms to perform a
range query?

Thx,
Joel
