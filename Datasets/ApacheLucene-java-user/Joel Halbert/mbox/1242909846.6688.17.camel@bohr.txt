SUBJECT: Does Lucene fail fast on boolean queries?
DATE: 21 May 2009

Hi,

When Lucene performs a Boolean query, say:

Field Name = Male
AND
Field Age = 30

assuming the resultant docs for each portion of the query were:

Matching docs for:  Name = 1,2
Matching docs for:  Age = 1,2,5,10

Will Lucene stop searching for documents matching the Age term once it
has found documents 1 and 2 ? 
i.e. since 5 and 10 will not be used will it stop searching at document
number 2 ?

Thx,
Joel
