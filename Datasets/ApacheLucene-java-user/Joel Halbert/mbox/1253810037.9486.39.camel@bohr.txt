It's really hard to say anything meaningful here. How many fields? Whatkind
of sorting to you intend to do? How complex are the queries you
expect?

And even if you have meaningful answers to the above,
then "it depends" (tm).

Then you could go to SOLR (which is built on Lucene) to handle
distributed searching and a host of other infrastructure issues.

There are certainly Lucene installations out there that are much larger
than you're considering if that helps.

But you can create a small test app *very* quickly that'll help you
answer this for your local set of conditions, which might be a good
place to start.

Don't forget the "powered by" section of the Wiki for some ideas:
