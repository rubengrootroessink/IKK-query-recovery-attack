SUBJECT: Optimal Solution for Unique Field Values
DATE: 15 Feb 2009

Hi,

I'm looking for an optimal solution for extracting unique field values.
The rub is that I want to be able to perform this for a unique subset of
documents...as per the example:

I have an index with Field1 and Field2.

I want "all unique values of Field1 where Field2=X".

Other than actually performing a query, where I select all documents
that satisfy the condition Field2=x and then collecting the unique field
values myself by iterating across the hits, is there a way of leveraging
the indexreader, and enumerating across Fields, something like the
general example given here:

Thx,
Joel
