SUBJECT: Upper limit on number of Fields
DATE: 15 Feb 2009

Hi,

Is there any practical limit on the number of fields that can be
maintained on an index?

My index looks something like this, 1 million documents. For each group
of 1000 documents I might have 10 indexed fields. This would mean in
total about 10000 fields. Am I going to run into any issues here?

The index in Ram based.

Rgs,
Joel
