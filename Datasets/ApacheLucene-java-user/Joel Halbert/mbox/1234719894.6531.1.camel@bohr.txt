Presumably there is no score ordering to the hit id's lucene delivers to
a HitCollector? i.e. they are delivered in the order they are found and
score is neither ascending or descending i.e. the next score could be
higher or lower that the previous one?

The HitCollector used will determine how things are ordered. In 2.4, the 
TopDocCollector will order by relevancy and the TopFieldDocCollector can 
order by
relevancy, index order, or by field. Lucene delivers the hit ids to the 
HitCollector and it can order as it pleases.
