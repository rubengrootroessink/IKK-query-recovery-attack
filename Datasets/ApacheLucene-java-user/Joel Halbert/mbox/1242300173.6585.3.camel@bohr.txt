You can use your Analyzer to get a token stream from any text you give
it, just like Lucene does.

Something like:



String text = "your list of words to analyze and tokenize";

TokenStream ts = YOUR_ANALYZER.tokenStream(null, new
StringReader(text));
Token token = new Token();

while((ts.next(token)) != null) {
	String t = new String(token.termBuffer()).substring(0,
token.termLength());
	System.out.println("Got token " + t);
}

Hi,

I'm rather new to Lucene and could use some help.

My Analyzer uses a set of filters (PorterStemFilter, LowerCaseFilter,
WhitespaceTokenizer). I need to replicate the effect of these filters
outside of the normal Lucene pipeline. Basically I would like to input a
String from one end and get a processed String or String[] from the
other end.

Is there a good way to do this? I'm trying to figure it out myself but
in case I fail, maybe someone from here could give some advice?

Thank You!
Marek
