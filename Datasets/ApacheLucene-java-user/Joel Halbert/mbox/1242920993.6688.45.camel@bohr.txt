TrieRangeQuery - thanks for the tip.

Lucene has a simple heuristic (in ConjunctionScorer): it first calls
next() on each of X and Y, then it looks at that first docID for each
and re-orders the clauses so that whichever of X or Y had the largest
first docID is the one that "drives" the intersection.  But that
heuristic could easily be wrong if it just so happened that a rare
term appears in an early document.  A simple improvement would be to
add an approxCount() to Query or Scorer/DocIdSet and then order based
on that.  But we haven't done so yet...

If the RangeQuery will hit lots of terms and/or docs, you're likely
better off building the filter; else, the query.  Test both and let
the machine tell you :)

But: orthogonal to that decision, you should look @ TrieRangeQuery (in
2.9-dev, contrib/queries) which does numeric filtering typically with
far fewer terms needing to be visited.
