"but in some cases the search returns too many results"
do you *really* mean you get "too many results"? or do you actually mean
you get a "too many terms" exception due to the query expansion?

Hi,

I am using RegexQuery aiming to get a list of records from a regular
expression, but in some cases the search returns too many results, and for
that my program throws an Exception.

How could I customize the query or the searcher to, for example, get just a
set of results?

Thank you so much!!
