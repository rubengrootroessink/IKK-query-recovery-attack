SUBJECT: Term precendence
DATE: 15 Feb 2009

When constructing a query, using a series of terms e.g.

Term1=X, Term2=Y etc...

does it make sense, like in sql, to place to most restrictive term query
first?

i.e. if I know that the query will be mainly constrained by the value of
Term1, does having this as the first in the query make the execution of
the query any faster than if it were the second term?

Rgs,
Joel
