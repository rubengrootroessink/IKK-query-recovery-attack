SUBJECT: metrics for index ~100M docs
DATE: 24 Sep 2009

Hi,

Does anyone know of any recent metrics & stats on building out an index
of  ~100mm documents (each doc approx 5k). I'm looking for approx stats
on time to build, time to query and infrastructure requirements (number
of machines & spec) to reasonably support an index of such a size.

Thanks, 
Joel
