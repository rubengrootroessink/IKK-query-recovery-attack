SUBJECT: Filters - at what stage are they applied?
DATE: 19 Feb 2009

Hi,

By way of clarification, when a filter is used with a search query, is
the filter applied only to documents that matched the search query or is
it applied to all documents in the index before the query is executed?

Rgs,

Joel
