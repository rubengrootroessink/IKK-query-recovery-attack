SUBJECT: Integrating lucene search with adobe search
DATE: 15 Aug 2005

Hello all,
  After I do my search and display the hits I get back I would like to pass the seach string
that I used with lucene to acrobat reader when it opens.  Has any one done this or has anyone
seen any documents on how to do it?

Thanks,

Andrew
