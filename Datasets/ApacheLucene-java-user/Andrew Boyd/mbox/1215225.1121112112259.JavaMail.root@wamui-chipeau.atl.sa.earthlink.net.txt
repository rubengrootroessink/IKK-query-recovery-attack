What about storing the unstemed word with the same position as the stemmed word.  Would that
show up in the TermVectors?

You can get the unstemmed word by re-analysing the
(hopefully stored somewhere) text.
Look at the tokens emitted from the TokenStream and
when you get to the one that matches the stemmed form
you can use the token offset info to retrieve the
unstemmed form from the original text. 

Another option which avoids re-analysis is to store
the TermVector with TermPositionVector info enabled.
All the offsets are then stored in the index, rather
than computed on-the-fly by an Analyzer.

The highlighter in the sandbox can use both of these
approaches to get the original forms.

Cheers
Mark
