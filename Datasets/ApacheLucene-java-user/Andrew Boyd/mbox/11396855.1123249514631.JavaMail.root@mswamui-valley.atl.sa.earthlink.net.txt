You might want to look at stemming for "de pluralization"  it boils down words to their "root"

So bombs and bomming get stemmed to bomb.

I'm using the snowball stemmer, which handles different languages as well as english.
It is in the sandbox.  
org.apache.lucene.analysis.snowball.SnowballFilter;

Hope this helps,

Andrew

Its not an analyzer, but the "norm" feature of this tool does a good job 
at getting to the normalized form of the words...

Creating an analyzer from it is fairly straightforward.
