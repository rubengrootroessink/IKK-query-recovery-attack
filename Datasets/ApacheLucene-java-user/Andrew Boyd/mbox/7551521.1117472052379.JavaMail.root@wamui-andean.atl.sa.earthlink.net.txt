SUBJECT: Stemming at Query time
DATE: 30 May 2005

Hi All,
  Now that the QueryParser knows about position increments has anyone used this to do stemming
at query time
and not at indexing time?  I suppose one would need a reverse stemmer.  Given the query breath
it would need to inject breathe, breathes, breathing etc.

One benifit is that if you ever wanted to change your stemming algorithm you would not have
to re-index.
Also your index would be closer to the actual documents.

Comments?
