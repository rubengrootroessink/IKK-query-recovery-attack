Andrew,

There are a couple different open parameters that can be passed in when
opening a PDF.  See
http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/PDFOpenParameters.pdf
for the complete specification but an example for a url would be

http://www.pdfbox.org/index.pdf#search="pdfbox"

It also possible to pass it in when opening from the command line.
