Thanks for the pointers

I'm going to store the long as E086.656530 or W086.656530 

and the lat as N34.74212 or S34.74212

that should at least keep the lexographic search happy.

I'm still reading the math pointer.

thanks!

Andrew

Hello Andrew,

There already is a plugin available for Nutch :
http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/GeoPosition
I think that one can easily integrate it into a lucene app (i'll make
some experimentations with it soon)

AB> Hi All,
AB>   I'm wanting to do some range queries using latitude and longitude.

AB> I have numbers like so:

AB> long           lat     
AB> -84.65532   32.74212

AB> What would be the best way to store this in lucene so I can do a range query?

AB> Also for all you smart people out there do you know the
AB> distance between the decimal places?
AB> What I mean is if the long is constant what is the distance
AB> (miles, kilometers, feet etc) between

AB> 32.74213 - 32.74212   = .00001 = ?distance?
AB> 32.74222 - 32.74212   = .00010 = ?distance?

AB> Thanks,

AB> Andrew
