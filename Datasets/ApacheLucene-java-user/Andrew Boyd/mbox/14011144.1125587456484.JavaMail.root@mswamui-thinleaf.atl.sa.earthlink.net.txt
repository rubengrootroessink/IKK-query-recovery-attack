If I do a proximity search "terma termb"~10 that will get me the documents that have terma
within 10 words of termb.  But how can I get all the terms

instead of just the documents.

Thanks,

Andrew

PhraseQuery, or "termA termB"~10 syntax with QueryParser, provides  
term distance capability as well.  SpanNearQuery certainly will do  
the trick, and has an advantage over PhraseQuery in that it can be  
ordered or unordered whereas PhraseQuery is always irrelevant of order.

There are code examples in the Lucene in Action code found at http://

By the way, did you see we got slashdotted?  <http://
