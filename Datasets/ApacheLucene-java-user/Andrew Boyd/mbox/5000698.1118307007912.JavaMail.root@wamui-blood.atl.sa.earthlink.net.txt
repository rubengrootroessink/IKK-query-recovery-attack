Kevin,
  Those results are awsome.  Could you please give those of us that were following but not
quite understanding everything some pseudo code or some more explaination?

Thanks,

andrew

Well this was a BIG win.  Just benchmarking it out shows a 10x -> 50x 
performance increase.

Times in milliseconds:

Before:

duration: 1127
duration: 449
duration: 394
duration: 564

After:

duration: 182
duration: 39
duration: 12
duration: 11

The values of 2-4  I'm sure are due to the filesystem buffer cache but I 
can't imagine why they'd be faster in the second round.  It might be 
that Linux is deciding not to buffer the document blocks.
