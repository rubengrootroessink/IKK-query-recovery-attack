SUBJECT: How to get the un-stemed word
DATE: 8 Jul 2005

Hi all,
  I am using the snowball stemmer and for all my searches that works fine.
However,  I have a need to display the un-stemmed word after doing some term vector analysis.

I was thinking that I might insert the real word at the same position as the stemed word but
give
the real word a type of say "r-word".  My question is how can I get the r-word from the TermVectors?

If there is not a way to get it from the TermVector is there a way to search/retrieve by token
type?

Thanks,

Andrew
