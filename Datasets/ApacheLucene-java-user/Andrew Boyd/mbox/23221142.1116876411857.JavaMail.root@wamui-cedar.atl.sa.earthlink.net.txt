SUBJECT: URL search causes BooleanQuery TooManyClauses Excp
DATE: 23 May 2005

Hi All,
  I have an index with 4811 documents each of which have a field called
url.  When I try to search such as:

url:http*C02MS00800* I get a BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses.

I've seen other posting with this exception but they normally are caused by doing a range
query.  Any Ideas?  I would ultimatly like to search the url with wildcard search so as to
search
on enbedded info within the url such as state 

url:http*NY*  = state of new york
url:http*NJ* = new jersey  etc.

Thanks,

Andrew
