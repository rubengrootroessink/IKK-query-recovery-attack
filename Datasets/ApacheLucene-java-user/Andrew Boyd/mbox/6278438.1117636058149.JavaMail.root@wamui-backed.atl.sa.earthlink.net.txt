Hi Andrew,

Coming up with an answer... sorry for the delay.

Yes, most clustering methods are based just on that (term-vector
matrix). Carrot also uses this internally, but builds its own data
structure from the provided data instead of relying on Lucene's. It
shouldn't be a problem to write a clustering plugin to Carrot that
actually uses the term-vector data from Lucene.

The question is ill-defined, I'm afraid. "top 5 key terms" are very 
subjecting and depend on the strategy of score calculation, the way 
you're pruning stop words, etc.

**** What I meant was the top 5 terms of a document where top is based on 
wi = tfi * IDFi

I also don't get the: "each of the top ten documents". Do you mean: each 
of the ten top documents within a cluster?

**** with the carrot demo you used the top 100 documents returned from the query.  I really
meant the top n documents from the query.

**** I hope I'm more clear now.  Thanks for the response.  
Andrew
