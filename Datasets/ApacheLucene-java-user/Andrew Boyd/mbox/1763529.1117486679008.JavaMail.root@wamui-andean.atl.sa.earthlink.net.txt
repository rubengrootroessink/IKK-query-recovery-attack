SUBJECT: How to build 1.9-rc1 sandbox?
DATE: 30 May 2005

In trunck/java I've built ant compile-core

changing to trunck/java/contrib the only target is build-tree

but I get a lot of compiler errors such as package org.apache.lucene.analysis does not exist.

Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks,

Andrew
