SUBJECT: Clustering Carrot2 vs TermVector Analysis
DATE: 30 May 2005

Hi All,
  By using the carrot demo:
http://www.newsarch.com/archive/mailinglist/jakarta/lucene/user/msg03928.html

 I was able to easliy cluster search results based on the fields used by carrot( url, title,
and summary).  
However I was wondering if there was a way to do something similar using term vector analysis
and the built in TermVector / Similarity api.

Please bear with me as I'm just learning about term vector analysis mostly from:
http://www.miislita.com/term-vector/term-vector-1.html

Where it discusses wi = tfi * IDFi

I've ordered the book Information Retrieval: Algorithms and Heuristics but it has not shown
up yet.

Any way here is my question:

After doing a typical lucene search how can I get the  top 5 "key terms" for each of the top
ten documents.  I was thinking that I sum these and then have a type of cluster.

When we do a search we have the query vector that we use to get the similarity used for ranking.
So when we do a query the query terms are the "key terms".  If we dont have a query vector
is there a way to get the "key terms" from a document?  Of course there if tf but every thing
I'm reading says that tf is not ideal.  So I guess my question boils down to 

     how using the lucene api can I get the top 5 wi= tfi * IDFi of a given document.

If you have any suggestions or if I'm off base I'd really appreciate the help.

Thanks,

Andrew
