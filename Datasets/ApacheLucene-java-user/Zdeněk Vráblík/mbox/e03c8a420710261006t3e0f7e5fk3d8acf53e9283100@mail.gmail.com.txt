SUBJECT: fuzzy search MultifieldQueryParser - Lucene 2.2
DATE: 26 Oct 2007

Hi all,

How could I set fuzzy search in MultifieldQueryParser?

It works if query string ends with ~, but how to switch it on for all query?

I would like to search without fuzzy and if nothing is found I would
like to search with fuzzy search.

Thanks.

Regards,
Zdenek
