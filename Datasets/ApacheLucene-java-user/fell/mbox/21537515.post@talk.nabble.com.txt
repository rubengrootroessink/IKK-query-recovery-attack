SUBJECT: Lucene search question
DATE: 19 Jan 2009


Hi all, 

I am new to Lucene and I need to know the following: 

In case I have indexed some data using Lucene and it contains the fields: 
Location, City, Country. 

Suppose the data is as follows in the index in each of the above fields: 
1) R G Heights 
2) London 
3) United Kindom 

If i try to search the index by putting the following in my query : 
1) RG Heights (Please not R and G do not have space in the middle) or 
2) RGHeights. (no space at all) or   
3) R  G      Heights. (extra space between tokens), 
4) Kingdom United. 

Please tell me if lucene would come up with a positive result or would it
tell me 'no hits'. 

Please let me know this for each of the queries above! 

Thanks!
