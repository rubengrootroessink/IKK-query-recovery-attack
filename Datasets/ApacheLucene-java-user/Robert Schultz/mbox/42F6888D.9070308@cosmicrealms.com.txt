SUBJECT: New Site Live Using Lucene
DATE: 7 Aug 2005

Not sure if this is appropriate or not, but I just put live a web site 
that I have been working on for over a year, and it uses Lucene for all 
it's searching.

I have 46 million documents in 15 Lucene index's, although the vast 
majority of those consist of only a few words.
The Lucene index's take up about 6GB of space.

I wrote a Java daemon to listen on a socket, and accept connections from 
my PHP scripts in order to do the searching.

The results from Lucene include ID numbers that are linked up with MySQL 
records thus forming the resulting web page.

You can see the site here: http://csourcesearch.net

It's a website that allows you to search over 99 million lines of open 
source C/C++ code :)

Anyways, just wanted to say thanks a lot for such a great product (even 
if it is java *snicker*)

Thanks again Lucene! :)
