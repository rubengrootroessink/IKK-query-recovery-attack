SUBJECT: looking for efficient way to dump index info
DATE: 19 Jun 2008

Hello list,
I need to generate a report with all the terms, the document ids where 
they appear and the score in each document.
My current approach is to get a Term enumeration from the index and 
construct a query for each of them.

But as I am a newbie with the library I wonder if there is a better 
approach.


best regards,
Gerardo
