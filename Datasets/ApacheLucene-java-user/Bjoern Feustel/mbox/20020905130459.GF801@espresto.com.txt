  first of all: Search results are composed of stored fields. You can
store whatever description you like.

I think you are using HTML-parser that ships with lucene. Since i've
never used it i cant tell you anything for this parser and how you
can decide what data will be stored.

I've used JTidy (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy/) to parse my
very-real-world-HTML-files. Then i decided manually what to index and
what to store. This works fine for me and i can store all information i
like to present the user.

Dont know wheter this helps,

  Bjoern
