SUBJECT: Unable to compile FrenchAnalyser and DutchAnalyser
DATE: 3 Jun 2007

Hello,

 

Im trying to recompile the FrenchAnalyser and DutchAnalyser but I have the
following errors (among many others of the same type):

 

.................................

                        private boolean isVowel(char ch) {

                        switch (ch)

                        {

                                   case 'Ã¢':

                                   case 'Ã ':

                                   case 'Ã«':

                                   case 'Ã©':

                                   case 'Ãª':

                                   case 'Ã¨':

                                   case 'Ã¯':

                                   case 'Ã®':

                                   case 'Ã´':

                                   case 'Ã¼':

.................................

                                   

 

The IDE says Too many characters in character litteral and the compilation
unclosed character literal

 

Help would be very appreciated !
