SUBJECT: Extracting a subset of an index
DATE: 3 Apr 2007

Hi folks,
I need to extract a subset of an index so that I can move some documents to
another isolated machine to be searched locally. I'm not sure whether the
following scenario is correct:
- extracting the documents from the index by using one of the doc(i) methods
- adding the same Document objects to a fresh index.

Am I right?
