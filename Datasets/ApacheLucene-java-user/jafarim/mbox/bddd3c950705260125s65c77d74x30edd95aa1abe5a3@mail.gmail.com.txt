SUBJECT: Sorting direction
DATE: 26 May 2007

Hi folks,

- I am wondering whether there is any mechanism to specify the sorting
direction (i.e. ascending/descending) without being obliged to make a custom
Sorter. I add a "timeOfIndexing" field in order that I can retrive results
based ob recentness later. But the sorter sorts in an ascending manner and
hence, old results are top results.

- Can I count on Sorter.INDEX_ORDER instead of "timeOfIndexing" field for
this purpose?

regards,
