SUBJECT: updating a single searcher in MultiSearcher
DATE: 14 Apr 2007

hi list,
I am using a ParallelMultiSearcher in order to search a number of indices.
As the rate of input to the index is very high I have to check
indexSearcher.isCurrent quite often and have to reopen the index. There are
however to issues:

- In order to have a current version of a searcher, do I have to get a new
instance of the underlying fsDirectory (on which I have built the searcher)
too?
- My only choice now seems to be reopening the corresponding Searcher and
then creating another MultiSearcher object from the Searchers vector. Is
there any way to reopen only one of the underlying Searchers in
MultiSearcher without destroying the MultiSearcher object?
