I am trying to fetch similar results to a Document in the index. The problem
are myriad of irrelevant hits the score of which is less than 1 percent. I
was thinking to write this class in order to omit these results. I can't use
TopDoc because the number of *really* similar results can be known a priori.
There might be hundereds or only 10 relevant hits...
