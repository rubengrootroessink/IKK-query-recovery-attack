SUBJECT: Top Score Collector
DATE: 22 Apr 2007

Hi list.
I am trying to implement some TopScoreHitCollector class; a kind of
TopDocCollector which collects the documents the score of which is higher
than a threshold. The threshold will be configurable in the constructor of
the class. There is seemingly a document starvation about TopDocCollector as
I could not find anything other than javadocs. My copy of lucene book seems
to be too old and could not provide any help in this regard. I know this
must be quite easy but I don't know where to start. Any help?
