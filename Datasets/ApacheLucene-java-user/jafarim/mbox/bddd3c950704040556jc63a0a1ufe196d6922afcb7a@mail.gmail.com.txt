SUBJECT: Field.lazy setter method?
DATE: 4 Apr 2007

Hi
I wonder why there is not setter method for the "lazy" member variable in
Field class. Does that mean the propoerty is nominal and setting it does not
have any effect, or am I missing some point?
Any way, is there any way to tell lucene that a field is to be lazy-loaded,
from the very beginning of field construction?
