SUBJECT: Search within multiple different subfolders
DATE: 20 Jun 2006

Hi all,
I'm a new user of Lucene and wanted to know if Lucne can search multiple data directories
which these directories do not have similar parent? 
e.g. I have a directory named "father" and i have a subDirectory called "son" and i have another
directory called "mother" with a subDirectory called "daughter" and i want to search within
both "son" and "daughter" but not in other subfolders and files of "mother" and "father".

Is it possible to limit the search to these two different path directories? should i use any
kind of filter for it?

Thanks in advance
