SUBJECT: Exchange Scoring algorithm
DATE: 22 Feb 2004

Hello group,

how can I exchange the existing scoring (the way the score is calculated
using TF/IDF, term boost, etc) with my own score. I know there is a way to
overwrite the Similariy class. However I am missing a good example. Could somebody
provide a good example which would show how to exchange the existing
DefaultSimilarity with MySimilarity. I think this would be necessary to implement
common Relevance Feedback algorthms. Did somebody do that and can give me some
hints?

Kind Regards,
Karl
