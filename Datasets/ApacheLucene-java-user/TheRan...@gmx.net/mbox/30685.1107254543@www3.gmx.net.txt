SUBJECT: Adding Fields to Document (with same name)
DATE: 1 Feb 2005

Hi,

what happens when I add two fields with the same name to one Document?

Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(Field.Text("bla", "this is my first text"));
doc.add(Field.Text("bla", "this is my second text"));

Will the second text overwrite the first, because only one field can be held
with the same name in one document?

Will the first and the second text be merged, when I search in the field bla
(e.g. with query "bla:text") ?

I am working on XML indexing and did not get an error when having repeated
XML fields. Now I am wondering...

Karl
