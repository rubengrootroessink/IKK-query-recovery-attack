If I was in your shoes, I'd wait for a moment when the problem comes
up, do a memory dump (hint: jmap -dump:format=b,file=filename pid),
then fire up a profiler and search for instances of
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader, org.apache.lucene.store.Directory
and if that doesn't help - java.io.File. This would show you the
traces all the way to the top.
