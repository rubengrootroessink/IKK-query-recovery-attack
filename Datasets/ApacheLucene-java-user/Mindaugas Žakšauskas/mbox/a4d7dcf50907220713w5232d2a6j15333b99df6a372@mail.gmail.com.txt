This might be irrelevant, but have you considered using ZFS? This file
system is designed to do what you need. Assuming you can trigger
events at the time after you have updated the index, you would have to
trigger new ZFS snapshot and place it elsewhere.

This might have some side effects though (hint: fs I/O speed), either
positive or negative depending on your current setup.
