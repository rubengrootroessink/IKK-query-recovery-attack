DATE: 13 May 2011

Hi,

In my quest to fight a similar problem, I ended up writing a wrapper
finalizer (sic!) that simply closes the underlying reader/searcher. It
might be against all advices (e.g. "Effective Java 2ed" Item 7) but I
simply couldn't find any better solution to this problem.

I wish I wouldn't need doing close() myself. Hopefully this will be
improved with Java 7's AutoCloseable one day.

Regards,
Mindaugas

What I described was an attempt to switch from MultiSearcher to MultiReader. We had a simple
delegating IndexSearcher wrapper for cached/reused IndexSearchers that was doing reference
counting. <..>
