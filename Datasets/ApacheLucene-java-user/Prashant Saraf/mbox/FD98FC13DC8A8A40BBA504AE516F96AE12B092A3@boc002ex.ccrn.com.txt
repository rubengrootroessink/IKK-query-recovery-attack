Hi,
I am creating a keyword based search engine. Now I am able to search the required data. Now,
I notice that the data coming is in random order. Is there any way I can call particular record
1st. I have an example. Suppose I m working on search of Book content, writer, publication.
Now if I enter name of title of book say java, but if there is another book who has content
as word Java Coffee now it is showing that Book of coffee first. How to solve this problem.


Thanks and Regards
