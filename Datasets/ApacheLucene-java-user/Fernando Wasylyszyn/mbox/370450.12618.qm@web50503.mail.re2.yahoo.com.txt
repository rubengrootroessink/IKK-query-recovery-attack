SUBJECT: Modify how a field value is stored in Lucene
DATE: 2 Aug 2010

Hi all. This is my question. Currently, I'm working in a project where I have 
Lucene documents with one field that use payloads. For this field, I use 
org.apache.lucene.analysis.payloads.DelimitedPayloadTokenFilter, so the value 
for that field is something like: "fieldValue\1.0" where '\' is the payload 
delimiter and "1.0" is the field value payload. The thing is that the values of 
this field are stored in the index, so when I retrieve the field value from the 
index, I get "fieldValue\1.0" and manually have to remove the payload from the 
field value in order to show it to the user, put it in some XML or whatever. 
There is any way to modify how a field value is stored in the index as it can be 
modified how the value is indexed v√≠a TokenFilters? In this particular case, the 
needed modification is remove the payload from the index stored field value, but 
there are a lot of cases where something like this could be useful. Thanks in 
advance. Cheers.
