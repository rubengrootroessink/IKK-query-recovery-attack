 Hello, any one can help me with fields?

I have the same problem posted in
http://search.lucidimagination.com/search/out?u=http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/HierarchicalFields,
but I don't like the proposed solutions. I need a order field, like [
token1, token2, token3]
If a query match with token1 the score is bigger then a match in
token2, or same thing like that.
