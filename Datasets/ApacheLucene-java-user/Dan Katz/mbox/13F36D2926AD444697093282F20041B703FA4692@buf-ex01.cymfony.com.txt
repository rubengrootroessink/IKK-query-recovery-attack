SUBJECT: Lucene Query Writing question
DATE: 17 Jan 2006

I apologize if sending this to the wrong place, but I need some help
writing some lucene queries.  I am not the Lucene manager here at our
company.  Just a lowly unsophisticated user who would be appreciative of
any help that can be provided.
 
Question 1)   Is there a way in Lucene to have some sort of limit based
on term count.  For example,  "atleast5 Apple" to find items with the
word apple only when it has at least 5 mentions.
 
Question 2) We use Lucene to index articles from Web sites. When I have
these documents I want to find when a Web site is mentioned, but not the
email addresses of a Web site.   I write something like "website.com NOT
\@website.com".  This works to a point.  However, it also excludes the
documents when the website.com AND the @website.com is mentioned.  I
want to eliminate the content that only has @website.com but keep it
whenever the @ is not present.  Does anyone know how I would write this
query?
 
Again, I apologize if sending this to the wrong place and would be
thankful for any help I can get.
