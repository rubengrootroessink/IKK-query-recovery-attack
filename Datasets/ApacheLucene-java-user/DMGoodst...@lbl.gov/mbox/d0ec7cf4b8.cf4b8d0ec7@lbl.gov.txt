SUBJECT: Using lucene highlighter over multiSearcher
DATE: 8 Dec 2003

Is there a straightforward way to use the
highlighting class with a multisearcher?  It seems
awkward at the moment, as one is required to rewrite
queries with an IndexReader, and there is not an
equivalent aggregating class (i.e., there is no
MultiReader class and I don't want to have to add
all my disparate indexes into a single IndexWriter
and write out a new, aggregated index).
