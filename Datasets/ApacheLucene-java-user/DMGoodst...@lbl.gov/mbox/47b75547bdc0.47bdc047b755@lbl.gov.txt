DATE: 18 Mar 2004

I use lucene to index several (currently 8) large
(greater than 3 million records each) databases. 
These databases have a table structure that is
optimized to support the graphical display of large
numbers of alignments between biologically-relevant
sequences.  Unfortunately, that structure is quite
suboptimal for knowledge-discovery type queries
(e.g., searching for all the sequences that are
characterized as being involved in a particular
biological or molecular function).  So I export the
data and construct more biologically-informative
Lucene documents.  Typical indexes are 500-600Mb per
organism, and I have a ParallellMultiSearcher using
RemoteSearchables to spread the search load over
several servers.  Search speed is quite acceptable
(as long as post search sorting of results isn't
required).

So I would say using Lucene to replace some of the
RDMBS query functionality is quite feasible and
yields good performance.
