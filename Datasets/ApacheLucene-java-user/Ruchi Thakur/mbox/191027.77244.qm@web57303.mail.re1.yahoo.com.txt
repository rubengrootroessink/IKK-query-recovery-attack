SUBJECT: BooleanQuery TooManyClauses in wildcard search
DATE: 30 Nov 2007

 
  Hi there. 
I am a new Lucene user and I have been searching the group archives but couldn't solve the
problem. I have just joined a project that uses Lucene. 
We use the StandardAnalyzer for indexing our documents and our query is as 
follows when we issue a search string of    t*      for example:
  +t* +cont_type:pa
   
  We get an Exception when we issue some of our wildcard text searches we get following Exception
  org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses Exception : Max clause if 1024
   
  Please suggest.
   
  Regards,
  Ruchi
