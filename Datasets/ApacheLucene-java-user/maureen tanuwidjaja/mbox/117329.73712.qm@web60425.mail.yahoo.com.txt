SUBJECT: exception is hit while optimizing index
DATE: 8 Feb 2007

Hi ,
  
  I would like to know about optimizing index...
  
  The exception is hit due to disk full while optimizing the index and hence,the index has
not been closed yet.
  
  Is the unclosed index dangerous?Can i perform searching in such index correctly?Is the index
built robust yet?
  
  thanks and regards,
  maureen
