SUBJECT: Building Lucene index for XML document
DATE: 24 Jan 2007

Hi...
  I am a Final Year Undergrad.My Final year project is about search  engine for  XML Document..I
am currently building this system  using Lucene.
  
  The example of XML element from an XML document :
  ----------------------------------------------
  <article>
      <body>
          <section>
          This is my first text
          </section>
         <p>
          This is my second text
        </p>
      </body>
  </article>
  ----------------------------------------------
  After the XML Document is parsed,I will get
  
  tag       : article
    value    : 
  
  tag       : article/body
    value    : 
  
  tag       : article/body/section
  value    : This is my first text
  
    tag       : article/body/p
    value    : This is my second text
  
  
  Constructing the Lucene Index, I treat : 
  1.the XML tag as the field
  2.the value of it as the terms to be indexed
  
  
  Before implementing this search engine,I have designed to build the index in such a way
that every XML tag is converted using binary value,in order to reduce the size index and perhaps
for faster searching.To illustrate:
  
  article will be converted to 0
  article/body will be converted to 0.0
  article/body/section will be converted to 0.0.0
    article/body/p will be converted to 0.0.1
  
  Now,because of using lucene for the implementation,i wonder wheter such conversion will
still be useful for efficiency..I  wonder wheter inside the lucene index itself, such kind
of conversion  or perhaps even further optimization is already done in order to reduce  the
size index or for  faster searching.
  
  Can anyone give me some information?
  
  Really need help...Thanks a lot
  
  
  Regards, 
  
  Maureen
