SUBJECT: Is there any way to optimize existing unoptimized index?
DATE: 8 Feb 2007

Hi,
  
  May I also ask wheter there is a way to use writer.optimize() without indexing the files
from the beginning?
  
  It took me about 17 hrs to finish building an unoptimized index(finish  when I call IndexWriter.close()
).I just wonder wheter this existing  index could be optimized...
  
  THanks and Best Regards,
  Maureen
