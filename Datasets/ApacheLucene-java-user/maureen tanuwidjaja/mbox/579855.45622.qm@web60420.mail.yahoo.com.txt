SUBJECT: My program stops indexing after 10000th documents is indexed
DATE: 27 Jan 2007

Hi all,
  
  Is there any limitation of number of file that lucene can handle?
  I indexed a total of 30000 XML Documents,however it stops at 10000th documents.
  No warning,no error ,no exception as well.
  ....
  Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491876.xml
  Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491886.xml
  Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491887.xml
  Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491891.xml
  Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491893.xml
  Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491896.xml <--10000th doc
  --it idles here--
  
 At first I thought that it was the size of  10000th document is so big so that it took quite
a long time to put  into the index.Then i found out  that the 10000th document has the  size
of 6 KB only.Indexing process stops for about 1 hour,so that i  decide to terminate the progress.
  
  Is there anything to do with smt like setCompoundFiles etc?cause I dont include any in my
program...
  
  Any suggestion pls?
  
  THanks and Best Regards,
  
  Maureen
