DATE: 13 Mar 2007

ok mike.I'll try it and see wheter could work :) then I will proceed to optimize the index.
  Well then i guess it's fine to use the default value for maxMergeDocs which is INTEGER.MAX?
  
  Thanks a lot

Once you've created a Field and before adding to your Document
index, just call field.setOmitNorms(true).

Note, however, that you must do this for all Field instances by that
same field name because whenever Lucene merges segments, if even one
Document did not disable norms then this will "spread" so that all documents
keep their norms, for the same field name.

Ie you must fully rebuild your index with the above code change to
truly not store norms.
