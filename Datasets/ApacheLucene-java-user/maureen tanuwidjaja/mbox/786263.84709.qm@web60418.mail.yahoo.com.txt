Subject: Building lucene index using 100 Gb Mobile HardDisk

Dear All,
  
  I was indexing 660,000 XML documents.The unoptimized index file was
successfully built in about 17 hrs...This index file resides in my D  drive
which has the free space 38 Gb.This space is insufficient for  optimizing
the index file -->I read Lucene documentation said about  its requirement of
substantial temporary free disk space
  
  Hence,I now put my index file in the Mobile HardDisk which has the
capacity of 100 Gb,and restart indexing.
  
  However...there is an exception saying that :
  
  java.io.IOException: There is not enough space on the disk
  
  when I index the 120,000th documents
  
  
  It is a pretty weird thing!!...I keep thinking what is happening...Is
there anything to do with the file system used?my D drive use NTFS file
system whilst this Mobile HDD use FAT32...
  
  
  Any comments/suggestion pls?
  
  THanks and best Regards,
  Maureen
