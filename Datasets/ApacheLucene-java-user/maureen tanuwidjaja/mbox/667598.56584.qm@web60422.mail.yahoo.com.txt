SUBJECT: lengthNorm accessible?
DATE: 14 Mar 2007

hmmm...now I wonder wheter it is possible to access this lengthNorm  value so that it can be
used as before but without creating any nrm  file --> setOmitNorm = true
  
  Any other suggestion on how i could get the same rank as before by making use of this lengthNorm
but without creating nrm file?
  
  
  Thanks,
  Maureen

You can store the fields in the index itself if you want, without  indexing them (just flag
it as stored/unindexed). I believe storing  fields should not incur the "norms" size problem,
please correct me if  I'm wrong.

Thanks,

  Another thing i would like to see is whether the precision or recall will be much affaected
by this...

will be different? Do you need to search by each of  these many fields? If not, you probably
don't have to index these  fields (but store them for retrieval?).

Just a thought.

I think you'd need to test different values for your situation.  Maybe
try 66,000 which will give you ~ 10 segments at your current number of
docs?

I think you'll need to turn off norms.  I expect alot of the slowness is
in loading the large norms files for the first time.
