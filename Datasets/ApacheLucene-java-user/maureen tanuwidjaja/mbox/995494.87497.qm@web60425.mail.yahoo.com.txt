SUBJECT: about merge factor
DATE: 11 Feb 2007

Hi all,
  
  I just wondering wheter is it sensible and possible if I have 660,000  documents to be indexed,I
set the merge factor to 660,000 instead of  the default value 10 (...and this means no merge
while indexing) and  later after closing the index,I use the IndexWriter to optimize/merge
 the whole index file...
  
  
  Thanks and Regards,
  Maureen
