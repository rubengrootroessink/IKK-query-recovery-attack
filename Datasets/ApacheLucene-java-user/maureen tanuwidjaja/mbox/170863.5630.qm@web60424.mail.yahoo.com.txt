SUBJECT: Searching eats lots of memory?
DATE: 22 Feb 2007

I also would like to know wheter searching in the indexfile eats lots of memory...I always
ran out of memory when doing searching,i.e. it gives the exception java heap space(although
I have put -Xmx768 in the VM argument) ...Is there any way to solve it?
