Hi Mike and Erick and all,
  
  I have fixed my code and yes,indexing is much faster than previously when I do such "hammering"
with IndexWriter
  
  However,I am now encountering the error while indexing
  
  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
  
  This error never happens before..it doesnt even exist when I do such hammering with the
IndexWriter
  
  Is it because the document I am going to index is too much?coz I am  indexing thousands
of XML Documents and total size is about 1Giga...
