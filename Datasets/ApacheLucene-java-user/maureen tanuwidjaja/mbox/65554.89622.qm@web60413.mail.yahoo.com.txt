DATE: 23 Feb 2007


yes I do have around 75 GB of free space on that HDD...I do not invoke any index reader...hence
the program only calls indexwriter to optimize the index,and that's it..
   
  I am also perplexed why it tells that it have not enough disk space to do optimization...

Does your disk only have this index? Ie 100 GB - 20.6 = 79.4 GB of
free space?

Do you have reader(s) open on the index when you kick off the
optimize? If so then the temporary free space required is 2X the size
of the index (41.2 GB in your case).

Worse, if your readers are refreshing during the optimize (eg because
on IndexReader.isCurrent() returned false) even more temporary disk
space can be tied up. This is a case LUCENE-710 aims to fix (adding
"commit only on close" to IndexWriter). The workaround for now is to
create app level logic to ensure readers never refresh during
optimize.

If you don't have readers then you really should only need 1X
additional free space at the start of optimize (20.6 GB free in your
case) so I'm baffled why 79.4 GB would not be enough.
