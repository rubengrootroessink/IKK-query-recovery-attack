Before you get into Java, you should know that it's posible to find a lucene
implementation for your language. Lucene is available in python, c# .net,
etc... Search for that first.

If you chose Java, you'll need to make baby steps. Install yourself an IDE
(eclipse, netbeans...) to get rid of all the ant/jdk/etc.. setups.
Then you'll need to create a project,
download lucene<http://lnx.apollo-hw.ro/apache//lucene/java/3.3.0/lucene-3.3.0.zip>,
import just the lucene-core-3.3.0.jar from the mentioned zip
but first you need to learn how to import *.jar files into a project for the
chosen IDE (google atleast this)
and in your project, create a .java source file and write :
*import org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher; *
to use IndexSearcher object, and do the same for other unresolved classes
(consulting the
JavaDoc<http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_3_0/api/core/index.html>)


now you can copy paste examples from the book.

Further info is available on the web, especially for you to learn Java. This
mailing list is more for high level lucene fiddling.

Hope you understand.
Happy learning!
