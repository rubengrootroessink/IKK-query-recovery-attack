SUBJECT: Separating IndeWriter with NRT
DATE: 22 Jul 2011

I trust that some of you had to run the indexing as a service/jar and the
search as a servlet/war. How can i obtain this while still keeping the
search near real time(this is difficult because IndexReader needs direct
access to the IndexWriter instance). If no lucene users know this, where
else should i ask this question?

Thank you,
Mihai
