It's only available in Solr and it's based on UnInvertedField
<http://lucene.apache.org/solr/api/org/apache/solr/request/UnInvertedField.html>.
Lucene 3.4.0 should have
it<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3003>implemented too.

I ran a small index in Solr and it does the job by showing among the results
the faceted results. Thank you Erik for that.To run more tests yourself
using the out-of-the-box setup like Erik said:

*grab a compatible version of Solr and just plug your index into Solr's data
directory (and you will have to add your field "content" to Solr's
schema.xml and adjust the primary-key-field accordingly) and just give it a
try.
After starting Solr (there's a ready-to-use web app delivered in a Jetty
servlet container in your Solr download), you would get your results by
calling this URL (from your browser or by the curl command line program):

http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=<query>&facet=true&**
facet.field=content*
