Searches will be made on only one group at a time(disjoint groups of
documents). So for very large groups, the old documents will have they're
own index. I'm hopping that this shortens the work load on a search by not
having to skip other groups while searching for large quantities of old
documents.  In other words, I won't be needing a filter for the group needed
to be searched, this being the filter with most hits.

I'm only storing doc-id's and retrieving they're date field.
