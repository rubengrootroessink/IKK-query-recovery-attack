DATE: 2 Nov 2006

Ok I am trying the MemoryIndex, but when compiling I have the
following erro message:

package org.apache.lucene.index.memory does not exist

Is it not included in the lucene .jar?

I currently have the latest lucene binaries.

Moreover:

parse(java.lang.String) in org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser
cannot be applied to
(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer)
    [javac]     float score =
index.search(QueryParser.parse("information", "content", analyzer));
