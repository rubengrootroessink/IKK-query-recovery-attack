SUBJECT: Re: simple (?) question about scoring
DATE: 2 Nov 2006

The whole problem I have to face is the following:

I have a web service which searches a corpus of documents and returns
a list of documents which match the query

le list is not ordered (I do not know the details of the search
angine, I only have its result for a query)

then I have this list of documents, which represents a subset of the corpus

I have to rank the documents of the list, using your scoring algorithm

now: I do not know if I have to import all the documents in a sort of
Index and apply Lucene's ranking algorithm (if there is one), or take
each document and compute the score of the document vs the query, and
then sort the list based on the scores

currently I am following the second approach, thus I need to compute
the score of each document

I think the MemoryIndex is good for this, I am trying to compile the
example provided in the javadoc, but there is some package lacking...
