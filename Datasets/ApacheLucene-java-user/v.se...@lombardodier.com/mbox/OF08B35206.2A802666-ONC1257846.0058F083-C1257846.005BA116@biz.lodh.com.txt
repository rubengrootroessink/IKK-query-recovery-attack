Hi,

we developped a real time logging system. we index 4.5 millions 
events/day, spread over multiple servers, each with its own index. every 
night with delete events from the index based on a retention policy then 
we optimize. each server takes between 1 and 2 hours to optimize. ideally, 
we would like to optimize more quickly, without compromising the search 
performances. in the lucene in action book, it says "use optimize 
sparingly; use the optimize(maxNumSegments) method instead". what is a 
reasonnable maxNumSegments in my situation?
Thanks,
Vincent

I don't think we have any guidelines yet... but if you get some
numbers then please post back :)  That's how guidelines develop!

But: why are you optimizing so often?
