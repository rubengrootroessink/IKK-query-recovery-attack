SUBJECT: gracefully interrupting an optimize
DATE: 21 Jan 2011

Hi,

Each night I optimize an index that contains 35 millions docs. Its takes 
about 1.5 hours. For maintenance reasons, it may happen that the machine 
gets rebooted. In that case, server gets a chance to gracefully shutdown, 
but eventually, the reboot script will kill the processes that did not 
stop in time. My preference would to stop gracefully the optimize rather 
than getting the process killed. Is there a way to do that?

Thanks,

Vincent
