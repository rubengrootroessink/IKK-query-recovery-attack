SUBJECT: Updating documents

Hi all,

I would like to update a document as follows.

1) retrieve the document from an IndexReader/Searcher
2) delete the document
3) manipulate the document, that is remove and add fields
4) save the document using an IndexWriter

When I do this all fields that were indexed and/or tokenized but not
stored get lost.

So is there any way to preserve fields that were not stored?
Reconstructing these fields is to expensive in my application.

Thanks in advance,

Markus
