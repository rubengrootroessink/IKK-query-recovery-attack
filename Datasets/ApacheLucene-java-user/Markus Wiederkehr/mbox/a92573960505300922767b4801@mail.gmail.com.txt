Thank you, this seems to be exactly what I am looking for.

One thing I don't quiet understand is how to ensure that the document
numbers in the different indexes always correspond? AFAIK the only way
to update a Lucene document is to delete and re-add it, right? And
doing so is likely to change the document number. So when I update a
document in one index but not in the other(s) the link between them
gets lost. How do I prevent this?
