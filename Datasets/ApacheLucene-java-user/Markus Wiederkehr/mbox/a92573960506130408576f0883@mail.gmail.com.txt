SUBJECT: Hypenated word
DATE: 13 Jun 2005

Hello,

I work on an application that has to index OCR texts of scanned books.
Naturally there occur many words that are hyphenated across lines.

I wonder if there is already an Analyzer or maybe a TokenFilter that
can merge those syllables back into whole words? It looks like Erik
Hatcher uses something like that at http://www.lucenebook.com/.

Thanks in advance,

Markus
