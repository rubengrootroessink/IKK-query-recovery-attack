Hi Ganesh,
About the memory consumption while sorting, it would end up using similar
amounts, perhaps even more.. like in the case of regular parallel
programming algorithms (hoping that you intend to search using a parallel
multi searcher). Would you have to query particular indexes only for a
particular search or would you be searching over all the indexes and then
follow it up by merger (which the parallel multi searcher would do
efficiently).?
Also, I guess 30 indexes would be a little too many, haven't really tried
out those many indexes for a multisearcher.
As far as maintenance of DB is concerned, it might be easy as long as you
don't have any document updates, in which case you'd have to shift the
documents from one DB/index to another (which includes creating an entry in
the latest index/DB and deleting the record from the older DB).
I guess you'd have to pilot it, in case memory is an issue in your case and
not speed, you could try a regular multisearcher instead of a parallel
multisearcher.
I guess when you say maintenance of the DB gets easier, you mean that the
data in each individual table is controlled (but remember there could be
other bigger hassles like the one mentioned above about moving data between
indexes/DB).
