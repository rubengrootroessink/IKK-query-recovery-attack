Hi,

One way to do that would be to iterate the terms and then reconstruct the
document or just check for the terms one after the other. Though Luke also
reconstructs the document and you could use the reconstruction logic to do
the same and compare, it is not guaranteed that the reconstruction would be
proper (from the inverted index that is).
I am assuming you'd only want to verify the index on some sampled set and
not the entire corpus, else it'd just take a lot of time.
You may also take the document corpus again, tokenize the terms and then
search for each of those in the index. This would also give you a fair idea
of the index state.
