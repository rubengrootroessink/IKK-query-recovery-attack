SUBJECT: Copying a part of index and index structure
DATE: 18 Jun 2008

I have 2 indexes and I would like to move index for a few 'selected' and
'specified' terms from one of the indexes to the other.
Would some one have an idea on how to do it?
Actually, I am looking at splitting my index on keywords (terms) and would
like a single index be distributed over 2 smaller indexes after it has been
created.
How can I do it?
