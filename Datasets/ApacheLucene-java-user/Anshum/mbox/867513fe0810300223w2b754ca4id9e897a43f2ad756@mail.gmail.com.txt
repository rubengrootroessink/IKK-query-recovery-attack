Hi Aditi,
In that case I could suggest you to just index the domain name seperately as
well i.e. index the following fields : email adddess, domain name; instead
of just email address.
When I said reverse the tokens, you could reverse the tokens while
indexing(just flipping the text string while indexing) and search for
reverse string while searching.
Eric might have a better solution though ! :)
Let me know if that solves the issue.
