DATE: 30 Oct 2009

In case you are trying to say that in subsequent runs, the previous state of
the index just goes off, its because the indexwriter gets opened with
'create new' flag as true. In other words, the index would be newly created
overwriting any existing index at the directory location.
The solution to this would be to open the indexwriter with the createnew
flag as false.
*public IndexWriter(String path,*
*                   Analyzer a,*
*                   boolean create)*
*            throws IOException*
This should solve your problem.
