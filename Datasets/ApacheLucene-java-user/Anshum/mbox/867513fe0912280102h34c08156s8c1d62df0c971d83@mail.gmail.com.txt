Hi,
Don't worry! there always are ways!
Is prefix query is what you are trying to run? They would run but would be
highly unoptimized as lucene stores terms in a lexically sorted manner in
its index. <term>* like query terms are allowed by the parser/searcher
though.
Possible solution for this would be:
Index flipped terms (using an appropriate analyzer) i.e. cat is also indexed
as tac. You may then query on ta* instead of at*.
Does that solve your issues/concern?
