DATE: 7 May 2009

Hi Nate,
The scores are only comparable within the same search and not over different
searches as the scores are affected by query as well as docs.
About the threshold, I guess you could have count cutoff to get 'x' best
matches. Said so coz I'm not really able to recollect anything which could
use score as a metric to absolutely cluster 'good' and 'not good' matches.
