SUBJECT: Timeout for search threads
DATE: 25 Feb 2008

Hi,

Is there a way I could add a timeout value for each search instance
while searching? Currently I encounter issues while a bottleneck causing
query continues to execute for over 1000 seconds(I am still looking into
the cause for the same though, to remove it from the root)
I need to have a TTL kind of an idea for each search thread to jump over
such blocking queries.
