Hi,
After looking for a long time and feeling the need to I'd like to invite
people to a Lucene India user/developer group. There is no such thing
existing at the moment where we could interact and organize
meet-ups/discussion events for Lucene developers based in India.
Please visit* http://groups.google.com/group/luceneindia* to join and share!
