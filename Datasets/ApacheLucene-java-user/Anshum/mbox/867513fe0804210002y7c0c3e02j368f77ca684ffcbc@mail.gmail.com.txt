SUBJECT: Binding lucene instance/threads to a particular processor(or core)
DATE: 21 Apr 2008

Hi,

I have been trying to bind my lucene instance (JVM - Sun Hotspot*) to a
particular core so as to improve the performance. Is there a way to do so or
is there support in lucene to explicitly control the thread - processor
linkup?
