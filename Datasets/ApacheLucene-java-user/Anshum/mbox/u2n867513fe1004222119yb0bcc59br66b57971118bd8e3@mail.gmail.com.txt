Hi,

You'd need to either expand the query or index the documents in a manner
that they store the extra ontology related information. You may try going
for the later option in case your mappings change often, though it'd be slow
as you'd be adding more terms to the query.
You could try using something like a synonym analyzer while conducting
search in this case.
