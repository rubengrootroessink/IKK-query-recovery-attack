Hi KK,

Easier still, you could just open the indexwriter with the last (3rd)
arguement as true, this way the indexwriter would create a new index as soon
as you start indexing. Also, if you just leave the indexWriter without the
3rd arguement, it'd conditionally create a new directory i.e. only if the
index dir doesn't exist at that location would it create a new index else it
would append to the already existing index at that location.
Coming to the 2nd point, if you are talking about the index name, as
mentioned by John you could simply use the timestamp as the index name.
