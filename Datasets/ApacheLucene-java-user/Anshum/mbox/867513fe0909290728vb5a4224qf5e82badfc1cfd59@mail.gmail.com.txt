DATE: 29 Sep 2009

Hi Viksit,
Why don't you try breaking the query and running a boolean boost query.
Building something like
("A B C"~1000)^100 OR ("A B"~1000 OR "B C"~1000 OR "A C"~1000)^10 OR (A OR B
OR C)

Though this is not a fool proof way to do it and a manual merge is the right
way.
Also, I remember a similar question being posted in the past. You might want
to have a look @ the archives.
