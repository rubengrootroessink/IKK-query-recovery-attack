Hi Ching,
Does the app exit or hang and stay there? as in does the JVM stay alive and
idle?
Also, can you make sure that its not the pdfbox? as in, try commenting the
indexwriter part and just read the pdfs, does that work fine.
Can you also post info on your environment?
Index Size? Lucene Version? Machine  and JVM (32/64 bit)?
This most probably seems like a code level issue rather than lucene, but I
may be wrong.
