So what you essentially want is still being able to update a document. To
update a particular field in the lucene doc, you'd need to mark that field
as updated/deleted and create a new document with new field information
(that somehow gets merged while searching or gets taken care of in a similar
manner). This as of now is not possible, and even if you were to do it using
some logical workaround, it'd be much better to take the approach of just
adding another doc and deleting the current one completely (marking it
deleted unless you need to optimize).
So by the way, is there a reason for you wanting to do so? is it that you
only index data coming from a stream and you don't have access to the
original source at a later time?
