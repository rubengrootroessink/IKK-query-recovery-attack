Hi,
You could just try the following code to print the term freq for individual
terms.
************************
public static void printTermFreq(String indexPath) throws
CorruptIndexException, IOException{
    IndexReader ir = IndexReader.open(new NIOFSDirectory(new
File(indexPath)));
    TermEnum te = ir.terms();
    while(te.next()){
      System.out.println(te.term().text()+":"+te.docFreq());
    }
    ir.close();
  }
*************************

For phrases, you'd have to build/use a different tokenizer that tokenizes
the input text into those phrases (stored as a single term). Something of an
ngram, and then treat those phrases at terms.
Doing it at runtime would not be a feasible option.
