DATE: 30 Oct 2009

The only way to do it is to index a field (self maintained primary key) with
each document and do a deleteDocument (or updateDocument) for each document
before adding it.
Something like
*writer.deleteDocument(new Term("term-key","unique-id"));*
*writer.addDocument(d);*
This should help.
