Hi Wenhao,
Its generally better to incrementally buld your index and at the same
tiime.
Considering by this time you'd be a little aware of implementing/using
luceneAPI, here is what you could do.
Open the existing index using 'createnew' set to false

*IndexWriter(Directory d, Analyzer a, boolean create) *
*This way, the indexwriter would append the new documents to the existing
index (as specified in the IndexWriter constructor).*
*
*
*This way you could incrementally build the index.*
*Also note, you may wish to optimize the index at times.*
*
*
*Hope this solves your issue (and doubt).*
