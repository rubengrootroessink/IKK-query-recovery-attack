Hi Namrata,

As far as results are concerned, it depends on the analyzer you use and the
query formation [was a trivial answer].
About the specific cases:
1. RG Heights : would not under any normal circumstances fetch you any
results unless you index all variations. You could create a custom analyzer
to handle such things though (All single alphabets indexed as single tokens
and combinations, mapping keyword like in synonym analyzers).
2. Same is the case with RGHeights.
3. R  G      Heights.  : Using a whitespace analyzer would handle all such
cases. You could also use multiple analzers withing your custom analyzer to
counter these queries. The other thing is, your application/query formation
logic could strip off or cleanup and map the incoming queries before lucene
recieves them.
4. Kingdom United: I am assuming that you are using a phrase query here, you
could set an appropriate slop value (using ~) in that case while forming the
query, also you could form an 'all words' query i.e. Boolean 'AND' or (MUST
clause in case of lucene). so that your search results include all documents
containing ALL the searched tokens.

Hope this clears it up!
