Hi Sahin,
Incase you intend to get an enumerator on the terms in an index, you could
use the following call [indexreader.terms()] from IndexReader to get the
enumerator on terms and just iterate.

http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_1/api/core/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#terms()
Hope this is what you intended!
