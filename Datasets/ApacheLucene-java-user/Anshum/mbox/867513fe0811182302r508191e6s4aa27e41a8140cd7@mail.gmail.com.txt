Hi Shireesha,
I'm not sure as to what is it that you have been using, but 'm kinda sure
that you'd have to check for deprecated things as well as improved ones
while upgrading.. 1.2 to 2.4 is a huge jump certainly, with compound index
structure etc. coming into place.
You would have to try it and check if your code works the same(I doubt it
would though).
About having 2 versions of lucene on the same machine, ofcourse yes, it is
as good as having 2 (or more) java jars.
I am presuming that you place your lucene core jar in the project library
directory and not in the jre/lib/ext directory, in which case you would have
issues placing the 2 jars.
It would be better of you completely remove lucene jars from the implicit
included library dir, and place them in a different folder (and include that
in your classpath).

Hope that solves a bit of your doubt (atleast) !
