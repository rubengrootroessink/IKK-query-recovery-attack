Hi,

I guess (but 'm not quite sure) you are looking for a way to
incrementally index(+update existing index), there would be a lot info
available on the same. 
What I would suggest would be deleting the indexes from the current
index using deleteDocuments
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_1/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#deleteDocuments(org.apache.lucene.index.Term))
and follow it up by adding the same (but updated) docs into the index. You could periodically
merge the indexes (using lucene merger) to avoid the incremental index to grow to a huge size.

To search the indexes you could use a multi searcher for the incremental
index and base index until merged.
Important to mention, for this you would need to design someway to
lookup and compile a list of modified docs(to be newly indexed or
reindexed) and pass it to lucene while indexing.
