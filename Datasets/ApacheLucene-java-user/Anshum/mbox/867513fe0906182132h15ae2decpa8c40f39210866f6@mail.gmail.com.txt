HI Galaio,
To update a document in lucene this way, you'd have to first delete the
document
using indexReader's delete document and then readd the document (thereby
changing the internal docId as well).
You may use:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#deleteDocument(int)
