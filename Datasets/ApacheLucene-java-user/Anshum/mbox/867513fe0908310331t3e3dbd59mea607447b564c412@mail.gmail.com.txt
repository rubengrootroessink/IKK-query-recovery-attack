What happens is when you index using the analyzer, attent gets indexed
(assuming you are using the same analyzer while indexing). When you search
for attent*, the query formed is for attent.
when you search for attenti*, it would look for all documents that contain
attenti* (which would not be present in the doc that got indexed as attent).
Also, stemmer wouldn't work in case of wildcards.
Hope this solves your issues.
