If I'm interpreting your need correctly, you want to index untokenized
strings, is it? Even if you aren't looking for untokenized indexing, you
could always use/design a suitable analyzer which indexes your docuement
exactly as you want, Yes, what you also are looking at is some kind of a
synonym analyzer so that.
*cold icecream *
is also indexed (and so is searchable as )
*chilled icecream*.
This is completely doable using Lucene.
