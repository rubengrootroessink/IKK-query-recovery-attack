Hi Veera,
I'd say you should get yourself a copy of Lucene In Action 2 Ed. It would
really help you figure out the hows and why's in case you are looking at
using lucene further.
Talking about your solution, let me explain it to you a bit. When
you analyse a particular field in lucene, it gets tokenized/processed prior
to getting indexed. The way the processing would happen depends on your
analyzer (which here is StopAnalyzer). So point 1. If you analyze a field
with value *'My name is anshum' *it would get broken down into tokens, e.g.
[my] [name] [is] [anshum] where each term in the [] is a token
indexed separately.
A search on my or a search on name or a search on anshum would get you this
document. Whereas in case you don't analyze it, the field would get indexed
as it is and this document would only be picked up if its an exact match for
the complete value i.e. the document would have one token with the value *[my
name is anshum].*
**Hope you get what 'm trying to put forward here.
Reanalyze your requirement, you might really want to analyze the field. Do
not avoid analysis of the field only to get a particular test case work
fine, it might trouble you later!
Analyze your field using a suitable analyzer and the searches should just
work fine.
