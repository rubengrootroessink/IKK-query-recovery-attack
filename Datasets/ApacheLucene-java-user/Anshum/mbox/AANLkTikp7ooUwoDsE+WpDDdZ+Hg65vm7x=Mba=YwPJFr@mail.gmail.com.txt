SUBJECT: Re: construct a field without analyzer?
DATE: 15 Feb 2011

Hi Yuhan,

By what I understand you are trying to construct an index and add a field to
it which would not be analyzed. Am I correct?  You could simply declare that
field as
new Field(...... , Index.NOT_ANALYZED)
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_1/api/core/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html

Also, if you want to analyze it using an analyzer that is different from the
one that you'd use for the other fields, you could use the perfieldanalyzer
<snip>
analyzer = new PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper(new StandardAnalyzer(
        Version.LUCENE_30));
analyzer.addAnalyzer("anotherfield", new KeywordAnalyzer());
</snip>

In the above snip, I instantiate an analyzer which by default would use the
StandardAnalyzer but for 'anotherfield' would use KeywordAnalyzer.

Hope this helps you.
