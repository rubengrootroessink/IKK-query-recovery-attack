Hi John,

In case of deletions, it is just a delayed delete. In other words, the doc
is just marked as deleted in the deletable file, leaving a void in the
numbering of docs. The actual shifting of document ids happens only when you
optimize the index. In that case the deletables file is used to physically
remove the docs from the index.

Hope that clears the doubt :)
