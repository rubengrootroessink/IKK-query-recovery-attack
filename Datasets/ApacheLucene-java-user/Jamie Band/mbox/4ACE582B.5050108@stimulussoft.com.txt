SUBJECT: Index.close() infinite TIME_WAITING
DATE: 8 Oct 2009

Hi All

I have a long running situation where our indexing thread is getting 
stuck indefinitely in IndexWriter's close method. Yourkit shows the 
thread to be stuck in TIME_WAITING. Any idea's on what could be causing 
this?
Could it be one of the streams or readers we passed to the document?

I am running Lucene 2.9.0.

Many thanks in advance

Jamie
