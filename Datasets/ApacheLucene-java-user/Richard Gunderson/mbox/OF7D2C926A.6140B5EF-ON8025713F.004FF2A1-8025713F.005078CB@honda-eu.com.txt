Hi Otis

Thanks for the information. I'm actually writing something to search files
containing code (such as JSP files) so I do expect there will be a few
problems like this because I guess Lucene's out-of-the box analyzers are
really suited to natural languages. But, I was wondering if you could you
recommend an Analyzer that would be good for my purposes. I tried
StandardAnalyzer and KeywordAnalyzer with limited success, although I admit
I might not be using them 100% correctly as I'm new to Lucene.

FYI I've added an option to bypass Lucene so I just do an String.indexOf on
my search terms, which works well (embarassingly-crude though!) but it
would be nice to be able to use the power of real text searching within
Lucene ;-)

Regards
