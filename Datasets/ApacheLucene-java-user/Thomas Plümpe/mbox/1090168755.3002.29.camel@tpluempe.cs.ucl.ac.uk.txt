SUBJECT: Re: Query across multiple fields scenario not handled by	"MultiFieldQueryParser"
DATE: 18 Jul 2004

Dear all,

I would like to do the exact same thing that Ali Rouhi posed as a
challenge in [*] and has found a solution for. Unfortunately I haven't
been able to get through to him. Does anybody here know which changes I
would have to make to QueryParser.jj to get the functionality described?
