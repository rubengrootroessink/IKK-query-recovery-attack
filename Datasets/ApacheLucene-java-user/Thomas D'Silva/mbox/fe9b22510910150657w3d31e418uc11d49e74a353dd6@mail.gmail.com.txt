SUBJECT: Re: Using TermVectorMapper to compute term frequency across documents
DATE: 15 Oct 2009

Grant,

I have an index with documents that have a text field containing
document text, and a tag field containing tags associated with the
document. I am trying to calculate the probability that a document
contains a particular word and is tagged with a particular tag.
This is related to a MoreLikeThis extension I was trying to write
(http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1910)

Most of the time is spent in the loop iterating over the document
tagged with the particular tag, and computing counts of terms across
the documents. If the index contains millions of documents, it takes a
while to compute the document,tag probabilities.

Thanks,
Thomas
