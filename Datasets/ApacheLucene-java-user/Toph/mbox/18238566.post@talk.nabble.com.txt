For now I just changed the offset calculation in DocumentWriter as specified
here by the OP:

It has side effects as previously mentioned on this list, e.g. if the
tokenstream is not backed by a stringValue or the Analyzer does not
calculate offsets in the normal way.  But for my purposes it works.

This issue was also discussed previously 
http://lucene.markmail.org/search/?q=offset%20documentwriter#query:offset%20documentwriter+page:1+mid:l6jbfmfisyg5zyre+state:results
here .

Querying the tokenstream for the final offset would good, but then would the
change be put into the DocumentWriter directly or available as an option?
