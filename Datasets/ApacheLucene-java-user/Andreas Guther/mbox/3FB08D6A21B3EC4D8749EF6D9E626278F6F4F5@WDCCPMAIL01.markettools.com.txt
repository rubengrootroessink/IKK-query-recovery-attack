What fragment size are you using? Have you tried the null fragmenter? 
Are you using the QueryScorer that you can pass a field name to restrict

highlighting to a certain field? Do you have any example code of what 
you are attempting? Have you looked at the test code for examples of how

to use the Highlighter?
