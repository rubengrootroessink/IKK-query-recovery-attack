We have everything on Windows NTFS.  Our index folders are on a server
and accessed via shared drive.

I haven't optimized the folders yet but after doing optimization on a
test folder I noticed that we have very little files left.  That might
help.

I am going to optimize all folders now and then will come back with more
information.

: Are there are large number of files in your index directory?

and is there any correlation between the number files matching segment*
and the time isCurrent taks?

it would also be handy to know what filesystem you use as well ...
directory listings may be more expensive on some filesystems then
others.
