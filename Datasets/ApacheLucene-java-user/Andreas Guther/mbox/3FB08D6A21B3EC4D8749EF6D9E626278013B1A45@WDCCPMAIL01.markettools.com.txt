Eric,

Thank you very much for your response.  That sounds very interesting.
Let me do some experimenting to see if I fully understood your solution.
Otherwise I have to come back to you with more questions.

Andreas

As luck would have it, I've done something very similar. What I had
to do is index a special token at the end of each page. Then I could
get the term offsets for each page....

Then I used one of the SpanQuery.getSpans to get all of the
offsets of the hits throughout all of the pages.

now I have a list of all the offsets of the *last* term on each
page and a list of the offsets of the hits. From these two
lists I can know which pages have hits.


Best
Erick
