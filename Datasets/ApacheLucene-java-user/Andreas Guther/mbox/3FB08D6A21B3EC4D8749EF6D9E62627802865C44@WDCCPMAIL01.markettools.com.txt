Just some comment and I understand that you cannot change your index:

What we did is to organize our index based on creation date of entries.
We limit our search to a given number of years starting from the current
year.  Organizing the index in that way allows us to take off outdated
information.  We can provide the user an option to search across older
indexes as well, if wanted.

Hi

Thanks for the suggestions. This would require us to change the index 
and right now we literally have millions of documents stored in current 
index format. I'll bear it in mind, but I am not entirely sure how I 
would go about implementing the change at this point.

Much appreciate

Jamie
