Blueyben,

What you describe is a general Java time conversion problem, not a Lucene
related one.

You will need to do a search on "Java time format" which should bring you
amongst other links to
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html.

You might also be interested for time formatting to look into
http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/.
