SUBJECT: How often to optimize an Index?

What are best practices for optimizing an Index?

 

We have several GB indexes in sizes between 2 and 8 GB.  One index gets
updates about every 2 to 30 seconds.  It takes less than a week to have
an index with several thousand files.  What is a good practice for
scheduling optimization?  Wait until a certain number of files is
created?  Every n number of updates?  Once a week or once a night?

 

I am interested in finding out what other people use for optimizing
strategies.
