Hi,

I found the following recommendation in Lucene in Action from Eric and
Otis about where to put Lucene lock files:

"Because of known issues with lock files and NFS, choose a directory
that doesn't reside on an NFS volume."

Could someone please help me understand what those known issues exactly
are?

Thanks in advance,

Andreas
