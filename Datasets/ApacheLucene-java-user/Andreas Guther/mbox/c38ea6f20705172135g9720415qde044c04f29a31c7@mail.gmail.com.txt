SUBJECT: Re: Field.Store.Compress - does it improve performance of document reads?
DATE: 18 May 2007

I found a similar recommendation about the disc access and reading in order
in the following message and implemented this in my code:
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/general/28268#28268

Since I am dealing with multiple index directories I sorted the document
references by index number and then by doc id.  This actually improved the
read access and reduced the read time to 50% and less.

I think this is a very interesting performance improvement tip that should
have its place in the FAQ.

Thanks for the input.

Andreas
