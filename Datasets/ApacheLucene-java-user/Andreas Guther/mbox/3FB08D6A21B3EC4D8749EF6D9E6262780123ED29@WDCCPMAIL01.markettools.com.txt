Hi

We have an index of several GB in size which is updated very
frequently-about every 2 seconds.

Though it is desired to have changes updated to the index as soon as
possible I wonder if this frequent updates can have negative affect on
the search and data retrieval performance.

Would it make more sense to limit the updates to times of lesser usage
(night) or is this something that does not affect Lucene and I should
not worry?

I see performance problems and would like to figure out if this frequent
updates can have an impact on search.

Andreas
