SUBJECT: How to retrieve the terms that matched
DATE: 14 Apr 2004

Perharps a silly question, but ...

I do not find the way to retrieve the matched terms of a found document.
Indeed, We construct a Lucene query searching on different fields with 
OR clause
and we want to display to the user for each result the term(s) which have
matched.
Is it possible with the Lucene API ?

Thanks in advance
David THIBAU
