Hi Grant,

It's true, I may have an X-Y problem here. =)

My basic need is to sacrifice recall to achieve greater precision.  Rather
than always presenting the user with the top N documents, I need to return
*only* the documents that seem relevant.  For some searches this may be 3
documents, for some it may be none.

My user interface in this case isn't the standard "type words in a box and
we'll show you the best docs" - I'm using Lucene as a tool in the background
to do some exploration about how I could augment a set of traditional
results with a few alternative results gleaned from a different path.

Not sure if this helps with the X-Y problem, but that's my task at hand.

Also, while perusing the threads you refer to below, I saw a reference to
the following link, which seems to have gone dead:

  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31841
  (in http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/1618ce933c8ebd6b )

Has the issue tracker moved somewhere else?

Finally, I seem unable to get Searcher.explain() to do much useful - my code
looks like:

        Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(reader);
        QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(LuceneIndex.CONTENT, analyzer);
        Query query = parser.parse(queryString);
        TopDocCollector collector = new TopDocCollector(n);
        searcher.search(query, collector);

        for ( ScoreDoc d : collector.topDocs().scoreDocs ) {
            String explanation = searcher.explain(query, d.doc).toString();
            Field id = searcher.doc( d.doc ).getField( LuceneIndex.ID );
            System.out.println(id + "\t" + d.score + "\t" + explanation);
        }

In the output, I get explanations like "0.88922405 = (MATCH) product of:"
with no details.  Perhaps I need to do something different in indexing?

Thanks,


 -Ken
