Okay, silly me - notice that in my code I was printing the string with
println().  I didn't realize println() truncated strings that contain
newline characters (nor was I aware that the string had any newlines, I
guess!).  Once I ran it through replaceAll( "\n", "\\\\n" ) I'm getting the
output I need.
