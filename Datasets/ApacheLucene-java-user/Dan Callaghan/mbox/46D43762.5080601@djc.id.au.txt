SUBJECT: Lucille, a (new) Python port of Lucene
DATE: 28 Aug 2007

Dear list,

I have recently begun a Python port of Lucene, named Lucille. It is
still very much a work in progress, but I hope to have a
feature-complete release compatible with Lucene 2.1 done in the near future.

The project homepage is at: http://www.djc.id.au/lucille/

Contributions, feedback, and questions are most welcome!

P.S. A big thanks to the Lucene contributors for their hard work in
building a great piece of software.
