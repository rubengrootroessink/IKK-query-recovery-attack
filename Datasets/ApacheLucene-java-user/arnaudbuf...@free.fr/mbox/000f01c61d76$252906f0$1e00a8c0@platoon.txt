Hi,

I begin working with lucene and need few explanations to do what i want,
thanks for your helpful answers.

I have to add lucene into a java application and I have two targets:

- To enable search throw different types of files, like MS Word, PDF or
Excel files. 
I read that each type of document must be indexed with the appropriate
indexer. So how can I do it easily? I found an API called Lius which
seem to index different types of documents directly, is anyone know this
product? Other ones?

- Secondly, the search system must work with different like Dutch,
Turkish, Bulgarian and tomorrow Thaï or Chinese. 
The lucene documentation talks about using different Analyzer for none
ISO languages. Lucene's sandbox is quite empty, and I do not understand
which kind of treatment much be done to read correctly data. I think I
still have problem searching into indexed documents with accents. So how
should I work on the languages particularity?

Thanks

A
