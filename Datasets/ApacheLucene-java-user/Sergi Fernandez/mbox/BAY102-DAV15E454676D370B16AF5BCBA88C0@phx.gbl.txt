SUBJECT: Count occurrences of worths within a corpus.
DATE: 13 Jun 2006

Hi there, 

I'm new in Lucene, and I just know to index a corpus, and run a query. I thought I can count
the times that a word appears in the whole corpus with a simple query, but it seems to be
not so easy. Somebody knows how to do it? 

Many Thanks!

Sergi Fernandez.
