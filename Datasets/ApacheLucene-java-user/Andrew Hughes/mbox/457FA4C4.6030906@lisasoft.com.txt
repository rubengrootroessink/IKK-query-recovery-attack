SUBJECT: Advice on 3NF Data Structures and Lucene Please
DATE: 13 Dec 2006

Hey All,

I am very interested in indexing a 3NF Data Structure. Is there any 
advice that someone can provide with this? From what I have seen Lucene 
is typically a flat "First Normal Form" (Flat) data structure.... The 
only way I can see to combine the relational links between multiple 
indexes is to compare documents.


Any Help is Appreciated.
