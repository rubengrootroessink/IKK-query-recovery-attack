SUBJECT: Does Optimize preserve index order?
DATE: 25 Mar 2006

Hi,
I've been trying to search and show the results
in a sorted order by using search(query, sort).
However, the sorting seems to take too long when
the index size becomes large (currently 7GB).
So,,, I thought it would be nice if the index were
pre-sorted...
What I want to do is to show the results in
chronological order. (btw, the index contains the time field)
One solution I have thought up was:
1. index the whole set
2. read in all the time field values
3. re-index the whole set according to time
   (heard that the index order is same as insertion order)
4. optimize.


However, although I think the step 3 would result
in a sorted index, isn't there a possibility that
step 4 might ruin all the sortedness?
- Wouldn't optimizing break the order in which they
  are indexed?

Also, is there any other way that I can pre-sort the
index over a specific field (such as time), so that
I wouldn't have to sort while searching? I'm not
even sure if my idea would work well.

Any suggestions are welcome..
Thank you in advance.....
