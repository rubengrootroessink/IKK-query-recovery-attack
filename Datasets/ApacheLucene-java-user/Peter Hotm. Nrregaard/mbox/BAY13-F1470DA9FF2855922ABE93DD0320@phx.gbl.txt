SUBJECT: How to include a multi-word synonym to a word when indexing?
DATE: 11 Apr 2005

According to "Lucene in Action" it is possible to get synonyms indexed 
together with a word by putting multiple words with the same position-id in 
the term vector.

My problem is, however, that some words needs to have alternatives where the 
word is decomposed / decompounded into two or more words:

"FooBar Corp" or "cybercafe"

should be found when searching for

"Foo Ba*" or "cyber cafe"


The reverse is also true: The "Foo Bar Corp" should be found with "Foob* 
corp".

So how do I solve this problem?



Thanks,



Peter
