But be aware of the drawbacks from replacing multiple words with its  
corresponding acryonym/alias during analysis. The analyzis at search-time 
cannot perform the normalization to a single word if the rest of the words 
in the search string are not recognized:

- Prefix search: [cyber] [ca*] would not match [cybercafe]
- Wildcard search: [cyber] [ca?e] would not match [cybercafe]
- Fuzzy search: [cyber] [cage~] would not match [cybercafe]

I am not sure that this is correct but perhaps someone in this forum can.
