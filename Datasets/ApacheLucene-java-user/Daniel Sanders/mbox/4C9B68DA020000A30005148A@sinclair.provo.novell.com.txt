SUBJECT: RE: Problem with Numeric range query.
DATE: 23 Sep 2010


Thank you for your timely response. 

It's going to take me longer to create an isolated test case you can test this with.  I will
see what I can do. 

In the meantime, I have some follow up information in response to your other suggestions.


1) I don't think my problem is that the IndexWriter has not committed the document.  Here's
why: 


In my test case, I first retrieve a document using a different lucene query on a different
field.  From that document I extract the value for timestamp field and then perform the NumericRangeQuery
on that value as described below.  I was doing as a way to create a unit test that would verify
that the NumericRangeQuery was working properly.  I think the fact that first query found
the document is evidence that the IndexWriter had committed the document.  Hence, I would
expect that if I follow that query with a NumericRangeQuery it should be able to find the
same document. 

2) I also don't think my problem is values near Long.MIN_VALUE or Long.MAX_VALUE.  My values
are all timestamps, which are positive integers that are not anywhere near those two extremes.
 The values originally come from the java.util.Date.getTime() method. 

3) I will try the upper+lower inclusive = true and using same value for min and max, although
I don't see how that will change anything.  I have actually debugged through the code for
NumericRangeQuery, and if minInclusive == false, then min is incremented, and if maxInclusive
== false, then max is decremented.  So my query: 

   NumericRangeQuery.newLongRange("timestamp",8,timeX-1,timeX,false,true) 

is essentially equivalent to the query you suggest trying: 

   NumericRangeQuery.newLongRange("timestamp",8,timeX,timeX,true,true) 

right?

Hi,

Can you provide some self-containing testcase that shows your problem? In
most cases those problems are caused by not committing changes to
IndexWriter before opening the IndexReader.

Additionally, if you only want to look for exactly one timestamp (like a
TermQuery), use a NumericRangeQuery with upper+lower inclusive = true and
use the specific value to search for as both upper and lower.

You may also hit a bug, that's already solved in SVN (it happens when the
lower bound is near Long.MAX_VALUE or the upper bound near Long.MIN_VALUE):
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2541
