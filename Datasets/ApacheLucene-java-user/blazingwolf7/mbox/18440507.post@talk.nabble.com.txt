Hi, 

I am working on extracting information from around 2 to 3 million document
and place it into the memory to retrieve it for filtering search results.
The application will have to extract the information and store it for every
search. I am wondering what will be the best way to store this information.

ArrayList or hashmap? Which is the fastest among these two? I will have to
directly access information in a particular position by using some
identifier which both of this is capable of doing. So I just need to know
which one will be faster. And what is the maximum size of the arraylist and
hashmap?

thanks
