Thanks for the reply. I had try to start a new project already. Like I had
mention, I actually go through the code from the start of the application
and till the end where the scoring is done. 

But unfortunately, I still fail to locate the part where Lucene open the
index to perform the search. Anyone has any idea on how to do this?
