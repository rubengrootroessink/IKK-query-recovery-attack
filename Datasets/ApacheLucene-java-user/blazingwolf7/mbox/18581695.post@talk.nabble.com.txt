SUBJECT: Storing information
DATE: 22 Jul 2008


Hi, 

I am using Lucene to perform searching. I have certain information that will
be loaded everytime a search is run. This means, if there are multiple user
running the search at the same time, the information will be loaded multiple
times. 

This is not effecient at all, so I was wondering is there anyway I can load
those values only once, and every search perform after that no matter how
many user will simply refer to the preloaded values?

Thanks
