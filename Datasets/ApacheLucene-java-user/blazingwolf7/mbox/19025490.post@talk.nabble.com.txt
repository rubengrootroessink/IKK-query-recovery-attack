SUBJECT: Index of Lucene
DATE: 18 Aug 2008


Hi,

I am currently using Lucene for indexing. After a index a file, I will use
LUKE to open it and check the index. And there is 1 part that I am curious
about. In Luke, under the Document tab, I randomly select a document and
display it. At the bottom will be 4 columns, Field, ITSVopLBC, Norm and
String Value. 

I am wondering, what is Norm for? And where is it created during indexing
time? Which method calculates it? 

Could anyone advise me on this? Thanks for the help
