SUBJECT: How Lucene Search
DATE: 26 Jun 2008


hi, 

I am fairly new to Lucene and is currently going over its source code. I had
read through the code for a few times, mapping it and all but I seems to be
facing a problem. I could go all the way to the calculation of score for
each result obtain, but strangely I did not managed to locate the part where
Lucene open the index and check for the matching term.

What I mean is that, I want to check on how Lucene actually open the index
and perform the search. I went through all the methods in IndexReader,
IndexSearcher and some other related class but still fail to locate the
method responsible.

Could anyone help me with this? Thanks
