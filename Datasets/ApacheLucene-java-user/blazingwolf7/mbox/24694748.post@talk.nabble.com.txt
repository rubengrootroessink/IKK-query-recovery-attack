SUBJECT: Generating Query for Multiple Clauses in a Single Field
DATE: 28 Jul 2009


Hi,

I am currently creating a search engine and will need to generate a query
like the following:
title:(+chemistry +"national curriculum")

its mention that it can be done using the QueryParser but unfortunately I
can't find any reference in how to used it. Can anyone help me with this?

Thanks
