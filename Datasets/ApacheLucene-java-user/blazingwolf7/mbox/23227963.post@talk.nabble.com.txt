Hi,

I created a query that will find a match inside documents. Example of text
match "terror india"
And documents with this exact match does exists.

My query generated is like this: (title:"terror india"^4 content:"terror
india"^3 site:"terror india")
But why does it not return any results?
can anyone help me with this? Thanks in advance
