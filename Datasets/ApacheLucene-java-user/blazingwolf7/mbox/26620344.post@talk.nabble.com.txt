SUBJECT: Re: Storing image with Lucene
DATE: 3 Dec 2009


Thanks for the reply...yes i am trying to create an Image Search. And I did
create something similar to your
suggestion on only storing the links. But due to some limitations being set
on me...I have to find a way to 
store the image..

Maybe I could try the transform idea.
