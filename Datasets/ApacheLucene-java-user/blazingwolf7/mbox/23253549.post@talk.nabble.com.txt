SUBJECT: Why Lucene phrase searching fail?
DATE: 27 Apr 2009


hi,

I am trying to perform a search using Lucene. The keyword : "national india"
This phrase exists inside the content. I try searching it using Lucene and
it fail to return any results. Then I try to search it using Luke, with the
quotes and it also fail to return results.

Why is that happening? Can anyone advise me on this?
