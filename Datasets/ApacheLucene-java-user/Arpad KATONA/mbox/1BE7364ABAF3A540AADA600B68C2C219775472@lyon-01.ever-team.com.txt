Hi Shoba,

do you know the medieval song :

Orientis partibus
adventavit asinus
etc...

i really deserve to be called an "asinus", it is hard to do but i must APOLOGIZE to all the
Lucene-Users for my mistake, i remember tavarish Otis Gospodnetic's e-mail on Wed, 2 Apr 2003
08:34:30 -0800 (PST) as he wrote : "Funny how this is the outcome of 90% of the problems people
have with software - their own mistakes"...

In fact, the code i sent to the list runs fine, as you say. We are using here some "FrenchAnalyzer"
and in the code i had run here on my computer there was that FrenchAnalyzer in stead of the
StandardAnalyzer. In order to avoid embarrassing questions about "what is that french-thing
you use there?" (nevertheless, even embarrassing questions might be sometimes helpful) i replaced
"french" by "standard" in the sample code without testing the behavior of that piece of prog
with StandardAnalyzer.

The fault is in our french-specific filters, as i began to look at the java source files (a
work of an ex-Collegue of us), i found that in same places the tokens are created in this
way e.g. :
  Token tok = new Token(sTxt, 0, sTxt.length(), "word");
it is not surprising if Token.startOffset() returns then always zero...

Well, one more funny anecdote on the Lucene Users Mailig List.

Pax

Hi Arpad,

Tested your codes with this example. Seems to run fine....
