Each sentence will be a document.  Read the file a line at a time and
make each line a separate document.

The user input will be a word, or words, which you can pass through a
QueryParser to get a Query which can be used to search the index, and
which will return matching documents i.e. sentences.


Lucene in Action is strongly recommended.  Somewhat out of date but
all the core concepts are still valid.
