Just trying to grasp the concept.

 

I want to search a text file where each line is a separate item to be
searched.  When text it entered by the user, I want to return all the lines
in which that text appears.

For example, if the text file has:

I like apples.

I went to the store.

I bought an apple.

 

If the user searches "apple", I want it to return the first and third
sentences.

 

Is each sentence a Token?  Is the user input going to be a QueryParser?  How
should I read in the file so that each line of text is a token to search?

 

Thanks in advance.
