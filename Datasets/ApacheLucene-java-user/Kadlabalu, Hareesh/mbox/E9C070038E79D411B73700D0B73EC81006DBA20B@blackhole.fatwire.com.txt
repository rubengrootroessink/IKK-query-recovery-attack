I want to use Lucene version 1.4.3 and upgrade to the current SVN version
later on. I was hoping if there is some way to use 'morelikethis' code in
1.4.3.

If someone could someone please extract a version of this file from source
control that corresponds to lucene 1.4.3 or if this can file can be
back-ported, it would be greatly helpful. 

Or, here are some 'guesses' to get around compilation errors using lucene
1.4.3. Please review if this correct (because I am not familiar with recent
changes)

1. 
IndexReader.getFieldNames( IndexReader.FieldOption.INDEXED ) does not
compile on 1.4.3, replace with IndexReader.getIndexedFieldNames( true )?

2. 
query.add(tq, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD) does not compile on 1.4.3, is this
the same as query.add( tq, true, true )?

Thank you
-Hareesh

All developers in the lucene group, you guys are awesome and it is a
pleasure to work with this library. I have one small request, is it possible
to make the archive of 'Contribution' section that corresponds to Lucene
1.4.3 release available online?

You need to point to the new Lucene Jar (from SVN, not the 1.4.3)
version.
