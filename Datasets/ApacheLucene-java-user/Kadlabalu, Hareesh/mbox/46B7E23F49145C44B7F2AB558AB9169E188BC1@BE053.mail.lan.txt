SUBJECT: Locking in Lucene 2.0
DATE: 1 Feb 2007

Hi,
I am starting to work with Lucene 2.0 and I noticed that we can no
longer create an FSDirectory using a LockFactory. 

Could someone point me to some discussion or documentation related to
locking and what has changed in terms of best practices? It appears that
the only way to build custom locking is to write my own Directory
implementation. 

Thanks
