Hi,

this is interesting but why do you use "AND" in your query when both the
term are a MUST (they have +). See
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/queryparsersyntax.html for more details
about Lucene query syntax.

Try dropping the AND and try the following query:
+courseName:cooking +mandatory:Y
This query means that both the terms must be met.

If this does not work check that the default operator is set to AND and also
you can directly check what data is in your index (using Luke for example).

Let me know if this helps.

Regards,
Lukas
