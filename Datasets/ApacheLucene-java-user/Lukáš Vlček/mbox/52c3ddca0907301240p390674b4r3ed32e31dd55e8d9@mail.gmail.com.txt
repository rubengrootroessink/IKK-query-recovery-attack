Don,
To me it seems as if there is only one document in your index, and moreover
the only document has mutifield courseName and mandatory fields (this means
you will get the same result even if you query +courseName:art +mandatory:N).
Do you think you can share how you create your domain objects and how you
push them into index?

Did you check you transaction logic? Are you sure you indexed all the domain
objects you wanted?
