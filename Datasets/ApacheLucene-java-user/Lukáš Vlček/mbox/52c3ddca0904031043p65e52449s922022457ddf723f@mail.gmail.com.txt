So it means that autonomy search solution is doing better out of the box
then any solution based on Lucene right now? And bringing Lucene based
solution at the same level would require additional investments and
non-trivial development (probably not small). In other words if client is
using autonomy then it makes no sense to migrate to Lucene...Hmmm... great
pity.

Thanks,
Lukas
