Thanks, I have got it now. It's because I did not have
the optional jar for Ant. 

Here is some guide on how to compile lucene-1.2-rc2 in
case someone needs it:
1) Get Ant from the jakarta website, do not forget to
download the optional jar as well.
2) Get JavaCC from
http://www.webgain.com/products/java_cc/, this is
optional because lucene-1.2-rc2 come along with
javaCC.zip in its /lib folder.
3) Run ant from the lucene folder. You don't need to
change the builde.properties file, but the
configuration is there.
