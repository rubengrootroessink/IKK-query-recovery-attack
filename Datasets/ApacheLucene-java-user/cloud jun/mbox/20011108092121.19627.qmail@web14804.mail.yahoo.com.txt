SUBJECT: lucene indexing technique
DATE: 8 Nov 2001

Hi,

I am asking this question because I am currently
working on an internet search engine program. Can any
body tell me where is the part that lucene does its
indexing and which kind of indexing technique it is
using? Say, inverted file, document signature or
something else?

Thanks
jun
