SUBJECT: Spanish analyzer and Indexing StarOffice docs
DATE: 21 Jul 2003

Hi. I'd like to know if some of you could help me finding a spanish analyzer (free if possible).
I'd also like to know how can I index a file made on StarOffice 5.x (.sdw and .sdx files),
I've been looking on google for them but I have not found anything about this, 

Thank you in advance for your collaboration,
