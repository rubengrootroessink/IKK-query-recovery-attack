There is no option to provide an Occur.SHOULD to the PhraseQuery. So where
does it go? I changed the source to look like this:

PhraseQuery pq = new PhraseQuery();
for (String word : words) {
	for (String field : fields) {
		pq.add(new Term(field, word));
	}
}
Hits hits = indexSearcher.search(pq);

However, I get an exception:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: All phrase terms must be in the same
field: description:green tree

I don't understand how to a) search for combinations of words like "green
tree", b) search in multiple fields (description, text, ...) and c) search
by a SHOULD restriction.
