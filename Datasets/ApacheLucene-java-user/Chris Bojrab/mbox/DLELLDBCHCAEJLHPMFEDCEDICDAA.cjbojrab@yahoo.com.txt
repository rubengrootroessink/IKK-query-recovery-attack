SUBJECT: RAMDirectory question
DATE: 15 Oct 2001

I am using Lucene for a java project and am interested in using the
RAMDirectory to store the index.  I am new to Lucene and have a question
regarding the use of RAMDirectory.  Is it possible to load the RAMDirectory
index from a file or another source so as to keep from having to build the
index from scratch every time the application starts?  I like having the
index in memory, but I don't like having to rebuild the index every time I
restart the server.

Thanks,
Chris Bojrab
