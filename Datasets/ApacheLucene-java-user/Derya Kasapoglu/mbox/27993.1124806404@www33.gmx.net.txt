Hi, 

is there anybody who have the poi hslf classes to extract text from Power
Point files. I know the classes are on the poi sites but they are not
packaged in a jar!
If i download all of them by myself i get version problems!
So maybe someone has a jar file and can send me?

Thanks in forward
Bye
