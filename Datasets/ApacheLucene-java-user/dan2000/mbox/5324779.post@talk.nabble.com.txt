Thanks Doron. The site you provided doesn't support firefox, that's why had
problem with downloading. 

Your code works fine and I've just noticed I didn't change the create
parameter to false when I've leaned the index directory. Sorry for my
mistake. 

Thanks a lot for your help Doron. You advice helped me a lot.
