SUBJECT: Re: TermQuery doesn't support non-english charecters
DATE: 9 Jul 2006


Ok, here is my code:
Term term = new Term(myField, myKey);
TermQuery query = new TermQuery(term);
mySearcher.search(query);

If myKey is an English, everything works fine. If myKey is not an English,
it always return null.

With other types queries, I can use this:
Query query = new QueryParser(myField,
myLanguageAnalyzer).parse(myField+":"+myKey);
mySearcher.search(query);

But this returns more than one result which is not what i wanted. That's why
I need to use TermQuery to do ID/Key based search. Any idea?
