Thanks a lot Doron. I'm gonna give it a try now. The problem I've had before
was that I set my writer to null right after close it. That's why I got lock
timeout exception when i try to create a the writer again. Guess I just need
to close it, and re-open it would avoid the locking problems then.

Thanks.
