yes, myField is a tokenized field. I've used ChineseAnalyzer. here is an
examle text ??

Let me explain what exactly what I want.

myField is a tokenized field:
new Field("key",key, Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED)

I sometimes need to find the exact match. What would be the best way to find
a exact match for a tokenized field? I've tried:
Query query = new QueryParser(myField,
myLanguageAnalyzer).parse(myField+":"+myKey); 
mySearcher.search(query); 

But I always get a lot of relevant results with above code. The
myLanguageAnalyzer is the same analyzer that was used for indexing.  I just
want something like "key = myKey" instead of " key like myKey".
