Currently I'm using version 3.2.
I used already 4.x some month ago but there was to much change to that time
so I decided to go with 3.0.x and updated to 3.1 and now to 3.2.

I'm still dealing with my fieldCache OOM issue and want to understand
why things are as they are.
I have already removed/solved one "insane message" from fieldCache and
three ReadOnlyDirectoryReader Entries from fieldCache.
Only sorting produces now an entry.

So action that starts a new searcher and closes the old one (like replication)
should release cache from fieldCache through garbage collection?

Regards
Bernd
