SUBJECT: Re: which unicode version is supported with lucene
DATE: 25 Feb 2011


I just tried vim as editor, seams to work.

- start vim
- enter i (for insert)
- enter <ctrl>+v and then <shift>+U (for uppercase U)
- enter upper Unicode with 8 digits
(e.g. 0001D5A0 for U+1D5A0 [MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF CAPITAL A])
