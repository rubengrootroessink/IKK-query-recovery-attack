SUBJECT: which unicode version is supported with lucene
DATE: 25 Feb 2011

Dear list,

a very basic question about lucene, which version of
unicode can be handled (indexed and searched) with lucene?

It looks like lucene can only handle the very old Unicode 2.0
but not the newer 3.1 version (4 byte utf-8 unicode).

Is that true?

Regards,
Bernd
