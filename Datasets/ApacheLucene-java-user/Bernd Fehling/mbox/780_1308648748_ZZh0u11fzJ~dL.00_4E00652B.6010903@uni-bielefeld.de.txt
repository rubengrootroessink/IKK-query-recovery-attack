SUBJECT: questions about fieldCache
DATE: 21 Jun 2011

I'm trying to understand the logic of/behind fieldCache.

Who has written this peace of code or has good knowledge about it?

Why is it under the hood of jetty?

I see FieldCache$StringIndex with
- f_dccollection
- f_dcyear
- f_dctype
but also
- dctitle --> f_dctitle --> f_dccreator
- title --> f_dcyear

There are some entries without further reference like the first examples
and some that have references to further HashMaps like a chain.
Why is it this way, what is the purpose?

What is fieldCache doing if a server is replicated, will all old content
be cleaned up because of a new index with new content?

Regards
Bernd
