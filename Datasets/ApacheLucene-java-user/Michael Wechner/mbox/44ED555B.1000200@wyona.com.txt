well, the issue seems to me rather that the (X)HTML is hardcoded into 
the JSP resp. Servlet which creates
a maintenance nightmare when one wants to customize the layout and at 
the same time upgrade from time to time.

As an alternative I would rather suggest that one generates a 
well-defined XML with JSP or a servlet and then applies
an XSLT. If somebody is afraid of performance issues then one might want 
to consider generating the servlet or jsp code
dynamically out of the XSLT ...
