SUBJECT: incrementally indexing a million documents
DATE: 14 Jun 2004

I try to index around a million documents. The problem is
that I run out of memory during sorting by uid when I go through
the directory recursively.

Well, I could add more memory, but this wouldn't really solve my problem,
because at some point I will always run out of memory (e.g. 10 million 
documents).

Is there another approach than sorting by uid?

Thanks

Michi
