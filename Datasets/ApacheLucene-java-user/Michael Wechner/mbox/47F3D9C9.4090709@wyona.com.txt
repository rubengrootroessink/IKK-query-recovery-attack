what kind of database do you use to store your emails?

I am asking because it might make sense to introduce some data 
abstraction layer (for example JCR or Yarep) which would access your 
database and has built-in Lucene and hence you would't have to worry 
about Lucene itself, but could rather search like

Node[] emails = getRepository("emails").search("sender", QUERY);
for (i < emails.length) System.out.print(emails[i].getProperty("body");

Otherwise I would suggest to start at

http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_1/gettingstarted.html
