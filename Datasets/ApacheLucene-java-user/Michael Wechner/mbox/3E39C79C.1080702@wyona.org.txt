sure, no problem. Actually I think it's good to have small demo code and 
"larger" industrial strength code.

yeah, I am not sure if there is a standard way to do this. I just know 
from an Atomz demo that they
are using something like this.
It would be nice if there would be a "standard tag" for this, or at 
least that the Open Source Search Engines
projects could agree on one. To have it configurable would also be nice 
of course, but I think it
wouldn't be necessary for the beginning.

Thanks
