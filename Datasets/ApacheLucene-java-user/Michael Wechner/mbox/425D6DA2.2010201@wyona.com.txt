I think it would make sense to enhance the current JSP by introducing a 
"format" parameter, e.g.

nutch?format=xml

whereas default could be HTML (or XHTML)

It seems to me that the following formats would make sense most:

XML (plus an XSLT attached, e.g. 
http://search.msn.ch/results.aspx?q=Nutch&format=rss&FORM=ZZRE)

and a

(X)HTML like XML with a CSS attached.

If people are interested then I could try to provide such a patch.

Re the XSLT one then could offer various XSLTs in order to cover the 
various RSS
and Atom formats (and other "XMLs" of course).
