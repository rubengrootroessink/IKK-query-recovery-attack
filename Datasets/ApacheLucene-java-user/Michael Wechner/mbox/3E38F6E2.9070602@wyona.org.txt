Hi

I am looking for an HTMLParser which skips text tagged by

<no-index>  or something similar. This way I could exclude for
instance a "global navigation section" within the HTML

<no-index>
International<br>
Business<br>
Science<br>
...
</no-index>

It seems that the current demo/HTMLParser 
(http://lucene.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/faq/faqmanager.cgi?file=chapter.indexing&toc=faq#q11)
is not capable of doing something like that.

Any pointers are very welcome.

Thanks a lot

Michael
