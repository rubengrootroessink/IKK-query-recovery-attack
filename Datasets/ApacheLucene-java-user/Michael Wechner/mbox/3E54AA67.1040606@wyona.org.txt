That's very interesting.

I have tried something similar by integrating
Lucene into Wyona, which is a CMS based on Cocoon,
and I also separated Structure from Layout. You can try it out at

HTML:

http://195.226.6.70:8080/wyona-cms/oscom/search-oscom/lucene?publication-id=all&queryString=Cocoon+Wyona&fields=all&find=Search

XML:

http://195.226.6.70:8080/wyona-cms/oscom/search-oscom/lucene.xml?publication-id=all&queryString=Cocoon+Wyona&fields=all&find=Search

I think XooMLe also did a pretty good job:

Maybe we find a way how to join efforts

Thanks

Michael
