SUBJECT: Score: Lucene 1.2 versus 1.3-dev1
DATE: 16 Dec 2002

Hi

I started to deploy Lucene 1.3-dev1 from CVS very recently and
noticed that the "score" is kind of different.

In the case of Lucene1.2 I received scores such as for instance

  3.45345234 * 10e-1

In the case of Lucene1.3-dev1 I am receiving scores such as for instance

  3.23232131 *10e-8

Is this correct or have I to change something within my Lucene 
"implementation"?

Thanks a lot in advance

Michael
