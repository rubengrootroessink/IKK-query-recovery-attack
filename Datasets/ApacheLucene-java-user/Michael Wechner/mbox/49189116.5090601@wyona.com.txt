SUBJECT: performance/scalability issues re filtering of protected search results
DATE: 10 Nov 2008

Hi

We have about 1 mio documents and growing within a hierarchical order (3 
to 20 deep) and about 3000 people accessing these nodes, whereas some 
people have access to certain branches and other people to other 
branches and some branches are shared. The access control of these nodes 
is changing every day and also contains shortcuts  which allows people 
to glimpse into parts of branches which they otherwise do not have 
access to.

Currently we have one index for all nodes, which is ok 
peformance/scalability wise, but before displaying the results we need 
to filter based on the access privileges each user has, which is very 
bad peformance wise, because it might be that the first 10K hits are all 
protected re this user and hence it can take a very long time that one 
finally finds a result that the user is actually allowed to see.

We were thinking about introducing an index for each user which only 
contains the documents a user is actually is allowed to see, but this 
doesn't scale well either if the user number is growing.

Any hints how other people are approaching such a situation would be 
very much appreciated.

Thanks

Michael
