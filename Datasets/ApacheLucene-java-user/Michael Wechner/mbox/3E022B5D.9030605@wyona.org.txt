Concerning PDF:

Before indexing you should extract the text from the PDF and save it
as .txt (Then you can index the .txt, but reference the PDF uri). To do 
this have a look at


http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html

or

http://www.pdfbox.org/

These links are listed at

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/contributions.html

Also take a look at the FAQ
