Hmm, no - the stemmed token is indexed and the full field is stored.  
I guess that means running a search for the stem and then using the  
same logic as a highlighter to find and extract the actual terms from  
each document.

How would you recommend doing this - using positionIncrement to store  
the stem and the original word at the same position, perhaps?
