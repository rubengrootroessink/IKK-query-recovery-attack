So, forgetting the RMI stuff, I put together a test client very similar to the one in the book
"Lucene in Action" page 182. 

The  client:

1. instantiates a IndexSearcher
2. loops through queries, searches, prints hit count, saves nothing

I am only able to run through about 40 searches before I get an OutOfMemoryException.  JDK
1.5

Because of this, I have put a counter in my search server to close and re-open the IndexSearcher
after a certian number of searches. But this shouldn't be necessary right? What's eating up
all the memory?

Source code @ http://urbanmarsupial.com/share/TestLuceneMemory.java

Any hints would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Craig

No reason that I can think of.  What makes you think the problem is with the IndexSearcher?
 Maybe it's something else in your code, for instance.
Make sure you have the same version of Java on both ends of the call.  Also, Java 6 made our
RMI calls a lot more stable than even 1.5.

I am using an RMI architecture for calling a remote service which uses an IndexSearcher in
its own JVM. I am starting the service with the following provisions for memory allocation
and garbage collection: java -server -Xmx1024m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC

After about 1000 search calls I start to run out of memory, and I have to close and re-open
the IndexSearcher, loosing any cached data and filters... Is there any reason why I shouldn't
be able to use my IndexSearcher forever, until I want to close it?

Thanks!

Craig
