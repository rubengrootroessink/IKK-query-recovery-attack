SUBJECT: distributing the indexing process

If we have to index a lot of documents, is there a way to divide the
documents into multiple sets and index them on multiple machines in
parallel, and then merge the resulting indexes back into a single
machine? If yes, will the result be logically equivalent to indexing all
the documents on a single machine?

 

Thanks,
