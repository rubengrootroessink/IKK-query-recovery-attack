A bit tardy, but I was in-between versions, hence wanted to wait until
I had posted the new ones up.

We have developed a java-based daemon we call Luceneserver, and
which listens on a port and understands either of two text protocols, one
line-based, and one XML. This allows people to set up a server box
centrally, and then use Php, Perl, Java, or whatever to index/search a
central Lucene repository pretty easily. It has been designed such that
you can partition off separate "domains" (eg. websites) within the
same index, if you wish.

In particular we've also developed a family of Php classes to talk to the
above via the XML protocol, included in an opensource web development
platform we call Axyl.

Taken together, all of this might (or might not) be of some use to the
original poster, as a starting point, or just for ideas.

Version 2.1.1-1 of Axyl and Axyl-Lucene is available at:
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/axyl

Cheers,
Paul.
