Ok, I'm hearing it's a doubtful option. ;-)

In general, the above scenario is exactly what would happen. Ie. filter gets
built, sometime later a doc might be deleted (or not), then sometime later
a doc will be added (and added to the existing filter).

As it stands in the API, if I build a filter, and a document which happens to
be in it gets deleted from the index, does it automatically get removed from
the filter?

Right - I'll make sure it's broken before diving in there and fixing it... ;-)
