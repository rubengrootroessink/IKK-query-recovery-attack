I was wondering if there was a nice way to add documents to a cached filter
'manually' as it were.

The reason would be to avoid a complete refresh of the filter, if you
already knew the docids of the extra documents to add.

An example would be if I had a filter based on datetime, which contained
all documents since a recent fixed timestamp. Then as each new document
arrived, and was indexed it could be simply added to the filter quickly,
instead of having to rebuild it from scratch each time.

Cheers,
Paul.
