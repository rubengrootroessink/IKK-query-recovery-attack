SUBJECT: IOException in updateDocument(term, document) method of IndexWriter
DATE: 3 Jan 2011

Hi,

 

we are calling updateDocument(term, document) method on IndexWriter and
after that we are calling close() method of indexWriter.

 

In Close() method i got the following IO exception.

 

\\server01\files\luceneIndex\_c.cfs (The process cannot access the file
because it is being used by another process)

 

Ni this case index writer was created successfully and it acquired lock
for that directory and due to above exception the lock file was not
removed.

 

Is there any chances that _c.cfs file is used by any other process
because index writer already acquires lock on that directory?

 

Is there any way to handle such scenario ?

 

 

Lucene Version : 3.0.2

OS : Windows Server 2003 64 bit

 

 

Thanks,

Atul
