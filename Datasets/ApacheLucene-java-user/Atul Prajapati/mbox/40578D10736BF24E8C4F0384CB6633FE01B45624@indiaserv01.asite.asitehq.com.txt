DATE: 3 Jan 2011

Hi,

Right now we don't have full stack trace for this exception and this
issue is not easily replicable. We have updated our code to log full
stack trace and once we get this replicated i will post the full stack
trace here.

If anyone have any idea about this then please let us know so we can
investigate it further in that direction.

Thanks,
Atul

Can you post the full exception that you hit?

And maybe a standalone test case showing the problem?
