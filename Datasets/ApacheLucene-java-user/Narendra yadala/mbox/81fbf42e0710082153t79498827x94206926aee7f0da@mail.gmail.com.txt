SUBJECT: Re: Lucene indexing error
DATE: 9 Oct 2007

Thanks very much for the information. I did not include the other portion of
the stack trace because it was totally belonging to Jackrabbit library. Now
I guess the problem is due to the fact that Jackrabbit's latest version is
using Lucene 2.0 for its indexing purposes. So I will search some patch
which involves fixing this bug for Jackrabbit.

Regards
Narendra
