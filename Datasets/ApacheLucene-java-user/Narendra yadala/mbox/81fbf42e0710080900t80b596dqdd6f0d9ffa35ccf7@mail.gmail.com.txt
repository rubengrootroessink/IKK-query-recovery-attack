SUBJECT: Re: Lucene indexing error
DATE: 8 Oct 2007

But then the core problem is that the index that is created is in a totally
corrupted state.
So deleting or keeping the lock does not make a difference as the Index
itself is not created properly.
The problem arises when the index is getting created itself.
