DATE: 21 Apr 2003

I forgot to mention a couple of things that might help narrow down the 
problem:

Searching for two characters (ie a bigram pair term that is known to be 
in the index) returns 0 results also.

Searching for a single character (ie a single Japanese character term 
that is known to be in the index) *DOES* find results.

Very strange.

Thanks,

Matt
