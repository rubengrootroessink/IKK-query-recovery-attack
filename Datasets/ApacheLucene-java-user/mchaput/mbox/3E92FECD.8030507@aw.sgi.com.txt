SUBJECT: HTMLParser choking on Unicode
DATE: 8 Apr 2003

When I try to index Japanese HTML files using HTMLParser, I just get
"lexical errors" in every file:

   Parse Aborted: Lexical error at line 12, column 28.
   Encountered: "\u2030" (8240), after : ""

Is there something I have to do to make HTMLParser work with Unicode?

(I haven't done anything special with readers or encodings (don't really
know much about it)... is that the problem?)

Thanks,

Matt
