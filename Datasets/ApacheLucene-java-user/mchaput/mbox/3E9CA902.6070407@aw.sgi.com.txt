Sorry, I thought I had this but I've run into another wall...

I'm trying to index shift_JIS encoded Japanese HTML using the demo 
HTMLParser.

I get an inputstream (FileInputStream or ZipInputStream) from the 
file/zip entry, then I wrap an InputStreamReader around it with a "SJIS" 
encoding type, then wrap a BufferedReader around that.

Then I create a org.apache.lucene.demo.html.HTMLParser with the 
BufferedReader.

On every file, I get something like this:

  Parse Aborted: Lexical error at line 9, column 47.
  Encountered: "\u8a2d" (35373), after : ""

The error messages for different files have different characters at 
different positions, but it always seems like it's choking on Japanese 
text in HTML attribute values.

I've tried this on our own documents and some Japanese help from WinDVD, 
and get the same problem. Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Matt
