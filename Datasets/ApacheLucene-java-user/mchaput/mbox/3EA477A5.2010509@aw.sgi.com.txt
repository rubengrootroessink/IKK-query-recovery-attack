Sorry to keep spamming the list like this, but I think I figured out the 
problem I posted about earlier today.

The CJKTokenizer was returning an extra, empty token at the end of each 
run. Hence the space at the end of the string representation of the query.

Now, to figure out WHY...

Cheers,

Matt
