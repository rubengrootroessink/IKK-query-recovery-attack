SUBJECT: Selecting the maxium/highest numerical value from a lucene Index)
DATE: 23 Jan 2006

Hi

A database is used as our primary data store.  Our lucene index is then
created and updated from this database.

We store the value of the database primary key in the lucene index as we
need to be able to identify documents across the database and lucene
index.

New documents are inserted into the database on a daily basis and this
is not necessarily a batch process.

What is the easist way to identify the maximum or highest primary key
value in the lucene index?

(The database equivalent of SELECT MAX(id) FROM CONTRACTS)

I would then be able to add documents to the lucene index from the
database whose primary key is greater than the highest primary key value
already in the index.

SELECT * FROM contracts WHERE id > maximumIdInLuceneIndex

Is there a standard approach to achieve this?

Aldo
