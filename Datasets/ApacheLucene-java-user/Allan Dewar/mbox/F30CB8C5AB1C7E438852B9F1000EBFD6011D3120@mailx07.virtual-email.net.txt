Thanks for the suggestions...

I've only been using Lucene for a few months, so will go with the sort
option for now and see how that works.

Bummer that you can't step backwards with a TermEnum... finding the
first term is cheap, but finding the last is expensive.

How feasible would it be to add a prev() to TermEnum?  Would it be worth
it?  It seems like it would be useful for numeric fields to be able to
quickly find the max as well as the min without filling the fieldcache.
