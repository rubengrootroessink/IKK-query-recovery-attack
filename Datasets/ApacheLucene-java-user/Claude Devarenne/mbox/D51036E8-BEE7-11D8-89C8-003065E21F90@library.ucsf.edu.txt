SUBJECT: indexing with 1.4-rc3 only yields single .cfs file
DATE: 15 Jun 2004

Hi,

I just upgraded to 1.4-rc3 and re-indexed my data.  I did not change 
any code and noticed that in the index directory there is a single .cfs 
file which I am guessing stands for compound file system.  Search works 
fine but after checking out the latest from CVS I did not see this 
mentioned in the fileformats documentation.  Is this the normal 
behavior for indexes from now on or is something else going on?  When 
creating the index I see the .tis, .frq and other files being created.  
Maybe I need to update my indexer, sorry if I did not RTFM.

Claude
