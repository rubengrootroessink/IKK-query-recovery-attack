Hi,

I thought it is the StopAnalyzer that weeds out numbers.  StandardAnalyzer 
keeps in them in I believe as I ran into the same issue using the jsp demo 
code and just replaced StopAnalyzer  with StandardAnalyzer  and numbers 
were searchable.  This assumes you index with a StandardAnalyzer  though.
