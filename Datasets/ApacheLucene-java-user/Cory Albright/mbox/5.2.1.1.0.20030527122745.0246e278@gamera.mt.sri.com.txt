SUBJECT: too many hits - OutOfMemoryError
DATE: 27 May 2003

Hi -
	I have created an index of 1.8 million documents, each document containing 
5-10 fields.  When I run a search, that I know has a small number of hits, 
it works great.  However, if I run a search that I know will hit most of 
the documents, I get  an OutOfMemoryError.    I am using the basic search call:

	Hits hits = searcher.search(myQuery);

	Is there a better way to handle this problem?  Without knowing the number 
hits that a given query will return, how do I prevent against this problem?

Thank you,

Cory Albright
