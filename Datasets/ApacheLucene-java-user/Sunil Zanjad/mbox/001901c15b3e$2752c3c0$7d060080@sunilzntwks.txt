Hi,

Two weeks back I did have the problem which I stated.
But I am unable to reproduce the results currently. I tested and retested
but couldnt repeat the same.
Doug have U guys fixed the issue long back itself ?
(The only thing I have done fresh is to download the latest
lucene-1.2-rc1.zip file and re-installed lucene  - since it came along with
source code)

:-)

Regards,

Sunil Zanjad

If you think there is a bug, can you please provide a simple,
self-contained, reproducible test case that illustrates the problem.  You
could use Runtime.getRuntime().halt() to abruptly exit the JVM.

Thanks,

Doug
