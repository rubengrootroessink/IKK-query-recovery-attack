DATE: 4 Oct 2001

Hi,

I downloaded the Lucene API yesterday and like to really use the API. I have
not been able to get the source code for Lucene1.2.

All I have is the lucene-1.2-rc1.jar with some examples in it and the API &
have run the same.

Currently I am trying to search on specific keywords and phrases, but then
the words with characters like
 '_" '@' are never searched for. I would like to solve this problem. But
then overall understanding of the API
is a must. How do I go about the same & also where can I have get the source
code?

Regards,

Sunil Zanjad
