Hi,
you can export index with jar itself
and do not provide absolute path relative to file system
instead create folder named index in your project space
then as below you can get index directory

directory=FSDirectory.open(new File("index"));

here path is relative to you workspace which will not mess up, when you send
jar to other systems
eventually when you export project as jar or so, it will create folder named
index for index files.
 below is link for exporting and related stuff
