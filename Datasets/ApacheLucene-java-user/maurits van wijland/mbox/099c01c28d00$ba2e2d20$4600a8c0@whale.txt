SUBJECT: Language identifier, stemmers and analyzers
DATE: 15 Nov 2002

Hi there,
this is a cross post. I first send this to the developers list, but some how
no response yet. Maybe here, there is someone that can help me!

I am hoping to improve Lucene and add a strategy for multi lingual
support. We already have stemmers for almost all european languages,
now, I think this is the next step.

Any thoughts, please??
