SUBJECT: indexing unsupported mime types using Lucene
DATE: 18 Jun 2008


Hi,
I am using Lucene for indexing and searching the documents.
Its working file for supported documents. Now i want to index documents with
unsupported mime types.
Right now i am using LIUS which is built over Lucene for indexing the
documents.

Is there any tool which I can use for indexing the unsupported mime types.
Thanks in advance.
-Gaurav
