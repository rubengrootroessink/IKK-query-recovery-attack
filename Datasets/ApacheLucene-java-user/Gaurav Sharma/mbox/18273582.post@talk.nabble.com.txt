SUBJECT: too many clauses exception
DATE: 4 Jul 2008


Hi,

I am stuck with an exception in lucene (too many clauses).
When i am using a wild card such as a* i am getting too many clauses
exception. It saying maximum clause count is set to 1024. Is there any way
to increase this count.
Can u please help me out in overcoming this.

Thanks in advance.
