SUBJECT: adding term information to Index
DATE: 8 Jun 2006

Hello,

I try to use Lucene to make some experiments with the distribution of words
in documents. Using the TermPositionVector, one can compute some statistics
about word positions (mean, standard deviation, etc.). 

It is possible to store such statistical values directly in the Lucene
index?

For example, I want to save the statistical values of each Term (X1, X2, .,
Xn) by the index process, and get them later in query time.

 

Term    =>    <docNum, freq, <X1, X2, ... ,Xn> >

 

Should I modify the classes: IndexWriter.java and IndexReader.java?

 

Thank You
