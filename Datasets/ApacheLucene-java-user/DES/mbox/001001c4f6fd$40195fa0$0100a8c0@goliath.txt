Hi,

I am currently implementing some sort of semantic indexing with Lucene. I'm 
using lucene index to generate TFIDF matrix and then apply singular value 
decomposition on it. So I get some kind 2D vector representation for each 
document. The distance between  two vectors is their relevance.
If you are interested mail me.

Subject: document relations



Does someone know anything about document relations/closeness? I want to
see all documents related to a specific document. The relations can be
link relations (the other documents refer to that document). But the
relation could also be some kind of semantic relation. Does anybody have
some thought about this?

Met vriendelijke groet,
