SUBJECT: Re: Indexing terms only
DATE: 22 Dec 2004

I actually use Field.Text(String,String) to add documents to my index. Maybe 
I do not understand the way an analyzer works, but I thought that all German 
articles (der, die, das etc) should be filtered out. However if I use Luke 
to view my index, the original text is completely stored in a field. And 
what I need is term vector, that I can create from an indexed document 
field. So this field should contain terms only.
