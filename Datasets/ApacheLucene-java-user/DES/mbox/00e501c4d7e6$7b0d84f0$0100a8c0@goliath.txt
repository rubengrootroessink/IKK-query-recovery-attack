Hi

i've got to index some SGML documents and need help or some expiriences with it.
Documents contain a number of different articles with the same structure (TITLE, AUTHOR, DATA
etc.), but i need to index each article as a different document in my lucene index. Is there
some reader for SGML? I can create different documents, but how can i relate this index-documents
to my articles within SGML files?

thanks for help
