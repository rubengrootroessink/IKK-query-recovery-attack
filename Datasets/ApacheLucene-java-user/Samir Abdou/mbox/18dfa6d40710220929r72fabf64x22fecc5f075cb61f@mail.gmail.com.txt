SUBJECT: Re: Is there bug in CJKAnalyzer?
DATE: 22 Oct 2007

Hi,

For a chinese token like ABCD (where A,B,C and D are chinese signs),
CJKAnalyzer will generate the following overlapping bigrams: AB  BC  CD.
Thus issuing a query containing one chinese sign will not retrieve any
documents.  To overcome this, you have to index chinese characters as single
tokens (this will increase recall, but decrease precision).

Hope this will help,
Samir
