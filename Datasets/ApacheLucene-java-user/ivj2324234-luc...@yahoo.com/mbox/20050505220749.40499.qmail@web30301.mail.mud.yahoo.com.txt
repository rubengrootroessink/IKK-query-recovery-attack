SUBJECT: Changing default "OR" to "AND" for QueryParser
DATE: 5 May 2005

Hello all,

For us "OR" defaul causes confusion among the users 
because they expect narrower results as they add to 
the query but the oppsite happens because the terms 
are or-ed.

It it possble to request QueryParser to use "AND" as 
a default instead of "OR"? What API call(s) is
responsible for this?


Thanks,

Slavikas
