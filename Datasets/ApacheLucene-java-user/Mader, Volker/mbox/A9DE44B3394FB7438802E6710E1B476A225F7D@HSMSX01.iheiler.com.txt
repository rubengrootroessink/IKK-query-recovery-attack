SUBJECT: Performance with 5 Millions indexed items
DATE: 10 Sep 2002

Hi,

I've got a question about performance with "bigger" indexes. We used IndexWriter with GermanAnalyzer
to index data with the following fields:

Field1: ID (a long value)
Field2: Description (a free text)
Field3: Groups (a list of up to 10 long values encoded in a single string)
Field4: Classes (a list of up to 10 long values encoded in a single string)

Documents are created with the 4 fields and then added to the Indexwriter.
After all the index is optimized.

Searching now for a word in field "Description" using IndexSearcher(GermanAnalyzer) with FuzzyQuery
leads to search times up to 30 seconds on a Pentium 4 1,4GHz.
Also the retrieval with hits.doc(..) is very slow.

Any ideas?

Volker
