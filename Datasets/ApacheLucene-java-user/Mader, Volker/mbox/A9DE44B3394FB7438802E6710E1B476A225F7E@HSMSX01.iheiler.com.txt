SUBJECT: AW: Performance with 5 Millions indexed items
DATE: 10 Sep 2002

It's a completely local installation.
We used the standard mergeFactor.

Could you please describe your scenario? What classes/methods do you use for indexing/searching?
How big are your indexed fields? What is your hardware?

Sorry for this questions, but perhaps the answers help me understand lucene a little more.

Thanks
