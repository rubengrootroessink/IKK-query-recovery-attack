Ok, that sound really good. But something is not really clear to me and maybe
you can bring up a little light in the dark :-))

I have two indicies now:

1. With ID, Name
2. With ID, Forename, Street, Phonenumber

When i perform query with parallelreader how do lucene gets the concurrent
documents which results of both indices? Do i have to specifie somewhere
that the "ID"field is the relation???

Thanks,
Neils :-))
