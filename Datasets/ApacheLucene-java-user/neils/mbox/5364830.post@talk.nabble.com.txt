Hm,

so if following is possible than it would be great:

I have a table in SQL-Database with following columns: ID, Name, Forename,
Street, Phonenumber.

So i would make index for each column (ID will included in all indizies). 

After this i have 4 indicies. Name (in memory), Forename (on Disk), Street
(on Disk), Phonenumber (on Disk).

When now somebody search for name "kos" in the street "teststreet" can you
use parallelreader for this and how ?

Thank you very much!
Neils
