Hi,

i had seen that a suggestion-tool (like google: Did you mean xyz?) can be
implemented with a addon for lucene which is called SpellingChecker. 

Is this correct or is there another (better) solution and where can this
addon be downloaded (cause i do not find a working download link).

Thanks for you help ;-))
