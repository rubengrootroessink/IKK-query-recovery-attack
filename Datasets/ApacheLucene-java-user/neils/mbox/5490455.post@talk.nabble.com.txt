SUBJECT: Sorting with Parallelreader fails
DATE: 25 Jul 2006


Hi,
 
i have 3 indexfiles which i access over a parallelreader.
 
When i make a search, everything works fine, but....when i want to make a
search and sorting by a special
column i get an error. Here is my code:
 
 
Schnipp....
Dim field As SortField = New SortField("Streetname")
Dim sortByName As Sort = New Sort(Field)

Dim queri As Query = QueryParser.Parse(q, "Streetname", New
StandardAnalyzer)

hits = searcher.Search(queri, sortByName)

...Schnapp

Is there something wrong or is there a bug in parallelreader... ?

Thanks very much for you help :-))
