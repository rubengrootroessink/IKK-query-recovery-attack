Hi Chris,

thanks a lot for your reply. Currently I'm using a parallelreader, cause one
part of index is in the memory and one part is on disk. It seems like
parallelreader has a problem with sorting. So i have three questions:

1. Is there a know bug in the parallelreader?
2. Is it true, that only fields with one single term can be sorted?
3. The fields i would like to sort are indexed but not stored...is this a
problem for sorting `?

Thank you very much ;-))
