Hi,

i have two applications on an windows machine. One is the searchengine where
the index is can be searched.
The second application runs one time on a day which updates
(deletions/adding)
the index.

My question:
The index is already opened (Indexreader) by the frist application. Is there
a problem when second application accesses the same indexfiles for updating 
at the same time? I tried it and i get no exception, but when i search for
the for documents where the values where changed (first delete, than add 
new document), i can only find it with the old values, not with new ones.


Thanks a lot for you help :-))
