SUBJECT: Re: Are there any ready made implementations of lucene
DATE: 6 Nov 2001

Yeah, of course, we are developing a Content-Manager and we have made a Lucene implementation
to index and search and our Documents. We have now the Gold version and the final version
will be ready in www.ubicua.com in a few days.

I´m just a member of the Development team but I think it will be absolutely free for developers.
If you want to get more info please write me.
