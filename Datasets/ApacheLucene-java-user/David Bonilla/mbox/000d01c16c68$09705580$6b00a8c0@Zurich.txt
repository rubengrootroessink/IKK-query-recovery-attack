SUBJECT: Lucene and the numbers (again!)
DATE: 13 Nov 2001

Dear mates :

Yeah I know that i´m not very original and maybe the FAQ can resolve my problems but I didn´t
find any real help there. Ok... here we go :

The problem is... I have a J2EE application working with LUCENE and the basic searching works
properly but when I try to use a query with a number, Lucene gives me back all my indexed
documents and I don´t understand why.

I´m using the SimpleAnalyzer. If I have for example a document with a field named "name".
How can I search for example a name like '456' ?

Thank U for your help and advice !!!
