Joshua, et.al,

"You are correct sirs." But... ;)

I'm deploying the demo as I have very little time to come up to speed on the
API, JavaCC and other more powerful features of Lucene. (It's likely all the
reading I did over the weekend may make that moot, but I don't think I'm
going to be writing my own implementation this week... ) ;)

The demo actually does support entities, but I think something is askew (I'm
not sure if it's a bug).*

Specifically, see org.apache.lucene.demo.html.Entities. The class provides
straight forward encoding and decoding of the entities, including the entity
series in question (82xx). The Entities class appears to be directly used by
the HTMLParser.jj, in turn, used by IndexHTML. Since I don't know JavaCC,
I'm hoping that someone much more familiar with the demo and Lucene can
help. I have provided some idea of what is happening below.

Warmest Regards,
Tim


* The details...

My problem manifests itself in the the demo when returning results. I use
the 82xx series of decimal entities extensively throughout my site, in the
title, in the content and more. The returned results thus look like:

Document						Summary
Welcome to HarrisburgCity.com ? ...		To quote the Mayor, ? I have
seen...


Here the entity, "&#8212;", emdash, is used in the title, and the entity
"&#8220;", opening double quote, is used in the summary. Both appearing as
"?".
