SUBJECT: Using lucene to search a bunch of keywords?
DATE: 23 Jul 2008

Everything i've read and seen about luceen is search for keywords in
documents; I want to do the reverse. I have a huge list of
keywords("big boy","red ball","computer") and I have phrases that I
want to see if they keywords are in. For example using the small
keyword list above(store in documents in lucene) what's the best
approach to pass in a query "the girl likes red balls" and have it
match the keyword "red ball"?

Thanks.
