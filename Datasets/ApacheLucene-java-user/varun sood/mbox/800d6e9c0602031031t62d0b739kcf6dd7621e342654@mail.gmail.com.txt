Hi,
 I am impelementing Lucene to index my website. I would like to know if its
possible to generate a simple frequency matrix?

By frequency matrix I mean, docmuent name on top X-Axis and keywords on left
Y-Axis. and the cells of the matrix will contain the frequency of the
keyword in a particluar document.

I know its very much possible, but its just time which is limited to dig
more in Lucene.

Thanks in advance.
Varun
