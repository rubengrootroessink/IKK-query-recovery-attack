Hi,
 I am trying to delete a document without using the hits object.
What is the unique field in the index that I can use to delete the document?

I am trying to make a web interface where index can be modified, smaller
subset of what Luke does but using JSPs and Servlet.

to use deleteDocument(int docNum)
I need docNum how can I get this? or does it have to come only vis Hits?

Thanks,
Varun
