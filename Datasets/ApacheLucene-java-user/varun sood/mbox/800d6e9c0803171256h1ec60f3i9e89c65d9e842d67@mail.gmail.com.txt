SUBJECT: Re: IndexReader deleteDocument
DATE: 17 Mar 2008

Hi Erick,
 My idea/need is to create a simple web interface where I can manage my
index.
managing includes..
Adding new documents to index, editing the old ones, deleting, etc.. all
using a simple Web GUI so that person does not need to be a web developer to
manage the index. Besides there are other few things which I have to add to
my application, specific to my project. This all will be part of an Admin
Panel.

The discussions show that its currently not possible to get docNum by some
simple ways, infact I would have to use Hits to get my job done. Besides the
docID issue, i.e. if it changes the thing might not work as I expected..
Perhaps simple solution is just an old database style to have a unique ID
field (like a primary key) with some Auto-Incerement approach.. this way we
can query for that ID to get docID and will never go wrong. But
incorporating this new ID field.. I have to see how feasible it could be...


BTW.. where can I find the GWT version? I coudlnt' locate the reference on
Sandbox or via G!

Varun.
