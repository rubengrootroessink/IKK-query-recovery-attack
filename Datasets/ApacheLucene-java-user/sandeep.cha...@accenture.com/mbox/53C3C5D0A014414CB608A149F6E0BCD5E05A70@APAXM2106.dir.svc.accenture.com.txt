SUBJECT: How to use StandardAnalyzer
DATE: 16 Mar 2007

Hi,

 

I am new to Lucene Java API.

 

I want to use StandardAnalyzer for tokenizing my document.  How can I
use it?

Further how can I index "Acronym" and "Company name"  as one term. 

I know , we can do this using StandardAnalyzer but I am not sure of the
way.

 

Thanks in advance

 

Sandeep
