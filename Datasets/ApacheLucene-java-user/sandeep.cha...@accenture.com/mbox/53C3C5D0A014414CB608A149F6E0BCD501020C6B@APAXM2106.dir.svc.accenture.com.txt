Hi,

 

Lucene provides a PorterStemFilter which uses PorterStemmer.

 

Is there any way I can use a PorterStemFilter ( by extending it or
something) which uses porter2 stemming algorithm not the original porter
algorithm.

 

I know , this is possible using snowball filter but for some reason I
don't want to use it.

 

Thanks

Sandeep
