Hi Anshum,

Thanks so much for the quick response! I think that pretty much covers it. 
I was worried that having to delete the document and re-add it simply
because a date field has been updated would make my indexing quite slow.

Seems however that's not something I'll have to worry about.  Thanks so
much!
