SUBJECT: License adherence
DATE: 7 Dec 2001

I'm integrating Lucene as the searching engine of a commercial server 
product. I've been reading the license trying to figure out how, 
precisely, it affects us.

Our obligations under condition 3 is pretty clear. A sentence in our 
documentation. Not a problem.

I'm trying to understand what my obligations under condition 2 are. 
Would the use of Lucene as the search engine of a product be 
considered a binary redistribution? If so, what would be the 
preferred method of including the license? As a separate file? As an 
attachment to the Read Me? And if I have to distribute the license as 
required by condition 3, does that fulfill my condition 2 
responsibilities?
