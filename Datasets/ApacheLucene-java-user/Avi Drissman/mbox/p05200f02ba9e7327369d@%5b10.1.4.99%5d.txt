Hmm...

I think I need to rephrase my first question. Suppose I have a big 
index. I add a document. What seems to me to happen is that the files 
are read into memory, manipulated, and then written back out to disk 
as new files. What doesn't appear to be happening is modification of 
the files in-place. Is that true?

If so, I think that negatively impacts my ability to store the 
indexes in the database...
