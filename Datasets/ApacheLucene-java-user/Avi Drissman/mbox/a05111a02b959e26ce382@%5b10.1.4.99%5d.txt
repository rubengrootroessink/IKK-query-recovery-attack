AIAT was ported to Mac OS X, and is the SearchKit.framework. (See 
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks.) But it's private, and you'll get 
no help from Apple using it.

On the other hand, AIAT is obsolete, and you'll get no help from 
Apple using it. I was using it until I was having problems with 
flushes that used to take a fraction of a second taking over twenty 
minutes under OS X. Apple DTS told me to go away. I moved to Lucene, 
and I wouldn't recommend starting any new development with AIAT.
