Solved!

The moral of the story is:

When doing JNI, you _must_ use either JNI_FALSE or JNI_TRUE for 
jboolean values. Java isn't C. If you use _anything else_, things 
just won't work right at all.

(I wrote code like "jboolean jblah = blah" where blah was a C bool 
that was part of an uninitialized struct. Eeeek.)
