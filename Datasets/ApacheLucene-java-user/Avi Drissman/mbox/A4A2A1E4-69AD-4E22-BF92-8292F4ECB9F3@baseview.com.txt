SUBJECT: Is a field in use?
DATE: 23 Jun 2005

Suppose I have an index with a varying number of fields in a  
document. Some documents have some fields, and some documents have  
others. Is there a quick way to query the index to see if a  
particular field name is in use at all by any document in the index?

For example, if document 1 has fields (A, B, C), document 2 fields  
(B, C, D), document 3 fields (A, E, F), then document 2 is deleted, I  
need to be able to answer, "Does any document have field 'D'" with "no".

Thanks.

Avi
