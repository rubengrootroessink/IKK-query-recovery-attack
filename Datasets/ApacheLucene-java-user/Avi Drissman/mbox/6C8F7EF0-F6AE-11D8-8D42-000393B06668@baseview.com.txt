Yes, but that's a linear search :(

That's a very clever approach. I'm currently using Lucene 1.3, so I 
hadn't thought about using the new sorting abilities. I'd need to move 
to 1.4, of course.

A question, though: how efficient is it to make a query that matches 
all documents and then sort it? I'm looking for something as small as I 
can; after all, storing the last date in a file separate from the index 
is O(1)...

Thanks!
