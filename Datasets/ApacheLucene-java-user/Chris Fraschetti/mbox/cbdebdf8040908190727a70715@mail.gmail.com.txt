SUBJECT: maximum index size
DATE: 9 Sep 2004

I know the index size is very dependent on the content being index...

but running on a unix based machine w/o a filesize limit, best case
scenario... what is the largest number of documents that can be
indexed.

I've seen throughout the list mentions of millions of documents.. 8
million, 20 million, etc etc.. but can lucene potentially handle
billions of documents and still efficiently search through them?
