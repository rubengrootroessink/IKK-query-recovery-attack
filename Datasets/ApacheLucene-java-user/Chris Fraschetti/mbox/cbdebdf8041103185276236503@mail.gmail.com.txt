SUBJECT: sorting by score and an additional field
DATE: 4 Nov 2004

I mailed on this a while back, but am still at a loss.

Has anyone had any luck using lucene's built in sort functions to sort
first by the lucene hit score and secondarily by a Field in each
document indexed as Keyword and in integer form?

I can only get it to sort by one or the other... but when it does one,
it does sort correctly, but together in {score, custom_field} only the
first sort seems to apply.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance!
