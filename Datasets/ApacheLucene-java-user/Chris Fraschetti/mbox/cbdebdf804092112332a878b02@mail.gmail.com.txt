SUBJECT: displaying 'pages' of search results...
DATE: 21 Sep 2004

I was wondering was the best way was to go about returning say
1,000,000 results, divided up into say 50 element sections and then
accessing them via the first 50, second 50, etc etc.

Is there a way to keep the query around so that lucene doesn't need to
search again, or would the search be cached and no delay arise?

Just looking for some ideas and possibly some implementational issues...
