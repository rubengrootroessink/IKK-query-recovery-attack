SUBJECT: max number of documents
DATE: 10 Aug 2005

maybe this is a stupid question, maybe not...

hits.id returns an int.. which would lead me to assume the obvious
limitations of the size of the index (size meaning number of docs) ...
assuming I reach this limit, can I expect lucene to throw some sort of
exception?

What is the best practice for this? watch my count and switch to a new
index when the time comes, then search across both indexes?
