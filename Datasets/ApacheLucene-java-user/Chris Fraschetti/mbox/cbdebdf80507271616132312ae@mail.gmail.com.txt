SUBJECT: URL Stemmer
DATE: 27 Jul 2005

Writing simple code to trim down a URL is trivial, but to actually
trim it down to its most meaningful state is very hard. In same cases
the URL parameters actually define the page in others they are useless
babble. I'd like to use the hash of a page's URL as well as a hash of
the content data to help me eliminate duplicates... is there any good
methods that are commonly used for URL stemming?
