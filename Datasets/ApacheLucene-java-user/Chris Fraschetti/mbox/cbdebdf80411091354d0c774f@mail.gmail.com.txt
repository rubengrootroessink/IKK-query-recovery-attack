SUBJECT: can lucene be backed to have an update field
DATE: 9 Nov 2004

Is it possible to modify the lucene source to create an
updateDocument(doc#, FIELD, value)  function ? ....

I know there's a lot of work that goes on being the scene when an
.add(doc) is called, but can some of that functionality be adapter to
make the update a reality?
