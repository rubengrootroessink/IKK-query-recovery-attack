SUBJECT: Re: lucene docs in bulk read?
DATE: 1 Feb 2005

Definitely a good idea on the one line idea... that could possibly
save a good amount of time. I'm using .stringValue ... in reality, I
hadn't ever even considered readerValue ... is there a strong
performance difference between the two? or is it simply on the
functionality side?

The basic post processing is a grouping of results... because of the
time and space issues of my indexing process I am unable efficiently
go back and reindex a document if I have found a duplicate (my search
engine deals with multiple documents over time) .. so my post
processing groups results in the top 5000 hits which are the same,
except over different dates... But I need to grab the minimal data in
order to do this... the URL of the original page, the date of the doc,
etc... so that I can use only 1 doc, but if I find a duplicate, I can
simple add the new date to already existing doc. I am only reading a
few fields, but on a large scale of many documents, it hurts my timing
quite a bit.

It'll increase the size of your index, but should be faster to retrieve them all at one go.
