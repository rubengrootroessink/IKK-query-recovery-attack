SUBJECT: search caching
DATE: 3 Aug 2005

I've got an application that performs millions of searches against a
lucene index, can someone  give me a bit of insight as to the memory
consumption of these searches? Is there a cap on how many are kept
around? is there any way I can disable caching for this type of
search?
