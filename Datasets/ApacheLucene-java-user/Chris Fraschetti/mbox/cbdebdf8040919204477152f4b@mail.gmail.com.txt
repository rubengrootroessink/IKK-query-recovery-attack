SUBJECT: range and content query
DATE: 20 Sep 2004

can someone assist me in building or deny the possibility of combing a
range query and a standard query?

say for instance i have two fields i'm searching on... one being the a
field with an epoch date associated with the entry, and the
content....  so how can I make a query to select a range of thos
epochs, as well as search through the content? can it be done in one
query, or do I have to perform a query upon a query, and if so, what
might the syntax look like?
