SUBJECT: Re: sorting and score ordering
DATE: 13 Oct 2004

If i do the following...

SortField score_sort = ScoreField.FIELD_SCORE;
Sort sort = new Sort(score_sort);
hits = searcher.search(query, sort);

I get the results orderd by the lucene score.

also, if i do...

SortField rank_sort = new SortField(RANK_FIELD, true);
Sort sort = new Sort(rank_sort);
hits = searcher.search(query, sort);

I get the results sorted by my custom ranking which is an integer
(obviously in string format)...

and finally if i do....

SortField score_sort = ScoreField.FIELD_SCORE;
SortField rank_sort = new SortField(RANK_FIELD, true);
SortField[] sort_fields = {score_sort, rank_sort};
Sort sort = new Sort(sort_fields);
hits = searcher.search(query, sort);

I get the same results as I did with the score_sort only... no change
in the ordering of the rank is there... any ideas? It looks to me as
if it's completely ignoring it.
