Yes the version of lucene and java are exactly the same on the different
machines.
Infact we unjared lucene and jared it with our jar and are running from the
same nfs mounts on both the machines

Also we have tried with lucene2.2.0 and 2.3.1. with the same result .

also about the actual string u have it right till 2 .

        3,4,5 are a single character

Thx
