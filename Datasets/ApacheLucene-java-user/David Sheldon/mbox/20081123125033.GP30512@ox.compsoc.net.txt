I haven't tried this, but if you have lots of queries and few documents
then consider using lucene, but reconsidering how you design your
documents.

Turn the "queries" into documents in the index, and turn the "document"
into a query.

Something like google alerts you can have a document which is
   match: keyword

Then the "document" can become a boolean query for each word in it:
   match:foo OR match:bar

Obviously good choices of analysers and simplification of the queries
that you allow will make this better.

If you have fewer than 10k stored queries then the ways of running all
the queries against a document in memory will probably be faster
(depending on your incoming document rate, though you can batch them up
and do the queries every 15 mintues or something if you don't mind the
lag and you're getting lots of incomming documents).

Just an idea.
