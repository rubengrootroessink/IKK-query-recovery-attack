SUBJECT: Boosting documents
DATE: 26 Jul 2004

I want to do the same, set a boost for a field containing a date that
lowers as the date is further from now, is there any way I could do
this?

Also when I set a document boost at index time, with doc.setBoost(2);
then retrieve it via doc.getBoost() I always seem to get 1.0, even
though I can tell from a search that the boost works correctly. I
realise the docs say that the returned value may not be the same as the
indexed value, but should I always get 1? Essentially I'm trying to
allow an administrator to set the boost on the document through my
webapp.

Thanks
