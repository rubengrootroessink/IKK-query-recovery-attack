SUBJECT: Search Score percentage, Should not be relative to the highest score
DATE: 3 Jan 2011

Dear All,

                When using lucene to search documents, the results have a score based on their
relativity to the search term. Inside lucene, the score
percentage is calculated as a percentage of the maximum score achieved.

Assume we are searching for Amr ElAdawy

We get results like the following along with the score:
Omar ElAdawy --> 1.6
Amro ElAdawy --> 1.9
Amir Adawi --> 1.3


With no exact match. Then the percentage will be calculated relative to the highest score
( despite the fact that it is not exact match). So the percentage will be:

Omar ElAdawy --> 84.21%
Amro ElAdawy --> 100%
Amir Adawi --> 68.42%


I need to change that, so the percentage will be relative to the exact match score. And will
be something like that (assuming the Matching result score is 3):

Omar ElAdawy --> 53.33%
Amro ElAdawy --> 63.33%
Amir Adawi --> 43.33%


Regards,
Amr ElAdawy
