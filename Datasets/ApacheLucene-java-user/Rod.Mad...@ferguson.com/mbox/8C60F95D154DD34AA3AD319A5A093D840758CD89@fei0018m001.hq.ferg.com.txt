SUBJECT: Searching on Multiple fields
DATE: 16 Jul 2006

Currently, my Lucene search code allows the user to specify
which fields are searched ...I have now had a request to enhance
the code to allow the users to specify that certain 
searchfields contain one value and other ( or all other ) fields
contain a different value.
 
In Luke I can do following to run this type of search:
 +secondarySection:"Vendor Information" +title:types
 

The relevant section of my code as it currently stands is
as follows: ...
.
.
.
// Is a Lucene FSDir object available
if (fsDir != null) {
    is = new IndexSearcher(fsDir);
    // searchFields are those Lucene fields which I need to search for
the search term
    qp = new MultiFieldQueryParser(searchFields,new StopAnalyzer());
  
    if (qp != null) {
        // stringToFind is search term I am searching for across all
fields
       query = qp.parse(stringToFind.toUpperCase());
    } // if ( fsDir != null )
}
 
Can anyone suggest how I need to proceed to mod this code to allow for 
the new feature requested ...
 
Thanks
