Thanks for reply Jeroen ...does anyone have any
experience / comments regarding the use of PDFTextStream
versus PDFExtractor for working with PDF files ...the
issue for us is that there appears to be very high
memory usage when we work with PDF's using PDFExtractor.

I have heard that PDFTextStream may be a better solution.

Hi Rod,

PDFBox is a seperate project. The PDFExtractor in Jakarta Slide uses
PDFBox's 
functionality to extract the information from the .pdf file.

Hope this answers your question.
