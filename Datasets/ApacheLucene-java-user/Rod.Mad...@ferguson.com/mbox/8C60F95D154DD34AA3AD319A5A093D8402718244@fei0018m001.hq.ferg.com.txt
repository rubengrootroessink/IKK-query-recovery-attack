Hi,

 

I am new to Lucene and looking at some existing Lucene code....

 

I am confused about the relationship ( if any ) between 

org.apache.slide.extractor.PDFExtractor methods and org.PDFBox.cos
methods

for the purposes of working with PDF files.

 

I have found info on the web regarding PDFBox, however, I have found
little

regarding .PDFExtractor.

 

I am curious since we are having some issues with indexing PDF files and

I am wondering if PDFExtractor implements PDFBox or if it is a separate 

utility set.

 

Rod.
