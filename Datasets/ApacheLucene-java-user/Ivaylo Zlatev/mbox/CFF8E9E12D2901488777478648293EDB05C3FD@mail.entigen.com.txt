SUBJECT: increasing the mergeFactor causes FileNotFoundException (too many open files)
DATE: 12 Feb 2002


Increasing the MergeFactor on an IndexWriter can speed the indexing
process tremendously.
However, you can quickly run out of file descriptors and the indexing
application will thorw
java.io.FileNotFoundException:.....(Too many open files)

I know prefectly how to increase the number of available file
descriptors on Unix (ulimit -n 1000).

But how to do this for the Windows 2000 Command-line process, where I
execute my java
indexing application?

I spent an hour digging the internet for such informaton, but can't find
it.
I guess the answer is important to many other lucene users as well.
