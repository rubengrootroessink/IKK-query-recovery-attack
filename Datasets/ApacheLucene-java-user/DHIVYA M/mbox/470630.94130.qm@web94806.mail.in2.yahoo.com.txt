SUBJECT: How to do relevancy ranking in lucene
DATE: 3 Dec 2009

Hi all,
Am using lucene 2.3.2.
When i search using lucene demo am getting all the results which contains the query. But i
would like to restrict my results to the relevant match and not all the documents containing
the query string.
 
Ex:
Query: how to search a string?
 
Response am getting is: all documents containing words - search, string
 
Desired response: I would like to compare the documents that contains both the words and
the documents that contains anyone word of the query string - to find the relevant documents.
 
Kindly suggest me as how i should proceed and the details regarding this context.
Urgent help needed.
 
Thanks in advance for the timely help.
