SUBJECT: How to include some more fields to be indexed in the file document class?
DATE: 4 Dec 2009

Hi all,
 
Am using lucene 2.3.2.
I would like to include some more fields of the to be indexed other than the available one.
 
In the FileDocument class of the demo version of lucene 2.3.2 there are only three fields
added to the documents to be indexed.
 
Ex: doc.add(new Field("path"..........
      doc.add(new Field("modified".........
      doc.add(new Field("contents"..........
 
 
If i want to add some more fields,
like
 
      doc.add(new Field("xyz"........
 
what should i do?
Should i modify the class file and include it again in my web lucene? Or any other simpler
way is possible?
Kindly let me know.
 
Thanks in advance,
Dhivya
