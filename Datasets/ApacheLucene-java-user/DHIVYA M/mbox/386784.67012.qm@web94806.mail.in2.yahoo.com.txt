SUBJECT: Kindly spot out the reason for this undesired output.
DATE: 9 Dec 2009

Hi all,
 
I have attached the code file and also the output screenshot. The problem is:
 
When i search for a query, it gives out the resultant documents containing the query but,
 
if two documents a and b contains that query,
Result is:
 
Link for a:
contents of a
contents of b
 
Link for b:
contents of a
contents of b
 
kindly go through the attached documents for the code, obtained output and the correct output
screenshots. 
Can anyone pls solve this problem.
I want the contents of the corresponding file alone to be displayed and the repetition should
be avoided.
 
Also how to rank my results / how to implement relevancy ranking.
Am a beginner and have no idea so kindly help me on this context.
 
Thanks,
Dhivya
