Thanx for the suggestion sir.
But i wrote the Document of FileDocument class here in my indexing program so that it vl look
this method rather than refering the one from the jar file.
 
Updating the jar by creating a class again seemed to be time consuming for me so did this
way.
 
Thanks,
Dhivya

Hi Dhivya,
So are you using the same demo code for your app? Incase you are you have to
modify that code and continue.
All said and done, you'd have to add fields in your java file and
recompile(in case you are already using some code for that purpose). In case
you would be starting to write an indexer from scratch, you'd have to write
a java file on the same  lines as the demo (modified) and include it.
Does that help?
