DATE: 30 Oct 2009

Thanks a lot sir. Its working out well.
 
But i have one more doubt.
Is it possible to check whether the same documents are indexed again and again?
bcos due to appending of indexes,
when i search a query,
the result is displayed as much number of times as the index is created for that document.

how to solve this sir
 
Is it possible to remove duplicates with a flag in indexwriter?
 
Kindly let me know about this.
 
Thanks in advance
M.Dhivya
