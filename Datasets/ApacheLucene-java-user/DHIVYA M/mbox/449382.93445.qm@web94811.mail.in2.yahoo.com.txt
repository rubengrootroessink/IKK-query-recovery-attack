SUBJECT: Can anyone help me to implement highlighter in lucene 2.3.2
DATE: 30 Oct 2009

Hi all,
 
Am using lucene 2.3.2
I would like to have the search result similar to that of the google response.
On my study i found that highlighter could do this. I found the highlighter class available
in the contrib folder of lucene 2.3.2 .zip.
 
But am blind about using it to get the desired response as that of google.
 
Kindly help me in this regard
 
Thanks in advance,
M.Dhivya

The only way to do it is to index a field (self maintained primary key) with
each document and do a deleteDocument (or updateDocument) for each document
before adding it.
Something like
*writer.deleteDocument(new Term("term-key","unique-id"));*
*writer.addDocument(d);*
This should help.
