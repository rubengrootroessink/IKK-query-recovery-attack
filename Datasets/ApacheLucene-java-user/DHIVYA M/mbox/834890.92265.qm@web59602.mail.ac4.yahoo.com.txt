: As said i haveÂ set the classpath in environment variable PATH in System properties as,
: D:\lucene-1.9-final\lucene-core-1.9-final.jar; D:\lucene-1.9-final\lucene-demos-1.9-final.jar;

"PATH" is not "the classpath in environment" for any JVM that i know of, 
reading this document may be helpful...
