SUBJECT: Link in the result page is not opening
DATE: 6 Nov 2009

Hi all,
 
Am using Java Lucene through web.
 
When i execute through Netbeans, its working well. My problem is:
 
It is displaying the list of links that points to documents containing the query string. But
when i click the link the document[notepad document] is not opening. But if i right click
on the link and give "save target as" option, it is getting downloaded. 
 
I would like to know why the link doesnt open my resultant document?
 
Kindly suggest me the reason and a solution.
 
Thanks in advance,
 
M.Dhivya
