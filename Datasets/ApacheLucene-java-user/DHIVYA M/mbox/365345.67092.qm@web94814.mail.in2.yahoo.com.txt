SUBJECT: Re: What is multiple indexing and how does it work in Lucene [Java]
DATE: 30 Oct 2009

The question is indeed wrong. Sry for the inconvenience. Actually i should have asked this
way!
 
Am trying out executing the demo of lucene 1.4.3.
When i run a file for the first time, the index is properly getting created.
When i run the indexing for the second time with a different file, the file "_1" , a CFS
file in the index folder is getting overwritten, i.e. i couldnt find the index created for
the previous file i used.
 
So kindly let me know about the cause of this problem and a solution too.
 
I would also be happy if anyone let me know from which version the index will be appended.
 
Thanks in advance.
