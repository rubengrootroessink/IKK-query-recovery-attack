SUBJECT: How to find the fields that are indexed?
DATE: 23 Nov 2009

Sir,
 
Am using lucene 2.3.2. I would like to know what are the fields that are been indexed?
 
Ex:
 
doc.get("path");
 
this statement returns the path of the document 
 
like "path" what are the other fields of the document used by lucene
 
I went through converting all the class files to java files and read all the files. But i
got confused with the things available in cluster. 
 
So, Can anyone tell me how to find it out?
 
 
Thanks in advance,
Dhivya
