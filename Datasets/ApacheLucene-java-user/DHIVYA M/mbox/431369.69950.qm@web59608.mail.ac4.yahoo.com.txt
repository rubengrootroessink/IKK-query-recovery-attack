SUBJECT: how to extract text from the result document in lucene search
DATE: 28 Oct 2009

Hi
 
Am a beginner in using lucene. I succeeded in running the demo files of lucene and found the
concept. 
 
When we execute the SearchFiles.java file in the demo folder, am getting the names of the
documents containing the given query string. Is it possible to display some portions of the
text containing that query string from the corresponding documents????? [as a google response].
 
can anyone help me in this context
 
Thanks in advance.
Dhivya
