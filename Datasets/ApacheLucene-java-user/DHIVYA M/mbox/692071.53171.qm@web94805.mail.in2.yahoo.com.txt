SUBJECT: to exit the while loop if match is found
DATE: 26 Nov 2009

Sir,
 
This is my code sir.
I have given break statement.
 
 String s1= request.getParameter("indtext");
                IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open("newindex");
                String field="contents";
                //field = field.intern();
                TermEnum tenum = reader.terms(new Term(field, s1));
                try
                {
                    do
                    {
                        final Term term = tenum.term();
                        if (term==null || term.field()!=field) break;
                        final String termText = term.text();
                        // do something with the termText
                        s1 = termText;
                        out.println(s1);
                    } while (tenum.next());
                }
                finally
                {
                    tenum.close();
                }

Just add a check in the while statement to exit as soon as the pattern of
the term changes.
You could check if the term does not start with your input and exit from the
while loop there.
It would exit wherever the term start changes from what you want.
