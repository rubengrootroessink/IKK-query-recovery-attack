SUBJECT: limit lucene result
DATE: 7 Sep 2005

The reason that I want to limit returned result is that I do not want
to get out of memory problem. I index lucene with 3 million documents.
Sometimes, searching will return millions of fields back to me. I just
want to get the first 100, for example , to show them to user. Even, I
use search(query,filter,topDocs), I believe it still return all results
back. So how could I limit the lucene returning?
