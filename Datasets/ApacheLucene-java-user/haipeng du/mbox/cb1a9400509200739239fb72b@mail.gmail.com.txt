I use lucene to index a key word with date object. When I search document, 
how could I process the searching result for that field? For example:
index date with 
Field field = Field.Keyword("created", new Date);
.....
......
When I search that, I get that field back
Field f = doc.getField("created").
but value of that field is just like 
0edtel52h
How could I process that to get Date object back?
Thanks a lot.
