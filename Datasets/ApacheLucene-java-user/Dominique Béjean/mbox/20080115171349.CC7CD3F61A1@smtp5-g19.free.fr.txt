SUBJECT: Use Lucene in order to generate tag cloud
DATE: 15 Jan 2008

Hi,

 

Does anybody know an implementation of Lucene in order to generate tag
clouds.

 

The idea is to index some documents in a temporary index in order to find
most frequent 1-term, 2-terms and 3-terms sequences.

 

Stop word list will eliminate common words.

Ideally, terms like driver, drivers will generate only on term in the
cloud. 

Snowball Analyzer may help, but how get back the best original term for a
stem ?

 

Thank for your idea

 

Dominique
