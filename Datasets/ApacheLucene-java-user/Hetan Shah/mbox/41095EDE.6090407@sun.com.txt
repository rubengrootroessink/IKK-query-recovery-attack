SUBJECT: Re: Phrase Query
DATE: 29 Jul 2004

What I am trying to do is to create the query based on the field in 
which user enters the keywords.

I have the following fields.

All the Words:
The Exact Phrase:
Any of the Words:

For All the words and Any of the words I am able to use Query. For The 
Exact Phrase I want to use the PhraseQuery. That is what I was showing 
in the code snippet. My mistake in not commenting out the line where I 
was per-pending and appending the quotation marks, which is taken care 
by  the PhraseQuery. So how would one go about creating the different 
queries and then do the actual search.

Thanks.
