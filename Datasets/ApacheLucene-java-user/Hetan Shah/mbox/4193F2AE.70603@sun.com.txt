Hi guys,

Thanks for the fantastic mailing list. Where all the questions get 
answered.
Guys I have upgraded my installation from 1.3.final to 1.4.2 and now 
when I try to index the files using IndexHTML the commnad just hangs on 
the prompt or would parse some 4 - 5 files and would simply hang. Any 
idea what could be the issue?

TIA,
-H
