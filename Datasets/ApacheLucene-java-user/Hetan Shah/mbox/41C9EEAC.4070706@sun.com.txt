All,

This might be asked earlier please point to the earlier post or any 
pointers would be appreciated.
I have bunch of HTML pages which I index using IndexHTML. My dilemma is 
when I want to search the pages and then display the results the text 
that I use for the results snippet do not get the data from the body of 
the page it just gets the top portion of the page. How do I control what 
I want to show in the result text.

IndexSearcher searcher = null;
query = QueryParser.parse(queryString, "contents", analyzer);
hits = searcher.search(query);                       

I am currently using
TokenStream tokenStream = new StandardAnalyzer().tokenStream("f", new 
StringReader(doc.get("summary")));
String result = highlighter.getBestFragments(tokenStream, 
doc.get("summary"), 3, "...");


e.g.
Search Results
*Product Name: *Computer systems PAMIR??
