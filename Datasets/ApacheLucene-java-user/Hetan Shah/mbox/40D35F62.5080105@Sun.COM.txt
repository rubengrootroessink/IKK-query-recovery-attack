SUBJECT: Lucene search integration with Portal Servers
DATE: 18 Jun 2004

Hi All,

Has anyone tried or have any sample of working integration solution for
LUCENE with any J2EE portal servers? Also I am curious to know what are
the best or mostly used practices to link the search results with the
documents/files on the system.

Thanks all,

-H
