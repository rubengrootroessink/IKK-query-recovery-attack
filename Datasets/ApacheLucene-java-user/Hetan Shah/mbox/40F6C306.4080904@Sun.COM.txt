SUBJECT: Re: Searching against Database
DATE: 15 Jul 2004

It seems to me that the solutions offered are based on the documents 
already existing in the database. My scenario is a little more complex 
then that. In my application the documents get generated dynamically and 
I search for various fields across various tables.

How do I start this task? Has anyone done anything like this before?

thanks.
