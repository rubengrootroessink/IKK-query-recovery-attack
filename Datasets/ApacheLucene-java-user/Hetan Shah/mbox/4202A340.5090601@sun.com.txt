SUBJECT: Numbers in the Query String
DATE: 3 Feb 2005

Hello,

How can one search for a document based on the query which has numbers 
in the query srting.

e.g. query = Java 2 Platform J2EE

What do I need to do so that the numbers do not get neglected.

I am using StandardAnalyzer to index the pages and using StopAnalyzer to 
search the documents. Would the use of two different analyzers cause any 
trouble for the results?

Thanks.
-H
