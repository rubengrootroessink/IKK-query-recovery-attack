SUBJECT: Indexing with Lucene 1.4.3
DATE: 16 Dec 2004

Hello,

I have been trying to index around 6000 documents using IndexHTML from 
1.4.3 and at the end of indexing in my index directory I only have 3 files.
segments
deletable and
_5en.cfs

Can someone tell me what is going on and where are the actual index 
files? How can I resolve this issue?
Thanks.
-H
