Hello all,

Is there a way to reduce the indexing time taken when the indexer is 
indexing about 30,000 + files. It is roughly taking around 6-7 hours to 
do this. I am using IndexHTML class to create the index out of HTML files.

Another issue that I see is every once in a while I get the following 
output on the screen.

adding ../31/1104852.html
Parse Aborted: Encountered "\"" at line 7, column 1.
Was expecting one of:
     <ArgName> ...
     "=" ...
     <TagEnd> ...

Any suggestions on preventing this from happening?

Thanks in advance.
-H
