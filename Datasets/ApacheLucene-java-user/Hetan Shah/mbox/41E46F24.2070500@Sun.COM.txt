SUBJECT: Re: Indexing flat files with out .txt extension
DATE: 12 Jan 2005

Hi Erik,

Thanks for the pointers, I have modified the Indexer.java to index the
files from the directory by removing the file extenstion check of
(".txt"). Now I do get the index from the files.

New situation is that when I run the FileSearch

java org.apache.lucene.demo.SearchFiles
Query: tty
Searching for: tty
3 total matching documents
0. No path nor URL for this document
1. No path nor URL for this document
2. No path nor URL for this document

I do not get the actual path from the index and using Luke I get the
three hits. Last two are from the index and not the real documents.

Any idea what is happeneing and how can I fix it.

Thanks.
