Hello,

You guys have been great! I read lots of threads and am learning a lot 
about Lucene.

Can any one point me to right direction or show me a code sample where I 
can build queries for  'any word' 'all words' and 'phrase. I tried to 
look on the Lucene FAQ but I did not understand how to go about it. Any 
code sample would be really helpful. I am guessing that I would have to 
use PhraseQuery and BooleanQuery and QueryParser classes. Not sure about 
the syntax.

Thanks.
-H
