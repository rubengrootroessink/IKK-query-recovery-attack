Hi Fred,

Thanks for replying. I see what you mean by creating tags for name and 
description. I am not sure about how to hack the methods and where. If 
you can point me in right direction that would really be appreciated. I 
am thinking about editing the shipped HTMLDocument.java and 
HTMLParser.java files but not sure what I need to add. Can you please 
explain a little more.

TIA.
