SUBJECT: QurtyParser question
DATE: 29 Jun 2004

I am trying to tie the highlighter sample code with demo3 of the 
distribution.

There is one place where I think I am stuck. The code in demo3 has
query = QueryParser.parse(String query, String field, String analyzer); 
and the highlighter sample code uses a subclass of query which is 
PhraseQuery and then adds new terms
PhraseQuery query = new PhraseQuery();
query.add(new Term("f", "text"));

Is there a way to work this around, so that I do not have to create two 
different query objects?

Please help.

Thanks you guys, you have been best.
