My search results are only displaying the top portion of the indexed 
documents. It does match the query in the later part of the document. 
Where should I look to change the code in demo3 of default 1.3 final 
distribution. In general if I want to show the block of document that 
matches with the query string which classes should I use?

Thanks guys.
