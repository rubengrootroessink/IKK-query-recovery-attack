SUBJECT: Indexing flat files with out .txt extension
DATE: 5 Jan 2005

Hello,

How can one index simple text files with out the .txt extension. I am 
trying to use the IndexFiles and IndexHTML but not to my satisfaction. 
In the IndexFiles I do not get any control over the content of the file 
and in case of IndexHTML the files with out any extension do not get 
index all together. Any pointers are really appreciated.

Thanks.
-H
