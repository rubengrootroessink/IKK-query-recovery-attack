DATE: 6 Jan 2005

Hi Erik,

I got the source downloaded and unpacked. I am having difficulty in 
building and of the modules. Maybe something's wrong with my Ant 
installation.
************************
LuceneInAction% ant test
Buildfile: build.xml

BUILD FAILED
file:/home/hs152827/LuceneInAction/build.xml:12: Unexpected element 
"available"

Total time: 5 seconds

LuceneInAction% ant Indexer
Buildfile: build.xml

BUILD FAILED
file:/home/hs152827/LuceneInAction/build.xml:12: Unexpected element 
"available"

Total time: 5 seconds
**********************
Can you point me to proper module for creating my own indexer? I tried 
looking into the indexing module but was not sure.

TIA,
-H
