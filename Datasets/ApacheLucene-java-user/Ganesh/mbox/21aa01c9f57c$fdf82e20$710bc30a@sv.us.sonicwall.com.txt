What about setTermInfosIndexDivisor?? 

Directory dir = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexPath);
IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(dir, true);
reader.setTermInfosIndexDivisor(5);

It supposed to load only one fifth of the terms available?? But there is no difference in
memory consumption with / without settings this parameter.

I reopen the IndexReader whenever there is any document added to Index.  Do i need to set
setTermInfosIndexDivisor(5); during re-opening of the index also. I tried this, first time
it accepted and second time onwards it throws "terms already loaded" expection

Regards
Ganesh

setTermIndexInterval only helps appreciably when an index has a truly
immense number of terms (often, "by accident" eg your document
filtering/analysis process accidentally allowed binary terms into the
index); it's meant primarily as a "safety" for such situations.

If you run CheckIndex, it prints the number of unique terms per segment.

The other big things that use RAM while searching are 1) deleted docs
(do you have any deletions?), 2) norms (have you disabled norms for
fields that don't actually require it), and 3) FieldCache (used when
you sort by field instead of relevance).

I build the index using default value. After hitting OOME i am setting this.
