Thanks. This works well.

The logic is 
1. Do the search, For every document get the list of terms and its frequency. 
2. Use SortedTermVectorMapper to generate a list of unique terms and its frequency. 
2. Sort them to get the list of top numbered frequently indexed terms in a given date range
(any given criteria).

My Question is:
I need to get the top 20 highly indexed term in a day. 1 million documents could be indexed
in a day. I need to traverse the 1 million records and store the unique terms and its frequencies.
It may consume huge amount of memory. Is there any other way out? With out using term vector,
i could get the list of most frequently indexed term in a database. Similarly is there any
other way to get the list of most frequently indexed term in a date range or a subset of database.

Regards
Ganesh
