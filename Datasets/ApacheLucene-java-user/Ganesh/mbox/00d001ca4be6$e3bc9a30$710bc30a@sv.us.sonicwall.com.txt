Hello all,

In case of 2.4.1, the reader after reopen, will be warmed before actual use. In 2.9, public
void setMergedSegmentWarmer(IndexWriter.IndexReaderWarmer warmer), does warming when we do
getReader(). 

If we do getReader() for every request then whether it will reduce the search performance?


Does warming necessarly required in 2.9? If we do warming for the very first time is not enough?
Do we need to do it on every request?

Regards
Ganesh

Good point on isCurrent - I think it should only be with respect to
the latest index commit point? and we should clarify that in the
javadoc.

I think we keep it simple - the nrtReader.isCurrent() would return
false after a commit is called.
Yes, isCurrent() is no longer such a great name.
