SUBJECT: Re: Delete by docId in IndexWriter
DATE: 29 Jun 2009

This issue has been raised earlier. IndexWriter is not providing any functionality to delete
by doc id. IndexReader does, but it requires write permission. In my case, IndexReader and
IndexWriter will be opened always. IR will be reopened frequently. To delete, i have no other
option to write a query using IW and delete, evethough i know docid. 

This feature is a required one.

Regards
Ganesh
