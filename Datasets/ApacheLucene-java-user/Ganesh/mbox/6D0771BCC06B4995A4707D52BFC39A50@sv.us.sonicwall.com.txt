SUBJECT: Re: If you could have one feature in Lucene...

1. Payload per document which could be updated without a need to update the entire document.

Usecase: The state of our indexed content will change based on the User action (Created/ Viewed/Deleted
etc) and we are using Lucene as our database and we cannot use relational database only for
this feature. 

2. Offload fieldcache to disk
   As every one knows sorting consumes huge memory, there is a need to offload it to disk
using external caching mechanism. There is lot of discussion on sorting memory consumption
in the group and this would be in everone's wishlist.

3. Custom fieldcache
Currently fieldcache is created  with number of documents available in the index. In our case
we are using single index having multiple tables, and it is differentiated by the "Type" field.
Only one type is required to sort and others is just stored data and not participating in
the sort. This will certanily reduce the memory consumption. We cannot create one index for
each table, which will be difficult to maintain.

Ganesh
