Thanks.

IndexDivisor means, When set to N, then one in every N*termIndexInterval terms in the index
is loaded into memory.

For example i am having 100,000 unique terms and termIndexInterval set to 5 then (100000 /
(5*128) ) terms (==X terms)will be loaded in to memory. 
If termIndexInterval is set to 500 then (100000 / (5*100*128) ) ==> (X/100) terms should
be loaded and the memory consmuped should be 100 times less than that of the first one. But
is not the case. The memory difference is very less. 

Could any one explain me the calculation of memory savings with respect to IndexDivisor. 

Regards
Ganesh

Try to open with very large value (MAX_INT) it will load only first
term, and look up the rest from disk.
