We are using similar technique as yours. We keep smaller indexes and use ParallelMultiSearcher
to search across the index. Keeping smaller indexes is good as index and index optimzation
would be faster.  There will be small delay while searching across the indexes.

1. What is your search time?
2. Is your index optimized?

I have a doubt, If we keep the indexes size to 30 GB then each file size (fdt, fdx etc) would
in GB's. Small addition or deletion to the file will not cause more IO as it has to skip those
bytes and write it at the end of file.

Ganesh
