SUBJECT: Indexed Field impact on Memory
DATE: 4 Aug 2009

Hello all,

I am having a indexed field, If i am not using this field for any search query. Whether this
field consume memory? 

If this field is part of filter query, then there would be any impact in memory consumption?


I am going to break / shorten the Date Time field and one field might be used for sorting
and other might be used for filter query and stored. 

Regards
Ganesh
