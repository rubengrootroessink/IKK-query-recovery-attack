Thanks shai and mark for your suggestions.

I initially tried DuplicateFilter and it is not giving me expected results. It removes the
duplicates at query time and not in the results.

Regards
Ganesh

I have a field called category and all documents will have belong to some category( say some
belong to X and some Y etc). The field values may change dynamically. I want the search results
to be filterted to retrieve one document per category. 

This is similar to 'group by' feature in database.

Regards
Ganesh
