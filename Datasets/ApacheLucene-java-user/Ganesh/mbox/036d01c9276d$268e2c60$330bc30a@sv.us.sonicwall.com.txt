Hello Anshum,

My index is growing 1 million documents per day. Initially i planned to have 
a single database but the sorting of one or more fields consumes more RAM. 
Whether sharding the index would also consume the same.

My application should co-exist with other application of my product and my 
app could get 1 GB of RAM. Search speed is fine but i need to display the 
result in the sorted order.

I thought to keep 7 days of documents in one index and create one more after 
the 7 days. After 30 days the first index may get deleted. I need to keep 
the documents in the index DB for 30 days. My Index DB is in HDD.

I want to the pros and cons of sharding. I think maintance of the DB becomes 
easier.

It would be very much helpful, if you share some of your thoughts.

Regards
Ganesh
