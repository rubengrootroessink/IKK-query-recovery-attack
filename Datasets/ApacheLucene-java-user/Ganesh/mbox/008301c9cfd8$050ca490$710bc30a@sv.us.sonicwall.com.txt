Hello all,

I am using Lucene 2.4.1 and Snowball Analyzer for my indexing.
I am facing some issues with stemming.

Raining stemmed to Rain
cats stemmed to cat
but
Harder is not stemmed to hard
Stronger is not stemmed to Strong.

Even Keyword and Standard analyzer does the same. My opinion is Stemming 
process is to get the base word. Here it is not doing so.

Any idea?

Regards
Ganesh
