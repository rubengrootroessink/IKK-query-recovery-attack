SUBJECT: Scale up design
DATE: 13 Dec 2010

Hello all,

I know little bit about scale out design, Sharding the database across systems. Is any one
in this group tried Scale up architecture? I think to scale up, we need to use 64 bit. How
about the Lucene performance in 64 bit? Whether we could use 8 GB RAM completely?

Could any share their thoughts on this.

Regards
Ganesh
