Hi Anusham

I could understand that the Analyzer stems the word to base word and stores in DB. Users may
not know this internals and they tend to give "attenti*". 

My question is queryparser should stem the word and then apply /expand the wild card query.
Is this a bug with queryparser? OR Analyzer will not stem the word if it finds a wild card
operator in it?

Regards
Ganesh
