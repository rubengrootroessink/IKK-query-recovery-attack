DATE: 3 Dec 2009

I don't have deletions. No norms. No sorting. 
I am setting 70 MB for IndexWriter RamBuffer but not indexing any documents. Swtiched off
indexing.
I have enabled TermVector for one field. 
I am opening all 30 database with different value of indexdivisor.

Below are my stats
IndexDivisor    Memory
    -1                7 MB
    1                  486 MB
    100              180 MB
    1000            176 MB.

1. Whether term vector will consume RAM. I think it should only consume disk space.

2. By setting RAM buffer for IW, Does it will allocate memory Or based on the usage the memory
will be allocated / increased. 

Regards
Ganesh

How do you measure memory consumption?

If you pass -1 for the divisor do you still see no difference?

Can you post the output of CheckIndex on your index?

Are you sure your index has no deletions?

I think fieldcache is used for sorting.
