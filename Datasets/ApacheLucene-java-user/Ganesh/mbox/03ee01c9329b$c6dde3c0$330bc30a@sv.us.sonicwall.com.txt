SUBJECT: Merge index will maintain index order
DATE: 20 Oct 2008

Hello all,

I am planning to merge two or more indexes. Once merged, will the DB 
maintain the same index order as before merge?
I am doing sorting on Index Order as sorting on date-time takes more amount 
of RAM. If i merge the index DB, will the same index order be maintained or 
the indexes will be overlapped?

Regards
Ganesh
