We also use similar kind of technique, breaking indexes in to smaller and search using ParallelMultiSearcher.
We have to do incremental indexing and the records older than 6 months or 1 year (based on
ageout setting) should be deleted. Having multiple small indexes is really fast in terms of
indexing.  

Since you guys mentioned about keeping single large index. Search time woule be faster but
the indexing and index optimization will take more time. How you are handling it in case of
incremental indexing. If we keep the indexes size to 100+ GB then each file size (fdt, fdx
etc) would in GB's. Small addition or deletion to the file will not cause more IO as it has
to skip those bytes and write it at the end of file.

What are the characteristics of your slow queries?  Can you give examples?   Are the slow
queries always slow or only under heavy load?   What the bottleneck is and whether splitting
into smaller indexes would help depends on just what your bottleneck is. It's not clear that
your index is large enough that the size of the index is causing your bottleneck.

We run indexes of about 350GB with average response times under 200ms and 99th percentile
reponse times of under 2 seconds. (We have a very low qps rate however).
