SUBJECT: Questions about analyzer
DATE: 6 Mar 2009

Hello all

1)
Which is best to use Snowball analyzer or Lucene contrib analyzer? There is 
no inbuilt stop word list for Snowball analyzer?

2)
Whether Analyzer and QueryParser are thread-free. They could created once 
and use it in as many threads?

3)
I am using Snowball Analyzer to do index and search., When i search for 
windows AND vista, QueryParser is adding AND as part of search, But i am 
expecting something like +windows +vista.

Regards
Ganesh
