SUBJECT: too many file descriptors opened by Lucene shows (deleted) in /proc
DATE: 4 Sep 2009

Hello all,

In my linux pc, there are too many fd counts for lucene database. /proc/<processid>/fd
shows very big list. I have provided sample below.

lr-x------    1 root     root           64 Sep  3 17:02 360 -> /opt/ganesh/lucenedb/_2w5.tvf
(deleted)
lr-x------    1 root     root           64 Sep  3 17:02 361 -> /opt/ganesh/lucenedb/_hr.frq
(deleted)
lr-x------    1 root     root           64 Sep  3 17:02 362 -> /opt/ganesh/lucenedb/_hr.prx
(deleted)
lr-x------    1 root     root           64 Sep  3 17:02 363 -> /opt/ganesh/lucenedb/_hr.tvx
(deleted)
lr-x------    1 root     root           64 Sep  3 21:01 364 -> /opt/ganesh/lucenedb/_hr.tvd
(deleted)
lr-x------    1 root     root           64 Sep  3 17:02 365 -> /opt/ganesh/lucenedb/_hr.tvf
(deleted)
lr-x------    1 root     root           64 Sep  3 17:02 366 -> /opt/ganesh/lucenedb/_2w4.fdt
(deleted)
lr-x------    1 root     root           64 Sep  3 17:02 367 -> /opt/ganesh/lucenedb/_2w4.fdx
(deleted)

These files not exist in the disk but why it is showing as (deleted) in the /proc. This means
the process is still holding the fd. Please provide me more information on this. I am using
Fedora Linux, ext-3 file system, Lucene 2.4.1.
