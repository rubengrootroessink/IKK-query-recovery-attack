SUBJECT: How to avoid Index corruption
DATE: 20 Oct 2008

Hello all,

I am using Lucene 2.3.2 in Windows and Linux. I have to do incremental 
indexing.

I am worried about the corruption of index in case of power failure or 
forceful restart the server or application crash. How to avoid the 
situitation of corruption.
Any tips would be grately appricated. I think most of folks might have done 
this before.

Does Lucene 2.4 handles this better?

Regards
Ganesh
