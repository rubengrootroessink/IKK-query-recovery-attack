SUBJECT: Maintain last indexed information in a file or DB
DATE: 28 Nov 2008

I am using Lucene v2.4. I am indexing files from various folder and i have 
to maintain a bookmark of what i have last indexed in each folder.

Initially i thought to save the state in each  respective folder. Index 
Wrtier always has documents in memory and it commits in a intervals. In an 
unexpected application crash, sometimes the last saved bookmark and the last 
indexed document in the database is not matching.

One another option is to keep the information in a same or different 
database.

I think many might have faced this situitation.

Regards
Ganesh
