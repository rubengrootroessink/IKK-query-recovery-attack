SUBJECT: Scale out design patterns
DATE: 21 Jan 2011

Hello all,

Could you any one guide me what all the various ways we could scale out?

1. Index:  Add data to the nodes in round-robin. 
   Search: Query all the nodes and cluster the results using carrot2. 

2.Horizontal partitioning and No shared architecture, 
   Index:   Split the data based on userid and index few set of users data in each node. 
  
   Search: Have a mapper kind of application which could tell which userid is mapped to node,
redirect the search traffic to corresponding node.

Which one is best? Did you guys tried any of these approach. Please share your thoughts.

Regards
Ganesh
