SUBJECT: Re: Sorting field contating NULL values consumes field cache memory
DATE: 21 Jul 2009

Thanks. We could this feature be expected 2.9 OR 3.0?

This is a good feature. Mostly Users store sparse data. All records may not have data for
all fields. This will reduce the memory consumption to a large extent. In my case almost 30%
of records just store information of reference file pointers and it is not part of initial
search. 

Regards
Ganesh
