SUBJECT: Analyze other language using English Analyzer
DATE: 3 Mar 2009

Hello all,

I am using default English Snowball analyzer to index and search English 
documents. There may be chances to index European, Chinese documents. What 
will be the impact to use English Analyzer for European or Chinese language 
documents? Whether i could do index and search as expected?

The application will be installed in English OS but the chances of getting 
other language documents are high. I will not be able to detect the language 
of the document.

Regards
Ganesh
