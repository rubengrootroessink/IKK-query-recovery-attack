Thanks for your immediate response.

The culprit here is sorting. I stopped sorting then memory consumption is reduced nearly 50%.
Further for Testing purpose i set setTermInfosIndexDivisor to 50 then memory consumption is
further reduced.

Currently i am sorting DateTime with minute resolution as single string. If i split it as
Date, Hour and Minute then memory consumption in sorting will get reduced.

Regards
Ganesh

No, it's loads 1/5th of the 1/128th of all the terms available.  Ie,
by default Lucene loads every 128th term into RAM for searching.  If
you call setTermInfosIndexDivisor(5), then it loads every 128*5 =
every 640 terms.

Calling setTermInfosIndexDivisor on a reopened reader won't work,
because of a [just now discovered] bug in Lucene.  The workaround (if
you really must use setTermInfosIndexDivisor) is to not use reopen.
