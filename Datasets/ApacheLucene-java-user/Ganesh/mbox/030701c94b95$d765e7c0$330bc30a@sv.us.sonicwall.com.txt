SUBJECT: Filter or Query
DATE: 21 Nov 2008

Hello all,

I am planning to use Filter for UserID and Date. I will not be able to cache 
the Filter. I have to create this filter for every request. To my knowledge, 
Filter will give faster results, only if it is cached.

Is it a good idea to use a filter or better to use query?

Regards
Ganesh
