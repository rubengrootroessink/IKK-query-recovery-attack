Any adivice on this. I am closing the reader when not in use. But still /proc/<processid>/fd
shows many files as (deleted). What are other things i need to look in to.

Regards
Ganesh

I am closing the readers when not in use. 

I tried testing explicitly not closing the reader and found that the file is not actually
deleted and it remains in the disk. I remeber reading this information. In my case, readers
and searchers are closed and the files are not existing in disk but /proc shows many fds with
(deleted).

Ganesh
