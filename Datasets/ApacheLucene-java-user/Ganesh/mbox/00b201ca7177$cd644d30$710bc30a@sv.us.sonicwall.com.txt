DATE: 30 Nov 2009

Hello all,

I am having an index build using v2.4.1. I upgraded to 2,9.1. The index was searchable. I
added couple of documents and i found that the PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper is not working as expected.


PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper analyzer = new PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper(getAnalyser());
analyzer.addAnalyzer("FROM",         new EmailAnalyzer());
analyzer.addAnalyzer("TO_INDEX", new EmailAnalyzer());
analyzer.addAnalyzer("TO",               new KeywordAnalyzer());

After indexing i found that the FROM and TO_INDEX fields are indexed using KeywordAnalyzer
and not by  EmailAnalyzer. I even added logs in the tokenStream function of EmailAnalyzer
and it never hit. Rebuilding the index works good.

I faced this issue rarely in v2.4.1 itself.  Rebuilding the index works good.

This issue happens when document is added to the existing index. 

Please guide me to overcome this issue.

Regards
Ganesh
