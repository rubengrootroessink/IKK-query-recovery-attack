SUBJECT: Re: Maintain last indexed information in a file or DB
DATE: 28 Nov 2008

My application is similar to google or msn desktop but the data would be 
voluminous. Some set of files are there in each folder and new files could 
be added to this folder. I have to pick the new one and index it. I could 
very well add some fields like folder name, filename, modified datetime etc. 
in the same DB or separate db. I have to search the DB and get the list of 
files for a folder and compare the same with the actual folder. This is one 
approach. Another approach is to persist the state in a file for every 
folder.

I will also try to avoid the crash, but my product will be installed in 
different customer places and there may be a possibility of forceful 
shutdown or killing java application etc. I need to be prepare for this 
situitation also.

Regards
Ganesh
