Hello all,
 
I am using Keyword analyzer to index a field and while using queryparser, I am using the same
analyzer.  I am indexing the text Hello world and while searching using queryparser.parse
it is not returning me any results. I need to use the text within the codes qp.parse("Hello
world");   

My question is why i need to give the text within codes (basically as a phrase). While indexing
i have not given and it is indexing as single term and while searching also it should consider
the complete text as single term.

Regards
Ganesh
