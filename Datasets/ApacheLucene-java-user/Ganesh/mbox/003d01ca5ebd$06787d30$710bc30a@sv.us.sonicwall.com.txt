Thanks Ian. There are some issues with my code. 

I am using almost 40 fields only two fields, requires update one will be updated by background
thread and other by the User. I am using Lucene as my database. I am reopening reader at constant
interval. The problem is when background thread and the User updates the same record in the
same interval, then i am loosing one update. 

Is there any way to resolve this issue using Lucene. I don't think 2.9 supports payload per
document, which could be updated independently to the document. 

Regards
Ganesh

In my experience the most frequent cause is not getting an exact match
on terms.  Are you sure that you have an exact match i.e. you're not
analyzing "MyUniqueId" to "myuniqueid"?

How are you determining that the call was successful?  You could try
running a query first to verify that a doc you think should be present
is really there.  Any exceptions being missed anywhere?  All writers
closed when they should be?  No index corruptions (CheckIndex)?

middle. I am not able to get the scenario.

When i copy the same data and run it in my end, updates are doing fine. In production system,
Even If i do a reindex, sometimes all the updates are successful and sometimes not. Its highly
unpredictable. All my documents have a unique id and using that updates are done.

Is there any limitation of not to update while doing commit?
