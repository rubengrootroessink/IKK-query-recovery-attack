Hello all,

I am using Lucene for my project and we have new requirement  to present data in the form
of Analytics. Facet could be used for that but for this purpose i don't want to migrate to
Solr. How to acheive this with Lucene. Will facet feature be part of future release of Lucene?


We require results in the below fashion. Top 3 results in each column.

Top users                 Country                 PageAccessed     
UserA (100)             India (1000)           /Articles/abc (200)
UserB (100)             US(500)                 /Articles/xyz (200)
UserC (100)             Russia(200)            /Articles/aaa (100)

When click on particular user, the results should be grouped for that User.
Top users                 Country                 PageAccessed     
UserA (100)             India (100)           /Articles/abc (55)
                                US(50)                 /Articles/xyz (25)
                                                             /Articles/aaa (10)
