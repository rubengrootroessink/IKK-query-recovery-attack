SUBJECT: PDF text extracted without spaces
DATE: 3 Dec 2010

Hello all,

I know, this is not the right group to ask this question, thought some of you guys might have
experienced.  

I newbie with Tika. I am using latest version 0.8 version. I extracted text from PDF document
but found spaces and new line missing. Indexing the data gives wrong result. Could any one
in this group could help me? I am using tika directly to extract the contents, which later
gets indexed.

Regards
Ganesh
