Thanks.

I used NumberTool to convert the int to string. In 2.9, NumericField is to be used but it
stores it based on some precision. I think the way the integer data gets indexed is changed
from 2.4 to 2.9. This means my customers using 2.4.1 should rebuild their index.

Whether 2.9 could able to modify\search the index created by 2.4.1? Is backward compatibility
maintained?

Regards
Ganesh
