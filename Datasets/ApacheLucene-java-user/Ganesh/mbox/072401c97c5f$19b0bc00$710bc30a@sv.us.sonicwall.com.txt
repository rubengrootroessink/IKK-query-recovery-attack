  Hello all,

  This question is not related to Lucene and i hope some folks might have 
  faced this issue.

  My java app uses RMI and i wanted to run it as a service both in windows and 
  linux. Is there any open source projects available to do that? Whether 
  tomcat could host RMI app.

  Suggest me, if there is any other way?

  Regards
  Ganesh
