SUBJECT: Search warmup from Tomcat
DATE: 26 Sep 2008

Hello all,

I need to do warmup the searcher object from my JSP pages. Currently i am 
having a static object, which i am frequently checking whether index got 
updated, if so i am closing the indexer and re-opening it. These JSP pages 
are invoked by the User. When User performs any search operation, few are 
faster and few are slower. This is because the searcher object is getting 
updated.

How do i warm up my searcher object, without the intervention of User 
request.

Regards
Ganesh
