SUBJECT: Sorting issues resolved in 3.0?
DATE: 3 Dec 2009

Hello all,

Sorting consumes huge amount of memory. Did 2.9.1 /3.0 has ability to customize field cache.
In my case, 80% of documents are required to be sorted. Currently the field cache is loading
all records. 

Is there any custom interface available to decide which document to be loaded in cache?

Is there any functionality to load this fieldcache from disk rather completly keeping in to
memory. Something similar to ehcache.  

Is any optimization done in sorting.      

Regards
Ganesh
