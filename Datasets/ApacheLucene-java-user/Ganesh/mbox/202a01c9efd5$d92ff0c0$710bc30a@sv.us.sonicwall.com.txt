DATE: 18 Jun 2009

I am having a million of documents per day to index. DateTime field is with minute resolution.


How much memory i save by splitting this to multiple fields (one field containintg YYYYMMDD,
one field with HH and one with MM). 

Could anyone provide me some calculation of calculating memory for sorting in case of multiple
fields. I think fieldcache will load all unique terms and it will have a pointer to the all
respective documents. If it so then splitting the date field will consume more memory.   

Regards
Ganesh
