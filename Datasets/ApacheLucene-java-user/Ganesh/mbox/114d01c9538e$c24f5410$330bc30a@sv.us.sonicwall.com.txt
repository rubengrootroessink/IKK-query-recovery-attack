I need to index voluminous data and i plan to shard it. The client may not 
know which shard db to query. Server will take care of complete shard 
management. I have done almost 50% of  development with Lucene.

In case of Solr, i think the client should be aware of which core or 
instance it want to communicate?

Regards
Ganesh
