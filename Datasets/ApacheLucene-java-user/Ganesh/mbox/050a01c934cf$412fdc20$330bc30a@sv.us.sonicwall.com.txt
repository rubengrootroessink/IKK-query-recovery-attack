DATE: 23 Oct 2008

My Index DB is having 10 million records and it will grow to 30 million. 
Currently I am using millisecond timestamp and the RAM cosumption is more. I 
will change the resolution to minute. I am using 2 searcher objects 
refreshing each other every minute. When i do a warmup query with sort of 
timestamp then the cpu is spiked to 100% and this is happening for every 
minute.  In order to avoid these issues, i am planning to break my DB and to 
do sort on indexed order.

Will multisearcher will maintain indexed order on sorting?

Regards
Ganesh
