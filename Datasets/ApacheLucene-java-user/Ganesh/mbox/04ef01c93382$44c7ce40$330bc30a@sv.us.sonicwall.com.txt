SUBJECT: Multisearcher will maintain index order sorting?
DATE: 21 Oct 2008

Hello all,

I need to maintain multiple db and i don't want to sort on datetime as it is 
taking huge RAM. I want to sort on indexed order. Using Multisearcher or 
ParallelMultiSearcher will maintain the index order. If it does then i don't 
need to merge the indexDB.

Regards
Ganesh
