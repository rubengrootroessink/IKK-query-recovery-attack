I am also in the same idea. Based on the field, I could shard but there are two practical difficulties.

1. If normal user logged-in then result could be fetched from the corresponding search server
but if Admin user logged-in, then he may need to see all data. The query should be issued
across servers and results should be consolidated.

2. Consider a scenario I am sharding based on the User, I am having single search server and
It is handling 1000 members. Now as the memory consumption is high,  I have added one more
search server. New users could access the second server but what about the old users, their
data will be still added to the server1. How to address this issue. Is rebuilding the index
the only way.     

Could any one share their experience, How they solved scale out problems?

Regards
Ganesh
