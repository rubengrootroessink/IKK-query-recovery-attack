SUBJECT: Best way to do date sort
DATE: 13 Jan 2009

I am indexing and storing date time with minute resolution. I need to do 
date range query and also do sorting on this field. I am having almost 30 
million records spread across 20 database.

option1:
To index the date time as string

option2:
To index date, hour and minute separately as number.

Which option will consume lesser memory?

Whether date range query will also load all data using FieldImpl?

Regards
Ganesh
