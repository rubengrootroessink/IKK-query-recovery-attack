Hello Eric,

Thanks for your reply.

Memory reqd for sorting: 4 * reader.maxdoc() 
.
I am sorting datetime with minute resolution. 100 records are representing a minute then in
a 1 million record database, there will be around 20000 unique terms. the amount of memory
consumed would be 4 * 1000000 + 20000 * 8 [Considering date time as Long]

The more amount of memory consumed by 4 * reader.maxdoc. If i have two or three fields say
 (YYYMMDD, hh, mm) then the amount of memory consumption would be too high. How could you
say that splitting the field will help in reducing the memory usage.

Please correct me if i am wrong. I require some justification to split the date in to multiple
terms.

Regards
Ganesh
