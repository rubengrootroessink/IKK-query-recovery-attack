SUBJECT: Writer memory released after flush
DATE: 8 Jan 2009

I am maintaing multiple indexes and all writers will be opened. Based on 
some criteria, the document is added to a particular index. I am using 50 MB 
of RAM buffer size. Whether the buffer will be released once flush or 
optinization done or the writer will maintain the memory and recyle it.

Regards
Ganesh
