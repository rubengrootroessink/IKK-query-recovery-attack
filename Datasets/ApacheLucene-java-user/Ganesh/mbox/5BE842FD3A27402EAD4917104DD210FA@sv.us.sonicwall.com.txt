SUBJECT: Reusing Document and Field objects
DATE: 18 Jan 2010

Hello all,

I am indexing millions of documents. The app is single threaded. I need to create Document
and Fields objects repeatedly. I have a thought to create it once and reuse by setting the
field values to null. 

Is this advisable, Will it give any performance improvement?

Regards
Ganesh
