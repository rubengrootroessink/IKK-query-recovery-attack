SUBJECT: IndexReader delete
DATE: 17 Dec 2008

When i perform a delete, i am getting the following exception

org.apache.lucene.store.LockObtainFailedException: Lock obtain timed out: 
SimpleFSLock@/<path>
	org.apache.lucene.store.Lock.obtain(Lock.java:85)
	org.apache.lucene.index.DirectoryIndexReader.acquireWriteLock(DirectoryIndexReader.java:303)
	org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.deleteDocument(IndexReader.java:837)

Indexing is done by separate process and search is performed from web ui. If 
the DB is locked by indexing app then the records will not be deleted using 
reader?

I want the deletion to be performed by Reader, so that it will get reflected 
in the results immediately.

Regards
Ganesh
