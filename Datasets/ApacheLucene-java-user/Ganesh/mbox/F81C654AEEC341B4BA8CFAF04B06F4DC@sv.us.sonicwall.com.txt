My requirement is, I want to display the Top Terms with their count for every field. I am having
10 fields and in Each field Top 3 terms with their count should be displayed. When User selects
any term then the search will be performed to filter the results. 

I could use term vector and enumurate the term freqeuncy and sort it but it may be time consuming
task.  

Field_1                   Field_2                     Field_N  
Term_1_1(100)     Term_2_1(389)       Term_N_1(216)
Term_1_2(78)      Term_2_2(134)        Term_N_2(156)
Term_1_3(56)      Term_2_3(78)          Term_N_3(89)

Sample:
-------------
Top users                 Country                 PageAccessed     
UserA (100)             India (1000)           /Articles/abc (200)
UserB (100)             US(500)                 /Articles/xyz (200)
UserC (100)             Russia(200)            /Articles/aaa (100)

When click on particular user, the results should be grouped for that User.
Top users                 Country                 PageAccessed     
UserA (100)             India (100)           /Articles/abc (55)
                                US(50)                 /Articles/xyz (25)
                                                             /Articles/aaa (10)
