SUBJECT: Single searcher vs Multi Searcher
DATE: 3 Oct 2008

Hello all,

My indexing is growing by 1 million records per day and the memory 
consumption of the searcher object is quite high.

There are different opinion in the groups. Few suggest to use single 
database and few to use sharding. My Database has 10 million records now and 
it might go till 30 million or more. I plan to shard the index. but 
Multisearcher will give me benifit.

Regards
Ganesh
