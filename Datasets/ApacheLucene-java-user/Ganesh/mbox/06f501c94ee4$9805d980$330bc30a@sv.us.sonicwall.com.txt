SUBJECT: Marked for deletion
DATE: 25 Nov 2008

Hello all,

My index application is a separate process and my search application is part 
of web ui. When User performs delete, i want to do mark for deletion.

I think i have no other option other than to update the document, but index 
app is a separate process and it uses index writer. In order to update, I am 
planning to use RMI and create a single application which does both index 
and search and also exposes some search and delete methods.

Is there any other way to achieve this?

Regards
Ganesh
