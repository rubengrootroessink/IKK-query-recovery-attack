SUBJECT: Lucene app to run as daemon service in windows and linux
DATE: 22 Jan 2009

Hello all,

This question is not related to Lucene and i hope some folks might have 
faced this issue.

My java app uses RMI and i wanted to run it as a service both in windows and 
linux. Is there any open source projects available to do that? Whether 
tomcat could host RMI app.

Suggest me, if there is any other way?

Regards
Ganesh
