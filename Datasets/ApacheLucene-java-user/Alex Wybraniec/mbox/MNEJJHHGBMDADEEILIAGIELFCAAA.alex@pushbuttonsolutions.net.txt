I'm sorry if this is not the correct place to post this, but I'm very
confused, and getting towards the end of my tether.

I need to install/compile and run Lucene on a Windows XP Pro based machine,
running J2SE 1.4.2, with ANT.

I downloaded both the source code and the pre-compile versions, and as yet
have not been able to get either running. I've been through the
documentation, and still I can find little to help me set it up properly.

All I want to do (to start with) is compile and run the demo version.

I'm sorry to ask such a newbie question, but I'm really stuck.

So if anyone can point me to an idiots guide, or offer me some help, I would
be most grateful.

Once I get past this stage, I'll have all sorts of juicer questions for you,
but at the minute, I can't even get past stage 1

Thank you in advance
Alex
