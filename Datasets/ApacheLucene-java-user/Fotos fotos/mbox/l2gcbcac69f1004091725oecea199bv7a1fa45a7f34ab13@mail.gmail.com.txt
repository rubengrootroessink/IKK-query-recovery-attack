SUBJECT: Removing terms in the Index
DATE: 10 Apr 2010

Hello!
I am a beginner with Lucene. I'm needing to do the following:

I have a text file with the following terms:

"Lucene in action"
"Lucene"

and a file with the following sentences:

1 - "Lucene in action now."
2 - "Lucene for Dummies"
3 - "Managing Gigabytes"

I need to search in phrases of doc2, the terms of doc1.

But in search of the word n-grama: "Lucene in Action", he also finds the 2nd
sentence.

In this case, I want to meet with the term 1 ("Lucene in Action"), only the
first phrase and remove the term of the index, for not to be found when I
pass the term 2 ("Lucene")
