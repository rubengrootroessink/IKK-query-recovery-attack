SUBJECT: Memory allocation to Ram Directory
DATE: 16 Aug 2006


Hi,  my lucene index updates via the fileserver is eating up almost a huge
amount of heap memory and once the index is completed the memory is not
been returned.  Ram Drive is enabled.

Does anyone know if this might be a problem with the amount of memory been
allocated to the Ram Directory?
Can you tell me where to look to see what the current memory allocation is?
i.e what configuration file?

And is the Ram Directory been fed from the overall heap memory allocation
or has the Ram Directory got a seperate memory allocation?


Kind Regards
Adrena Keating
