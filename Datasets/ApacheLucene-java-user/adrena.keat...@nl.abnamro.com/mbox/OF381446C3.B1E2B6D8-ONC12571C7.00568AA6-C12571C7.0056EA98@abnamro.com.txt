SUBJECT: Lucene/Tomcat Memory Leak Issue
DATE: 11 Aug 2006


Hello, can anyone help?


We're experiencing the following issue an Widows Intranet website:


Following a Tomcat restart, our application has Lucene creating a single
new index in a RAMDirectory, followed by continuous creation of additional
index entries as new content is published.


During the initial index creation process, Heap Memory utilization jumps to
over 300 MB and never drops back down, even though the new index itself is
~15 MB in size. Then, as additional index entries are added, the Heap
Memory utilization continues to increase and garbage collection reduces in
size, until we max out the available Heap Memory and Tomcat crashes.


Relevant configuration items:
        Windows 2000 5.0
        4 Processors, 2GB RAM
        Tomcat 5.0.27
        JDK 1.5.0_06
        Lucene 1.9.1
        VM arguments:
                -Djava.io.tmpdir=D:\Appldata\Lucene\lockDir
                -Dorg.apache.lucene.commitLockTimeout=60000
                -Dorg.apache.lucene.writeLockTimeout=60000
                -XX:PermSize=256m
                -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
                -Xrs
                -Xms256m
                -Xmx1024m
                -Xss512k
        lucene.searcher.keep.open=true
        lucene.searcher.retries=6


Has anyone experienced similar conditions? Any suggestions?

Kind Regards
Adrena Keating
