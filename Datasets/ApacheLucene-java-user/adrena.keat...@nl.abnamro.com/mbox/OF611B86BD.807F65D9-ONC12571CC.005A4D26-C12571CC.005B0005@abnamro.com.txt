SUBJECT: Re: Lucene/Tomcat Memory Leak Issue
DATE: 16 Aug 2006

We are indexing the file server via Lucene.  We have a 15 MB index file and
have set up a once a day re-index and then switch to a continuous index
update.
So everytime a content item is published it is immediately indexed and
deployed.  Problem persists with both scenario's.

We are using jconsole as a profiler but this does not give us information
if tomcat objects are released from their references and so are not garbage
collected.
Certainly its looks like the long-term heap memory is the issue and is not
being garbage collected effectively.

We dont even know what the likely culprit is.  i.e memory leak, heap/pergen
memory settings, lucene bug, bug in the way the code is interacting with
lucene.

We have been looking at this problem for months now..

We dont index xml files with xalan.

Kind Regards
Adrena Keating

How do you index your documents? Are you releasing old resources? Can you
use a
profiler to see referenced objects?

I've experienced the same problem when indexing xml files which were parsed
with
xalan, and the memory leak in that case was in xalan. Switching to saxon
solved
the problems for us.
