SUBJECT: Problem with NOT and OR Query
DATE: 16 Jun 2009

Hi

 

I found that a query "NOT num_pkts:1024  OR src_port:80" behaves the same as
"NOT num_pkts:1024  AND src_port:80". The actual query is

 

(start_utc:[1230748200 TO 1230768000] OR end_utc:[1230748200 TO 1230768000])
AND (num_pkts:1024  OR NOT num_bytes:40960) but it behaves as if it is

 

(start_utc:[1230748200 TO 1230768000] OR end_utc:[1230748200 TO 1230768000])
AND (num_pkts:1024  AND NOT num_bytes:40960).

 

Is this a known issue?

 

 

Is there a workaround to this problem?

 

Thanks

Sumanta
