DATE: 6 Feb 2006

I have earlier used lucene and I must say it has performed bug free for the
limited use I deployed it for. I now want to deploy lucene to do something
more. Once indexed, I want to know, which is the word which occurs maximum
times among all the rest in a document set. Does lucene already provide such
a feature?
 
I would appreciate an answer to my question.
 
Thanks in advance.
Pranay
