Jason,
Even if there is no harm to the index,
I think the error needs to be reported back
to the caller.  I am assuming a system error 
like a filesystem error (filesystem full etc.)
that causes Lucene not be able to write new docs.
If this happens, the caller needs to be reported
of the error so that it can ask Lucene and other
participants of transaction to roll back.  Am
I missing something?
