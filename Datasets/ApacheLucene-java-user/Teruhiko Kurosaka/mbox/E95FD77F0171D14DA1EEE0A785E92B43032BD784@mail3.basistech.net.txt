SUBJECT: How to obtain raw scores?
DATE: 19 Nov 2008

Hello,
Is there anyway to obtain a raw hit score?

I understand the deprecated Hits.getScore()
returns normalized scores, relative to each
query.  Is TopDocs.scoreDocs[i].score
also normalized, or raw?

I'd like to compare confidence levels
of hits among different queries.

Thanks.
