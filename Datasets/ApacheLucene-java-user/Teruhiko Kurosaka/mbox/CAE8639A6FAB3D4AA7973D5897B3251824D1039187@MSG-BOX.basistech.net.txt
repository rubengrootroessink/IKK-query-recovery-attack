SUBJECT: RE: Lucene performance: is search time linear to the index size?
DATE: 17 Jun 2009

I've written a test program that uses the simplest form of search,
TermQuery and measure the time it takes to search a term in a field
on indices of various sizes.

The result is a very linear growth of search time vs the index size in
terms of # of Documents, not # of unique terms in that field.
