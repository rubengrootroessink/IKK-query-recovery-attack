SUBJECT: Re: PayloadAttribute behavior change between Lucene 2.9/3.0 and the trunk
DATE: 4 Dec 2010

Thank you, Robert, substituting getAttribute with addAttribute worked!

But I don't understand why.  Could you help me to understand the mechanics?

In my setting,
hasAttribute(PayloadAttribute.class) returns false.

So I thought addAttribute(PayloadAttribute.class) would just
create a new PayloadAttribute object.  It would remedy the
Exception, but it wouldn't do any good accessing the payload 
generated upstream.

But the newly generated PayloadAttribute t is actually 
getting the payload that was generated upstream (by my Tokenizer). 
How is this possible?
