SUBJECT: Lucene performance: is search time linear to the index size?
DATE: 17 Jun 2009

I am seeing my Lucene application's search time grows pretty much linearly to the number of
Documents.
Is this how Lucene is supposed to work, or does it depend on the nature of query? 

I am not using FuzzyQuery that was the subject of the recent discussion by the way.
