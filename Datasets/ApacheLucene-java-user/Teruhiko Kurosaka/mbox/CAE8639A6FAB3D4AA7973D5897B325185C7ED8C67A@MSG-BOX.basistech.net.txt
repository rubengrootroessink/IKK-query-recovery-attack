Shouldn't that be done in end()? If not, what is
the difference in purpose between end() and close()?
What is the purpose of end()?

In any event, if close() is meant to close the Reader,
I think the current description of TokenStream.close() 
in the javadoc is a bit confusing.  Instead of saying
"Releases resources associated with this stream.", perhaps
it should say something like "Release resources associated with
the current input source.".
