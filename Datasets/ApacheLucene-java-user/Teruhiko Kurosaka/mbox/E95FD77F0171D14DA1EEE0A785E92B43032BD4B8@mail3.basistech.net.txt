SUBJECT: RE: Phrase query-like query that doesn't requre all the terms?
DATE: 14 Nov 2008

Yonik, 
Thank you for your reply.
My problem with Phrase Query is that it requires
existence of all the terms in documents.  I want them more
permissible.  I want it to match with lower score.
Does dismax also requires all the terms?
