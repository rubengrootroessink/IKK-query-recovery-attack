DATE: 9 Jun 2006

Hi All! I have a trouble... When I index text documents in english, there
is no problem, buy when I index Spanish text documents (And they're big),
a lot of information form the document don't become Indexed (I suppose it
is due to the Analyzer). Howewer I want to Index ALL the strings in the
document with no StopWords. Is this possible??

Thank's in advance
