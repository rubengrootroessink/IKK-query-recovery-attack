SUBJECT: Problem loading file from Directory on MacOS X...
DATE: 10 Jun 2010

Hey folks.
Ran into a problem on MacOS X...that doesn't exist in Linux (CentOS, or Ubuntu).

No signature of method: static
org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.open() is applicable for argument
types: (java.io.File) values: [/home/kplummer/Development/tmp]

I'm actually running this through Groovy, but don't imagine this is
the problem.  Wondering if anyone has any ideas?

Here's the code:

def fsDir = FSDirectory.open(new File(indexDir))

TIA,
Kit
