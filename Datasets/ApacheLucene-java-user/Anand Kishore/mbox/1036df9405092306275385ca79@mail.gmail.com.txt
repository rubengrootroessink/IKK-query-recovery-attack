Thanx guyz for your prompt replies.

>>When you want to display relevant text for a search
>>result, find the file on disk, and pass it through the Lucene
>>Highlighter (see the Lucene sandbox).

A nice suggestion but again as i'm indexing mails my Lucene Document has
fields like "Sender", "Subject", and "Content". Feeding the entire mail from
disk will also include meta-data which i need to exclude.

OR

If i extract the subject, content etc concating them as a string, and then
feed it to the highlighter it should work rite???
