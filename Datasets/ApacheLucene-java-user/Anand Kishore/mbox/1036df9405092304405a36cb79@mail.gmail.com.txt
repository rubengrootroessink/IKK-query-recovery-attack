DATE: 23 Sep 2005

Hi,

I am indexing emails through Lucene. The body of the mails is stored in an
''Unstored" field. I also have a search interface setup which returns me all
Documents matching my query. What i need is to display a few lines from the
body of the mails where the queryTerm was found. How can this be achieved as
the body is just indexed but not stored.

Thanx

- Andy
