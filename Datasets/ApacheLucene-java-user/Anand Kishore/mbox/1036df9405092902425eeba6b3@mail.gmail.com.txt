SUBJECT: Boosting a subquery
DATE: 29 Sep 2005

Hi,
 LIA has info about boosting terms and/or fields but how do I go about
boosting an entire bracketed subquery. For example: if I have a query
consisting of 2 subqueries like:
(xyz:AAA OR qwe:BBB) OR (xyz:CCC OR zxc:DDD)
 I want to boost subquery1 so that documents are ranked accordingly.
