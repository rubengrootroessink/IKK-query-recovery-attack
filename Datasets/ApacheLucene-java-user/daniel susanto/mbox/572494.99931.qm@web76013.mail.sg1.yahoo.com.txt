SUBJECT: Is it possible to add new document into existing lucene index?
DATE: 17 Apr 2009

Hi all,

I'm NB in Lucene. 
Is it possible to add new document into existing document? I think it is important so that
we don't need to re-index the all in file folder if just one or two file that need to be added
into index. Thx.
