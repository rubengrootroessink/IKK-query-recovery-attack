It doesn't sound promising to me.

I mean, yes, you can probably draw an analogy of an OLAP drill-down to
searching withing search results, but that's about it...reporting and
analysis tools are fundamentaly different from a search engine in that
they work with highly structured data and leverage that structure to
do various calculations the results of which are then presented to the
user. A search engine, on the other hand, is basically a tool designed
to handle tons of unstructured or badly structured (i.e. structured
for the human reader) data.
In conclusion, you can do great things with a search engine, but BI in
general or reporting in particular is not one of them. Take a look at
bizgres, pentaho (mondrian, jrubik/jpivot, kettle, weka), and
jasperreports to get a better idea of what I'm talking about.

Just another opinion, anyway...
