I wish people would start selling .pdf books online... :(

Thanks for the tip, I'll be sure to try it out. Sounds like a good tool to have.

This will probably sound like a ridiculous question but...*how* would
I add new data to an existing index? Did you mean literally "add" as
in index an additional directory or website, rather than "refresh the
index of the currently indexed documents, now that they've changed"?

I'd imagine a search index in an intranet is probably the easiest
thing to rebuild if it comes to data loss due to a blackout: I'm now
worried about that at the moment. If the indexing becomes a multiday
effort (which I highly doubt it will), then I'll start to worry.
Still, I'd like to have the option of using multiple indices.

I haven't ran into it. Can you direct me to a document or two?

No comments on ranking of documents with no real interlinking to help?
