I don't really understand what you're so worried about. Either it'll
work well with the setup you have, or it won't. It's really the size
of it. ;)
Seriously, you have a number of relatively cheap possibilities at hand
to improve search performance: storing the index on a RAID 5 disk
array will let you read the indices very fast, using multicore CPUs,
adding memory and even if all that isn't good enough, you can always
use a small cluster (say, 4 nodes) of very, very inexpensive PCs
filled with a GB of RAM. You don't have to keep them inside the
regular UPS/backup/voult-protected area as the indices can always be
rebuilt (unlike e.g. data in transactional systems) and between 4 of
them they might cost like an entry-level server.
I'll let the experts speak now. :)
