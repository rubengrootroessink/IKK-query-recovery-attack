DATE: 9 Oct 2008


Hi,

I want to make a wizard that can help to find n-grams terms.
For example:
If i want to search History, after write it the system propose you the
following searches:
history europe
history spain
history .....
Consulting the terms indexed.

Does it exits in Lucene?

thank you,
Albert
