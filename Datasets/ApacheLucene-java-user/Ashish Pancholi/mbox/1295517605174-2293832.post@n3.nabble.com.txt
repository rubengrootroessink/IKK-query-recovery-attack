Using Lucene_3.0.3. we would like to implement following: 
The number of occurrences of the term in the entire index.
      For Example :     
      If we have indexed following text : amazon, amazon s3, amazon
simpledb, amazon aws;
      Then we are supposed to get results : 

            amazon    4
            s3           1
            simpledb   1 
            aws         1

Showing phrases by combining the words, in the same sequence as they were in
original text, before Indexing.   

      Lets suppose, we have indexed following text : amazon, amazon s3,
amazon simpledb, amazon aws;
      And for two word pharses we are supposed to get results 

                amazon amazon
                amazon s3
                s3 amazon
                amazon simpledb
                simpledb amazon
                amazon aws

      And for three word pharses we are supposed to get results : 

               amazon amazon s3
               amazon s3 amazon
               s3 amazon simpledb
               amazon simpledb amazon
               simpledb amazon aws

Any help will be appreciated.
