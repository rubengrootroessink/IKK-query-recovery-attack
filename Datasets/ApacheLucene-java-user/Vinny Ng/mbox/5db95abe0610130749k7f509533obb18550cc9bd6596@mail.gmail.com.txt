SUBJECT: multiple field query
DATE: 13 Oct 2006

Hi List,

I'd like to have a query consisting of different keywords on different
fields, e.g. "title:Lucene" "author:Otis" with the second part having
boosted value of 2.

Assuming I use the same Analyzer for both parts of the query then how should
i compose my query ?

Thanks a lot.

Ng
