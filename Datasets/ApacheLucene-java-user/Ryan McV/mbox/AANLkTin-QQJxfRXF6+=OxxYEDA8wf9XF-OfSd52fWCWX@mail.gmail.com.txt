SUBJECT: Query Match Count
DATE: 8 Aug 2010

Hello All,

Is there a way to count the number of times a query matched in a particular
document?

For example, say we created a document that had the string "cheese cheese
cheese cheese" in the field that is being searched.
I would like to know that the query "cheese" matched four times in that
particular document. Is there a way to do this?

BTW, I am new to Lucene, so if I have any misconceptions that are apparent
please feel free to correct me.

Thanks,
Ryan
