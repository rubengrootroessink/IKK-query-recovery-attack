I know of the following existing Java implementations of language
categorization:

* A Nutch implementation:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/nutch/nutch/src/plugin/languageidentifier/

* A Lucene patch: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26763

* JTextCat (http://www.jedi.be/JTextCat/index.html),  a Java wrapper
for libtextcat

* NGramJ (http://ngramj.sourceforge.net/), a general n-gram Java library

Of these, the Nutch one is certainly under active development, the
others don't seem to be as far as I can tell.

I like your idea of using Wikipedia translations as the training
corpus - it's a good way to get fairly reliable sources for lots of
languages.
