SUBJECT: range query problems
DATE: 17 Sep 2004

Hi,

I'm having a problem with a range query.

I have a field in my documents called "adzer". In at least one of those 
documents, the value is: "-000000009999999993" (without the quotes). I 
know this because if I create a search string like so: "adzer: 
\\-000000009999999993" (again, without the quotes), I get results.

However, if I create a range query that I would expect to find that 
value, I get nothing. The range query string is: "adzer:[# TO 0]" (minus 
the quotes). As far as I can tell, this query string should find any 
value in the adzer fields that starts with a "-". The unicode value for 
# comes before the unicode value for - and the unicode value for - comes 
before the unicode value for 0. Creating a sample program with the 
mentioned Strings and using the compareTo function seems to confirm 
this. But Lucene seems to disagree.

Am I missing something here? I've been banging my head on this all day, 
and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Derek
