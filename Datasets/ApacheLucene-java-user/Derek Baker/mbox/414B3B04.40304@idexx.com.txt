Thanks for your reply.

If I do it manually:

    Term term1 = new Term("adzer", "#");
    Term term2 = new Term("adzer", "0");
    Query myQuery = new RangeQuery(term1, term2, true);
    hits = searcher.search(myQuery);

I still get nothing. If I make the first term in the new RangeQuery call 
null:

    Query myQuery = new RangeQuery(null, term2, true);

I get nothing. If, however I make the second term in the new RangeQuery 
call null:

    Query myQuery = new RangeQuery(term1, null, true);

I get the results I expect.

Seems very strange.
