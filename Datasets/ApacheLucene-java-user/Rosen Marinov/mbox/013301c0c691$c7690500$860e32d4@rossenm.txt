I want to delete a document from index.

My index contains lucene Documents with 2 fields
for exammlpe"
 
"ID" "12345"
"CONTENT" "The quick brown ...."

now i wanrt to delete document with id 12345

create a Term  --> t = new Term("ID","12345");
IndexReader.delete(t) - doesn't delete the document

if ID is a string from letters it is ok: 
for example "ID" "abcd"
now with Term("ID","abcd");
everything is OK.
