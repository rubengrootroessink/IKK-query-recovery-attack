SUBJECT: Search in all fields
DATE: 16 Mar 2004

In QueryParser.parse method I must give which is the default field.

Does this means ttah non-adressed queris are executed only over
this field?

The main question is:
How I can search in all fields in all documents in the index?
Note that I don't know field names, there can be thousands field 
names in all documnets.

10x in advance.
