Are you using the highlighter or doing anything non-trivial in 
displaying the results?

Are the pages being compressed (mod_gzip or some servlet equivalent)? 
This definitely helps, though to see the effect you may have to make 
sure your simulated users are "remote".

Also consider caching search results if it's reasonable to assume users 
may search for the same things.

I made some measurements on caching on my site:

And I use OSCache:
