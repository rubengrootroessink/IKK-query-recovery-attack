I have a large index that needs to yield very fast query times.  I am
sorting by date as default since I am interested in the most recent
documents.  I was wondering if I boosted the score of my documents in
proportion to the date and not sorting would this increase search
performance. Thoughts?

 

Thanks,

Michael
