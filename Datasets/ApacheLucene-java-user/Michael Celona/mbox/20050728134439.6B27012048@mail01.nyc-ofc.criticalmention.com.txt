Will using a striped raid configuration (i.e. raid 5/10 ) yield the same
performance improvements as using multiple drives with ParallelIndexReader.

Also, for searching are you suggesting using ParallelMultiSearcher against
multiple indexes on separate drives and/or using ParallelIndexReader.

Option 1) will most likely give you more, but there are a number of
other things you could do before going for monster hardware.  Splitting
the index, more than 1 disk, ParallelIndexReader, the patch that splits
index files into a number of data files, etc.
