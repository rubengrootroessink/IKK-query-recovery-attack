Would fixing the lengthNorm to 1 fix this problem?

I have varying length text fields which I am searching on.  I would like
relevancy to be dictated predominantly by the number of terms in my query
that match.  Right now I am seeing a high relevancy for a single word
matching in a small document even though all the terms in my query don't
match.  Does, anyone have an example of a custom Similarity sub class which
overrides the coord and lengthNorm methods.

 

Thanks..

Michael
