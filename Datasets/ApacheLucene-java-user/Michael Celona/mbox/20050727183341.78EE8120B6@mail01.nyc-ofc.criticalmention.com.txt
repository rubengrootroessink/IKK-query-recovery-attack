I am going over ways to increase overall search performance.  

 

Currently, I have a dual zeon with 2G of ram dedicated to java searching an
8G index on one 7200 rpm drive.

 

Which will give the greatest payoff?

 

1)       Going to 64bit server and giving more memory to java with faster
drives 

 

Or

 

2)       Staying with 32bit server but going with faster drives and
splitting the operating system from the index drive.

 

 

Basically, what are the performance improvements from separating the
operation system form the index drive(s).

 

 

Thanks,

Michael
