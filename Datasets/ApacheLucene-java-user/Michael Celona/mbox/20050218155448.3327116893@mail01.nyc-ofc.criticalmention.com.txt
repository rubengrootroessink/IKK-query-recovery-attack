What is single handedly the best way to improve search performance?  I have
an index in the 2G range stored on the local file system of the searcher.
Under a load test of 5 simultaneous users my average search time is ~4700
ms.  Under a load test of 10 simultaneous users my average search time is
~10000 ms.    I have given the JVM 2G of memory and am a using a dual 3GHz
Zeons.  Any ideas?
