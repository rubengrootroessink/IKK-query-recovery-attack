Epoch is in seconds... I am also forced to used a date filter on most of
searches... how bad is the performance hit of that.

Is epoch a Date?  or a String?  If a String, what format is it?

Sorting by a Date keyword field will be sorting as a String value, 
which is a fair bit more resource intensive than if it was numeric.

Try using a purely numeric field (though as a String) that can be 
represented as an int be sure to specify the sort type as an int and 
see if that improves performance.  I'm pretty certain you'd still get 
better performance by using a boost than a sort though.
