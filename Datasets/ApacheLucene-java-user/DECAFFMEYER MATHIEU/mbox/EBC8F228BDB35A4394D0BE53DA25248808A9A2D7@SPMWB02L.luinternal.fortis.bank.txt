***** This message comes from the Internet Network *****



Just as a test I tried this : 

Field contentField = 
    new Field( 
        "content", cleanedContent, 
        Field.Store.NO, 
        Field.Index.TOKENIZED); 

contentField.setBoost(100);      
doc.add(contentField); 

In my document I have the word "experience", 
when I do a search on this word I keep having a score of a bit more than
0. 

Why is my boost not working ? 

Thank u.
