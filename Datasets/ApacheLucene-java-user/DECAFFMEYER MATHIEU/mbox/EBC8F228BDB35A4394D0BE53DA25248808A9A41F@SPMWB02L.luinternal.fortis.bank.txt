SUBJECT: Open & Close Reader

Hi,

I need to merge indexes,
if I want the user to see the changes (the merged indexes), I heard I
need to close the index reader and re-open it again.

But I will need to do this avery x minutes for some reasons,
So I wondered what could happen if user does a query just when a re-open
of the reader has been done.

Thank you.
