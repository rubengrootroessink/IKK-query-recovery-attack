SUBJECT: Deleting document by file name
DATE: 1 Feb 2007

Hi,

I have a list of filenames like
Corporate.htm
Logistics.htm
Merchant.htm
....
that need to be deleted.

For now on I  give this list to my Search application that reads the
idnex and give the results, and if the path contains one of the
filenames, I don't display this hit ... Not really proper programming
...

Is there a way to delete the document in the index instead with this
information ?

Thank u.
