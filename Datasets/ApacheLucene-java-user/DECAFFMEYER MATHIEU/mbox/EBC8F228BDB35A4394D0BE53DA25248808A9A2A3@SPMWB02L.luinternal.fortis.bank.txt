Thank u for your response,
Actually I want to merge the Hits to get a better score,
For example when user enter Hello
I want to merge :
title:Hello
headlines:Hello
summary:Hello
content:Hello

Then I will get a better score if the title is Hello,
What do u think of this ?

Thank u.

The easiest way is to merge the queries which produces thoses different hits. 
You should look at BooleanQuery.
