Hi,

The score depends of 
1. the query 
2. the matched document 
3. the index.

I don't really understand why the index must influence the score (why it
ahs been implemented that way).

Let's say I have this page Logistics.htm
I have just one time the word "experience" in it.
It will get a high score because of the IDF but it occurs only once in
my document.
