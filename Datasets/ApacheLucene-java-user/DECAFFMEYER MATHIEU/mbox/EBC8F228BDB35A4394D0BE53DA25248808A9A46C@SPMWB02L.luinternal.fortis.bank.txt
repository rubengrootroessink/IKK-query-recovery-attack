SUBJECT: Merge Indexes - addIndexes
DATE: 28 Feb 2007

Hi,

I store the Lucene Index of my web applications in a file system.
Oftenly, I need to add to this index another index also stored as file
system.

I have three questions :

* What is the best way to do this ?
  Open an IndexReader on this newcoming index-file system 
  and use addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers) ? 
   (where I will have each time one IndexReader in the array)

* Which files do I need ?
  I see in the File System that the following is stored :
  - segments
  - deletable
  - _1.cfs
  - untokenizedFieldNames.txt
  - stopWordList.txt
  - analyzerType.txt

* Can the merge be time consuming ?
   What happen when a user does a query in my search engine when I'm
merging the indexes
   with the method addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers)  ?


Thank u for any help !
