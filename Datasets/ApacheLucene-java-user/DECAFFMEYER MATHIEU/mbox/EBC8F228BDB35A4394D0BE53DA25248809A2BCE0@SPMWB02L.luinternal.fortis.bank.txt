I needed this myself not long time ago..
Here is a piece of code to get an Analyzer that will use a tokeniez and
an English stemmer, (for "bears" it will also return "bear" and vice
versa)


private static Analyzer createEnglishAnalyzer() {
return new Analyzer() {
	public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader)
{
		TokenStream result = new StandardTokenizer(reader);
		result = new StandardFilter(result);
		result = new LowerCaseFilter(result);
		result = new StopFilter(result,
StandardAnalyzer.STOP_WORDS);
		result = new SnowballFilter(result, "English");
		return result;
	}
};
}
