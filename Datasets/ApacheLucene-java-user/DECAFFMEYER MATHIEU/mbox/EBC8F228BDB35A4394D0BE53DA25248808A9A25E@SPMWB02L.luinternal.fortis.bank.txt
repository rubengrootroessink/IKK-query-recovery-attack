Thank u for your reply,

There is not much help in Regain community,

But I can see that when I type e.g. 
title:logistics
I have like 0.70
also headlines:logistics 0.70

But when I type logistics I have 0.02

I do not udnerstand since I added this word as title and headlines and I
need a higher score for titles of the web pages for the people I
develop.

I will try Luke but for some reason I can't install it in my company,

Can someone give me some suggestions on what I should do ?

Thank u.

I don't know what Regain is ... but this sounds like some issue between
how it reports the scores Lucene generates.  Lucene scores are not
percentages, they are either a "raw score" which is an absolute
calculation absed on the query boosts and constants in your Similarity
class -- raw scores can be any floating point number; or they are a
"Hits
semi-nomalized score" which are garunteed to be between 0 and 1, but the
"best" matching document is only garunteed to have a score no greater
then
1 -- it is not garunteed to have a score that *is* 1.

perhaps Regain is translating the Hits score as a percentage -- in which
case there is nothing wrong with the top matching document haveing a
score
of "2%" ... it's still the top matching document.


I would suggest you start by asking some questions of the Regain user
community or Regain is a commercial product, ask their customer support
people aboutthe scores.
