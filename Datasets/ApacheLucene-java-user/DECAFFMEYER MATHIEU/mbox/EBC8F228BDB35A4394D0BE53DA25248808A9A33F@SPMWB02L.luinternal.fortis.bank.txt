Thank u Otis !

Last question about this :
In what way will this differ ?

A)
Field headlinesField = new Field("headlines", "hello", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.TOKENIZED); 
Field headlinesField = new Field("headlines", "world", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.TOKENIZED);  

B)
Field headlinesField = new Field("headlines", "hello world",
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED); 

C)
Field headlinesField = new Field("headlines", "hello \n world \n",
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED);


Thank u .

*****  This message comes from the Internet Network *****

1)

Field headlinesField = new Field("headlines", headline1,
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED); 

Field headlinesField = new Field("headlines", headline2,
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED); 

  
...

2) path + url - you are probably looking at the demo.  That is *just* a
demo and those are just the fields that demo uses, your application can
use any field it needs, like "headlines" above.

Subject: Adding headlines, path



Adding headlines, path           Hi all, 

  I have simple questions for which I can't find an answer by googling :


  1)  

I want to add headlines for a document : 

  Field headlinesField = new Field("headlines", headlines,
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED); 

  But how do I separate the headlines between them ? 

  Let's say I want to add :  

Strengths

 Our clients

 Solutions & service 

  Do I need to put a white space between them or a newline, ... ? 

  2) 

  What is the difference between the field path and the field url ? 

  url I guess is the url of the document as http://.......  

but what is the field path ? 

 

  Thank u for any help !
