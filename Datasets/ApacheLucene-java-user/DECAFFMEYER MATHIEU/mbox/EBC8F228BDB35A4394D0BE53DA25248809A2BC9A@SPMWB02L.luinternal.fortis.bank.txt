SUBJECT: Using Stemmers
DATE: 5 Mar 2007


Hi, 
This is a very simple question, but I just can't find the ressources I
need ... 
I am using the StandardAnalyzer : 
StandardAnalyzer stdAnalyzer; 
if ((stopWordList != null) && (stopWordList.length != 0)) { 
stdAnalyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(stopWordList); 
} else { 
stdAnalyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(); 
} 
What I want to achive is be able to use an englsih stemmer, 
But I can't find any methods to associate my stemmer to my Analayzer. 
I appreciate any help, thank u.
