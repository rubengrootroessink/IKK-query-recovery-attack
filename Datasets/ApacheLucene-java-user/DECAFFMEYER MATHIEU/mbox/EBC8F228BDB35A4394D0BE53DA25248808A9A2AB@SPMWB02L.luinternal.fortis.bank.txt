Yes it helps me understanding, thank u.
I make a BooleanQuery with the input of the user and include in the query
title:keywordofuser headlines:keywordofuser content:keywordofuser
I tried to Boost field title, then if keyword appear in the title, score grows like I want
to, but if keyword occurs in content or headlines score decrease more than before ...
I would like to have a score independent for each query in the BooleanQuery, sounds basic
but I just can't achieve this.
Is this also possible to change ?
Thank u.

>>Soren
The score is not one (0.3764683). If it should to be one you can 
normalize the score.
What do u mean by normalizing the score and how ?

Note also that the scores in an Explanation are the "raw" scores ... if
you use Hits, the scores are "partially normalized" meaning that if the
highest scoring document has a score greater then 1, all scores are
devided by the highest score.

: Simple speaking, the score depends of the query, the matched document
: and the index. The influence of the index is represented by the idf
: (inverse document frequency).

: Look at:
: http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html
: http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html

: If you would like to get a score independent of the index you should
: override the idf function by sup-classing the Similarity class
: (DefaultSimilarity) and return always 1.
