do something like this:
public class Index extends IndexModifier { ...
 
 public int deleteDocuments(String field, String value) throws
IOException {
        return super.deleteDocuments(new Term(field, value));
    }
 
use like this :
index.deleteDocuments(filed name, field value);

	Hi, 

	I have a list of filenames like 
	Corporate.htm 
	Logistics.htm 
	Merchant.htm 
	.... 
	that need to be deleted. 

	For now on I  give this list to my Search application that reads
the idnex and give the results, and if the path contains one of the
filenames, I don't display this hit ... Not really proper programming
...

	Is there a way to delete the document in the index instead with
this information ? 

	Thank u.
