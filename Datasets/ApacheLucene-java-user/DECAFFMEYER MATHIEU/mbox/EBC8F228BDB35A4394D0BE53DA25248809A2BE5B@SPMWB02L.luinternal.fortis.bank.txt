SUBJECT: setBoost on Field
DATE: 30 Mar 2007

Hi,

I am parsing this file called Logistics.htm
I have a field named "headlines" that contains word "clients" among others.

When I don't put a boost on this field, I have as score 0.06 when searching for clients.
Then when I put a boost of "10", I have a score of 0.21
Yet I was expecting a score of 0.60

Could anyone clarify this behaviour to me ?
Thank u for any help.
