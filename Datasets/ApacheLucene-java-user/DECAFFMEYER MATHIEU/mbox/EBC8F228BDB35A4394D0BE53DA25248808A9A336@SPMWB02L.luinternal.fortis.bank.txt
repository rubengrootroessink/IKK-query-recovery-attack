SUBJECT: Adding headlines, path
DATE: 2 Feb 2007

Hi all,

I have simple questions for which I can't find an answer by googling :

1)
I want to add headlines for a document :

Field headlinesField = new Field("headlines", headlines,
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED);

But how do I separate the headlines between them ?

Let's say I want to add :
Strengths
Our clients
Solutions & service

Do I need to put a white space between them or a newline, ... ?

2)

What is the difference between the field path and the field url ?

url I guess is the url of the document as http://.......
but what is the field path ?


Thank u for any help !
