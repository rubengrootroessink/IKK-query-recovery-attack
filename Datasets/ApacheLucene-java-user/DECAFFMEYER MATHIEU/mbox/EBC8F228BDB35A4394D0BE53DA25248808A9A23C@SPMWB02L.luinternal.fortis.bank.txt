Actually I am using Regain over Lucene for URL indexing.
And Regain uses in its last stable release Lucene 1.4.3

When I index the whole website, then when I type a title of a document I
have like 60 to 70 % as score.
When I index only one page, then when I type the title I have like 2% as
score.

It is very annoying for me since I have, for some reasons, to index all
the pages separetely.

That's why I am looking through the code of Regain, I will paste some
more code except if someone of you has an idea of this behaviour with
this explanation ...

Thank u for any further help.

What version of Lucene are you using? 2.0 doesn't have a doc.add like
that.
You'd do something like
doc.add(new Field("title", title, Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.TOKENIZED);

So I really don't understand what you're trying to do. Nor do I
understand
what "2%" means in this context....

But there are two things you should be aware of.
1> the analyzer you use when you create your index AND when you query
your
index should be the same, at least when you start. There are reasons why
you
might want to use different ones, but certainly not when you are
starting.
Otherwise you, say, index something and it's automatically folded into
lowercase (StandardAnalyzer certainly does this) but your query could be
uppercase if you use, say SimpleAnalyzer for the query phase.

2> get Luke (google lucene luke). It allows you to examine your index
and
see what's actually in it. Otherwise you're flying blind. It also allows
you
to enter queries manually (see Lucene In Action for lucene's query
syntax).
Really, really get Luke. It'll make your life much easier.

You probably want to post bigger snippets of actual code for folks to
look
at, since one line of code and "it doesn't work" don't give us much to
go on
