FROM: "DECAFFMEYER MATHIEU" <MATHIEU.DECAFFMA...@fortis.lu>
SUBJECT: Boost
DATE: 31 Jan 2007

Just as a test I tried this :

Field contentField = 
    new Field(
        "content", cleanedContent, 
        Field.Store.NO, 
        Field.Index.TOKENIZED);

contentField.setBoost(100);      
doc.add(contentField);

In my document I have the word "experience",
when I do a search on this word I keep having a score of a bit more than
0.

Why is my boost not working ?

Thank u.
