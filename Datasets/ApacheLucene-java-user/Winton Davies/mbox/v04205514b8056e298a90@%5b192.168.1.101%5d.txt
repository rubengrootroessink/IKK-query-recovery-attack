SUBJECT: Querying an exact string match ?
DATE: 31 Oct 2001

Hi,

  I have a field which I need to match exactly -- Ideally it shouldn't 
even be tokenized, but I can't find a way to do that -- adding a 
field that is indexed but not tokenized, doesn't seem to work -- or 
at least a Term Query doesn't work.

  eg the field is "x y z" -- and I do a phrase query "x y" it should 
not match -- just "x y z" should match.
 
Cheers,
  Winton
