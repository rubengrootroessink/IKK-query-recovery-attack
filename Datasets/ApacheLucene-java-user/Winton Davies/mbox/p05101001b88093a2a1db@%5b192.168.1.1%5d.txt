Joe,

  Put the data to be returned in a single field, and ideally in a 
static final array in memory. Get Lucene to return a simple key (or 
better yet use the internal Doc ID). Retrieval should be fast. Also, 
make sure you aren't retrieving too many hits (the hit collector is 
differently optimized for diferent query types).

Network shouldn't be too much of an issue (just establish a base line 
load with a static page serve).

Cheers,
  Winton
