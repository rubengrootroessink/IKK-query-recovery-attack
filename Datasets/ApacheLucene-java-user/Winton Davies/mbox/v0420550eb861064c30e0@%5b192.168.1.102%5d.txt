Hi,
 
  We're (Overture/Goto) evaluating Lucene ... email me specific questions.

  In general I would say Lucene is very efficient. It is only about 
30% slower than Thunderstone Texis
  (which is a native C code base). Main difference is that Lucene 
doesn't handle Caching as well as
  Texis does.

  Basically the Index is on Disk or in RAM (ie can take up 400-500 MB 
in our application).  Texis for example
  is able to buffer what it can of the Index in memory without 
explicit setting of memory limits.
 
  Out of the box we couldn't use Phrase Matching for very high volume 
transactions (we're looking at 1000s queries/sec)
  and had to customize it to your needs, but because its Open Source, 
guess what, you can write any kind
  of optimizations you want. Actually that isn't fair --  just be 
careful that you understand the performance
  parameters involved in text retrieval and the various types of 
querys that are possible. Do you need Text Retrieval
  or Are you doing an unranked "Text Search" ?


  Oh, and its free :)

  Reliable ? Well I've never had a problem someone couldnt answer, and 
it never crashes (ie its pretty bug-free
  as far as I can tell).
 
  Cheers,
   Winton
