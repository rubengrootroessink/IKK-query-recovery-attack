Hi again....

  Another dumb question :) (actually I'm too busy to look at the code :) )

   In the index, is the datastructure of termDocs (is that the right 
term), sorted by anything? Or is it just insertion order ? I could 
see how one might want to sort by the Doc with the highest term 
frequency  ? But I can also see why
it might not help.

  e.g.   Token1 -> doc1 (2) [occurences] -> doc2 (6) -> doc3 (3)

  or is it like this ?

         Token1 -> doc2 (6) -> doc3 (3) -> doc1 (2) ?

 
  I have an idea for an optimization I want to make, but I'm not sure 
exactly whether it is warrants investigation.

  Winton
