Hi Otis and Doug,

  Many thanks for your comments before, sorry I was unable to deal 
with it, I was under time-pressure for results :)

  I'm still hitting the 2Gb limit though -- and I'm on a solaris box 
with supposedly big files enabled. I'm using Java 1.2 -- could this 
be the problem ?
 
  I adopted Doug's version, of setting the maxMergeDocuments and 
mergeFactor. However, optimize() still wanted to create one big file 
(I think this was the cause). Is there anyway to semi-optimize :-) ?


Cheers,
  Winton
