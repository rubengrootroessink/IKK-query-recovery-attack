SUBJECT: Phrase (and other) scoring?
DATE: 1 Nov 2001

Hi,

So my manager asked an intersting question -- is the score of a 
phrase search normalised or not ?

Lets imagine I have queried

"Deer Hunter" /SLOP = 2

and there is just one document with:

"Deer and Duck Hunter"

Now, this comes back with a relevance of 1.0 -- however it clearly is 
and isn't at the same time. It is the ONLY document that matches, so 
there can be nothing else relevant, so it is the most relevant with a 
score of 1.0 However, there was an edit distance of 2 -- so it isn't 
exactly a match to the query :)

  Can anyone help me -- in particular is there a way of find out a raw 
score, if normalisation takes place ?

 
Cheers,
  Winton
