Hi,

  Is the nightly build compiled Optimized ? if not, has anyone ever 
tried compiling Optimized, and using that ? Does it help improve 
performance ? It would seem to me that given the compute intensive 
nature of querying, that even slightly improved compilations would 
speed things up ?

  Cheers,
   Winton
