Hi,

  I was wondering why reader.document(i) is relatively slow ? Given 
that it is, perhaps could anyone tell me if this would be work?
  I'm currently trying to create a fast lookup, and the reader.doc(i) 
is quite slow.

   Question -- could I create this an array in the insertion order at 
Indexing (assuming no adds/deletes?)

   int i = 0;
 
   for i from 1 to number of X's
   add x to index;
   xarray[i] = x;
 
   ....

 
  Now, in HitCollector, I could simply refer to xarray[i] ?


  Another question -- HitCollector -- Is there anyway for the 
HitCollector to say to end the search ? I'm not quite sure how it is 
used, but it seems that Hits and HitCollector don't work the same way 
?

  Cheers,
   Winton
