Whoops, must think before I write...

I think this is *good* for me.

Let's say I have a default sort property I want to have:

If I only do a one-time Index, if I sort the input documents in the 
order I want before indexing, then the results will come out in that 
sort order -- assuming I implement my own hit collector (basically 
just ignore the score...)
