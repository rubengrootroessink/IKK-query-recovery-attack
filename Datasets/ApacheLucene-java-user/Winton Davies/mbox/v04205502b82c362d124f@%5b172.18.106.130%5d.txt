Hi Doug,
 
  Thank you again for your wisdom. Yep, we'll probably be running on a 
quad E420 or two.

  I think that I'll get better performance with one virtual searcher, 
spread over 4 CPU's (and < 1 GB ram each) rather than 4 monolithics 
searchers each with its own index (actually I don't think I could get 
4 on the machine --- the index is nearly a Gig each).

  Winton
