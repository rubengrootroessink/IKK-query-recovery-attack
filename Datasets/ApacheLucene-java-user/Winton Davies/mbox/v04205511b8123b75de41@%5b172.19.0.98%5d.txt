SUBJECT: Large-files redeux, Sorting and Uniqifying results.
DATE: 10 Nov 2001

Hi again,

offtopic -- Java 1.3 allowed me to optimize to a single 6GB 
segment... :-) yah -- needed Solaris largefile support though. 
However, I'm now fighting a problem when I try to open a searcher :-( 
StackTrace later!


ok, So I have a bunch of results -- I'd like to uniqify them (I can 
only return one document per document owner -- a document owner may 
have several versions), and then sort them according to another 
criteria other than score (eg alphabetically by owners name).

  Any guesses other than extracting the whole set and then processing 
:) I looked at HitCollector, but it says DO NOT CALL Searcher.Doc(i), 
which is what I would need to get the owners name... ?

  Any ideas ?

  Cheers,
  Winton
