Apologies  for the misleading quote, but you got the right syntax in 
the end it would seem.
I believe that the add(x,false,false) is just what you need for OR...

The Unary version is kind of ok -- OR is at least one member of a set 
present... the set of size one is still a set, it just happens to 
co-incide with the case of AND which is all of them members of a set. 
2 and more members of a set are obvious. As Doug pointed out OR isn't 
a binary operator (or teriary and so on) (although though it is a 
Boolean operator :) )

Cheers and sorry again for confusing the issue :)
