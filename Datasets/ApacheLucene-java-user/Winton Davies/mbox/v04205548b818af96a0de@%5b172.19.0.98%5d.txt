Hi Eliot,

  Not really, all documents have an accountID, but I need to search 
all the documents
first, and each document that is returned has an accountID, but I 
just want one document
per accountID.

so:

  doc1 acc1
  doc2 acc1
  doc3 acc1
  doc4 acc2
  doc5 acc2
  doc6 acc2

Lets say the query "X" returns hits in this order:

  doc1
  doc2
  doc3
  doc4
  doc5

what I want returned is:

  doc1  (best of acc1)
  doc4  (best of acc2)

Note that creating a seperate Index for each account is impractical 
(30K+ accountID).

  Cheers,
   Winton
