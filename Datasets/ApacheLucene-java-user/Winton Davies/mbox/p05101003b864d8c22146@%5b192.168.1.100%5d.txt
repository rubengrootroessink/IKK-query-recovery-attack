Oh, one final thing, try different JVMs. I've found the best so far 
(short of going to the bleeding edge of 1.4) is the 1.3.1_10 jvm. 
This is Hotspot, and supports the -server option, as well as very 
sophisticated GC controls.

It does make a difference against 1.2 and 1.3 previous versions.

Cheers,
  Winton
