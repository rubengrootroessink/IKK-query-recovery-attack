SUBJECT: RAMdirectory from Directory ?
DATE: 14 Nov 2001

Hi,
 
  I've an index that should fit in RAM -- but I need it stored as a 
file. Is there anyway to read in the regular directory in the the 
RAMDirectory and then create an IndexSearcher from this ? It seems 
that there should be, but I can't find a method to construct a 
RAMDirectory from a regular Directory ?

Cheers,
  Winton
