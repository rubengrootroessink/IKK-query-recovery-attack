Found what the problem is! The mole turn out to be QueryParser.

I wrote a simple test program that creates a document with a bunch of fields 
and data then query against the index.

QueryParser changes the term that I entered ie:

Query: 1@1
Searching for: "1 1"

Query: 1@1.1
Searching for: 1@1.1

Query: <1@1.1>
Searching for: 1@1.1


As you can see 1@1 -> 1 1, <1@1.1> -> 1@1.1

Arggh ... no wonder searching based on the message id does not work. 
QueryParser strips the < and > from my query. grr grr.....

Anyway after a nano-second of soul searching I can see why query parser does 
this. Seems to me like I have to construct my own query.
