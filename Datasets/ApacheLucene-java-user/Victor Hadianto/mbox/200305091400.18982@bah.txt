Yes we do have a unique field to identify the document, so I can check if 
there are two documents with the same id in the result set then they are 
duplicates and just return the unique documents. This may work.

The only issues here is when the number of "workers" increase the number of 
duplicates increase as well. Having said that, we probably won't have more 
than 16 workers anyway.

Hmm unfortunately this won't work because of the nature of the system. Each 
worker doesn't know what the other are working and there is no single entity 
that control the distribution of works to the worker. To make thing 
complicated each worker can be doing different stage (not only doing Lucene 
indexing).
