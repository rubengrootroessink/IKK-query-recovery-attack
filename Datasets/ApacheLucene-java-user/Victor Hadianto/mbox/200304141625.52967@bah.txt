Hi all,

What I'm trying to do is exactly the same with this discussion:

http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=&msgId=117093

Basically I want to know from my search terms which one that found a specific 
documents. For example

Search: apple OR orange OR banana

Found:

Doc1: apple orange
Doc2: orange
Doc3: apple banana

There is a reply from Dmitry:
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=&msgId=117102

Hinting that this can be done. However I couldn't find any other reference 
about doing this. 

Can this be done? Does anyone has anyone pointer about where I need to look?

thanks,

victor
