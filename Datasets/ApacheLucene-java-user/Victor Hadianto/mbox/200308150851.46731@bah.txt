This is what I would do. If you are not going to have large value in this 
field, and you don't need it for later display (ie for UnStored field) then 
put all the variant name in the "Name" field. This will be the easiest to do 
and you don't have to "or"s a lot of field (or use multi field query) later.

Also you can do: 
doc.add(Field.UnStored("Name", "BMG"));
doc.add(Field.UnStored("Name", "Berstelsmann Music Group"));

and that will be the same with:
doc.add(Field.UnStored("Name", "BMG Berstelsmann Music Group"));
