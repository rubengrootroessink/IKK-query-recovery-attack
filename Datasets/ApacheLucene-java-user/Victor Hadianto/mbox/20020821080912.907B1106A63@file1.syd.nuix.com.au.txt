SUBJECT: Modifying document with unstored fields
DATE: 21 Aug 2002

Hi,

We have a situation where we have a large collection of documents, which 
consist of both stored and unstored fields, and we'd like to add/modify a 
stored field on an existing document.

It seems the only way this can be achieved is to delete the document, and 
then re-create it. However, this will only perserve stored fields, the 
unstored field information will be lost.  

In our application, the unstored fields consist of very large data, and it 
would not be desirable to store them.

Are there any ways in getting around this problem?  Thanks.
