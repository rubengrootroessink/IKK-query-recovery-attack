I've been looking at QueryParser.jj and does the following modification:

I modified QueryParser to take 2 analyzer, 1 is the normal analyzer that drops 
all the stop words from the query, and the second analyzer will not drop any 
word from the token.

And in QueryParser.jj I modified the following:

     | term=<QUOTED>
       [ slop=<SLOP> ]
       [ <CARAT> boost=<NUMBER> ]
       {
	// If quoteAnalyzer is not null use the quoteAnalyzer 
         if (quoteAnalyzer == null)
         {
            q = getFieldQuery(field, analyzer,
                              term.image.substring(1, term.image.length()-1));
         }
         else
         {
            q = getFieldQuery(field, quoteAnalyzer,
                              term.image.substring(1, term.image.length()-1));
         }

Yes again the drawback is that I have to use the analyzer that does not drop 
all those words from the search and thus they are indexed. This will grow our 
index to probably a huge amount, but unfortunately this is our requirement 
that we need to be able to search something like

"apple and orange"

or 

"apple for tomato"

Thanks for the reply.
