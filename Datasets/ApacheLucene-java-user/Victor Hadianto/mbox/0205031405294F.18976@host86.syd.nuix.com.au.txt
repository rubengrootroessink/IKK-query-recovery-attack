SUBJECT: Number of occurence from word query.
DATE: 3 May 2002


Hi all,

Is there a way to found out the number of times a word is found in the query? 
For example if I search for: Java Programmers

Not only I want to retrieve the list of documents that matches, I also 
wanted, within that search result, the count of Java and Programmers.

Is it possible to do this with Lucene? Or do I have do a bit of changes in 
the code. If this so could someone kindly point me to the area? Currently I'm 
still reading source code to further understand how it works.

Cheers,
