I've looked at the code and need a bit of help. I've traced the code up to 
SegmentTermDocs.seek(Term).

If I'm not mistaken is this where my "search" logic is executed? But I'm lost 
straight away after that onn in the TermInfosReader.get(). I have a feeling 
that I have overlooked the place where the actual searching is done. Or 
perhaps i'm just totally off the way here :D

any hints?
