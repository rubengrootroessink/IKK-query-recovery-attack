If you have a unique identifier in your document you can index that id in a 
Field. Thus when you upload a new file you can check the index for this 
identifier. The search result should only contains 1 hit, you can delete this 
doc and add a new one.

I'm not sure what other solution is there if you don't have a unique id per 
document.
