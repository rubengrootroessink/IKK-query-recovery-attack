It's not jibberish, it's how Lucene indexes the date field. Internally Lucene 
works only with string, thus Lucene needs to convert any date values into a 
string value that can be compared properly, so 1st Jan 2000 will always be 
smaller than 2nd Jan 2000.

That at least how I understand Lucene to work, someone please correct me if 
I'm wrong.
