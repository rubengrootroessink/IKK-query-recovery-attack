SUBJECT: Max Field size.
DATE: 13 Aug 2003

Hi All,

Is there a maximum field size in Lucene? I found that by having a really big 
String as a field in a document, I couldn't search the tokens that exist in 
the end of the document.

I'm stumped, I've never read anywhere in the documentation that there is such 
limit in Field. Am I the only one having the problem here?



Regards,

Victor Hadianto
