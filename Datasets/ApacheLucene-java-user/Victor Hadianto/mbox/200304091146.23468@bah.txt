SUBJECT: Searching greater/less than using Lucene
DATE: 9 Apr 2003

Hi,

I'm haven't touch Lucene for ages and now revisiting it back, so please bear 
with me. The following is my problem.

I am indexing a bunch of emails and part of the field that I index in the 
document is the message size. We adjusted the size and padded with leading 
zeroes to normalised the number.

Currently we implemented the search for greater than and less than as a 
filter. 

Now the requirement has been changed that we need to include the message size 
as search parameter, for example:

From: victorh@nuix.com.au OR message size > 10K

First thing come to me is I have to run the query twice first as "From: 
victorh@nuix.com.au" and do another query to search ALL emails, filter the 
bunch and union the results, but this, admitedly, ugly and inefficient.

I'm stumped, does anyone has any idea/suggestions how should I tackle this 
particular issue. 


Cheers,
