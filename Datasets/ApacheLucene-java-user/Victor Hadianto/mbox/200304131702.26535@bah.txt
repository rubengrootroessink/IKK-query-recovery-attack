SUBJECT: QueryParser with stop/key words inside quotes
DATE: 13 Apr 2003


Lucene's QueryParsers seems to drop stop/key words even if they are enclosed 
in double quotes.

For example:

apple for tomato
--> +apple +tomato

Which is what I expected, however

"apple for tomato"
--> "apple tomato"

and "for" in between apple and tomato is conveniently dropped.

Is there a way to tell QueryParser not to drop those words if they are 
enclosed in double quotes?

Thanks,

victor
