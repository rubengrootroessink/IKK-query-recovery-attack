Hmm not quite my problem here.

OK ..  let me try again ...

basically I have a field in the document which I derive from the message id 
of an email, they look like:

<02052309340801.18525@host86.syd.nuix.com.au>
<818623B5FD23D51193200002B32C076103A15698@excsrv44.mayo.edu>
<3D044FA2@mail.totalise.co.uk>

The problem is that I couldn't search Lucene using this field. If I store 
this field as Text I can search and find the document but I couldn't delete 
it using the following:

indexReader.delete(new Term("id", "<3D044FA2@mail.totalise.co.uk>");

This will return 0.

If I store the id as a keyword, I couldn't even search the field.
