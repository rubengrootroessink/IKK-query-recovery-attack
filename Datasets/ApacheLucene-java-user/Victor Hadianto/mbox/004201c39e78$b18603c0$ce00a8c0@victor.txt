SUBJECT: Term out of order.

Hi all,

I'm using Lucene.Net but seems appropriate to post here as well. I have been
getting this exception "Term out of order" every now and then while doing a
bulk indexing.

I have been searching on the mailing list for this specific issue, but none
to avail. Does this occur on the Java version of Lucene?

thanks

/victor
