Another solution is to use Microsoft Office itself. You can setup a server 
that serve request to convert Microsoft Office doc. There are many ways of 
doing this, for example using Python to directly call Office then put your 
python script in a webserver.

Or you can set a .Net conversion server and you can call this .Net service 
using a Web Service, and many other interesting technique.
