I believe there is no easy way to do this. I had to implement a similar 
functionality by adding explainTerm() method on Weight interface. The 
implementation is, unfotunately, pretty horrendous by using the Explanation 
API. 

This achieve my purpose to explain what term matches given a query and given a 
document, from this list of terms you can then retrieve the field names.
