Ispecifically use the toString() method to create the string representation of 
the query and store them in the database. In the future, user can browse 
through the list of queries that she/he has run and re-execute them. 

I found exactly the same problem with Aviran and I had to create a RangeQuery 
wrapper object that translate the toString() method correctly to be parsed by 
QueryParser again.
