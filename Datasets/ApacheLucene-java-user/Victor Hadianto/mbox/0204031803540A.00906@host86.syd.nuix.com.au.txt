Hi list,

I'm having problem compiling lucene from scratch. I checkout lucene 1.2 rc4 
from cvs and I am missing one vital component JavaCC 2.0

The latest javaCC that I can get from webgain is 2.1 and just dropping the 
thing to lucene/lib directory does not work quite well, I had a look and the 
class name expected by lucene build file is quite different from JavaCC 2.1

Is there someplace where I can get JavaCC 2.0 that works with lucene? 

Thanks,
