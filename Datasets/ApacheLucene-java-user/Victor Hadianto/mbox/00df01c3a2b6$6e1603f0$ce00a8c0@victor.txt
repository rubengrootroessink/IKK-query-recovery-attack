DATE: 4 Nov 2003

Hi all,

I'm interested to know have big of Lucene index/documents that you have
experienced with? We are trying to index in the mark of 300 million text
documents. Each document will be quite small around 10kb ish.

Any insight about the scalability of Lucene with this many documents?
Creating the index and searching?

thanks,

/victor
