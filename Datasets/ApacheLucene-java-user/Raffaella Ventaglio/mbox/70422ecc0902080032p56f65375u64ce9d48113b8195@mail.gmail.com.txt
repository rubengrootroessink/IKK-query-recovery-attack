Thanks for your answer, I did not know about FieldCache.
However, I think I cannot use it to solve my problem because, as I said in
my previous post, a lot of my "facets" are not related to a "value" on a
single field, but can be configured by the user by writing a complex boolean
query.

And this is also the reason why I think I cannot use Solr to implement this
kind of faceted search.

Our Eden memory size is already very big, but it is not sufficient and, in
any case, this solution would not be very scalable.
I was also thinking about creating a "pool" of OpenBitSet to reuse, but
before to implement this I thought to look if there were already a better
solution I was not aware of.

Thanks,
