Thanks for sharing this info.
In any case, this is not a problem for me since I have used only the "idea"
to choose between OpenBitSet and SortedViIntList from contrib BooleanFilter,
but I have then implemented it in my own facets manager structure, so I do
not use the "removed" finalResult method.

Regards,
Raf
