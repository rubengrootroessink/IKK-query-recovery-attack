I am sorry, but I cannot understand: how can I create a BooleanFilter or a
ChainedFilter starting from two SortedVIntList objects?
I have not found any filter that takes an existing "DocIdSet" in its
constructor...

However I have seen that Filter interface is very easy to implement.
Should I create a custom Filter that wraps my SortedVIntList and than use
these filters to create a BooleanFilter?

Thanks,
Raf
