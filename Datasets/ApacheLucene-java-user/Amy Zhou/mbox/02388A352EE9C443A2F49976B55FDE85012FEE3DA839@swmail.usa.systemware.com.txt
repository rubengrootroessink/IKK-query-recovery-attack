SUBJECT: index large size file
DATE: 10 Mar 2009

Hi,

I'm having a couple of questions about indexing large size file. As my understanding, the
default MaxFieldLength 100,000. In Lucene 2.4, we can set the MaxFieldLength during constructor.
My questions are:

1) How's the performance if MaxFieldLength is set to UNLIMITED?
2) Any other options for indexing large size file?


Thx,

Amy
