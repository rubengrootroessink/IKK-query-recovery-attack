DATE: 10 Mar 2009

My issue here is that large file is truncated with default MaxFieldLength 10,000 during indexing.
The file size I index could be 10mb or larger. 

My questions are:

1) If I chose MaxFieldLength as UNLIMITED instead of 100,000, what the performance could be?
2) Any other options?

the default MaxFieldLength 100,000. In Lucene 2.4, we can set the MaxFieldLength during constructor.

It depends on how long your documents are. Its simply a cutoff - 
documents longer than n (10,000 by default) terms will be truncated.

What is the problem you are trying to address? Are you having trouble 
indexing a very large file? Can you share more details?
