SUBJECT: Using Lucene 2.3.0 with PDFBox
DATE: 13 Feb 2008

Hey

I am having problem using PDF Box for parsing the PDF and coverting
them to Lucene Document using the following statement.

Document doc = LucenePDFDocument.getDocument( file );

PDF Box uses a particular function of the Object 'Field' which is only
there in the lucene 1.4.3.
                 *Field.UnIndexed("path", file.getPath() )
In subsequent versions it has been removed. Kindly suggest a solution
for the PDF Box integration with lucene 2.3.0

Thanks

Naman K Gupta
