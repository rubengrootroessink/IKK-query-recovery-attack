SUBJECT: SpanNearQuery with repeated term?
DATE: 1 Apr 2011

I am having some issues with SpanNearQuery:

SpanQuery[] clauses = new SpanTermQuery[2];
Clauses[0] = new SpanTermQuery("text","aaaa");
Clauses[1] = new SpanTermQuery("text","bbbb");
SpanNearQuery q = new SpanNearQuery(clauses,0,true); // returns 1
document with "aaaa bbbb" in it

SpanQuery[] clauses = new SpanTermQuery[2];
Clauses[0] = new SpanTermQuery("text","aaaa");
Clauses[1] = new SpanTermQuery("text","aaaa");
SpanNearQuery q = new SpanNearQuery(clauses,0,true); // returns 2
documents ( "aaaa bbbb" and "aaaa aaaa") 

This second bit of code returns the document with "aaaa bbbb" in it,
Why doesn't SpanNearQuery discard that one and only return me the one
I've asked for?

Thanks

Greg
