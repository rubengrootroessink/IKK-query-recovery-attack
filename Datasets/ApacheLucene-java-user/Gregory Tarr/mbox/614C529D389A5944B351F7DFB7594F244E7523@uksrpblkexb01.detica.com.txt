SUBJECT: Index doubling in size when adding extra terms
DATE: 15 Jul 2009

I have added a new field to each document in my index containing
substrings of another field to speed up initial-wildcard searches.

Each document has a field "text" which might contain "the quick brown
fox jumped over the lazy dogs"
The new field - "text_substrings" would then contain "the quick uick ick
brown rown own fox jumped umped mped ped over ver the lazy azy dogs ogs"

This allows me to convert initial wildcard queries "*own" into a term
query "own".

However adding this field has exactly doubled the size of the index.
Given that the term list is a small fraction of the index (?), I find
this strange. I think it might be storing the documents twice.

Is there any way to stop this from happening?

Thanks

Greg Tarr
