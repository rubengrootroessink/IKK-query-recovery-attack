Chris, and others

Thanks for your reply. In effect what you are saying is that
SpanNearQuery works as expected, and I should set inOrder=true to obtain
the behaviour I require, even though I don't care about the order?

Thanks

Greg

: I attach a junit test which shows strange behaviour of the inOrder
: parameter on the SpanNearQuery constructor, using Lucene 2.9.4.
: 
: My understanding of this parameter is that true forces the order and
: false doesn't care about the order. 
: 
: Using true always works. However using false works fine when the terms
: in the query are distinct, but if they are equivalent, e.g. searching
: for "john john", I do not get the expected results. The workaround
seems
: to be to always use true for queries with repeated terms.

I don't think the situation of "overlapping spans" has changed much
since this thread...

http://search.lucidimagination.com/search/document/ee23395e5a93c525/non_
overlapping_span_queries#868b3a3ec6431afc

the crux of hte issue (as i recall) is that there is really no
conecptual reason to why a query for "'john' near 'john', in any order,
with slop of Z" shouldn't match a doc that contains only one instance of
"john" ... the first SpanTermQuery says "i found a match at position X"
the second SpanTermQuery says "i found a match at position Y" and the
SpanNearQuery says "the differnece between X and Y is less then Z"
therefore i have a match.  (The SpanNearQuery can't fail just because X
and Y are the same -- they might be two distinct term instances, with
differnet payloads perhaps, that just happen to have the same position).

However: if true==inOrder case works because the SpanNearQuery enforces
that  "X must be less then Y" so the same term can't ever match twice.
