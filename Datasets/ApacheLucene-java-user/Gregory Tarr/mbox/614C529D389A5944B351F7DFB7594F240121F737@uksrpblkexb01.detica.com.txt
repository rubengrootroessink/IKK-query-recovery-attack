SUBJECT: SpanNearQuery - inOrder parameter
DATE: 9 May 2011

I attach a junit test which shows strange behaviour of the inOrder
parameter on the SpanNearQuery constructor, using Lucene 2.9.4.

My understanding of this parameter is that true forces the order and
false doesn't care about the order.

Using true always works. However using false works fine when the terms
in the query are distinct, but if they are equivalent, e.g. searching
for "john john", I do not get the expected results. The workaround seems
to be to always use true for queries with repeated terms.

Any help?

Thanks

Greg
