SUBJECT: How to influence the score in lucene 2.9
DATE: 12 May 2010

How easy is it to influence the score of search results in lucene 2.9?

The situation is that we have a large number of dated documents that
match the term "john" but we want to return the latest documents when
"john" is the search term.

My solution to this would be to override the score such that the score
is the number of days since 01/01/1970, the latest documents therefore
scoring the highest.

How is this possible in the lucene API?

Thanks

Greg
