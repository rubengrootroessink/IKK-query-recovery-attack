SUBJECT: Closing and reopening readers
DATE: 30 Jul 2010

I'm having trouble with the IndexReader class as per below: (using
lucene 2.9.1)

RAMDirectory dir = new RAMDirectory();
createIndex(dir);
IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(dir);
IndexReader reader2 = reader.reopen();
reader.close();
reader2.terms(); // AlreadyClosedException - this IndexReader is closed

Can anyone see where I'm going wrong?

Thanks

Greg
