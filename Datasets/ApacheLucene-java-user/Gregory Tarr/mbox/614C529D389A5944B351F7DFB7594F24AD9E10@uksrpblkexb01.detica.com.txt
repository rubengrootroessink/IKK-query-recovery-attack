SUBJECT: Unsupported operation in DocIdSetIterator using lucene 2.9
DATE: 12 May 2010

I am using lucene 2.9 and I can't understand why a succession of
un-deprecated methods calls a deprecated method in this class.
The series of calls is as follows:

Searcher.search(Query, Collector)
IndexSearcher.search(Weight, Filter, Collector)
Scorer.score(Collector)
DocIdSetIterator.nextDoc()
DocIdSetIterator.next()

The javadocs for next() say that you should call nextDoc() but yet the
nextDoc() method calls next()!

I understand it is changing in 3.0, but can this be made to work in 2.9
without editing the code?

Many thanks,

Greg Tarr
