Sorry, I have got this working now. It was a silly mistake.

Sorry I am using 2.9.4, which is the same as 3.0.3?

The code below demonstrates the problem. 

Thanks

Greg

I can't reproduce this using lucene-core-3.0.3.jar.  You don't say what
version you are using.  Why don't you post the smallest possible
complete standalone program or test case that demonstrates the problem.
And tell us what version of lucene you are working with.
Always.
