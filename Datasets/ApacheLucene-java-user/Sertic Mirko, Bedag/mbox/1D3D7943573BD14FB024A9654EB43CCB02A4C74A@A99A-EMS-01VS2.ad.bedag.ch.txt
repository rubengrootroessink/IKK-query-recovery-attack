Hi@all

 

I am searching for a solution to make the Highlighter run property in
combination with phrase queries.

 

I want to highlight text with a phrase query like "windows printserver",
the following highlighted:

 

"windows printservers" are good blah blah "windows" manages
"printserver" blah blah, so the phrases

and the single terms are highlighted, but I just want to highlight the
phrases. How could this be done?

 

Thanks in advance

 

Mirko
