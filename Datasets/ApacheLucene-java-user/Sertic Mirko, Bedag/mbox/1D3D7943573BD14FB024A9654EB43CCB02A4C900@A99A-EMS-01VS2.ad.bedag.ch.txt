SUBJECT: Fuzzy Query with german special characters
DATE: 6 Mar 2009

Hi@all

 

I'd like to do a fuzzy search with german special characters. For instance I want to query
for "müller", but also terms like "mueller" should be respected, as ü can also be written
as ue. How could this be done? At index creation time, I could convert ü to ue, and just
use the ue version for querying. But is there a better version available?

 

Thanks in advance

 

Mirko
