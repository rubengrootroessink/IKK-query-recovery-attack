SUBJECT: AW: Combine data from index and db before sorting and pagination
DATE: 1 Sep 2010

The data from db is required for sorting, and one db entry matches to many index entries, so
storing it in the index would be redundant. Also there would be the challenge to keep index
and db in sync. Any ideas?

If the sorting and pagination doesn't require data from the database,
just do db lookups for the hits on a page, page by page as required.
But if the db data is required I'd suggest storing it in the index.
