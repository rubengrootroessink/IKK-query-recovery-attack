SUBJECT: AW: Search with multiple wildcards
DATE: 10 Sep 2008

Hi

Thank you for your quick response:-)

Of course I need to use the * character :-) But I have read somewhere in the documentation
that leading wildcards are not supported, and only one wildcard term per query. Is this limitation
resolved in the current version?

Regards
Mirko

Sure, but you'll have to set the leading wildcard option,
which I've forgotten the exact call, but it's in the docs.

And use * rather than % <G>.

But wildcards are tricky, especially the TooManyClauses
exception. You might want to peruse the archive for wildcard
posts...

Best
