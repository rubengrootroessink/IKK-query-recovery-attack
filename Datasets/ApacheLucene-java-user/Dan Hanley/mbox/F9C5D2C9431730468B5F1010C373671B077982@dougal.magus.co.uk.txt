Hi Andy
This looks like a very useful MBean (quite a bit more developed than the one I was working
on). 

One quick query on the quickstart example though, when I run it I get the output twice:

Subject: Lucene MBean service for JBoss


Hi All,

For those that may be interested, I have written a full text indexing 
service for the JBoss application server that uses Lucene as its engine. It 
allows lucene to be used as a service rather than a standalone app with 
thread pooling, access synchronization, management etc. Index and search 
interfaces are accessable via JNDI and remotely via session EJB's.

Additionally I have provided content filters for common formats like HTML, 
MSWord, MSExcel, xml etc (with some help from other projects). A simple 
interface also allows you to write your own filters for different formats.

It is available under an LGPL license and source code, binaries and info 
are avaialble here:
http://ejindex.sourceforge.net

I'd love to get some feedback, so if your iterested, please let me know 
your comments or suggestions;)

regards,
Andy Scholz
