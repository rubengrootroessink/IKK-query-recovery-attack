This doesn't work either!

Lets concentrate on the first version of my code. I believe that the code should run endlesly
(I have said it before: in version 1.4 final it does).

I've seen this written up before (javaworld?) as a way to probably 
"force" GC instead of just a System.gc() call. I think the 2nd gc() call 
is supposed to clean up junk from the runFinalization() call...

System.gc();
Thread.sleep( 100);
System.runFinalization();
Thread.sleep( 100);
System.gc();
