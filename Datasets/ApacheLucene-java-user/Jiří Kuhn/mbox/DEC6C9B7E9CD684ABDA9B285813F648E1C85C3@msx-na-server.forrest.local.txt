Thanks for the bug's id, it seems like my problem and I have a stand-alone code with main().

What about slow garbage collector? This looks for me as wrong suggestion.

Let change the code once again:

...
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException
    {
        Directory directory = create_index();

        for (int i = 1; i < 100; i++) {
            System.err.println("loop " + i + ", index version: " + IndexReader.getCurrentVersion(directory));
            search_index(directory);
            add_to_index(directory, i);
            System.gc();
            Thread.sleep(1000);// whatever value you want
        }
    }
...

and in the 4th iteration java.lang.OutOfMemoryError appears again.

Jiri.

you can close the index, but the Garbage Collector still needs to 
reclaim the memory and it may be taking longer than your loop to do so.
