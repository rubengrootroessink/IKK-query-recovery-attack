SUBJECT: RE: IndexWriter and Directory create param
DATE: 10 Jun 2003

Hi Otis, Thanks for the reply.  

My DirectoryImpl is configurable in a config file so I dynamically
instantiate whatever's listed there. Because of the private constructor in
FSDir and the lack of getDirectory on the interface, I'm having to do :-

     try{
      //Make an FSDir if it's one of those....
      return (Directory)Class.forName(myDefaultDirectoryImpl)
          .getMethod("getDirectory", new Class[] {String.class,
boolean.class})
          .invoke(null, new Object[]{myDefaultIndex, new Boolean(false)});
      }catch(Exception ioe) {  }

Which I think is rather funky :-) but some would say not very clean....
Anyway adding a getDirectory to the Directory class would be rather neat
then I could use the above for all dirs - this doesn't work with RAMDir or
DBDir at the moment of course - and wrap the whole lot into a
DirectoryFactory+config.xml file.

On the other point, I've decided to go with creating the new index via the
writer - no real reason, just couldn't see why not :-)  


Bye

Les
