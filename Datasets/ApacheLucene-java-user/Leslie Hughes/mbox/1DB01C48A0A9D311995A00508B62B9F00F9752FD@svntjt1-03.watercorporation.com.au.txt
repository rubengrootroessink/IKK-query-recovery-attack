SUBJECT: Lowercasing wildcards - why?
DATE: 30 May 2003

Hi,

I was just wondering what the rationale is behind lowercasing wildcard
queries produced by QueryParser? It's just that my data is all upper case
and my analyser doesn't lowercase so it seems a bit odd that I have to call
setLowercaseWildcardTerms(false). Couldn't queryparser leave the terms
unnormalised or better still pass them through the analyser?

I'm sure there's a good reason for it though.....
