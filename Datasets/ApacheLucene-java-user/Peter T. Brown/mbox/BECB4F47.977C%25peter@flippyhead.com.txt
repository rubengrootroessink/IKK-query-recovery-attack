SUBJECT: Cannot search on plain numbers
DATE: 7 Jun 2005

Hello. I am using lucene 1.4.3

I am indexing a Java Long number using a Lucene Keyword field, but no matter
what I do, I cannot find any documents I know have been indexed with this
field. My logs show that the number "4" is being indexed as "4" but doing
any searches in that field for "4" return no hits.

Is there something special I need to do to index and search on fields that
contain ONLY numbers?


Thank You
