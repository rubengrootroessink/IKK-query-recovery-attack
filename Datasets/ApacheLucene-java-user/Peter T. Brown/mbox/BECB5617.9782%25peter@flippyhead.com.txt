Thank You. I've re-read the FAQ and I think I've got a better understanding
of how I am confused. Presently I am using this arrangement to get my
analyzer:

    public static class DefaultAnalyzer extends Analyzer {
        public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
            LetterTokenizer tokenizer = new LetterTokenizer(reader);
            TokenStream result = null;
            result = new LowerCaseFilter(tokenizer);
            result = new StopFilter(result,
StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS);
            result = new PorterStemFilter(result);


            return result;
        }
    } 


However, for reasons I do not yet understand, it filters out search on plain
numbers. How can I modify this to keep the benefits of the filters currently
in use but also search on plain numbers?


Thanks again
