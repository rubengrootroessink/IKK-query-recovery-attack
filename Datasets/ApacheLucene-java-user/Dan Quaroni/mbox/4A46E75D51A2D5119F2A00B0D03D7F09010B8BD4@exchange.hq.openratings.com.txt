SUBJECT: Will failed optimize corrupt an index?
DATE: 19 Aug 2003

My index grew about 7 gigs larger than I projected it would, and it ran out
of disk space during optimize.  Does lucene have transactions or anything
that would prevent this from corrupting an index, or do I need to generate
the index again?

Thanks!
