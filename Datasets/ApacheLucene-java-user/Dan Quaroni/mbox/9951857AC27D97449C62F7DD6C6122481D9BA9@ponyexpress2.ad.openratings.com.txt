SUBJECT: Wording on FAQ entry
DATE: 27 Oct 2005

Hi, I just wanted to check the wording on this FAQ entry to see if it means what it says, or
what I'd prefer it to mean.  The entry is:

"Is the IndexSearcher thread-safe?
Yes, IndexSearcher is thread-safe. Multiple search threads may access the index concurrently
without any problems. "

So, the part in question is "Multiple search threads may access the index concurrently"

However, I think the question is really asking "Can multiple threads access the same SEARCHER
at the same time?"
