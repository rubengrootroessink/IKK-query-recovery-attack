I've tried the IBM jre on a number of occassions and have always found that
it didn't behave the way the sun one does...  In the end I gave up on it.

Hi Folks,

I'm getting a FUTEX lock when I use the indexer with
IBMJava2-JRE-1.4.1-8 (the jre that comes with RedHat AS3)

Sun's 1.4 SDK works fine.

Best Regards,
John
