SUBJECT: Can't find record when I'm sure I should
DATE: 11 Oct 2005

I have a set of indexes containing business information (name, address, phone, etc).  There
are a couple particular companies that don't come up when people search for them.  I've used
our debugging app that allows lucene queries to be executed directly, and I have confirmed
this. 

I can find the company if I search for it in the debugging app either by its unique ID or
address, but when I search for it using query only on its exact name, it doesn't show up.
 

Any advice for how to debug this?

Thanks!
