I guess I was wrong, then...  But I have 262 indexes with a combined 130 or
so million documents and at times the memory usage for a single query
exceeds 1.3 gigs with me only taking the top 25 of the hits.  We pushed the
jvm to 1.6 gigs and it seems to be doing OK, but if it's not the results
from the sub-queries, what's taking up all the memory?

Second, while these must all be processed, they're not all in memory at 
once.  Posting lists are merged, so memory requirements are proportional 
to the number of terms in the query (one buffer per term).  So the issue 
is not memory, but compute time.
