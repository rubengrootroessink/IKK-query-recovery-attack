SUBJECT: Re: Order the index by timestamp field and Get n documents
DATE: 16 Nov 2008


Possibly the fastest way to do this is to use a sortable timestamp field
(e.g. padded long) and use a TermEnumerator, which always gives a
lexicographically-sorted enumeration. Since you'd probably prefer a "most
recent" policy you may need to come up with a reverse-timestamp scheme (e.g.
instead of zero-padded "milliseconds since epoch" you may prefer zero-padded
"milliseconds 'till year 3000" values).

Lucene doesn't handle this type of queries very efficiently, however, so you
may prefer an SQL database instead (or in addition).
