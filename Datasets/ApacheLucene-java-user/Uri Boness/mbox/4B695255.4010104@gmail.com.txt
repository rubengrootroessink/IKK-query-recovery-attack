SUBJECT: Lucene User Group Meetup in Amsterdam
DATE: 3 Feb 2010

Hi All,

On 17th February we'll host the first Dutch Lucene User Group Meetup. 
This meet-up will be split into two parts:

- The first part will be dedicated to the user group itself. We'll have 
an introduction to the members and have an open discussion about the 
goals of the user group and the expectations from it.

- In the second part, Anne Veling (http://www.beyondtrees.com) will give 
a session about his latest experiences with large scale Solr deployments.

Of course, you will not only get food for thought, but also food for you 
stomach - we'll have a pizza break between the parts and of course beer 
during & after.

Date:             17th February 2010
Time:             17:00
Location:       Frederiksplein 1
