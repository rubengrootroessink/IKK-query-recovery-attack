SUBJECT: Announcing Dutch Lucene User Group
DATE: 27 Aug 2009

Hi,

We started a new Lucene user group in The Netherlands. In the last 
couple of years we've notice an increasing demand and interest in Lucene 
and Solr. We thought it's about time to have a centralize place where 
people can have open discussions, trainings, and periodic meet-ups to 
share knowledge and experience with relation to these technologies. The 
website is up and running and you're welcome to register (even if you're 
not living in The Netherlands - the content is in English :-)). Check 
out: http://www.lucene-nl.org

Cheers,
Uri
