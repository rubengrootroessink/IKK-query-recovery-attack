SUBJECT: Span Query on different fields
DATE: 18 Sep 2007


Hello,
I have an index with tree fields (field1, field2,field3).
I have to do an or-query and get term positions within a document.
So I'm using span query but I have a problem because
with spans I can't write
...
SpanTermQuery field1 = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("field1", "hello"));
SpanTermQuery field2 = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("field2", "hello"));
SpanTermQuery field3 = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("field3", "hello"));
SpanOrQuery or = new SpanOrQuery(new SpanQuery[] {field1, field2,field3});
With this code I get an error because SpanOrQuery Clauses must have same
field.

My question is:
Is defined a field positions iterator on Spans or other structure ???

Can you help me???

Thanks
