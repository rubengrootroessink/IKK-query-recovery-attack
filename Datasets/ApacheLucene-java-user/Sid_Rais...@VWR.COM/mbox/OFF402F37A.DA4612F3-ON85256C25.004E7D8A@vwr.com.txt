Happy friday everyone:

In the  index there are serveral files.

Via filtering I want to restrict access to some of these documents for
non-priviledged regular users (majority of the searches are performed by
regular non-priviledged users). When a priviledged user logs on he should
have access to all documents.

I hope this answers your question. All ideas will be appreciated.

Thanks

Sid
