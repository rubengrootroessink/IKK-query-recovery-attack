SUBJECT: Lucene javadoc not up-to-date?
DATE: 28 May 2007

I've encountered a few discrepcies between the javadoc of Lucene and the
source code.
I use:
http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/javadoc/ as
the most up-to-date javadoc reference.
For instance, the SegmentTermDocs class implements the TermDocs interface.
However, there is no information about this SegmentTermDocs class in the
javadoc.
I notice such source codes (e.g. index/SegmentTermDocs.java) are not well
commented. Perhaps that's why they are not included in the javadoc
generation?
Thanks.
