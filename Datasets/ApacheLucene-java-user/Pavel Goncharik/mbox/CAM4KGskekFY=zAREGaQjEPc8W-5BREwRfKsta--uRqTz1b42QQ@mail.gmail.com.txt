SUBJECT: multiply sub-scores in boolean query
DATE: 17 Jul 2011

Hi,

as far as I can see, boolean scorers always sum up scores of their
sub-scorers. It works, but in case of my application it's required to
multiply sub-scores.
Is there a simple/efficient way to do this (apart from modifying
lucene's source code)?
It seems to me that standard tricks (e.g. CustomScoreQuery or custom
Similarity) would not help me in this case.

Thanks in advance for helping!

Pavel
