SUBJECT: commit lock, graceful handler
DATE: 2 Nov 2004

I'm testing fault tollerance aspects of an application using Lucene. 
Consider if power is pulled form the server/workstation and it
immediately shuts down hard or crashes.

I'm faced with a situation of a commit.lock file exising in the temp
directory.  Lucene is throwing an exception when a writer is first
created against this index.  An IOexception comes about and "Lock
obtained timed out" error occurs.

REading some docs anf FAQs I see that this could be deleted and the
index will be in a usable state.

Any advice/comments/thoughts?

Is there a graceful way to handle this?  

Thanks
