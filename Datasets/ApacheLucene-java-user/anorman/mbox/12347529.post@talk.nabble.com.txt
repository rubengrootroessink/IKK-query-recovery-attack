SUBJECT: Searching Diacritics
DATE: 27 Aug 2007


I have a searchable index of documents which contain french and spanish
diacritics (è, é, À) etc.  I would like to make the content searchable so
that when a user searches for a word such as "Amèrique" or "Amerique"
(without diacritic) then it returns the same results.

Has anyone set up something similar?

Thanks,
Albert
