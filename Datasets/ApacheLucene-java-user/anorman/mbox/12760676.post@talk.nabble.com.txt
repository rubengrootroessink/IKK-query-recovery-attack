SUBJECT: Re: Sorting a search result
DATE: 18 Sep 2007


Hmmmm.

Right now my search results are contained in an ArrayList object like so:

List searchResult = new ArrayList();

I am adding my "resultBean" objects (with it's data, i.e. title, author,
score, etc) into the searchResult (ArrayList).  

Would this be possible with a SortedSet?

Thanks,
Albert
