Dear Ravi,
                Thanks for ur help but my problem is not solved  yet. I have indexed the field
ToAddress.
I'm able to get results if I search for  (toAddress:abc*)  it gives me all mailids starting
with abc
but I want it to search for in the domain how do I do it ??
            Also I've found it does not return any results when I query for (toAddress:Abc).
If Lucene is not case sensitive  why doesen't  it give me results.

Regards,
Suneetha

to search through email's ToAddress field, You have a create an index which stores the toAddress
than only you can retereve the search for toAddress.
