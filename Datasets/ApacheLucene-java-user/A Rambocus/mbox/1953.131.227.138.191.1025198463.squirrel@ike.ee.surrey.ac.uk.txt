Mike,

I wonder whether you could be kind enough to forward me a copy of your code 
for the extended Crawler class, as i am having a few teethin problems  and 
a working copy would most likely solve some of my problems.

Your help would be much appreciated.

Cheers

Ajay R

Otis,

In the sandbox is there only the 'webcrawler-LARM' crawler?
