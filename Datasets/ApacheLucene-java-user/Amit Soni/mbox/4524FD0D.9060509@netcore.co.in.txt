Hi all,

I have been using Lucene from last few days. Right now i am reading some 
records from the db then convert in Document of lucene and then adds 
that document in lucene index. But in my record i have one field which 
is created_date and i want to search for given query in created_date 
order. So is it possible to search in date order. If any one of you have 
some idea regarding this then please let me know.

Thanks,
Amit Soni
