Hi Erick,

Thanks for the reply.

Actually the priorities mean when i search for example for cancer then 
in the result if get the result in order like
1. it appears in title
2. it appears in keywords
3. it appears in synonyms.

But right now with the default implementation when i search for query 
'cancer' then for say document range 1 to 10 i got 9th result which 
contains given 'cancer' query appears in synonyms field while in 10th 
result the 'cancer' query appears in keyword field . But actually i want 
10th result before 9th.

So i can do the same using Sort class. Or i can do the same with 
anything else.

I hope you understand want i want to ask.

Thanks,
Amit Soni
