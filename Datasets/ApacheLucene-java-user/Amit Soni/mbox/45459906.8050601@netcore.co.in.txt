fetching values from the database and then index it.

The fields which the docuement contains is:
1. hwid
2. title
3. author
4. keywords
5. synonyms

Now i want the search result should be as per the following priorities
1. title
2. keywords
3. synonyms

But right now it is in some different priorities. So if some one has and 
idean regarding this then please let me know.

Thanks,
Amit Soni
