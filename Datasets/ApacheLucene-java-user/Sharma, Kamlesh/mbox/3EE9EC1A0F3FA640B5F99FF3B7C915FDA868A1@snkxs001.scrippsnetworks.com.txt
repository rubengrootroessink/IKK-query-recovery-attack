http://www.eeecooks.com

EEECooks is recipe site that uses lucene for its searching. Not only
can you search by ingredients but also by the number of ingredients
(for those who can't handle preparing foods with lots of ingredients),
by prep time, and by category (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc).

Check it out ... it's not only a neat use of lucene (especially for
those who may think lucene is "too much" for their small site) but
there's also some great recipe's there.

The "powered by" logo appears on the search results.
