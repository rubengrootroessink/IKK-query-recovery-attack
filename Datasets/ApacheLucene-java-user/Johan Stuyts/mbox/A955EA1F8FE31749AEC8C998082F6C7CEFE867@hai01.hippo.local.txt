it seems I missed this one. Thanks.

I guess it is time we started evaluating Solr.

I still see problems because of:
- very frequent updates (expected to be thousands an hour);
- dense facets, more than 1 in 20 documents in a facet (e.g. month,
department, site section);
- the filters are also used for authorization. We want to use facets for
authorization, this means we have to combine (disjunction and
conjunction) the bit sets (expected number is less than 10) of a user
for each request.

But I will keep looking for solutions, and trying different
implementations. Today I finished a very simple test suite with which I
can compare the implementations.
