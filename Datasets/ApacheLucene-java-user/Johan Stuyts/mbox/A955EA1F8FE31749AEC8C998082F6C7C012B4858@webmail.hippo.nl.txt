SUBJECT: Possible documentation error?
DATE: 26 Oct 2006

Hi,

On the page about the file formats I think there might be a
documentation error below 'frequencies'. The example is '15, 22, 3', but
if I read the paragraph starting with 'DocDelta determines both the
document number and the frequency' correctly this example translates to:
  Doc ID   Freq.
    7       1
   18       3

Instead of documents 7 and 11 as described in the paragraph above the
example.

Shouldn't the example be '15, 8, 3'?

Kind regards,

Johan Stuyts
