Hi Yonik:

A simple RangeFilter did the trick

>    private RangeFilter rangeFilter;
>    public BitSet bits(IndexReader reader) throws IOException {
>        rangeFilter = RangeFilter.More("lastUpdatedDate"/*Field to sort*/,
> "" /*atleast an empty string but not null*/);
>        return rangeFilter.bits(reader);

the above code actually works perfectly.
