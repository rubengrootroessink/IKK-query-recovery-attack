SUBJECT: Search emails - parsing mailbox (mbox) files
DATE: 3 Apr 2008

Is there any reliable implementation for parsing email mailbox files (mbox
format), especially large (>50MB) archives ? Even after searching lucene
mailing list archives, googling around, I couldn't find one. I took a look
at Apache James project which seems to offer some support , but couldn't
find much documentation about it.
