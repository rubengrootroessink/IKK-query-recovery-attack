SUBJECT: void touchFile() should return the boolean result of the setLastModified
DATE: 4 Nov 2009

This is an issue found by Findbugs.
In the file FSDirectory the method void touchFile() should return the boolean result of the
setLastModified method call.


public abstract class FSDirectory extends Directory {


@Override
  public void touchFile(String name) {
    ensureOpen();
    File file = new File(directory, name);
    file.setLastModified(System.currentTimeMillis());
  }

Because this class is abstract this method may be overridden, and this may create an upward
compatibility issue.


Suggested change

@Override
  public Boolean touchFile(String name) {
    ensureOpen();
    File file = new File(directory, name);
    Return file.setLastModified(System.currentTimeMillis());
  }
