SUBJECT: Limit on number of search documents
DATE: 14 Mar 2005

We have an application which needs to index over 50, 000 documents which
will go up to 250,000 documents in the next two years. We have been
using Lucene to generate indexes so far. I was wondering if there is a
limit to number of search documents which Lucene can handle?
 
Thanks and regards
