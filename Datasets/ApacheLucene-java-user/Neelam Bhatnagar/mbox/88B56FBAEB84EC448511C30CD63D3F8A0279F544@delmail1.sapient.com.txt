These are the ones I think. They were the first things I read on Lucene
and
were very helpful.

Hello,

Thank you for your help. Could you tell us the URL of the online version

Thanks and regards

Redirecting to the more appropriate lucene-user list.

Hello,

About 2 years ago I wrote 2 articles for O'Reilly Network, where I
believe I mentioned this issue and provided some context.  Make sure
your index is optimized.  If that doesn't help, switch to the compound
index format (1 set call on IndexWriter instance).  You can also adjust
your OS's limits - the article I mentioned cover this for a few UNIX
shells.
