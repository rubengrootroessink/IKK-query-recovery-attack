Thanks,do you means that in any situation the docids maximum number maybe somewhere between
current doc count and about 3 times doc count.
No more than 4 times doc count

Andi s you not optimize, as soon as two segments are merged, the docids are also reassigned.
It just takes some time. Normally the docids maximum number maybe somewhere between current
doc count and about 3 times doc count.
