SUBJECT: about lucene doc id recycle
DATE: 22 Mar 2010

Total document number is not very big, but update is very frequency.

So I wonder whether the doc id is growing bigger and bigger and never
getting smaller.

Do lucene has some technique recycling doc id??

 

Ps: I never call optimize method.
