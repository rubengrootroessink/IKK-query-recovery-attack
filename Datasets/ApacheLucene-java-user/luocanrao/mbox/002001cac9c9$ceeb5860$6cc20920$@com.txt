SUBJECT: another question about phrasequery?(thanks again)
DATE: 22 Mar 2010

I don't think the current phrasequery can meet my requirement.

Can someone help me implement such a phrasequery?

 

Exact match document add some score

All other match document add 0 score.(no matter how big slop is)

 

For example:

Document 1: little boy is running

Document 2:boy is little

 

I query "little boy"

Document 1 add score 100(Exact match)

Document 2 add score 0( not Exact match)

But the two document can match the query.

user that search "litter boy" should see both the Document,

but the Document 1 is on the top!!
