SUBJECT: about optimize() quetion ,Looking forward to hearing from you soon! Thank you in advance!
DATE: 3 Jan 2010

If some but not all readers re-open while an

optimize is underway, this will cause > 2X temporary

space to be consumed as those new readers will then

hold open the partially optimized segments at that

time.  It is best not to re-open readers while optimize is running   

 

my question is:

1、if  the readers do not call re-open, segment file the readers will see is
after merged or before merged when optimize() done 

2、when old segment file on disk is removed,if old segment files are removed
after optimize() done at once,

How can the readers see the old data on the disk.
