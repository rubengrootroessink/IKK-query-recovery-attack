Uwe Schindler ,thanks for your reply.
First,I did not use reopens method, even when I start the my program, I can see this two big
anon memory at once.
Second,if I miss unmap,I will see some other index file map to virtual memory other than anon
memory.

MMapDirectory should only be used on 64bit machines with 64bit JVMs. This is described in
the Javadocs.

The additional sizes are caused by reopens and have their reason in specialties with the Java
VM, described in 2.9/3.0 Javadocs of the class, please take a look. You can also enable a
workaround for the missing “unmap” call.

Subject: MMapDirectory need twice more virtual memory than actually need?

 

Environment: 64 bit linux,memory 8G

When I used pmap instruction to see virtual memory, I found two big anon memory which grows
with the index file size.

I had the two following pictures to show the problem, can you explain?

         This is why I got out of memory exception in 32 bit machine. Because my index file
size is only 800m.

                                                                 Anon memory picture



                                                                 Indexfile memory picture
