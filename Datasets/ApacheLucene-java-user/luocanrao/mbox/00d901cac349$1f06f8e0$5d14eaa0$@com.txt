I am reading lucene in action 2,there is some question about it.

When a flush occurs, the writer creates new segment and deletion files in
the Directory. However,
these files are neither visible nor usable to a newly opened IndexReader
until the writer commits the
changes. It's important to understand this difference. Flushing is done to
free up memory consumed by
buffered changes to the index, whereas committing is done to make all
flushed changes persistent and
visible in the index.

Why Flushing does not make all flushed changes persistent even if it had
created new segment?
Flushing does not mean flush any change to disk?
