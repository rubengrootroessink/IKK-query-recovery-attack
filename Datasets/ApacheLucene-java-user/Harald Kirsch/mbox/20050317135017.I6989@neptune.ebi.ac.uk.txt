SUBJECT: storing int fields
DATE: 17 Mar 2005

Hi,

I need a field to store an int value. It need not be indexed or
tokenized. The obvious way to store it is of course to convert to a
String. I wonder however, if something like this would work too:

  StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
  sb.append((char)(i&0xFFFF))
    .append((char)(i>>16));
  Field f = new Field(sb.substring(0), ...

Is there any encoding/decoding done on the strings when they are
written to file so that I might get complaints from the encoder about
malformed characters.

To be honest, I would not try this route if it were for just one
field. But I have several of those and the above would allow me to
store several int values easily and quickly in just one field. As we
have already many fields, saving on the number of fields seems to be
important to enable a large mergeFactor.

  Thanks,
  Harald.
