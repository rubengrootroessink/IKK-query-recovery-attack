SUBJECT: best mergeFactor for merging 100 Indexes
DATE: 25 Jun 2004

Hi,

after an hour of indexing on a cluster I got 100 Indexes, ca. 25MB
each, 2 indexed fields. I intend now to run code roughly like

   IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(destDir, ...);
   writer.addIndexes(my100IndexDirs);
   writer.close()

When I did this a year ago, I know I had tough problems getting around
memory limitations and open file limits at the same time. In the end
it worked with writer.mergeFactor==4000, but I think it was a
specially tweaked kernel on Linux which I don't have anymore.

Since I don't really understand yet how open files, segments, memory
use, indexing time and mergeFacter interact, I would appreciate a good
gues how to combine these indexes.

Which mergeFactor to use?
Use a different strategy then the 3 lines shown above?

  Thanks,
  Harald.
