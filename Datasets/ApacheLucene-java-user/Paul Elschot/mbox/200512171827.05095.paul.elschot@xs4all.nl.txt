The easiest way to do this is by adding a required clause to a BooleanQuery.
You might consider using a ConstantScoringQuery for this clause:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-383

In case you really want to filter only the documents that match a query
you'll need to implement a filtering HitCollector and use it on the
lower level search API. 
An easier way to implement such a filtering HitCollector could be
by adding to it the search methods that return a Hits as an alternative
to Filter.
A disadvantage of this approach is that skipTo() cannot be used
to combine the filter and the query, see also here:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-330
