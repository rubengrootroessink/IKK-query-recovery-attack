Under Unix this will give you the cvs head:

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic checkout jakarta-lucene

The tests are in the jakarta-lucene/src/test directory.
There are some tests that might be interesting in the queryParser and analysis 
directories below the obligatory org/apache/lucene.

In case these tests are not covering what you need, or you need help to run 
the tests, could you continue on lucene-dev?
