With the default scoring methods, there is hardly any gain in doing this.
Nevertheless, to try this out, you need a Scorer for the query via 
Query.weight(Searcher).scorer(IndexReader) and then use Scorer.next() and 
Scorer.doc() only, ie. do not use Scorer.score().
The searcher can be opened on the index reader to have both available.

In case you have an OR like boolean query, with optional clauses only,
it may be faster iterate over the documents of each clause seperately
to set the document bits.
