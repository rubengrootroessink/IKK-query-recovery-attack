The normal way of doing that is to:
- make a list of all doc id's for the user.
- from this list construct a Filter for use in the full text index.
Sort the doc id's, use an IndexReader on the full text index, construct
a Term for each doc id, walk the termDocs() for the Term, and set
a bit in the filter to allow the document number for the doc id.
- keep this filter to restrict the searches for the user by
IndexSearcher.search(Query,Filter)
- rebuild the filter when the doc id's for the user change, or when
the full text index changes (a document deletion followed
by an optimize or an add can change any other document's number).

Hmm, this is getting to be a FAQ.
