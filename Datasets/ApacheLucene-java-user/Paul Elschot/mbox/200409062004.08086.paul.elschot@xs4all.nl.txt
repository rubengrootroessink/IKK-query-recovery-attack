What do you mean by reload?
You could try and delete the new documents from the old index beforehand.

I don't know to what extent you can do such updates atomically with
Lucene. One way might be to stop all searches, delete the
new docs from the old index, close the old index, then open a
MultiReader on the old and the new index together, and use this
to do further searches.
This writes the deleted bits for the old index, ie. one byte per 8 docs
and closes and reopens the index files, which takes an amount of  time
that is linear in the old index size. 
But there may be better ways.
