I think a theoretical maximum score is only going to work when that
maximum applies to queries of any structure. So, start with the
simplest query, associate it with a theoretical maximum score, and
then for each possible combination of subqueries ((weighted)
and/or/phrase/span) make sure that the subscore values are
combined into another value that has the same theoretical
maximum.

Have a look here to start:
