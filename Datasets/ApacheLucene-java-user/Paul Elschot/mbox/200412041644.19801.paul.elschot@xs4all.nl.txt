Currently a filter is applied during search, after the document
score is computed, but before a document is added to the search results.

In practice, the score computation is much less work than the I/O, so
a filter does reduce the search space.

A filter might also be used to reduce the I/O for searching, but Lucene
doesn't do that now, probably because there was little to gain.

P.S. The code doing the filtering is in IndexSearcher.java, from line 97.
