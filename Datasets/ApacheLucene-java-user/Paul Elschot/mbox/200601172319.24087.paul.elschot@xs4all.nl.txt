This can be done, but you'll need to write your own TermQuery and
TermScorer for this. Just add the requirement of the minimum number
of term occurrences in your own TermScorer.
Have a look at the Java code of TermScorer, it should be straightforward
to do this.

You'll need to make sure the the query term website.com does not match
@website.com so you can simply query for website.com.
I don't know how the StandardAnalyzer deals with this case.
You may need to use your own Analyzer to make sure that @website.com
is only indexed as @website.com and never as website.com .
If you need to know how some text is indexed try Luke:
