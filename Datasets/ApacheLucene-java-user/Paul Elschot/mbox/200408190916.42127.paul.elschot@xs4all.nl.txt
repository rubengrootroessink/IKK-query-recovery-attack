As noted, one would expect the index size to be about 35%
of the original text, ie. about 2.5GB * 35% = 800MB.
That is two orders of magnitude off from what you have.

Could you provide some more information about the field structure,
ie. how many fields, which fields are stored, which fields are indexed,
evt. use of non standard analyzers, and evt. non standard
Lucene settings?

You might also try to change to non compound format to have a look
at the sizes of the individual index files, see file formats on the lucene
web site.
You can then see the total disk size of for example the stored fields.
