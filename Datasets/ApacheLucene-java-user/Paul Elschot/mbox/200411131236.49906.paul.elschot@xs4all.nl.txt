Wouldn't it be counterintuitive to only use the longest matches
for truncations?
To have only longer matches one can also use queries with
multiple ? characters, each matching exactly one character.

I think it would be better encourage the users to use longer
and maybe also more prefixes. This gives more precise results
and is more efficient to execute.
