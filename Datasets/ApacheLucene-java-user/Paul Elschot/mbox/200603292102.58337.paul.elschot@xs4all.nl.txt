Jelda,

I have just added a patch for DisjunctionSumScorer.java here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-413 issue.

Could you try that patch and report the results at the jira issue?

In case you need help using the patch could you move the
discussion to the java-dev list?

Regards,
Paul Elschot
