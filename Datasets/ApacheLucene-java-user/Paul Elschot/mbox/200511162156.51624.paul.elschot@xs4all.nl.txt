Once you know the document numbers that you want the getSpans() to work
on, you can make a Filter for those doc nrs (set the corresponding bits
in the BitSet for the Filter) and use this FilteredQuery:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-330
to wrap your SpanQuery.
This FilteredQuery requires skipTo(), and the scorer for
SNQ implements that, so it should work.

The FilteredQuery in 1.4.3 will score all documents regardless of whether
they are filtered out or not.
