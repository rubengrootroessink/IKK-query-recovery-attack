There is no one to one relationship between a seacher and a scorer.

When a query consists eg. of two terms, there will be three scorers
executing the search for that query: one TermScorer for each term,
and one scorer to combine the other two to provide the search results,
usually a BooleanScorer or a ConjunctionScorer.
For proximity queries, other scorers are used.
