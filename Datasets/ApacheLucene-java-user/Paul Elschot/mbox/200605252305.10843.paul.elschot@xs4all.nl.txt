Have  a look at Similarity and DefaultSimilarity. It looks like
you need your own Similarity with a non constant coord()
implementation, and some constant value for the rest of the
methods in there.
The first argument to coord() is the number of matching
clauses for a document for a boolean query.
The value returned by coord() will be used in the calculation
of the score value for the document.
