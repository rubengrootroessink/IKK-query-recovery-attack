Philipp,

First off: I have no solutions, just some existing things that might
be useful.

The closest existing thing is coord() factor from Similarity.
But using that will only allow you to delay the implementation.

You can also use the sloppyFreq() from Similarity, but then
you still need a way to determine the sloppiness for any possible
term order. Span queries to that by just taking the distance
between the first and last matched "term".

Would your implementation also generalize to a SpanQuery?
