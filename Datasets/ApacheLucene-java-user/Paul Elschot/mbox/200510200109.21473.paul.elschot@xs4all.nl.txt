You may want to use the getSpans() method of SpanQuery and operate
on the result directly.

:)

Have a look at the surround query parser in the svn trunk:
http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/surround/

There is also some code that does highlighting based on Spans,
but I don't know where that is. Hopefully someone else can point you at that.
