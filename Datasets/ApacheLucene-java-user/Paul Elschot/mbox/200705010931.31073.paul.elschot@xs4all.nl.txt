Do you need the idf computations of lucene for each of these client fields
separately?
When not, another way is to move the names of the client fields into the
term value, and use a single special field for these.
When you do that, you'll also have to move the client field names
in the queries from the field name to the term. This can easily be done by 
overriding one of the methods in QueryParser.
