You can use the standard query parser with a query like this:
"dog computer"~50
This query is not completely symmetric in the distance computation:
when computer occurs before dog, the allowed distance is 49, iirc.

There is also a SpanNearQuery for more generalized and flexible
distance queries, but this is not supported by the query parser,
so you'll have to construct these queries in your own program code.

In case you have non standard retrieval requirements, eg. you only
need the number of hits and no further information from the matching
documents, you may consider using your own HitCollector on the
lower level search methods.
