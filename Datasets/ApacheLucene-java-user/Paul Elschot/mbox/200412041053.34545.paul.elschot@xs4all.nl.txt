One way to restrict results is by using a Filter.

Using a + before each term requires them all, ie. uses AND, which
would normally have an empty result for an Id field.
You might prefer this query concatenation:

+(locationId:1 locationId:3 ...)

It effectively OR's the locationId content query and requires
only one of the terms to match.

In this case using a Filter would probably be better, though.
