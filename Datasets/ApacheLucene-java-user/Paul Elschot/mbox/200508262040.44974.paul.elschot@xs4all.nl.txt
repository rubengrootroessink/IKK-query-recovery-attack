Subqueries of BooleanQuery are called clauses in Lucene.
The order of clauses does not matter.
Having only required clauses does matter, normally a lot.

The development version tries to do as much "short circuiting" as possible.
Lucene 1.4.3 neither short circuits for "or" (optional clauses)
nor for "not" (prohibited clauses).
Both do short circuiting for "and" (required clauses).
