IndexReader.numDocs() will give the number of docs in an index.

Lucene has no direct support for unique fields. After merging, if the
same unique field value occurs in both source indexes, the merged
index will contain two documents with that value.
In case one wants to merge into unique field values, the non unique
values in one of the source indexes need to be deleted before merging.

See IndexReader.termDocs(term) on how to get the document numbers
for (unique) terms via a TermDocs, and IndexReader.delete(docNum)
for deleting docs.

Regards,
Paul.
