To speed this up a bit make sure that the iterator gives
the terms in sorted order. I'd use an index reader instead
of a searcher, but that will probably not make a difference.

Adding the documents can be done with multiple threads.
Last time I checked that, there was a moderate speed up
using three threads instead of one on a single CPU machine.
Tuning the values of minMergeDocs and maxMergeDocs
may also help to increase performance of adding documents.
