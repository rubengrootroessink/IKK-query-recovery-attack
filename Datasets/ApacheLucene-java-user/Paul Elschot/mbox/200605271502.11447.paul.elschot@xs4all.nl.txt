Not always: it is possible for different terms to be indexed in the
same position, and it is also possible to create a SpanOrQuery
in which the same Span(Term)Query occurs more than once.
The spans will be ordered, so in case they are not unique, the
ones with the same begin/end positions in the same doc will
be consecutive.
