Overriding QueryParser.getFieldQuery() might work for you.
It is given the field and the query text so an analyzer can be chosen
depending on the field.
In case you don't use the latest cvs head, it may be worthwhile to
have a look. Some of the getFieldQuery methods have been
deprecated, but I don't know when.
