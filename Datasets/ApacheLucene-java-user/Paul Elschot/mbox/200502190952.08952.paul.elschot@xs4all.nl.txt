Overriding this (1.4.3 QueryParser.jj, line 286) might work:

protected Query getFieldQuery(String field, String queryText)
throws ParseException { ... }

It will be called by the parser for both parts of the query above, so one
could change the field depending on the requested type of search
and the field name in the query.

Once the users get the hang of this, you might end up having to quadruple
the index, or more.
