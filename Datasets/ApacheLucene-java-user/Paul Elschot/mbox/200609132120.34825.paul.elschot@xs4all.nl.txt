You only need to reindex the documents containing the terms to
be removed. That may not be really straightforward to program,
but it could be worthwhile depending how often you expect this to
happen.
In case you already have an incremental indexer that adds
documents that are not already in the index, you can use that after
deleting all docs containing your terms, iirc IndexReader has a
method to delete all docs containing a term.
