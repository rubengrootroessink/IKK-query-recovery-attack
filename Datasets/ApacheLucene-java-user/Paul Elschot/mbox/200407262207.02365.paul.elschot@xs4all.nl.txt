Lucene does this internally by buffering
up to 32 document numbers in advance for a query Term.
You can view the details here in case you're interested:
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/TermScorer.java
It uses the TermDocs.read() method to fill a buffer of document numbers.

Is this what you had in mind?

Paul
