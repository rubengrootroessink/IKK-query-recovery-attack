Meanwhile the choice between SortedVIntList and OpenBitSet
has been removed from the trunk (development version),
that now uses OpenBitSet only:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1296

In case there is preference to have SortedVIntList used in the
next lucene version (i.e. in cases when it is smaller  than
OpenBitSet), please comment at LUCENE-1296.
