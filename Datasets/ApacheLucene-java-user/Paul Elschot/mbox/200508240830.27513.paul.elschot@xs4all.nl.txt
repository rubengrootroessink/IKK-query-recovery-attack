This checkout command worked for me:

  svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk

and currently the command:

  svn update 

is working fine here, so I'd expect a checkout to work now, too.
Once you have a working copy use:

  ant jar

in  the trunk directory to create the latest jar in the build directory.
