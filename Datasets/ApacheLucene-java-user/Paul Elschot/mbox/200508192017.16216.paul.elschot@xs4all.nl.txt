Basically, you need to implement the next() and skipTo(int targetDoc)
methods from Scorer on your memory structure. They are somewhat
redundant (skipTo(doc() + 1) has the same semantics as next(), except
initially), but that is for a mix of historical and performance reasons.
Have a look at how this is done in the posted FilteredQuery class
for SortedVIntList and BitSet.
With only isValid(docId) these next() and skipTo() methods would
have to count over the document numbers, which is less than ideal.

When you use the posted code, iirc it is only necessary to implement the
SkipFilter interface on your memory structure. One can use that interface
to build/cache  such memory structures using an IndexReader, and
from there the DocNrSkipper interface will do the rest (of the top of
my head).
One slight problem with the current Lucene implementation is that
java.lang.BitSet is not interface.
