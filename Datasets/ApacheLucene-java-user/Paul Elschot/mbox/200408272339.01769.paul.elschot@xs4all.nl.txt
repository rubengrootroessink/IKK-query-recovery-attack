Probably good for a date filter, see the wiki on RangeQuery, and evt. my
previous message on filters (using 2nd index on constraining). Lucene has
no facilities for primary keys, so that is up to you.

RangeQuery again for the priority.
One can store images in Lucene, but currently only in String format, ie.
they'll need some conversion. There was some talk on binary
objects (not too) recently, but that is still in development. I'd probably store the
images in a file system or in another db for now. OTOH, if you're willing
to help storing binary images lucene-dev is nearby.

Yes :)

Span queries are currently not supported by the query language,
you might have a look at the org.apache.lucene.search.spans package.

Lucene can be as fast as relational databases, provided your lower level
java code on IndexReader plays nice with system resources like disk heads
and RAM.
That means using filters, sorting on index order before using an index
and evt. sorting on document number before retrieving stored fields.
Lucene's IndexSearcher for searching text queries is quite well behaved
in that respect.

To easily keep the primary keys in sync between the SQL db and Lucene,
I'd start by keeping the images and the full text only in the SQL db.
Lucene optimisations (needed after adding/deleting docs) copy all data
so it pays to keep the Lucene indexes small.

Later you might need multiple indexes, MultiSearcher, and occasionally
a merge of the indexes.
