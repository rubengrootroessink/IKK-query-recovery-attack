You can replace all stop words by your own special term value
to have space indicator.

It is also possible to index nothing at a particular position, for example
at the position of a stop word. This gives a "gap" in the index,
see below.

The problem may be that you expect a gap in the index.
When there is a gap in the index, it is also necessary to adapt
the analyzer used for the phrase query to query for a gap.
I don't know whether PhraseQuery can handle such an analyzer.

To have a gap in the index, you need to change your analyzer
to add a gap for a stop word. This can be done by changing the
position increment when a stop word is encountered, see
Token.setPositionIncrement(). Iirc you need to make a variation
on StopFilter for this.
