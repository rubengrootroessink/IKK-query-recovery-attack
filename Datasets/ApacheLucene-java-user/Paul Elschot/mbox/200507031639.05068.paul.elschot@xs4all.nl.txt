It's an internal error that is not supposed to occur.
Could you continue on the java-dev list?

SpanNearQuery is not supposed to operate on a single argument, at least
that's what I thought when I wrote the bug fix code that throws this
exception. Does the exception go away when you replace the first spanNear
(the one with the single [text:interesting]  with a SpanTermQuery ?

It's also possible that the code cannot handle the two identical
text:interesting arguments. 

It's probably good to have a test case for this. Could you extend the
exception with the document number and maybe a position within the
document to try and get to the original text that causes this exception,
and use that to file a bug report?
