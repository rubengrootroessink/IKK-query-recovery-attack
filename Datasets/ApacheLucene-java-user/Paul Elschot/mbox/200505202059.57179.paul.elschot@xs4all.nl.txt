Without having had a look at that code: probably not, because
a reader does not know which field is the primary key.

The problem with the two indexes above is that a single document has
different fields in both of them.  Usually a search would start in the
"properties" index, retrieve the found primary keys from there, 
then use these primary keys to set up a filter in the "content" index,
and then repeatedly search in the content text limiting to this filter.
