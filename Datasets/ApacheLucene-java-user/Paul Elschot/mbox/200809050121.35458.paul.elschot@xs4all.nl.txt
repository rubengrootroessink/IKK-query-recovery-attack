SpanScorer will use the similarity slop factor for each matching
span size to adjust the effective frequency.
The span size is the difference in position between the first
and last matching term, and idf is not used for scoring Spans.
The reason why idf is not used could be that there is no basic
score value associated with inner spans; only top level spans
are scored by SpanScorer.
For more details, please consult the SpanScorer code.
