Sounds like you may want to take a look at SpanNearQuery.

With (a variation of) SpanNearQuery you may end up not needing
any filtering at all, because it already uses skipTo() where possible.

In case you are looking for documents that contain partial phrases
from an input query that has more than 2 words, have a look at Nutch.
