DOES NOT return the inverse of a query for (term)), I believe the bit set 
returned by a purely negative QueryFilter is empty, so no matter how many 
results returned by the initial query, the result after filtering is always 
zero documents.

It may have been suggested already: you can create a Filter
for the positive Query, and then invert the bits in the BitSet of the Filter
to have negative filtering.
