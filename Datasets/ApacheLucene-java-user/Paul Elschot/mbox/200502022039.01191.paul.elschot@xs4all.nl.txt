It seems the java source files were not extracted.

How did you obtain the build.xml file?

Once the compilation works, you'll notice that the lucene jar being built
has a 1.5 version number because of an incorrect version number
in the 1.4.3 build.xml.
You need to correct the version property in the build.xml file:
  <property name="version" value="1.4.3"/>
