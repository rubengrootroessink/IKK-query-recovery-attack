It will throw an IllegalArgumentException when a Term is added
with a different field, which is probably what happened.

For PhraseQuery the field name and the term text could have been
used separately in the interface, which might have prevented your bug.
For example an alternative PhraseQuery could have constructor with a
field name argument, and term texts could be added at phrase positions.
