Could you say in a few words how the combination of proximity and boolean
is implemented in Qsol?

I found this the most difficult thing to implement in surround. In surround, 
every subquery that can be a proximity subquery has two (groups of) methods: 
one for use as boolean and one for use as proximity.
I'd like to have a mechanism that allows mixing proximity and boolean queries 
built into Lucene.

Did you also implement parsed phrases with Lucene's PhraseQuery?
Surround does not have that.
