These more compact filters might be useful here:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-328

They would probably take about two bytes per filtered document in this
case, both in RAM and on disk. Perhaps one won't even need the disk,
but adding some code to read/write such filters from a stream is easy.

I'd still prefer to give a score to each category based on the best
(say 100) document scores for the initial query, even though that would
need some more coding to keep track of the category scores.

These compact filters should work reasonably well as long as the
categories don't contain too many documents. For larger categories
these filters have the disadvantage that they still need to access every
document number for doing an intersection with the category, but BitSets
have this problem too.
