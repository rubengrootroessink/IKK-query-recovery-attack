I had a similar experience with this (SpanNotQuery not patched,
but previous bug is in fixed status):
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-433
and I would also prefer to have a mailing list for changes to
Lucene issues in JIRA.

Btw. the list general@lucene.apache.org might be better for this subject.
