The collect() method is called after next() on the top level Scorer has 
returned true. In between score() is called on that Scorer to provide the 
score value, but the score value is not tested.
Most Scorers give only positive score values for matching documents.

This is implemented in the IndexSearcher.search(...) and
Scorer.score(HitCollector) methods.
