You may be able to use a TermDocs, which access the index by term
and walks the documents while providing the in document term frequencies.

In case you need to access the terms by document, 
there are term vectors in the development version of Lucene.
The getTermFreqVector() method of IndexReader returns
a TermFreqVector which gives access to the terms in a document field
and their frequencies, not just {0,1}. It has an even better taste than vanilla.
To enable this, indicate an option from Field.TermVector
in Lucene's Document Field when the document is added to the index by
IndexWriter.addDocument().
