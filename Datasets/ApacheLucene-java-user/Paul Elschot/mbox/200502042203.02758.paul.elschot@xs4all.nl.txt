It's not impossible, but the problem is that the term index is first sorted
by field name, then by term text, then by document number, and then
by term position within document.

That means that the index path is no good to query for field name and
document number: you have to check all indexed terms in  between.

Lucene "only" allows to find the existence of a indexed field, the
indexed terms (field name + term text) in sorted order from a given term,
and the indexed documents of a term, possibly combined with the
with the term positions within each document.

The solution above shortcuts the index path by putting the field name
in place of the term text for a special field.
