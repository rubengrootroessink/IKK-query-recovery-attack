Correct. I suppose you mean the filtering code in IndexSearcher?

The trick of filtering is the use of skipTo() on both the filter and
the scorer to skip superfluous work as much as possible.
So when you make your scorer implement skipTo() efficiently,
filtering it should reduce the amount of scoring done.

Implementing skipTo() efficiently is normally done by using
TermScorer.skipTo() on the leafs of a scorer structure. So,
in case you implement your own TermScorer, take a serious
look at TermScorer.skipTo().

Normally, score value computations are not the bottleneck,
but accessing the index is, and this is where skipTo() does
the real work. At the moment avoiding score value computations
is a nice extra.

Yes, Filters.

In case you have a better way than skipTo(), or something
to improve on this issue to allow a Filter as clause to BooleanQuery:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1345
let us know.
