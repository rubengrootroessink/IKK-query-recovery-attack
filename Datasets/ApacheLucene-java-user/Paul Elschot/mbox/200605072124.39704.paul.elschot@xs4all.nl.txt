SUBJECT: Invoking luke when No sub-file with id ... found
DATE: 7 May 2006

Dear readers,

I had this error message from luke when opening a recent index:

No sub-file with id ... found

After looking around a bit on the web I found the problem mentioned
several times, but no solution.
Putting the lucene jar that created the index on the classpath before
lukeall.jar allows luke to normally work on such an index:

java -cp lucene-core-1.9-rc1-dev.jar:lukeall.jar org.getopt.luke.Luke

Regards,
Paul Elschot
