In general, the length of a field that does not match does not influence
the score, but it's still not easy to predict the order in this case.
With an OR over multiple fields:
- when a shorter field matches, it usually dominates the score for a
document.
- when other fields match, they contribute to the score via the sum
score over the clauses and via the coordination factor in the
DefaultSimilarity.

In case you prefer to use the maximum score over the clauses you
can use the DisjunctionMaxQuery from the development version.
