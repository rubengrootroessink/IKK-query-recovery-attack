The number of clauses added to the query equals the number of
indexed terms that match the wildcard. As each clause ends up using
some buffer memory internally, a maximum was introduced to
avoid running out of memory.
You can change the maximum nr of added clauses using
BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount() but then it is advisable
to monitor memory usage, and evt. increase heap space for the JVM.
