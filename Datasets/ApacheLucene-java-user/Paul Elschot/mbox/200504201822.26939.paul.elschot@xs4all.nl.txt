There is also a coordination factor:

The square root is a variation on the power norms of the extended
boolean model. It helps to make each extra occurrence in the same document
less important.

The field length is computed under the hood by counting the indexed terms.
Its square root is stored as a single byte value in a special representation
with 3 bits mantissa and 5 bits exponent.

Nutch has bigrams for phrases with frequently occurring words.
