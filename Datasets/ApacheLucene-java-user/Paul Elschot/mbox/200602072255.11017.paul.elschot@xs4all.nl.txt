You could take a look at the test code for these classes, this contains
examples on their use (see eg. TestPhraseQuery and the spans directory):
http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/tags/lucene_1_4_3/src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/

And there is also another query language that has ordered and
unordered queries:
http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/surround/
