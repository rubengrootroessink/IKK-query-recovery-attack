During search one byte of RAM is needed per searched field per document
for the normalisation factors, even if a document field is empty.
This RAM is occupied the first time a field is searched after opening
an index reader.
Supposing your queries would actually search 50 fields before
closing the index reader, the norms would occupy 50 bytes/doc, or
1 GB / 20MDocs.
