This enumerates all positions of the Term in the document
as returned by the Tokenizer used by the Analyzer (as normally
used by IndexWriter). The Tokenizer provides all terms as
analyzed, but here only the position of one term are enumerated.
Btw. this is why the index is called an inverted term index.

What is stored is a byte representing the inverse of the number of
indexed terms in a field of a document, as returned by a Tokenizer.
