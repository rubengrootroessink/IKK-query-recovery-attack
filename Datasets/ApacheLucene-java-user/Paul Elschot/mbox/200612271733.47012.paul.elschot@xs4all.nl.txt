In Lucene, the limit on the number of clauses is applied per (sub)query
that expands to a BooleanQuery.
In contrib/surround the limit on the maximum number of clauses
is applied for a full query including all subqueries.

The reason for the limitation in both cases is that each TermScorer
needs some buffer space, and without the limit Query.rewrite()
will run out of memory occasionaly.
