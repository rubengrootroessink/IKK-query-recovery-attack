Quite the contrary, it's called _de_normalization. This means that the
documents in lucene normally contain more information than is present
in a single relational entity.

Lucene has no facilities to maintain relational relationships among
its documents. A lucene index allows free format documents, i.e.
any document may have any field or not.
In practice you will need at least a primary key, but even that you will
need to program yourself.
