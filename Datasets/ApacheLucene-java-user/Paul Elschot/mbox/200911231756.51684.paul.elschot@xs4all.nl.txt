I think the problem is in the NearSpansOrdered.docSpansOrdered methods.
Could you replace the < by <= in there (4 times) and try again?
That will allow spans at the same position to be considered ordered.
From a quick reading of the code both the unordered and ordered cases
might work for a slop of -1 with that modification.

My pleasure,
