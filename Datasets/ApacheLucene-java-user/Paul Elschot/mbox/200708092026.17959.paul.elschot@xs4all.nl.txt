Ard,

It's the source code of an alternative query language on top of Lucene 
that allows boolean queries and span (distance) queries.
The minimal documentation is in the Java API documentation
on the lucene java site under contrib: Surround Parser, and in 
the surround.txt file here:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/surround/surround.txt?view=log

Groeten,
Paul Elschot
