For every field in the document, the first 10.000 tokens returned
from the analyzer are indexed.

There is no feature selection, except for stopword removal by
some of the analyzers.
Other feature selection mechanisms are up to you.
The reason for the 10.000 terms limitation is to have an upperbound
