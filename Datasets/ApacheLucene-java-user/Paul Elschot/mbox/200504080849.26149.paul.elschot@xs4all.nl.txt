Lucene does not provide this, ie. one can add
any document to the an index as often as one wants.
That means that it is necessary to implement
the identity yourself, eg. by using one field as primary
key, and/or use some hash of the document content
in another field.
Before adding a new document, one can lookup the
old one and check whether it should be deleted or not.

Updating documents is done by deletion and insertion
and this is best done in batches for efficiency.
