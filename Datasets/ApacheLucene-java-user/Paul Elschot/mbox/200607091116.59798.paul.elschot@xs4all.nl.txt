When modifying NearSpans, I'd start from here:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-569

To have the unordered case match with fewer than all given
subqueries/clauses, have a look at the NearSpansUnordered in the
above issue. It uses a queue with the minimum at the top of the
queue, and it maintains a maximum within that queue.
To match fewer than all given clauses, the queue should have
the size of the number of clauses that you'd like to match.
For the remaining non matching clauses, the same queue cannot
be used, but perhaps another one.

It's better to continue this on java-dev. It's not clear to me how you'd
like to treat the case of no missing words, and relaxing the matching
conditions in NearSpans can (/will) be tricky...
