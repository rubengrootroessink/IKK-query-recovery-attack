You can use the IndexSearcher method that searches a query with a Filter 
applied also with any SpanQuery.

In case you need wildcards within a SpanQuery, you need to construct
a SpanOrQuery over all the matching Terms during Query.rewrite().
Have a look at the source code of PrefixQuery.rewrite() to get going.
(I have not looked at Randy's code yet.)
