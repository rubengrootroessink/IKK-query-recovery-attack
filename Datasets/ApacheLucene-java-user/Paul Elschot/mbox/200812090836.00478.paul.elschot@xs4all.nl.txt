DATE: 9 Dec 2008

Michael,

The change from BitSet to DocIdSetIterator implies that you'll
need to choose an underlying data structure yourself.

A minimal approach would be to use DocIdBitSet around
BitSet, but there are better ways.

For your application you might consider to replace java's BitSet by
lucene's OpenBitSet. Also have a look at earlier discussions
on the subject: you might find a good use for OpenBitSetDISI and 
contrib/**/{BooleanFilter,ChainedFilter}.

Regards,
Paul Elschot
