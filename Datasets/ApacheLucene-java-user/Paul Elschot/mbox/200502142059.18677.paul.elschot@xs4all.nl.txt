A FilteredQuery works best when the filter from the criterias can be reused,
eg. by keeping it in a cache, possibly with CachingWrapperFilter.

It is possible, but whether it helps performance depends on your
circumstances.

The 1.4.3 filter implementation executes the most open query almost
completely.
It only applies the filter after the score computations for the
query being filtered, just before deciding whether to keep the docment
in the query results.
This is done in IndexSearcher.search(). 
A profiler might tell you whether that is a bottleneck for your queries.
If it is, there is some code in development that might help
.
In case it turns out that the memory occupied by the BitSet of the filter
is a bottleneck, please check the (very) recent archives of lucene-dev
on BitSet implementation.
