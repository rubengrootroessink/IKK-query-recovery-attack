SUBJECT: Re: Adding support for NOT NEAR construct?
DATE: 17 Oct 2007

Dave,

One can use SpanNotQuery to get NOT NEAR by using this generalized structure:

SpanNot(foo, SpanNear(foo, bar, distance))

This also allows for example:

SpanNot(two, SpanNear(one, three, distance))

Btw. I don't know of any query language that has this second form.

AND NOT normally does not work for this because it works on doc level
and not within the matching text of a field.


Regards,
Paul Elschot
