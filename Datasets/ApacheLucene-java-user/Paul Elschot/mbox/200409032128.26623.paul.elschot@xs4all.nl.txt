The src/java directory normally contains the java source files.

Since that directory doesn't exist you may want to create it
by installing the sources, eg. by checking out from cvs, or
from a jar or that contains the java sources here:
http://dist.apache.easynet.nl/jakarta/lucene/source/

Lucene 1.4.1 is out, but it's not available there yet.
In case you want that version please ask on lucene-dev.
