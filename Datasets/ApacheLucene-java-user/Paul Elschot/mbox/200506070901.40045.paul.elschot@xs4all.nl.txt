Have a look here:
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31784

It scores terms by density and it uses a separate table mapping
the norms stored in the index to inverse doc lengths. 
This table could be adapted as needed.
When that is not enough, it's probably a good start for what
you need.
