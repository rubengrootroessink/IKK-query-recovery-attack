It should work, as well as SpanNotQuery for excluding the
sentence boundary (see my other post). Using a separate
sentence field in which each token position is mapped to the same
sentence number would be faster, but that would also require
a special version of PhraseQuery to search at the same position.
Paragraphs can be handled similarly.

The disadvantage of adding a new field over the same data
is that the term index is duplicated.
This could be avoided by extending the index format
with index levels: one for normal use, one for sentences, one for
paragraphs, ... .
