In case you have many customers searching at the same time, compact filters
can help reduce memory requirements:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-328
A BitSet filter uses one bit per indexed document, and a compact filter uses 
one or three bytes per indexed document passing the filter.
When there are 100 different customers searching in their own docs at the
same time, assuming there are 100,000 * 20 docs in the customer index:
- BitSet filters will use 100 * (100,000 * 20) / 8 bytes,
- compact filters will use roughly 100 * 20 * 2  bytes.
The ratio between these is roughly 100,000 / 16 or about 6000.

Since the company docs will not need to be filtered, you can put these in a
separate index, and write your own MultiSearcher that filters only on the
customer index.
