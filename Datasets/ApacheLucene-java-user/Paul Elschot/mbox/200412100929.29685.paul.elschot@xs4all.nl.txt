A typical solution would be to use a Filter for each user group.
Each Filter would be built from categories indexed with the documents.
The moment to build a group Filter could be the first time a user from
a group queries an index after it is opened.
Filters can be cached, see the recent discussion on CachingWrappingFilter
and friends.
