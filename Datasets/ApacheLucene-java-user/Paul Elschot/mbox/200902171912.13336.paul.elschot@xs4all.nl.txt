It would be possible to build a similar choice criterion between
OpenBitSet and SortedVIntList into CachingWrapperFilter to chose
the data structure to be used for caching.

For example when using the same criterion as in the removed methods
there, your original problem might not have occurred at all.

In the CachingWrapperFilter in trunk the choice is left to an overridable method.
