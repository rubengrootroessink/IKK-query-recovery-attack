It's straightforward to reimplement the linked list as a modulo indexed
array. That might be a somewhat faster, but until now I expected the
runtime to be dominated by the I/O.

In case you would like to profile an implementation with such an array
just let me know, so I can add it in a bug report. It's a never finished
version I have lying around here, and it would need a bit of tinkering
before posting.
