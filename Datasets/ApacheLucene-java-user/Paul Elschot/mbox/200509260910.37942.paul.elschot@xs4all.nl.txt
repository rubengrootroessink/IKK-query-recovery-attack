I used my bug votes already. I hope more people will do that, hint:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=12310110

Is there a way to view the open issues sorted by number of votes?

In this case, the code requires skipTo() on all scorers. In the trunk, all
scorers have this. There may be a small query search performance hit
due to this, and the code has not been used widely.
To avoid having a dependence on a possible weak spot in performance,
it might be good to let this filter code wait until that is settled.
