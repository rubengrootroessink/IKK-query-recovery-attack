Normally, yes. A query is expected to provide a single score for
each matching document. The Hits class depends on this.
One can suppress later 'hits' by using a BitVector.

When your scorer implements skipTo it would normally have
to return the documents in document number order.

In the development version all scorers implement skipTo.
