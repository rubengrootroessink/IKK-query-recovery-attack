To compute the score for only a subset of the lucene documents
one normally uses a Filter. Assuming you get the primary keys of
the docs to be scored, you can look them up in the lucene index
and use their internal lucene document numbers to create the Filter.
Then search your query with this filter.
Have a look at the source code of RangeFilter.bits() to see how to
get to the internal document numbers from a set of terms.

Btw. when your database uses the same query to obtain this set of
documents, you might consider to move this function into Lucene
completely, because this will allow you to avoid using a filter alltogether.
