Gentlefolk,

Well, the javadocs as patched at LUCENE-584 try to change all
the cases of zero scoring to 'non matching'.

I'm happily bracing for a minor conflict with that patch. In case
someone wants to take another look at the javadocs as
patched there, don't let me stop you...

Regards,
Paul Elschot
