Timo,

You may be looking for class OpenBitSetDisi in the util package,
it was made for boolean filter operations on OpenBitSets.
Also have a look at the contrib modules, OpenBitSetDisi is
used there in two classes that do (precisely?) what you need:
contrib/miscellaneous/**/ChainedFilter
contrib/queries/**/BooleanFilter

Regards,
Paul Elschot
