That seems to be the case indeed.
Would it be possible for you to provide a (preferably small) lucene index that
shows this problem?
When so, could you post it at the jira issue?

Similar strange behaviour occurred on the previous occasion.

You might try the alternative implementation of span queries that is available
at the jira issue. However, even with that, the problem persisted on the 
previous occasion, so the source of the problem seems to be somewhere else.
This is also why a test index would be most welcome.
