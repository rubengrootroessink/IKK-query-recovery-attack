I don't have the code, but I can give an overview of possible
steps:

First inherit from BooleanScorer to implement a score() method that
returns only the coord() value (preferably a precomputed one).
Then inherit from BooleanQuery.BooleanWeight to return the above
Scorer.
Then inherit from BooleanQuery to use the above Weight in createWeight().
Then inherit from QueryParser to use the above Query in getBooleanQuery().
Finally use such a query in a search: the document scores will be
the coord() values.
