In case it is only positional information that is stored in the payload
(i.e. some integer number that does not decrease when tokenizing the
document), it is also possible to use an extra field and make sure the
position increment for that field is only positive when the number
(currently your payload) increases.
A SpanFirstQuery on this extra field would almost do, and you will
probably need https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1093 .
This will be somewhat slower than using a payload, because the search
will be done in two separate fields, but it will work.
