It took some sleep to realize this:
This exception can happen when a scorer is add()'ed to the BooleanScorer after
the query search has begun. Given that it is difficult to reproduce, the odds
are that there two threads not properly synchronized: one add()ing
to the BooleanScorer and one searching the query too soon and
producing the above exception.
