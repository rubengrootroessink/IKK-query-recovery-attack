SUBJECT: Re: Call Lucene default command line Search from PHP script
DATE: 21 Mar 2008

Milu,

This is a PHP problem, not a Lucene one, so you might get better
response at a PHP mailing list.

The easy way around your problem is probably by invoking a shell
script from php that exports the class path as you indicated,
so that java can see the correct classes.

Having said that, you'll probably want to use the PHP/Java extension
to avoid initializing a JVM for each call to lucene.  Try this:
http://www.google.nl/search?q=php+java+org+apache+lucene&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

This was one of the results:
