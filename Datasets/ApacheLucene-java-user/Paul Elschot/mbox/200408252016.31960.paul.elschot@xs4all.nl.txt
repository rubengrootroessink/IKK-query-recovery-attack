You can implement your own HitCollector and pass it to IndexSearcher.search()
Have a look at the javadocs of the org.apache.lucene.search package,
it's quite straightforward. The PriorityQueue from the
util package is useful to collect results. For every distinct score you could
store an int[] of document nrs in there while collecting the hits.
Basically you'll end up implementing your own Hits class.

For URL's that have the same content, it's better
to store multiple URL's for the same document. However, this
merging is normally done by a crawler because the same contents
means the same outgoing URL's. Crawlers also keep track
of multiple host names resolving to the same IP address.

In case you need to crawl and index an intranet or more, have a look
at Nutch.
