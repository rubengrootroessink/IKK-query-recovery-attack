The simplest solution is to index such synonyms at the first or last
or middle position of the source tokens, using a zero position
increment for the synonym. Was this one of the workarounds?

The advantage of the zero position increment is that the original
token positions are not affected, so at least there is no influence
on scoring because of changes in the original token positions.
