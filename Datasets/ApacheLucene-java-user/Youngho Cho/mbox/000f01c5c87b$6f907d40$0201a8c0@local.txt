Would you share what the problem is ?

I used CJKAnalyzer for Korean over 2 years without any problem.
( I remembered that there was some query result problem with StandardAnalyzer at that time
)
But I tring to switch to the StandardAnalyzer again.

Thanks,

Youngho

Hi:

We are running into problems with searching on korean documents. We are
using the StandardAnalyzer and everything works with Chinese and Japanese.
Are there known problems with Korean with Lucene?

Thanks
