SUBJECT: Indexing other documents type than html and txt
DATE: 29 Nov 2001

Hi all,
I have a doubt. I know that lucene can index html and text documents, but
can it index other type of documents like pdf,docs, and xls documents? if it
can, how can I implement it? Perhaps can implement it like html and txt
indexing?

regards

Antonio
