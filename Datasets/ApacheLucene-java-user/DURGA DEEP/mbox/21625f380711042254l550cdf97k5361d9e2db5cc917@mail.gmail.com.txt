SUBJECT: Pointers on Messaging Server and Lucene.
DATE: 5 Nov 2007

Hi Folks,

         we have started on a project ( evaluating ) using Lucene with
our Groupware services ( Messaging / Calendar and IM for now ). Are
there any good pointers or links, we can reference before we start our
evaluation. Any feed back would be of immense help...

Thanks you!
