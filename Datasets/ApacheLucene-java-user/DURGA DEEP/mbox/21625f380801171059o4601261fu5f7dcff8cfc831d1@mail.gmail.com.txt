SUBJECT: Unable to match strings with Underscore / . etc...
DATE: 17 Jan 2008

 HI folks,

         We are facing this problem with able to find the following strings.

For Example:

a.b.c
a_b_c

Are we doing some thing wrong ?. Seems like the ( . / Period Character )  (
_ / Underscore Character ) are being tossed away.

And if we are trying to search for a.b.c we are unable to find it. But we
are able to find abc.

Since we have lots of IP Addresses in our work, this is a severe limitation.
Can some one help ?


Thanks Much
_Durga
