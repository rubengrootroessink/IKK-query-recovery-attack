I have a follow up question. Seems like if I want to use highlighting, we
should store the content of the entire document that has to be indexed.

         d.add( new Field( FIELD_NAME, "some text", Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.TOKENIZED) );

Are there better ways of acheiving this ?. Since we have huge data that
needs to be indexed.

  Thanks Much
