SUBJECT: Word / Pharse match shown in a context
DATE: 29 Jan 2008

Dear All,

         I've been scouring through the Lucene classes. Are there any
classes which can help me acheive the following ?.

         1)  We are an e-mail service provider. We wanted to provide a seach
capability of e-mail messages via Lucene. So far we are able to index/ parse
the e-mail. create the appopriate indexes etc..

              Now The customer wants us to have a google like search
capability i.e when they search for a particular word, the word should be
highlighted as well as the surrounding
              text i.e the context in which this word occurs should also be
shown.

              Example : when searching for the word thread.

              ...crawler is a classic example of Thread in an poolExecutor
code
               an poolExecutor code...

Any help greatly appreciated
