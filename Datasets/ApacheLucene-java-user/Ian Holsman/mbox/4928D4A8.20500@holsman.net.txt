SUBJECT: [ot] a reverse lucene
DATE: 23 Nov 2008

Hi. apologies for the off-topic question.

I was wondering if anyone knew of a open source solution (or a pointer 
to the algorithms)
that do the reverse of lucene.
By that I mean store a whole lot of queries, and run them against a 
document to see which queries match it. (with a score etc)

I can see the case for this would be a news-article and several people 
writing queries to get alerted if it matched a certain condition.


Regards
Ian
