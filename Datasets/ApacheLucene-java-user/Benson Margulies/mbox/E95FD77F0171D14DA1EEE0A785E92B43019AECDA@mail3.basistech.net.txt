If all is well with the lifecycle, should IndexReader.numDocs() return
an accurate count?

No need to close the directory object for that.
Closing the IndexWriter will do.

I think you will find "Lucene In Action" book very useful in
understanding
the life-cycle of an index.

Or you may want to start with the javadocs intro at
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api (see the bottom of that page) and
explore the API from there.
In particular:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWrit
er.html#addDocument(org.apache.lucene.document.Document)
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWrit
er.html#close()

Also relevant are FAQ entries:
