SUBJECT: Extracting TFIDF vectors
DATE: 2 Mar 2009

Hi,

I'm a complete novice at Lucene, and I'm looking for a little bit of help
with something.

How can I extract the TF*IDF vector for each document in the indexed
collection? Also for the query?

I need to build a user-feedback system which manipulates the query based on
the liked and disliked documents from the local collection. This query
modification uses the TF*IDF vectors.

Thanks for your help!
