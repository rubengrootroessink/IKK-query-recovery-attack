See http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/fileformats.html search for fdt

.fdt files are stored field data

When you store a field in the index for later presentation like the title of an HTML document,
you don't apply the analyzer to the data being stored but you do apply it to the data as it
is indexed.

I'd recommend you do some more reading of the resources linked off the main lucene page to
get a better understanding of what Lucene does with your data.

Hello,
 I have used StopAnalyzer as my analyzer but the stop words are not get removed in *.fdt file.
 What could be the case.

I have already sent two mails to this group but I didn't get any response. Please help me
out.
