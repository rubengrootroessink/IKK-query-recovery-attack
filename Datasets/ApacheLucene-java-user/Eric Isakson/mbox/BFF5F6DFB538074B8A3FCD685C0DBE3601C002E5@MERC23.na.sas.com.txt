I think you will have to write a custom analyzer and tokenizer to produce the tokens you need
and you will have to arrange for whatever code you are using to create your query to use that
analyzer in the correct circumstances. I don't think I've seen anyone post about this particular
use case before, so I'd be surprised if there is much other information about it on the lists.

I haven't read Lucene in Action, so I don't know if it is covered there or not. If Erik has
any information on indexing Asian languages, there might be some background there on using
overlapping n-grams. Searching the list archive may give you some background if Lucene in
Action doesn't have enough info on this topic.

That sounds like just what I'm looking for. Do you know if this is covered in Lucene in Action
or where I can find more information about it.

you didn't mean to do this too, but without knowing the exact domain of compound words that
you wish to support, this is probably the best you will be able to do.
