DATE: 6 Jan 2003

Abhay,

This query is processed by the query parser...

((+SEARCH_NAME:dvd +SEARCH_NAME:cd ) OR (+DEF_DOC_FIELD:dvd 
+DEF_DOC_FIELD:cd )) AND ((-SEARCH_NAME:player) OR (-DEF_DOC_F
IELD:player))

and comes out looking like...
+((+SEARCH_NAME:dvd +SEARCH_NAME:cd) (+DEF_DOC_FIELD:dvd +DEF_DOC_FIELD:cd)) +((-SEARCH_NAME:player)
(-DEF_DOC_FIELD:player))
Using org.apache.lucene.search.Query.toString(String fieldName)

I use this representation as it shows me what happened after my query was processed by the
QueryParser and Analyzer, so stop words would be removed and case modified if the analyzer
does such things.


This part...
+((+SEARCH_NAME:dvd +SEARCH_NAME:cd) (+DEF_DOC_FIELD:dvd +DEF_DOC_FIELD:cd))
will produce a set of documents as hits that have the "dvd" and "cd" terms in those fields

This part...
+((-SEARCH_NAME:player) (-DEF_DOC_FIELD:player))
will always produce an empty set

when the two sets are joined with an intersection, you will always get an empty set

The problem is that when using NOT or - operator, it excludes documents from the set of found
documents not the set of all documents. This is correct Lucene behavior. So, since their are
no found documents in that required part of the query, your results will always be no hits.

This is mentioned in the jGuru FAQ at http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=593598

Rearranging the query the way you mentioned is the correct way to deal with this.

...

However, when I try to do this in a single query by grouping I get no result
((+SEARCH_NAME:dvd +SEARCH_NAME:cd ) OR (+DEF_DOC_FIELD:dvd 
+DEF_DOC_FIELD:cd )) AND ((-SEARCH_NAME:player) OR (-DEF_DOC_F
IELD:player))

I don't get any results on a single term query like this (and this explains 
why I am not getting any results in above query)
-SEARCH_NAME:player
Is this a known issue?

Is there any way of dealing with above-mentioned problem other than 
rearranging query like this?
(+SEARCH_NAME:dvd +SEARCH_NAME:cd -SEARCH_NAME:player) OR 
(+DEF_DOC_FIELD:dvd +DEF_DOC_FIELD:cd -DEF_DOC_FIELD:player)

Thanks
Abhay
