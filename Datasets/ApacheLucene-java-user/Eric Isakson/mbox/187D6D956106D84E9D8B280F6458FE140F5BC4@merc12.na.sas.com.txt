DATE: 30 Apr 2003

When looking into something similar to this in the past, I noticed that when an anlalyzer returns
multiple tokens the query parser treated them like a phrase, so when your document was indexed
with the word:

foo

Then your search analyzer turns foo into the tokens:

foo
bar

Your query object will be looking for the phrase "foo bar" and your document only has the
token foo so you get no hits.

I noticed this when I was running the unit tests against a modified version of the query parser.

I suspect this is what is causing your trouble, though I don't know how to "fix" it, you might
consider taking the query parser code as a baseline and roll your own that behaves a little
differently.

Here is the snip of code from QueryParser that does this:

protected Query org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.getFieldQuery(String field,
                                Analyzer analyzer,
                                String queryText) {
    // Use the analyzer to get all the tokens, and then build a TermQuery,
    // PhraseQuery, or nothing based on the term count

    TokenStream source = analyzer.tokenStream(field,
                                              new StringReader(queryText));
    Vector v = new Vector();
    org.apache.lucene.analysis.Token t;

    while (true) {
      try {
        t = source.next();
      }
      catch (IOException e) {
        t = null;
      }
      if (t == null)
        break;
      v.addElement(t.termText());
    }
    if (v.size() == 0)
      return null;
    else if (v.size() == 1)
      return new TermQuery(new Term(field, (String) v.elementAt(0)));
    else {
      PhraseQuery q = new PhraseQuery();
      q.setSlop(phraseSlop);
      for (int i=0; i<v.size(); i++) {
        q.add(new Term(field, (String) v.elementAt(i)));
      }
      return q;
    }
  }

Hi,

I had (and have) exactly the same problem: My postfix reducer returns an unstemmend and a
stemmed version of the word; but using this analyzer during search will give 
me either less than expected or no hits.

However, using analyzers during indexing that produce more than one token has 
other disadvantages anyway: the index gets much larger and searches therefore slower. 
I would like to use this kind of analyzer therefore only during search, but the 
behavior described above prevents this too.

So, again, is this a bug or did we overlook something?

Regards,

Karsten

Betreff: Analyzer use at search time?


I've written an analyzer which uses a filter which I wrote which invokes LVG's (http://umlslex.nlm.nih.gov/lvg/2003/index.html)
norm function on each token, and then, if there is more than one result for the token, it
puts all of the results into the same position as the original term (via setPositionIncrement(0)).
 This works great while indexing documents.

When my filter is run, LVG's norm turns the word "leaves" into "leaf" and "leave".  My filter
returns 3 tokens - leaves (position increment 1) leaf (0) and leave(0).

Now, when I search, if I provide the same LVG enabled analyzer, when I search for the word
"leaves" I get 0 hits.  I can see that it calls the norm function, and this returns the same
three words again as I would expect it to.  But I get 0 hits, even though all 3 words are
in the index.

If I search with an analyzer that does not have LVG in its flow, I get the correct hits each
of these searches - 

leaves
leaf
leave

So, is there a bug in the way that analyzers are used during a search - in that it does not
expect the analyzer to return more than one word in a single spot - or am I misusing lucene?


Thanks, 

Dan
