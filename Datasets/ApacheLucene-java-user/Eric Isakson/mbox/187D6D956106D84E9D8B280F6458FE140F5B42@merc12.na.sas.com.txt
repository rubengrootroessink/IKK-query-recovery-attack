Have a look at the source for org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.jj the production in
the grammar for the AND operator is:

  <AND:       ("AND" | "&&") >

and I didn't see anywhere that the token "AND" was being treated any different than the token
"&&"

The query parser does not ignore these.

The queries

10060 && 10040

and

10060 AND 10040

and 

+10060 +10040

should be equivalent.

Have you tried isolating this in a test case outside of your web application, that would help
you be certain this is or is not a Lucene problem. It should be pretty simple to test.

It is a web app, but I am absolutely sure it is correct. 
I just wrote a log.debug() to prove this. 
I suppose lucene simply ignores AND and OR, because OR is default anyway.
But it does not ignore && .
