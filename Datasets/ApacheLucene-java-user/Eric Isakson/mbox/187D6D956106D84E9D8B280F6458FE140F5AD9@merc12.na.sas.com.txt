Hi Roy,

One of the things I do with my query tool is show the user what happened to the query after
it went through the query parser and analyzer. You might try producing your Query object then
dump it out somewhere for examination using the Query.toString(String defaultField) method.

I get results like:

report AND title:search
becomes
+report +title:search

report AND title:search OR as
becomes
+report +title:search
Note that here "as" is a stop word, so the query is the same

(report OR HaPPy) AND (title:SeArCH OR Ju?k)
becomes
+(report happy) +(title:search Ju?k)
Notice the analyzer normalized the case of all the tokens except the one with the wildcard
character

Subject: QueryParser searches


Hey guys,

We have a question about how the QueryParser class optimizes searches, if it
does at all.  We have some searches that are taking an abnormal amount of
time.  Our search string specifies 3-4 fields separated by ORs with a single
term each, and another field searching for many terms separated by a bunch
of ORs.  So it looks kind of like this:

Field1:( term1 term2 term3 term4 ... termN ) && ( Field2: termx || Field3:
termy || Field4: termz ) )

Does the QueryParser class do anything to optimize its search for this?  Or
is there a better way to do this?

Thanx.

Roy.
