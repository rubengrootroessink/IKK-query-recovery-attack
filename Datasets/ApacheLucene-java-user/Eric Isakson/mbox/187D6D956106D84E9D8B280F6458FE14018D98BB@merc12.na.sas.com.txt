I think this info is available via the Manifest that is created during the build. This is cut
from the build.xml from the latest CVS...

        <!-- Create Jar MANIFEST file -->
                <echo file="${build.manifest}">Manifest-Version: 1.0
Created-By: Apache Jakarta

Name: org/apache/lucene
Specification-Title: Lucene Search Engine
Specification-Version: ${version}
Specification-Vendor: Lucene
Implementation-Title: org.apache.lucene
Implementation-Version: build ${DSTAMP} ${TSTAMP}
Implementation-Vendor: Lucene
</echo>

This is only added to the core jar, there is no such Manifest generated for the demo jar.

Hi,

Would it be possible for Lucene to provide package informations? 
Basically all the java.lang.Package attributes... Things like 
implementation vendor, name, version and so on... This would make it 
easier to identify which packages/versions are used.

Thanks.

PA.
