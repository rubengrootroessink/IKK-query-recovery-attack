I think Erik Hatcher commented on a similar problem the other day. When QueryParser handles
a * query which it creates as a prefix query, the token the prefix query is built from is
not analyzed.

StandardAnalyzer would turn abc$def into two tokens "abc" and "def"

QueryParser would take query 2 and build a PrefixQuery with "abc" as the prefix and query
3 as a PrefixQuery with "abc$" as the prefix.

There are probably a million valid reasons why this is appropriate default behavior for QueryParser.
One off the top of my head is that with a stemming analyzer, you may not get an approriate
stem if you analyzed the prefix. In this case, if this is not appropriate behavior for your
application, you should probably create a custom query parser with different behavior.

Here is the snip of QueryParser.jj that builds the query objects. The only one that is analyzed
is the field query. The term productions generally break on whitespace and special unescaped
query operators (see the .jj file for the full details):

       term=<TERM>
       | term=<PREFIXTERM> { prefix=true; }
       | term=<WILDTERM> { wildcard=true; }
       | term=<NUMBER>
     )
     [ <FUZZY> { fuzzy=true; } ]
     [ <CARAT> boost=<NUMBER> [ <FUZZY> { fuzzy=true; } ] ]
     {
       String termImage=discardEscapeChar(term.image);
       if (wildcard) {
       q = getWildcardQuery(field, termImage);
       } else if (prefix) {
         q = getPrefixQuery(field,
           discardEscapeChar(term.image.substring
          (0, term.image.length()-1)));
       } else if (fuzzy) {
         q = getFuzzyQuery(field, termImage);
       } else {
         q = getFieldQuery(field, analyzer, termImage);
       }
     }

Are you indexing your documents with the same Analyzer?
Are you using QueryParser?
Are you able to get query 3) to work when using queries directly, without a QueryParser?
