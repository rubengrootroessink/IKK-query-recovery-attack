It seems that since the index document number value is a positive int, this restricts the
number of documents in an index to ( 2^31 - 1 ) = 2,147,483,647.

Do I misunderstand?

I mean, that's enough for me, but it seems a kind of surprising restriction, considering long
could be used instead for unimaginably large numbers of documents.  Well, I grant I probably
can't imagine 2 billion documents either, but google can.

Just curious, sorry to bother anyone.
