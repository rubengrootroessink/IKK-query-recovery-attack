What is wrong with Document.setBoost(float)
/** Sets a boost factor for hits on any field of this document.  This value
 * will be multiplied into the score of all hits on this document.
 */

If you know you are indexing a certain kind of page and your application using Lucene wants
to lower the importance of those pages, set this to some low number like .2 when you are adding
them to the index.

Do you mean the hit lists, which often list low rank pages (i.e. JavaDoc 
APIs) before solid project pages? ;-)

Unfortunately, Lucene does not implement any mechanism that would be 
able to eliminate this behaviour IMHO.
