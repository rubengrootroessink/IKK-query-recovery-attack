I attached a patch to

Bugzilla Bug 19468  
   Lucene 1.3-rc1 does not build against JavaCC 3.0
http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19468

But they haven't been added to CVS. You should use the last two attachments. I couldn't figure
out how to delete my first 3 attachments which had some of my initial attempts at a patch
for this problem.

Has anyone else tried these yet?

Eric

Hi

Has anyone made the changes to the Lucene codebase/build process for the latest version of
JavaCC?  Version 2 is pretty hard to come by these days (I managed to get a copy from one
of the developers), but I also tweaked the Lucene code to build with version 3...but that
also required downloading the lastest Ant build, since the JavaCC optional task was also configured
for version 2.

Thanks
