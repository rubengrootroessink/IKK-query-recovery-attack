Hi,

I wonder if the behavior of my application using Lucene respects the
behavior of Lucene when I perform a search.

I search for a word "Qvar" and I have 2 documents containing that exact
word. I get 2 results representing the 2 documents that I want.
Everything seems ok there, but I get other results that contains words
that starts with Q, P, O, and N but not the word I am looking for. I
detected an inverse alphabetic pattern. Is that normal ? Is this a kind
of ressemble search technic ?

Thanks in advance,

MHF
