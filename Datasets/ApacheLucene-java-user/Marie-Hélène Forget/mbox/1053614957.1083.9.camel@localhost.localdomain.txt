DATE: 22 May 2003

Hi,

I am trying to write a delete method using delete(int docNum) from the
IndexReader class. The problem is that I don't know how to get the
docNum parameter. Can you please help me.

My idea was to perform a search and to delete the documents found. Is
that possible or is there another way around ?

PS: I tried to use delete(Term term), but it did not work. The document
was not deleted.

Thanks for your help:)

MHF
