Yonik, Klaus, thanks for your quick response.

Let me rephrase, i can't compare currently processed document with all
documents in my collection using angle between documents in
terms-vector space because of performance issues. As far as i can see,
i can avoid unnecessary operations. At first, i can build query from
document terms, fetch top N results and compute angle only for them.
Is it ok?

The second question is
How to generate some information about documents similarity to store
in lucene index?
For example, hash with the same values for similar documents or
something like that.
Thus it would be easy to filter "supplemental" results.
