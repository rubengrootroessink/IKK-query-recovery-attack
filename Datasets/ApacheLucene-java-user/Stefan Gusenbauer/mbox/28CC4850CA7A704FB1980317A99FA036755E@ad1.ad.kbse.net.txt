SUBJECT: AW: Scoring by number of terms in field
DATE: 10 Jan 2006

I think this will work because in number 1 europe is the only word in the title which means
it has a higher weight than the word Europe in number 2. In number 2 there are more words
around Europe and so on with number 3.
As I can remember the scoring algorithm should exactly reproduce this result if the body isn't
regarded at. But in the body the words are usually weighed lower because it contains more
words. 

Hope this helps!
stefan

This will ensure that match 4 appears at the end, but as far as I can see 
this won't help with getting matches 1-3 ordered correctly? Note that match 
1 for example may have a "description" field that contains a lot terms, but 
no mention of the query term.
