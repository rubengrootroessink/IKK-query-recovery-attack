SUBJECT: Boosting a token in the query
DATE: 29 Mar 2006

Is there a way to boost a token while querying? Example, in the
following query +(DESC:sheets DESC:sheet), can the token 'sheets' be
boosted and given higher precedence over 'sheet' so the results matching
'sheets ' appear before those for 'sheet'? I am using lucene 1.2. I
tried using the boost factor for 'sheets' so the query would read:
+(DESC:sheets^2.0 DESC:sheet), but that did not help.

 

I have read overriding getFieldQuery of QueryParser would help boost
terms/tokens, but this is not available in lucene 1.2. Nor is the
IndexSearcher's explain method. 

 

Any ideas on how this can be accomplished?

 

Thanks.
