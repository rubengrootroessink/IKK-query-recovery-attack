SUBJECT: Write.lock error with spellchecker
DATE: 14 Mar 2006

I am trying to use the spellchecker plugin with Lucene 1.2. I get the
following exception when my SpellIndexer class tries to create the spell
index. The new directory is being created with all the correct
permissions. There is no write.lock file being created. Has someone run
into similar issue? Does this have to do with lucene1.2?

 

Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: couldn't delete
write.lock
