Hi,

So we've implemented both suggestions and it made a big difference.
You can see a Beta sample at

http://www.fastbuzz.com/search/index.jsp

We have around 7,000,000 items in the index.

What we did:
1. Instead of using msec granularity, we're using hour granularity for
date searches. This reduced search times from tens of seconds to 2-5
seconds. No ideal, but ...
2. We cache the results. So if you're looking for items in the last 15
days and then do a "next" it'll save the filter using
CachingWrapperFilter and reuse it, resulting in much faster times the
second time.
This reduces the times from the above 2-5 secons to 0.2 - 0.8 msecs.

One of the challenges though is that since the index is updated in real
time, we can't cache for very long. We'll probably have to set up a
mechanism to "seed" the cache before the "new" index becomes available.

Regards,

Dror
