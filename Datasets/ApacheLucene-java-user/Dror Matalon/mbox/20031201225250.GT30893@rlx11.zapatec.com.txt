SUBJECT: Re: disable locks on read only indexes (performance improvement?)
DATE: 1 Dec 2003

Let us know what you find out. I would guess that the gains are not
going to be that spectacular. Creating and deleting files should be
"cheap" operations in a modern OS. Mainly when you compare these to the
costs of openning a new index and populating various caches.
But let us know what you find.

Dror
