Based on my experience it'll be slower if you use large object and
significantly slower if you don't. The db just can't push data as fast
as NFS does, and NFS has caching on the client side. 

We tested some of these issues at some point, and I wish I had the
numbers in front of me.
THere are some numbers at:

That's a very good reason. But again, if you do this, you'll slow
performance even more. Still for small indexes where data integrity is
important it could help.

That's a compelling argument. For small indexes it might be the best
solution. 

I'd be interested in seeing some benchmarks using SQLDirectory compared
to local file.

By the way, we *are* using NFS. We just make sure that the reader uses a
snapshot of the index.
