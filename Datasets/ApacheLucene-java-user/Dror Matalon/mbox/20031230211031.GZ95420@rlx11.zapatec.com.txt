Oops, my mistake.

I don't think this is a good idea. Mostly because it would be hard to
explain/document, and you don't want end users to have to think and read
a lot of documentation when doing a search.

For one thing, I would advocate for using the '+' notation as the
underlying syntax and migrating to boolean operators since that's many
more people are used to that syntax, and I believe it's better
understood.

At first I was inclined to agree but as a rule I think we should adopt
the WWGD (What Would Google Do) philosophy, since that's the syntax and
behavior that most people are used to.

It looks like it basically adds an "AND" between any two terms that
don't have operator between them. We could do the same for both the
default AND and the default OR. Once you've done that, you just use the
standard boolean logic precedence rule.

Now the good news on all of this is that it seems (I did a small test),
that if you use parenthesis the parser does the right thing. In my mind,
it's a good idea to use parenthesis whenever you're creating complex
expressions.

And Erik indicated that they're here anyway, so it's fine.
