I see. So for large data sets when a small number of items are returned,
it might be cheaper to just fetch the documents and see if they fall in
the date range.

I did some timing tests and it looks like time is spent in the actual
query rather than in creating the filter object. This seems to
contradict your suggestion here, or am I misunderstanding how filters
work?
