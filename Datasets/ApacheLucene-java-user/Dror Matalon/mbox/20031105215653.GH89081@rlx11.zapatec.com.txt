Hi JT,

Are you the same person that posted earlier about the server with
16Gig RAM?

Also, what is the project that you're looking at? Are you really looking
at creating a google news type of service?

Are you already running a news server?

As far as parsing headers, I would guess that the javamail api should
work since news and email headers are very similar. I'm not really
too worried about that part. 

The main challenge as I see it, is to fetch the items, store them, and
then index them with Lucene.

Regards,

Dror
