SUBJECT: Term Vector support
DATE: 27 Feb 2004

Hi folks,

I'm trying to get a better understanding of term vector support. Looking
at lucene-dev I'm understanding that with each document you store the
list of terms and their frequencies. Is this correct? 
What uses are there for term vector other than "more like this"?
