So each posting is roughly 3K. More than I would have thought, but not
too surprising. 
The main reason I asked about how many days, is to get the sense of
growth. 15 Gig is a big index, but to understand the performance
repercussions the rate of growth is equally important. I suspect that by
the time you hit 100 gigs, you'll have one of the biggest indexes around
and you'll have to throw quite heavy hardware or distribute the load to 
get reasonable performance.
