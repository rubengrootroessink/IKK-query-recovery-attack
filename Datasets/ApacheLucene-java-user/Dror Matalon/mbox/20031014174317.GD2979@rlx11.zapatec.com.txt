Looks like I misunderstood. I looked through the FAQs and didn't find
much information on race condition with searching and indexing and how
lucene locks things. The race condition that I'm talking about is the
fact that if you do a search while you update the index files, you need
to be careful during the transition from the old data to the new one.
I imagine that the process involves renaming files since that's atomic
on most systems, but It'd be nice to have a clearer picture.
