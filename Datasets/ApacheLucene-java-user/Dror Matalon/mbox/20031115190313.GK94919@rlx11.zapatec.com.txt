SUBJECT: Re: AW: Slow response time with datefilter
DATE: 15 Nov 2003

After posting the original email, I started wondering if that's the
issue, the fact that we store timestamp up to the millisecond rather
than a more reasonable granularity. Dates are too high a granularity for
us, but minutes, and possibly hours should work.

I'll report once we've tested some more.

Regards,

Dror
