At this point, we're just doing additions.

Actually, rather than relying on the GC, my plan is to always have two
indexed open, the current one and the previous one, and when I detect
that it's time to switch, I then close the oldest index. Luckily in a
web environment, we know that searches are not going to be around for
several minutes, and I make sure that my indexes don't change more often
than every 15 minutes.

Thanks for the prompt and detailed feedback.
