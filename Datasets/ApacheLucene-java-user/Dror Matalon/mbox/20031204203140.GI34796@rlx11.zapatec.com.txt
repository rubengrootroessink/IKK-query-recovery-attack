Great,

I'm working on it in my "spare time" so it's not moving as fast as it
could, but I suspect that's true about most of the developers.

What I got:

o Uses standard readline commands so all the usual things like ^P, ^N,
tab completion, etc work as expcted.  BUT to support this part you'll
need an external shared library since you can't do this in java.

o The following help command displays the current supported commands:

lucli> help
count: Return the number of hits for a search. Exaple count foo
explain: Explanation that describes how the document scored against
query. SLOW
help: Display help about commands. Type help command for specific help
about a certain command.
index: Choose a different lucene index
info: Display info about the current Lucene Index. Example:info
optimize: Optimzie the current index
quit: Quit/exit the program
search: Search the current index. Example: search foo
terms: Show the first 100 terms in this index. Supply a field name to
only show terms in a specific field.
tokens: Does a search and shows the top 10 tokens for each document.
Verbose!

o Here's an example of a search:

lucli> search dror
