SUBJECT: Lucene command line tool
DATE: 25 Nov 2003

Hi,

I looked around the archives and didn't see anything about this subject.
Is there a Lucene command line tool that lets you look at an index, run
queries, and look at different metrics?

Something similar to Luke http://www.getopt.org/luke/, except that it'd
run on the command line, have a history, etc.

Regards,

Dror
