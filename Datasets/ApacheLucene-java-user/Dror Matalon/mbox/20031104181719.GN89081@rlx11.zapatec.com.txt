Kind of similar in that a news item and an email have very similar
structure. 

On the other hand trying to replicate google news is a major project.
You need to run a news server which last time I looked wasn't a small
task, and then you need to have enough storage, enough bandwidth and
enough disk space to hold all of this.

Do you know how many daily articles there are in a daily feed? What is
the average size of a news item? Probably similar to email.
