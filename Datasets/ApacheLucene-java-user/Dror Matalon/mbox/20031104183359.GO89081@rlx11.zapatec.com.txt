Hi,

By the way, we're also thinking of integrating newsgroups into RSS
aggregator which you can see at  www.fastbuzz.com. 

Are you interested in comparing notes, or possibly pooling resources? We
have plenty of technical resources, and we've run news servers before,
although it's been a few years.

Regards,

Dror
