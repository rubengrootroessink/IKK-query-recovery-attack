Hi,

I might be the only person on the list who's having a hard time
following this discussion. Would one of you wise folks care to point me
to a good "dummies", also known as an executive summary, resource about
the theoretical background of all of this. I understand the basic
premise of collecting the "words" and having pointers to documents and
weights, but beyond that ...

TIA,

Dror

i have been looking into how to do this in Lucene and so far, it's not been promising. the
indexing engine and file format needs to be changed. there are very few search engines that
incorporate interterm correlation in any mathematically and linguistically rigorous manner.
i designed a couple, but they were all research experiments.

to TREC-7 questions produced about 0.05 to 0.10 improvement in average precision by proper
use of interterm correlation. my project at the time was cancelled after TREC-7 and so there
haven't been any new developments.
