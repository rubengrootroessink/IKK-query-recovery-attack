Just a comment, I'm not really answering the questions you ask.

It would seem that frequency and, possibly, spelling play a big role in
google's "did you mean" strategy.

So if instead of searching "lucen index java" it suggests "lucent index
java" instead of what I was searching for "lucene index java" because
lucent shows up much more often than lucene. 

It looks like for the most part this strategy works fine. I know that
it's not too hard to get a list of words and their frequencies, but I'm
not sure what the performence implication would be. Also, you'd need to
figure out a misspelling strategy, but I suspect that's not too hard.
