SUBJECT: segments' size and getMaxMergeDocs()
DATE: 30 Aug 2006

If IndexWriter.getMaxMergeDocs() always returns M
then which one is true:
1) No segment file will ever contain > M documents;
2) Any segment that participates in a merge contains <= M documents (but 
the resulting segment of the merge may contain > M documents)

Obviously (1) implies (2) but my guess (based on my practical 
experience) is that only (2) is true.
