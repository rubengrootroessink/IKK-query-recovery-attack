SUBJECT: threadsafe QueryParser?
DATE: 9 Oct 2006

Method
static public Query parse(String query, String field, Analyzer analyzer)
in class QueryParser is deprecated in 1.9.1 and the suggestion is: /"Use 
an instance of QueryParser and the {@link #parse(String)} method instead."/
My question is: in the context of multi threaded app, is it safe that 
distinct threads utilize the same instance of QueryParser for parsing 
their queries?

ps. After writing this letter, I incidentally ran into the answer in the 
end of the class comment of QueryParser:
/ * <p>Note that QueryParser is <em>not</em> thread-safe.</p>/

So, is this it?
