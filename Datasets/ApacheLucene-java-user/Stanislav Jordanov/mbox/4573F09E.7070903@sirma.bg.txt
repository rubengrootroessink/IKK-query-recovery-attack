DATE: 4 Dec 2006

Guys,

there's another aspect of the index optimize operation, that confuses us 
a lot - the free disk space it requires to complete successfully.
Initially we thought that an amount of free disk space equal to the 
index size (prior to optimization) should suffice.
Then it became clear that having the Index opened for reading (i.e. 
searching) while optimizing it prevents old segments from being deletion.
So let us assume that nobody else is touching the index except the 
optimize method itself.
How much free disk space should be there (with respect to the index 
size) in order for the optimize to complete successfully?

Stanislav
