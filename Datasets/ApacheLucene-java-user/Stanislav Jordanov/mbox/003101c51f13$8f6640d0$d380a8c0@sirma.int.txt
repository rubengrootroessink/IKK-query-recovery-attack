You're rihgt:  nHits - nHits == 0 :)
But I did the right tests - it just happened that I've sent you a wrong
source.
I mean I performed the tests accessing the proper last doc: doc(nHits - 1)
then I switched to accessing the first hit, just to make sure (once again)
there is essential difference in access times.
And instead of wiping out the code fragment (nHits - 1) and replacing it
with 0, a replaced 1 with nHits.
That's how the resulting (nHits - nHits) code got posted.

Yes, the index is stored at a local hard drive.
