SUBJECT: Custom filters & document numbers
DATE: 24 Feb 2005

Given an IndexReader a custom filter is supposed to create a bit set, that
maps each document numbers to {'visible', 'invisible'}
On the other hand, it is stated that Lucene is allowed to change document
numbers.
Is it guaranteed that this BitSet's view of document numbers won't change
while the BitSet is still in use (or perhaps the corresponding IndexReader
is still opened) ?

And another (more low-level) question.
When Lucene may change document numbers?
Is it only when the index is optimized after there has been a delete
operation?
