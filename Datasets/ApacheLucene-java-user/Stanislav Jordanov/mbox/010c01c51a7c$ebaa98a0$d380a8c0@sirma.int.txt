The first statement is clear to me:
I know that an IndexReader sees a 'snapshot' of the document set that was
taken in the moment of the Reader's creation.

What I don't know is whether this 'snapshot' has also its doc numbers fixed
or they may change asynchronously.
And another thing I don't know is what are the index operations that may
cause the (doc -> doc number) mapping to change.
Is it only after delete or there are other ocasions, or I'd better not count
on this at all.
