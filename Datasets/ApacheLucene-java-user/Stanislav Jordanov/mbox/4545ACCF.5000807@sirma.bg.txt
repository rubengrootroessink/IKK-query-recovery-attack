SUBJECT: Re: Putting some constraints on index optimization
DATE: 30 Oct 2006

Hi Mike,

By optimizing (in this particular case) I seek to minimize the disk 
space used by the index files.
My index is incremental - docs get added and deleted on the fly.
There is also a user defined constraint of total index size (in terms of 
disk space).
There is another user defined constraint of max segments size which is 
approximated by IndexWriter.MAX_MERGE_DOCS
When this max index size is reached, I would like to first try optimize 
the index
which (if I am not mistaken) will remove from each segment the documents 
marked as deleted thus saving some space.
Correct or am I missing something?

Regards,
Stanislav
