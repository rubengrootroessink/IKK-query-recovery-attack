/Michael,
For a moment I wondered what exactly do you mean by "compound file"?
Then I read http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/fileformats.html and got 
the idea.
I do not have access to that specific machine that all this is happening at.
It is a 80x86 machine running Win 2003 server;
Sorry, but they neglected my question about the index is stored on a 
Local FS or on a NFS.
I was only able to obtain a directory listing of the index dir and guess 
what - there's no a /*_1j8s.cfs * /file at all!
Pitty, I can't have a look at segments file, but I guess it lists the _1j8s
Given these scarce resources, can you give me some further advise about 
what has happened and what can be done to prevent it from happening again?

Regards,
Stanislav
