Thank you Stefan,
unfortunately, our situation is a bit different - we are not caching 
parsed docs in any way.
When a document is parsed it is indexed immediately.
So in our case it is not the accumulation of documents waiting to be 
indexed that causes the OutOfMemory exception.
I believe it is a "pure lucene" issue - just as at some point when the 
next doc is added to the index, and this causes (perhaps)
the merging of segments, the memory consumption raises drastically.
