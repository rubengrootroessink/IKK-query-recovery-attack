SUBJECT: Putting some constraints on index optimization
DATE: 26 Oct 2006

Have the following problem with (explicitly invoked) index optimization -
it seems to always merge all existing index segments into a single huge 
segment, which is undesirable in my case.
Is there a way to force index optimization to honor the  
IndexWriter.MAX_MERGE_DOCS setting?

Stanislav
