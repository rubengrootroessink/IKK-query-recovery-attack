SUBJECT: Split an existing index into smaller segments without a re-index?
DATE: 16 Aug 2006

I searched the mail list archives for an answer to that question;
The closest (and perhaps the only) thread in this regard that I found is:

http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/9928


So the answer was "No", but this is way back in the mid 2004 (2 years ago).
Is there a solution to that problem now?

Stanislav
