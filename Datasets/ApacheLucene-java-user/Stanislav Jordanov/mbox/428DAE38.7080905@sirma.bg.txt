SUBJECT: a "real" PhrasePrefixQuery
DATE: 20 May 2005

Is there a Lucene Query (or something that will do a job) like:
"Star Wars tri*"

that will match all docs containing a 3 word phrase: 'Star' followed by 
'Wars' followed by a word starting with 'tri'.

I.e. the above query will match both "Star Wars trilogy" and "Star Wars 
triumph".

(I know about PhrasePrefixQuery and I know it is does something totally 
different, that's why I've named my post this way ;)


Regards,
Stanislav
