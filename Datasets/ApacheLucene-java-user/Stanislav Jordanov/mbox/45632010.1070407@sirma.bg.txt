SUBJECT: Querying performance decrease in 1.9.1 and 2.0.0
DATE: 21 Nov 2006

Hi guys,

We've identified a significant querying performance decrease after 
switching from Lucene 1.4.3 to 1.9.1.
It is steadily demonstrated no mater if the concurrent querying threads 
are 1, 2, 4 or 8 (or even more) -
If N queries are executed against 1.9.1 for a given time, then 1.4.3 
executes approx. 1.5 * N queries for the same time.
Lucene 2.0.0 behaves just like 1.9.1 in terms of querying performance.

Any idea what may be causing this behavior?
Or is it just the Windows (tm) syndrome - every newer version requires 
more powerful hardware to deliver the same performance?

Regards,
Stanislav
