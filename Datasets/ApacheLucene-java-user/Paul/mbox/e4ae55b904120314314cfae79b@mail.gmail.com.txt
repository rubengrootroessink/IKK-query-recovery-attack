SUBJECT: restricting search result
DATE: 3 Dec 2004

Hi,
how yould you restrict the search results for a certain user? I'm
indexing all the existing data in my application but there are certain
access levels so some users should see more results then an other.
Each lucene document has a field with an internal id and I want to
restrict on that basis. I tried it with adding a long concatenation of
my ids ("+locationId:1 +locationId:3 + ...") but this throws a "More
than 32 required/prohibited clauses in query." exception.
Any suggestions?
thx!
Paul
