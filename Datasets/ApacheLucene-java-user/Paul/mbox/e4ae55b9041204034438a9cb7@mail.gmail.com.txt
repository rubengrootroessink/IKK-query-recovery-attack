The thing with the different indexes sound too complecated because the
users (and their rights) as well as the index itself change quite

but a filter is applied after the whole search is performed, isn't it?
I thought it might be faster to restrict the search space in advance

d'oh, yes of course..

ok, that sounds very nice and works fine. But I will have a closer
look at the filter as well.

Thank you all
