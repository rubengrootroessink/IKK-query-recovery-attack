My initial reaction to the first post was to use rsync too. I was about
to post that, when I read Ype's post. ;-)

Another option is to do what we're doing, and write a daemon
which talks to Lucene on the server it runs on, and also serves
requests coming in on a specific port. That way many clients
can have the benefit of one index.

You are welcome to our source, once we've got it to a stage
where we can wrap it all up nicely and Open Source it. As
it stands it is currently working well in a beta form.

Cheers,
Paul.
