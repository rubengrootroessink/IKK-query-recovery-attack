First index your docs with all fields that are queried on, and storing the
db key.For each query check the terms to see if the any non-metadata (Lucene)
query data has been submitted, If so, run a Lucene query, and build a
resultset of keys. If not, go straight to the database and do the same with a
standard db query.

The Lucene returns are then filled in with a database lookup for each doc
in the returned resultset to provide metadata.

Cheers,
Paul.
