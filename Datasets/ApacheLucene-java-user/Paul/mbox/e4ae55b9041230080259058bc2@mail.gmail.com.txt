Alternative: create a hashed value which is unique within your DB
(e.g. use md5). Afterwards you can delete documents from the index
with the IndexReader(Term).
Without that additional field you can use the IndexSearcher to
retrieve your documents from the index and then use
IndexReader(DocNum) to delete these documents
