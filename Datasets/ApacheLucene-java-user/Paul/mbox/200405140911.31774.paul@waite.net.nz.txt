Yes, we were querying on a datetime field (seconds resolution). We
re-indexed with a date field instead, since people querying were only
generally interested in day resolution for filtering.

We retained the datetime as a stored field.

We index about a 1,000+ articles per day, so this reduced the typical
number of boolean terms in a date-range query by a factor of 1,000.

The retained datetime stored field allows us to post-sort resultsets in
datetime order.

Cheers,
Paul.
