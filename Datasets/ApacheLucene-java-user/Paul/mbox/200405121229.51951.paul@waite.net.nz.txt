For date handling and querying we munge the datetime in seconds to be
a lexicographically ordered value, but the standard YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
string format is just as good.

Because in our app people are generally interested in day granularity rather
than seconds for date-range querying, we index on a date value and use
that field for queries. However for subsequent sorting we have a full datetime
value which is a stored Lucene field.

Since we index about 1,000 articles per day, this means the boolean term
expansion, based on the date, is at an acceptable level (in the 10's usually)
whereas trying to utilize the datetime field for that would generally require
1,000x more and cause resource problems.

Cheers,
Paul.
