SUBJECT: retrieving added document
DATE: 23 Nov 2004

Hi,
I'm creating a document and adding it with a writer to the index. For
some reason I need to add data to this specific document later on
(minutes, not hours or days). Is it possible to retrieve it and add
additonal data?
I found the document(int n) - method within the IndexReader (btw: the
description makes no sense for me: "Returns the stored fields of the
nth Document in this index." - but it returns a Document and not a
list of fields..) but where do I get that number from? (and the
numbers change, I know..)

thanks for any help

Paul
