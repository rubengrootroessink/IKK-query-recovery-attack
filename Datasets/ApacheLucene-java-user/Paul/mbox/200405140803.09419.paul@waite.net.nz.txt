Also look at any range queries you have. Depending on the range and the
number of terms in your index within that range you could potentially have
a lot of boolean query terms being generated.

Pre Lucene 1.3-Final, we did not appreciate this, and had a lot of Out of
Memory exceptions occurring. In 1.3-Final a limit on boolean query terms
was intorduced, and this revealed our problem. We re-organised our index
tin the light of that, and have had no exceptions since.

Cheers,
Paul.
