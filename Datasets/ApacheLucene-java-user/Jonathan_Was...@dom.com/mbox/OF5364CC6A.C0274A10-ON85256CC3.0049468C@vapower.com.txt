For Lotus Notes... yes... sort of.  You'll have to either go through the
local file system using Lotus's Notes java libraries or you web-crawl the
documents that are exposed to the web via the database's URLs.  Be aware
that when web-crawling, Notes databases can be a little frustrating.
"Twisties" and "Calendars" can throw your web-crawler into a seemingly
endless loop.  This is because they appear to offer a neverending list of
new URLs.  It helps as a "best practice" to encourage your Notes developers
to avoid these widgets if at all possible.  Sorry, don't use Verity.

Am I able to use Lucene to search Lotus Notes databases?  How about Verity
Indexes?
