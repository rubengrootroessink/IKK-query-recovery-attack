Found the problem.  Not related to memory.  May actually be a bug in
initial distribution of HTMLParser.jj.  If you have a title with a huge
number of characters (in my case 652 char's... though most are
erroneous)... the Parser hangs the whole indexing process.  Can anyone else
verify this?  I was able to fix it by simply limiting the title when my
webcrawler is parsing my pdf's, but this should be probably be addressed in
the parser as well to be safe.

Have tried that... even going so as as to push it to a Solaris server with
plenty more RAM than my NT box... still hanging, so assume it is something
other than memory.  So far have stepped into it and it appears to be
hanging on HTMLParser parser = new HTMLParser(f); in HTMLDocument.class...
think this may have something to do with JavaCC.zip & HTLParser.jj?
Similarly org.apache.lucene.HTMLParser.Test appears to be hanging.

                    Please
                    respond to
                    "Lucene Users
                    List"






My guess is Garbage Collection -- Try allocating twice as much Heap as
before.
or more. Try running with -gc:verbose (or whatever).
