Are you implying ( ... public synchronized Searcher getSearcher()....) to
use this  synchronized method in a servlet/jsp thread as well?  Is that a
good idea?  Your jhtml example doesn't appear to synchronzied.  Maybe I'm
missing something though.

Yes, that would be the most efficient way.  Note that HitCollector.collect
()
is called with increasing document ids, so you don't actually have to
sort--they arrive in order.

You shouldn't close the Searcher.  Reuse it too.

I may have confused things in an earlier message.  One should keep a single
Searcher which uses a single IndexReader.  Thus the code I posted earlier
for caching an IndexReader should really be caching a Searcher.  The
IndexReader will be cached implicitly by the IndexSearcher.  Thus the
correct code for caching the IndexReader in "latest" should be:

  private Searcher searcher;
  private long lastModified;
  public synchronized Searcher getSearcher() throws IOException {
    if (lastModified != IndexReader.lastModified("latest")) {
      // there's a new index: open it
      lastModified = IndexReader.lastModified("latest");
      searcher = new IndexSearcher("latest");
    }
    return searcher;
  }
