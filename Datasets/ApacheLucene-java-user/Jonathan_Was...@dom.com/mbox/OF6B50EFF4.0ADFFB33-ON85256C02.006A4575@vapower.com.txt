SUBJECT: Field.Unstored vs. Field.Text
DATE: 26 Jul 2002

Will using Field.UnStored(String name, String value) produce approximately
the same size index as if you used Field.Text(String name, Reader value)?

My originial implentation of the Lucene Indexer used
Field.Text(some_string,some_reader) and parsed the html body content on the
fly, as per the example IndexHTML file.  Now I supply the pre-parsed
content as a string from an xml file and use the
Field.Unstored(some_string,some_other_string).  Unfortunately, it seems as
though my index size has gone from a meager 60MB to a whopping 900MB.  Any
suggestions as to what may be causing this?  Am indexing around 60k files.

Thanks!
