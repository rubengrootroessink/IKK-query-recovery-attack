Otis,

I hadn't really thought about this, but it would be easy to build a
dictionary from an existing Lucene index. Tha main caveat is that it would
only work with "stored" fields. That's because this spellchecker boosts
accuracy using pair frequencies in addition to term frequencies, and Lucene
doesn't need or track pair frequencies to my knowledge. So any field which
you wanted to spellcheck would need to be indexed with Field.Store.YES.

Of course a side effect is that they'd have to be Analyzed again, with the
resulting time cost. Still, this could make sense for a lot of people.

I'll make sure the contribution includes an index-to-dictionary API, and
thank you very much for the input.
