The dictionary is generated from the corpus, with the result that a larger
corpus gives better results.

Words are queued up during an index run, and at the end are munged to create
an optimized dictionary. It also supports incremental building, though the
overhead would be too much for those applications that are continuously
adding things to an index. Happily, it's not as important to keep the
spelling dictionary absolutely up to date, so it would be fine to queue
words over several index runs, and refresh the dictionary less often.
