Yea, make sure that your "high end" SAN doesn't end up storing your  
files on one physical disk :P

In short, a SAN can be fiendishly difficult to setup properly,  
specially if it has to be shared among different applications with  
different needs and wants. Too much of a good thing in general. Not  
worth the price, the complexity, nor the pain.

A decent alternative to a SAN would be something like a couple of  
dedicated Sun Thor (aka Sun Fire X4540 Server):

This gives you 48 disks to transparently spread you load across in a  
rather compact, simple package. Very handy for IO intensive systems.

As always, YMMV.
