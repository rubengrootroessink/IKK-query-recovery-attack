As mentioned previously, the visual display of your search results is  
one rather critical factor in balancing the need to duplicate data or  
not...

That said... aside from some rather narrow field of endeavors... and  
assuming you already have a database... I would personally keep  
everything in there and not even bother with Lucene in the first  
place... after all, most databases worth using have "good enough" full  
text search facilities already (e.g. MySQL [1], Oracle Text [2],  
PostgreSQL [3], SQLite FTS [4], etc)...

In other words, do you _really_ need the full fire power of Lucene  
just to tack on a rather pedestrian text search on top of your small  
corporate database?

Just my 2Â¢.
