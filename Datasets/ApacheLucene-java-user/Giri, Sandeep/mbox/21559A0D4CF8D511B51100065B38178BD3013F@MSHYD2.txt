SUBJECT: Index-file locking while searching?
DATE: 13 Feb 2003

Hi!
I don't want to give write permission to the index directory while
searching.
But lucene needs write permission on index directory so that it can create
locks while searching.
So, I tried to use the "-DdisableLuceneLocks=true" but its not working.
It gives the following error:
-----<snip>--------------
SEVERE: 
java.io.IOException: Permission denied
        at java.io.UnixFileSystem.createFileExclusively(Native Method)
        at java.io.File.createNewFile(File.java:827)
        at org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory$1.obtain(Unknown Source)

        at FileSearcherCmdLine.main(FileSearcherCmdLine.java:689)
[Search Time]: 0.0 secs

What is the solution?
