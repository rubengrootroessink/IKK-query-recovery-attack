You'll need to sort the results after you collected them. There is a
project called SortedField in lucene's contribution or sandbox (I don't
remember exactly) which will help you sort by any field.

Search hits come back ordered by score.  How do I get my results sorted
by the date of the article?  I have added the article date as a keyword
field.
