AFAIK the number of files depends among other things on the number of
fields.

Subject: High number of files in the index


Hi list,

I'm experiencing a high number of files in the Lucene index, even after 
running optimize I still have over 600 files in my Lucene index. Now the

scary thing is that's about the same number of document that I indexed.

This problem didn't happen before, the only change that I can think of
is that 
I'm changing the documents being indexed. Previously all documents have
the 
same fields, but now each document has a different set of field indexed.


Is this the problem? Will this cause the high number of files in my
index 
directory?

Please someone say no .. because otherwise I'm dead.
