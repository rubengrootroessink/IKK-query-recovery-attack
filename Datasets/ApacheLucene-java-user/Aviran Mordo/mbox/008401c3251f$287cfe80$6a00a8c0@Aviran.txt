I think I saw a solution for this in the past. Try to search the mailing
list.
Anyway you can always use the SearchBean which is in lucene sandbox to
sort by any field.

I think it's possible, but I'm not sure how Scorers work.  I just want
to place the most recent hits at the front and the oldest ones at the
back (where "date" is a field in the documents).  Is there a simple way
to do this?

Thanks,
