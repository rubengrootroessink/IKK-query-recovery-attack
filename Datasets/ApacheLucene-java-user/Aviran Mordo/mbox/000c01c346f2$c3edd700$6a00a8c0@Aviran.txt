You can add as many fields with the same name as your heart desire on
the same document. This will give you multiple values

Hello, i would like to know if it was possible to introduce more than
once value for a field in a document. I think that is must be possible,
but i don't know how to make it.

Thanks for answering and knocking on my head if i had stupid questions
;-)
