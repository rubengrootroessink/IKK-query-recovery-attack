SUBJECT: Range Query
DATE: 28 Apr 2003

Hi All,
I have submitted a bug report on this issue to bugzilla, but since I
haven't got any response to it I ask you guys
 
When the RangeQuery.toString() outputs. The result is something like
this: "PostDate:[0ddiz2jml-null]"

But the QueryParser does not handles the (-) sign (Throws and
exception), it expects the "TO" keyword. So in order for it to parse the
string. 

The String has to be converted to "PostDate:[0ddiz2jml TO null]" instead
of "PostDate:[0ddiz2jml-null]"

Is this a BUG?

BTW: I use Lucene 1.3-RC1

 

Thanks,

Aviran Mordo
