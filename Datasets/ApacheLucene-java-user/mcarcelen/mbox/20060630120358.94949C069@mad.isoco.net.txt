I don't know about the lucene demo, but I can help with your POI issue.
You only need the poi bin package, but you do need to unpack it. In there
you'll find three jar files - for PowerPoint stuff, you'll just need to
put the poi-3.0 and poi-scratchpad-3.0 jars on your classpath.

You can then use org.apache.poi.hslf.extractor.PowerPointExtractor to do
your text extraction.


Perhaps someone can advise you on how to integrate this into the demo.

Nick
