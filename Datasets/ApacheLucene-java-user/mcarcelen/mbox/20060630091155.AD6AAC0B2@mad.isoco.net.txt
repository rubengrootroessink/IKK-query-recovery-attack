SUBJECT: Lucene indexing PPT
DATE: 30 Jun 2006

Hi everybody!
I´m trying to build a index with PPT files. I have downloaded the api POI,
"poi.bin.3.0" and "poi.src.3.0", but I don´t know where may I have to unzip
them. I´d like to build the index by the command line, the same way as 

> java -cp lucene-core-2.0.0.jar;lucene-demos-2.0.0.jar
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles docs

And also i´d like to search index 

May anyone help me?
Thanks a lot
Cheers
Teresa
