SUBJECT: Queries in Lucene
DATE: 13 Sep 2006


Hi all,
I´ve got a index and now I´m trying to create a query with lucene-2.0.0, 
I´d like to find files that in the first line get the following:

<DIV class=My-Word1> AND Word2

I´m tried with the package org.apache.lucene.demo.SearchFiles 
but I get files where the word "Word2" is not in the first line.

I don´t know how to do the query filtered or if I have to use another file

Can anyone help me?

Thanks 

Best Regards
Teresa
