SUBJECT: SAME-opattor (possible newbie question)
DATE: 4 Sep 2005

Is there a way to tell Lucene to restrict proximity searches to just one field? This would
mimic the BRS/Search SAME-operator, which I use very often.

For example, given this data:

author: a b c
author: d e f

a search for "a SAME c" would match the first row, but "a SAME d" would match nothing, which
is what I want.

Is this possible?

Cheers,
  martin
