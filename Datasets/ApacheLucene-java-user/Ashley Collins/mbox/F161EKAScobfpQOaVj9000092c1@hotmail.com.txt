SUBJECT: Keyword fields which don't contribute to a document's score?
DATE: 6 Dec 2002


Is it possible to stop keyword fields contributing to a document's score? 
Leaving only text fields?

Is the best way to boost the terms I know are keyword fields by small 
numbers?

e.g. sender:"acollin2@hotmail.com"^0.001

Thanks.
Ashley
