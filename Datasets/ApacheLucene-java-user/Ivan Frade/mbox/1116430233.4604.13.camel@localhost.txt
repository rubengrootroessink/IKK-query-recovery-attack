SUBJECT: Using jdbcdirectory
DATE: 18 May 2005

Hello,

 I'm trying to use JDBCDirectory in my project. Now (the project) is
working fine with FSDirectory, but if i simple replace FSDirectory with
JDBCDirectory the things don't go well: I can create the index, but when
try to connect (to insert a document) i find a corrupted index. Looking
database content, i found "segmets" file with 0 bytes length.

 My questions are:

* Is this a problem of JDBCDirectory or i'm using it in wrong way (I use
the _same_ code i run with FSDirectory)
* Exists other alternatives to JDBCDirectory to store the index in a
database? (mysql or oracle)

 Thank you, excuse me my english

Frade
