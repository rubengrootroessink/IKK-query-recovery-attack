SUBJECT: Re: Phrase Frequency For Analysis
DATE: 22 Jun 2006

I may be coming into this thread without knowing enough.  I have implemented a
phrase filter, which indexes all token sequences that are 2 to N tokens long.
The n is defined in the constructor.

It takes a stopword Trie for input because the policy I used, based on a publish
work I read, was that a phrase should neither begin nor end with a stopword.
This is immaterial as one can simply provide a trie with nothing in it.

The Trie structure is found at http://www.graphbuilder.com/trie/
The SWPhraseFilter.java file is attached and is self explanatory.

I do believe that if you change the condition on linke 67 of phraseTerms.size()
> 1 to phraseTerms.size() > 0, you may get the result you need.  Sorry, I do
not have the time to test this out.

I have also included TriePhraseFilter.java.  When I indexed all the possible
phrases, I went back and dumped the ones that occured in more than 25 docs into
a file (this turned out to be about 2% of all candidates), then I placed these
in a Trie and reindexed the documents.

So I used this TriePhraseFilter to recognize the phrases I dumped into the file.
 The requirement of them being in 25 documents is also in the paper I that I
read about phrase indexing.

By the way, I am 90 percent certain of the TriePhraseFilter code.
