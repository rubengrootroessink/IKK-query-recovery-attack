SUBJECT: Searching for keyword 0 [zero] using TermQuery
DATE: 21 Nov 2002

Hello.  I have a field in an index that stores item id's which can be 
zero.  I use a TermQuery to search for these, and everything works fine 
except when I'm searching for things with id 0; these entries return no 
results.

The index appears to have the correct data and the query looks proper 
as far as I can tell.

Is this a known issue?  Can anyone suggest a possible workaround?

thanks
eric
