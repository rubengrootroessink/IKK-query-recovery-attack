Hello,

 

I want to manage user subscriptions to specific documents. So I would like to store the subscription
(query) into the lucene directory, and whenever I receive a new document, I will search all
the matching subscriptions to send the documents to all subcribers. For instance if a user
subscribes to all documents with text containing (WORD1 and WORD2) or WORD3, how can I match
the incoming document based on stored subscriptions? I was thinking to have two subfields
for each field of the subscription: the AND conditions and the OR conditions. 

-OR. I will tokenized the document field content and insert OR between each of them, and run
the query against OR condition of subscription

-It's for the AND that I will have an issue, because if the incoming text may contains more
words than the sequence I want to search. 

For instance, if I subscribe for documents contents lucene and java for instance , if the
incoming document contents is lucene is a great API which has been developed in java, once
I removed stopwords my query would look like lucene and great and API and developed and java.


As query is composed of more words than the stored subscription I will fail to retrieve the
subscription. But if I put only or words, the results will not be accurate, as I can obtain
subscription only for java for instance.

 

Do you know how I can handle this situation? I'm not sure I can actually do this using Lucene...

 

Thank you,
