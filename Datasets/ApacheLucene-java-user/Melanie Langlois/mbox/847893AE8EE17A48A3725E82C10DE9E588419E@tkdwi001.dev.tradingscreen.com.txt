Hi Mark,
If I follow you, I should list the key terms in my incoming document, then select the queries
which contains these key terms, and then run those queries on my index ? If this is correct
there is two things I don't understand:
-how do I know which term is a key term in my document ?
-how can I select the queries? Should I index them in a separate index?

Thanks,


Mélanie Langlois

Bear in mind that the million queries you run on the MemoryIndex can be shortlisted if you
place those queries in a RAMIndex and use the source document's terms to "query the queries".
The list of unique terms for your document is readily available in the MemoryIndex's TermEnum.
You can take this list and find "likely related queries" to execute from your Query index.
Note that for phrase queries or other forms of query with multiple mandatory terms you should
only index one of the terms (preferably the rarest) to ensure that your query is not needlessly
executed. For example - using this approach I need only run the phrase query for "XYZ limited"
whenever I encounter a document with the rare term "XYZ" in it, rather than the much more
commonplace "limited". 

Cheers
Mark

I think that creating an index with a couple of documents takes a  
fraction of the time it will take to place a million queries on that  
index. There is no real need to optimize something that takes  
milliseconds when you in the same process do something that takes  
half a minute.
