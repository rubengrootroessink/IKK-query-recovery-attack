Hi,

 

I'm wondering if lucene would understand such a query:

 

content*:mysearch

It's just because I index several translations of my document contents in addition with common
fields, and this separation is really usefull when an user specify the language in which he
wants to search, but I want to be able to search among all languages if no option is specified.
I could programmatically transform my content* into several sub queries content-en:mysearch
content-fr:mysearch ... but I'm concerned about the number of conditions it will generate.
So that would be cool if lucene automatically look into all concerned fields.

 

Thanks,

 

MÃ©lanie
