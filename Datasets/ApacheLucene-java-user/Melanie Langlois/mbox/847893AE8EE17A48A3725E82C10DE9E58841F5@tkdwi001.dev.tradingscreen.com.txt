Hi,

 

I'm indexing documents, and some of them are provided in several languages. Thanks to this
mailing list participants, I know that I have two choices to index these multiple instances
of documents. Either, I create languages specific field, either I index the translations in
different documents, adding the language field.

I choose the second solution, because first, the translated documents will not be the majority
of documents that I need to index, second is that at search time, if I don't want to restrict
the search to one language, with solution one, I have a query with potentially lot of fields
to cover all languages. Also, the second option makes it faster to filter the results by language,
if specified. 

 

However, with this solution, when the query is not filtered by a language and that the user
search for fields common to any language, such as author for instance, I will have as much
results as I have translations. I'm wondering if there is a way to have a "distinct filter".
For instance, I have a common field "docId" for the translations of one document, and I don't
want to have two documents with the same "docId" in my results.

Also, even if the user didn't put restrictions on language, I want to give back the results
in its default language if it's available, but I don't want to do a filter query, because
I don't want to restrict the search to only this language.

So basically, if the default language of the user is English, and that I have translations
of the matching documents in English, it will be the only one send, otherwise, it should take
the first translation available for this document.

Any hint of how I could do this?

 

Thanks,
