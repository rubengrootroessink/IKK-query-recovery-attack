Well, thanks, sounds like the best option to me. Does anybody use the PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper?
I'm just curious to know if there is any impact on the performances when using different analyzers.

If language is known also at search time, PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper seems a
nice third option: single document per feed, with a separate field for each
language, additional field(s) for the common data;  using
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper at both indexing and search;  using FieldSelector
at search to retrieve only the relevant field(s) for matched documents.
(never done this myself though.)
