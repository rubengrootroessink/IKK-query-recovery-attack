SUBJECT: Spellchecker bug (or feature?)
DATE: 31 Mar 2006

Not sure if this is the right place to report this issue:
   
  The accuracy value, which can be set via setAccuracy(), is being modified in SpellChecker.java
when a word is checked. As a result, the "min" may be pushed
  very high and will not suggest anything for later requests.
   
  One workaround would be to call setAccuracy() each time before a word is checked, I'm not
sure if this is a feature (intended behavior) or a bug.
  By the way, I'm using spellchecker 1.9.1 that comes with Lucene 1.9.1.
   
  Thanks,
   
  Xiaocheng
