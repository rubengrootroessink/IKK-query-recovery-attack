SUBJECT: Does Lucene support on-disk search?
DATE: 8 Mar 2006

Hi,
   
  I heard that Lucene loads the index into memory to do a search, which does not sound quite
right to me. I will not be surprised if Lucene is smart enough to load
  the index into memory when it is feasible, but I'd be surprised if it ALWAYS loads index
memory to do the search, which I think would have scalability problem.
   
  Could someone clarify on this, thanks!
   
  By the way, could someone please share some experience on the performance of Lucene, say,
on a data set of a few gigabytes and a "reasonable" query, what would
  be the average search time?
   
  Xiaocheng
