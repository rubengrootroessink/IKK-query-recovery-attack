SUBJECT: (Lucene) tools/algorithms for co-occurrence terms computation
DATE: 10 May 2006

Hi,

Is there any Lucene tools (or general tools/algorithms) that can compute the co-occurrence
terms for a given query (or term)?

For example, if the user types in "avian flu", the top co-occurrence terms may include "Hong
Kong", "vaccine", "H5N1", or "pandemic", depending on the underlying data set. It may be precompued
or dynamically computed on a small data set, any help wil be highly appreciated.

Thanks!
Xiaocheng Luan
