Hi Michael, 

if I understand your questions correctly - feels like I must have missed something - here
is what can do to achieve what you want:

index these fields:

to
from
content
subject
all (includes text from all the above 4 fields)

and use "all" as your default search field. Then when you type "michael contract negotiation",
you'll be searching "all" field, which is "all the fields". When you type "to:michael AND
content:foo", you will be searching the specified fields only.

Thanks,
Xiaocheng

We allow our users to search through our index with a simple textfield.  
The search phrase has "content" as its default value.  This allows them 
to search quickly through content but then when they type "to:blah AND 
from:foo AND content:boogie" it will know to parse,etc.

What I want to do it expand it so when they type a phrase in the 
textfield it will search select all at once and still be smart enough to 
recognize a lucene query.

For example,  say we have these fields:

to
from
content
subject

When I type "michael contract negotiation" it will look through all 
these fields and return hits.

Then it should be able to recognize more advance searches like:

to:michael AND content:foo

and not go through all fields....

Am I making sense?  Is this a good way to provide search?  How would I 
do this?

Thanks,
Michael
