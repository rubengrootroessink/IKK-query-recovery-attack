SUBJECT: Creating a new index from an existing index
DATE: 29 Aug 2006

Hi,
Got a question. Here is what I want to achieve:

Create a new index from an existing index, to change the boosting factor for some of the documents
(and potentially some other tweaks), without reindexing it from the source.

Is there any tools or ways to do this?
Thanks!
