Thanks, Erick.
I agree that it might be unlikely to reconstruct from an existing index, but I think document
boosting (that is, one document has a higher boost factor than other documents) as well as
field boosting is specified during indexing.

Our use case is performancce/results tuning. We have huge indexes (in the range of dozens
of GBs) and some sources are remote. I'm trying to figure out ways to avoid re-ingesting the
contents as much as possible.
Any suggestions?
Thanks.

1> I don't think you set the boost when indexing. You set the boost when
querying, so you don't need to re-index for boosting.

2> A recurring theme is that you can't do an update-in-place for a lucene
document. You might search the mail archive for a discussion of this. The
short form is that if you want to change every document, you're probably
better off re-indexing the whole thing. If, for some reason you can't/don't
want to just re-index it all, then be aware that if you didn't store the
fields for the documents (i.e. use Field.Store.YES), then you really can't
reconstruct the document from the index without potentially losing
information.

Hope this helps
