 Hi, 
  I am parsing this file called Logistics.htm  
I have a field named "headlines" that contains word "clients" among others. 
  When I don't put a boost on this field, I have as score 0.06 when searching for clients.
 
Then when I put a boost of "10", I have a score of 0.21  
Yet I was expecting a score of 0.60 
  Could anyone clarify this behaviour to me ?  
Thank u for any help.
