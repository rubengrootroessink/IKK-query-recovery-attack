Or, you may index the fields that you want "exact matches" as non-tokenized.
Thanks,

You fire only phrase query on the first field where you want only "world 
cup" as a result
while on second field fire Phrase query as well as term query...Or only term 
query depends on your need.

Thanks.

Hi all,

Is it possible to search whether a term is equal to the entire contents
of a field rather than that the field contains a term?

So for example if I have a field with this text: "world cup" and I do a
search for "cup" I want it to return false but for another field that
contains exactly the text "cup" I want the result to be true.

Thanks in advance
