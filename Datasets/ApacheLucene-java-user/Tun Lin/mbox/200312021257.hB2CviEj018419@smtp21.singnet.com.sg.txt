Hi,

I am very keen on using the New luceneweb. Has anyone managed to run luceneweb
successfully on Windows? 

The instructions in luceneweb seems to support unix more than windows. 

Anyone has the install instructions for windows to run luceneweb? I cannot even
see the first page when I start tomcat though I have the weblucene in the
webapps directory.

Can anyone help? Please.

Could you add a Lucene logo somewhere on your search results, as noted
here:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/powered.html ?

Thanks!
