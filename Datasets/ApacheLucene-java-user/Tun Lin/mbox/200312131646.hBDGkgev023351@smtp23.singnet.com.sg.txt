I am using the beta version.

ant -version

I have the following:
Apache Ant version 1.6beta3 compiled on December 5 2003

I am downloading the previous to be if there is improvements?

Everything works fine but it fails miserably?!  :)

This says Ant did not even launch.  I'm not sure which "weblucene" you mean here
- the built-in demo?

My guess is your Ant installation has issues.  What does "ant -version" 
tell you?  How about "ant -diagnostics"?  And finally "ant -projecthelp
-verbose"
