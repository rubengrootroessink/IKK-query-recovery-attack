Hi,

Thanks for your reply.

What if I add a new document into the directory that I have compiled using the
following command: java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index
{index-dir} ..

Will it automatically reindex like I did manually to reflect the new document
being added in that particular directory?

Please advise.

You don't need to reindex the documents again. Lucene does incremental indexing.
Just add your document to the index and that's it. You need to create a new
IndexSearcher to reflect the new changes into the your search result.
