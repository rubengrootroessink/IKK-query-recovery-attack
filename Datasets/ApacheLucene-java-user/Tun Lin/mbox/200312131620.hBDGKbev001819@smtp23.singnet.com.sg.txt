Hi,

I have tried to type the following at Windows command line at weblucene
directory:

ant build

Everything seems to work fine except the following error:

java.lang.InstantiationException: org.apache.tools.ant.Main
        at java.lang.Class.newInstance0(Class.java:293)
        at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:261)
        at org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher.run(Launcher.java:214)
        at org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher.main(Launcher.java:90)

I have set the necessary classpath but still the error mentioned above.

Can anyone help?
