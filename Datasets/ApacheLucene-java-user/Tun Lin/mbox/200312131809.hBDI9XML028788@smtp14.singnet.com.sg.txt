Hi,

When I downloaded the web lucene source classes and all, I did not see the
classes directory at all as instructed in install.txt. 

Anyone knows how to get the whole package of classes for web lucene as in a jar
file?

When I type the command:
Java IndexRunner

I get the following message:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: IndexRunner

I have set the classpath for Web Lucene as in the path to the class files but it
still does not work.

Please advise.
