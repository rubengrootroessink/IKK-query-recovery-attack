SUBJECT: Handling of unknown/multiple lanuage documents
DATE: 5 Sep 2005

Hello,
 I'm new to Lucene. After some readings, I'm still not quite sure which 
Analyzer I should be using for handling documents in unknown or multiple 
lanugages. The documents I want to index may be written in lanuages other 
than the user/system's default language and one document may contain text in 
different lanuages.
 By the way, I hope there is a search capablity in website of Lucene search 
engine. :-)
