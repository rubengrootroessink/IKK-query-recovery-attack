Thanks for the link. 
I had overlooked the fact that RangeQuery expands to a sequence of term
queries and throws an exception when 1024 is reached. 

By setting the BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount() to the required value, I was
able to avoid the TooManyClauses exception. But, as mentioned in the FAQ
link, there is a memory overhead attached to this. An alternative,
suggested, was to use a DateFilter replacing the RangeQuery. Will try that.

thanks again for the link.
