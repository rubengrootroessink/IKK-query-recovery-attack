SUBJECT: Lucene file size issue through SMB mount
DATE: 20 Mar 2006

hi,
I'm posting this issue here (just in case if anyone here has faced a similar
issue) since i couldn't get any solution from the Linux forums. 

I have a partition which holds a lucene <http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/#>
index file of size >2GB. This file is accessed thru' a SMB mounted share
from other linux machines (running my web app.). The issue here is that when
viewing the file (ls -al) thru' this SMB share, it shows an abnormal size &
my application is not able to load this file. I'm reproducing the output of
my ls -al command.

# ls -al
total 2145627826
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Feb 25 13:15 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jun 6 2005 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 18446744071809180098 Feb 25 00:52 _11l.cfs
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4 Feb 25 00:52 deletable
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 29 Feb 25 00:52 segments

But when i telnet into this linux <http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/#>
machine & do an ls -al, the output is as below :

# ls -al
total 2340780
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Feb 25 13:15 .
drwxrwxrwx 6 root root 4096 Jun 6 2005 ..
-rwxr--r-- 1 root root 2394595778 Feb 25 00:52 _11l.cfs
-rwxr--r-- 1 root root 4 Feb 25 00:52 deletable
-rwxr--r-- 1 root root 29 Feb 25 00:52 segments

Hope i was able to describe the issue clearly. Any pointers or references
will be helpful.
