Great to hear that! 

Doing query iteration programatically will be faster than making it with ShingleFilter.

Since you don't care about scores, you can enhance your search time complexity. You need only
Boolean Retrieval (true or false) so can omit term freq. and length norm. and index time boosting
etc in your fields.

Field.setOmitNorms(true)
Field.setOmitTermFreqAndPositions(true) 
Using Field.Index.ANALYZED_NO_NORMS in constructor.

Secondly there is a discussion about disabling score calculation completely. It is stated
that:

"As of 2.9 (not yet released) the new Collector API allows you to skip
scoring entirely and just collect the doc IDs matching the query." [1].

If you made these modifications, your search will be even faster and storage space - required
in the index - will decrease.
