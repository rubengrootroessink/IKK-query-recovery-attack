Hi Mark,

ComplexPhraseQueryParser.parse() method returns ComplexPhraseQuery.
As you said when I feed QueryScorer with ComplexPhraseQuery.rewrite(IndexSearcher.getIndexReader()),
highlighting succeeded. FastVectorHighlighter didn't work, but all is well.

"A query must be rewritten in its most primitive form for QueryScorer to be happy." [LIA Book]

I thought that solr highlighting component does this by default. 
Although solr version has still some problems, lucene version working perfectly.

Thank you for your input, it really helped.

Ahmet
