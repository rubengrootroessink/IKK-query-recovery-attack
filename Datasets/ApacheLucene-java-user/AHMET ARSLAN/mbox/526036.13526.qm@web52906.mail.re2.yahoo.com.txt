Thank you for your interest, Mark.

I am sending a java code (using lucene 2.9.0) that simply demonstrates the problem. When the
same query string is parsed by Lucene's default QueryParser highlighting comes. 

I am trying to highlight full original text, preserving proximity criteria.
Choice of FastVectorHighlighter or Highlighter is not important for me.

I was using ComplexPhraseQueryParser with solr 1.3.0, without problems with PhraseHighlighter.
But now with lucene 2.9 + solr 1.4 snippets disappeared suddenly.

Thank you for your help.

Ahmet
