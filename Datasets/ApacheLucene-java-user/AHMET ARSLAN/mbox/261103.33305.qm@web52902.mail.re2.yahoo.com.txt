SUBJECT: Re: Edit distance and wildcard searching with PhraseQuery
DATE: 11 Nov 2009

What you are looking for is ComplexPhraseQueryParser [1] and implemented in Lucene 2.9.0. It
uses SpanQuery family. 
It supports "Phil* PA"~10 as well as "Philadelphid~0.75 PA".
Ranges, OR, fuzzy and wildcard inside proximity (phrases).
