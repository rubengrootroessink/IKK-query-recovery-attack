You mean that you do not need score calculation therefore you do not want results sorted by
relevancy. Just you need is a Boolean Retrieval Model, right? All results will have ConstantScore
(0 or 1).

If yes, I think omitting norms and tfs of your searchable fields can improve your search performance
without writing custom HitCollector.



void org.apache.lucene.document.Field.setOmitNorms(true) 
Using Field.Index.ANALYZED_NO_NORMS in constructor.
void org.apache.lucene.document.Field.setOmitTf(true)  


But i am not sure those changes are enough to convert Vector Space Model to Boolean Retrieval
Model. I think there should be another trick to not to calculate score/similarity at all.
