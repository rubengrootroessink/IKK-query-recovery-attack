Which analyzer/tokenizer are you using on that field? I am assuming it is a tokenized field.

Is it returning 1's as well as -1's?

- is a special character so you have to escape it when querying.
So keyword:\-1 is correct. But the problem is StandardTokenizer tokenizes 
-1 to 1. If you use it all -1's and 1's are threated same. Use whitespaceanalyzer instead.

Hope this helps.
