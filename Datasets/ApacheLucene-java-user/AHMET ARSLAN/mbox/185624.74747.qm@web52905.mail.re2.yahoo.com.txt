You are trying to retrieve documents begins with "Once upon a time", right? You want your
phrase in the beginning of the document. You can retrieve them using SpanQuery family programmatically.

I am not sure about the value of (int end) in SpanFirstQuery constructor but it will be something
like that:

s1 = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("story","once"));
s2 = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("story","upon"));
s3 = new SpanTermQuery(new Term("story","time"));

s4 = new SpanNearQuery([s1,s2,s3], 0, true);

s5 = new SpanFirstQuery(s4, 3);

Note that you need to use analyzed text of terms in this approach.

Hope this helps.
