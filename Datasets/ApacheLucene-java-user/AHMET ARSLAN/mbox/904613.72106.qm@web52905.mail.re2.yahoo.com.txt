Your remedy is ComplexPhraseQueryParser that utilizes SpanQuery family.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1486
That accepts ranges, ORs, Wildcards inside Phrase queries.

Using this new QueryParser your query will be someting like.
(with the default field set to contents) 

"revision [40 TO 50]"

If you want to construct your Query programmatically with Lucene Query API:

Query query = spanNear([contents:revision, spanOr([contents:40, contents:41, ..., contents:50])],
0 , true)

Take a look at those Query subclasses:

org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanNearQuery
org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanOrQuery
org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanTermQuery
