If you want to use a built-in analyzer WhitespaceAnalyzer with PrefixQuery are enough to get
this behavior.
Just add an star ( * ) end of the user query:

Moo*
Mood*
Moodys*
Moody's*

Note that this option will be case sensitive. 

To perform case insensitive search either you can add LowerCaseFilter to  WhitespaceAnalyzer,
or remove StandardFilter from StandardAnalyzer.
May be it is a good idea to setLowercaseExpandedTerms of your QueryParser to true, since wildcard
query words are not analyzed.

If you don't want to use wildcard searches, then EdgeNGramTokenFilter can help you.
