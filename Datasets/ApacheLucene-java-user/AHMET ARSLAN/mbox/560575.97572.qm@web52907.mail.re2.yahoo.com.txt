May be you can use WhitespaceTokenizer that won't remove &?
Why and's (&) are import for you? Do you need to search them?
Replacing &'s before indexing (by preprocessing) can be a option?


Filter before tokenizer can be simulated by using:

1-)KeywordTokenizer 
2-)Your CharFilter
3-)A token filter that tokenizes input token's text using StandardTokenizer

But i think this is not a good idea.

Hope this helps.
