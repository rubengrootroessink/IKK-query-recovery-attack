SUBJECT: Sorting on tokenized fields
DATE: 21 Jul 2004

I see in the Javadoc that it is only possible to sort on fields that 
are not tokenized, I have two questions about that:

1) What happens if the field is tokenized, is sorting done anyway, 
using the first term only?

2) Is there a way to do some sorting anyway, by concatenating all the 
tokens into one string?
