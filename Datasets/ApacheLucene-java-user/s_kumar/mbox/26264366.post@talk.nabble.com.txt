SUBJECT: How to use Lucene to suppot quick search on huge databases where the primary content is of non textual format ?
DATE: 9 Nov 2009


The requirement is to perform a Quick search on a DB table that has more than
a million real estate property records where the primary search criteria is
state/city, state/county or zip code. How can I use lucene effectively in
this case ? Which one will be better a plain sql search on the DB table or a
lucene search with some sort of a index constructed (not sure how to go
about this) ?
Please Advice.
