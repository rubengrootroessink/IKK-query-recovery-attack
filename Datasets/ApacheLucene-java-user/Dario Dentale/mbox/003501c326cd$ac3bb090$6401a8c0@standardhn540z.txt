Thanks, for the answer.

I was searching for a solution not based on a dictionary, but on the list of
terms (with relative frequency) contained in the Lucene index.

In this way (I think) I can obtain more significant results,
I can use this method on multiple languages (without relative dictionary and
without know which laguage is used in the query string)
and especially on out-of-dictionary terms (i.e.: in a e-commerce site you
can find "Nikon coolpix" that are not in a dictionary).

I was searching for some algorithm that can calculate the similarity
coefficient between two terms and multiplying it
to the frequency in the indexed documents can obtain a score.

Do you think that this is a wrong way?

Regards,
Dario
