SUBJECT: Index maximum field length
DATE: 19 Oct 2001

I have a need to index large files ( ~50,000 terms).  I noticed that by
default the maximum field length is 10,000 terms, set by IndexWriter.  How
can I index the entire content of these large files?  Obviously, one option
is to increase the maxFieldLength int to more than 10,000.  If I do this,
what are the implications?  Is there a better way?

Currently I am passing a Reader object to the "body" field and it only
indexes the first 10,000 terms.

Thanks,
Stuart
