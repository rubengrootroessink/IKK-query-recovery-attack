SUBJECT: Advise regarding drawing search
DATE: 8 Jul 2011

Hello all,

Me and my collegues would like some advise on the following;

We have a really large amount of technical drawings (about 300 Million)
which we want to make searchable. An OCR library has already been developed
which is able to identify all components which may be available on a
drawing, remove noise, etc.

Next to adding components we also add x,y coordinates (normalized for
drawing size) for each component with the goal to provide our users with
some kind of (real, 2D) proximity search on the drawing itself. For example
search for a drawing which has a condensator near a resistor.

Especially because of the amount of drawings, any advise will be
appriciated, like wether or not to use payloads,spatial search etc.

Thanks in advance.
