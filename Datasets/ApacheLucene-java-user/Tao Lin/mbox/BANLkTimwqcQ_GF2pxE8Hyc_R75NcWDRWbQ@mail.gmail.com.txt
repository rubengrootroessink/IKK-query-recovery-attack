SUBJECT: Inquiring part-of-speech (POS) tagging indexing and searching
DATE: 1 May 2011

Dear Sir/Madam,

I'm working on a project related to part-of-speech(POS) tagging
indexing and searching. I found a good example in Java doc of Lucene.
We can implement our own custom Attribute(PartOfSpeechAttribute) for
part-of-speech tagging and index it accordingly, as is demostrated in
the followings:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/package-summary.html

But this example shows half the solution: the indexing part. How about
the searching part?
Given the PartOfSpeechTaggingFilter, how can we search only "Noun"
terms in the index?

Best regards,
Tao Lin
