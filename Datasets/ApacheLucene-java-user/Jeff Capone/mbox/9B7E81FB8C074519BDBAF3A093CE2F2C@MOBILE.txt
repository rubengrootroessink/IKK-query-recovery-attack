SUBJECT: Feasibility question
DATE: 10 Nov 2008

Has anyone deployed Lucene to index log files?  I have seen some articles 
about how RackSpace used Lucene and Hadoop for log processing, but I have 
not seen any details on the implementation.  

To get my required analytics, I think I would need to treat each line of 
the Apache log files as a document and I though I would treat each field as 
a key word to minimize processing. 

Assuming you have clusters operating on independent datasets (so I guess it 
would scale linearly) and you want to process Terabytes of logs per day, 
is such a solution even feasible?

Thank you,

Jeff Capone
