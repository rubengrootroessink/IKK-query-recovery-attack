SUBJECT: Re: Searching multiple fields in one Index of Documents
DATE: 11 Feb 2002

I have a bunch of html text boxes on a page to represent database fields and
then programmatically add the field name and a colon in front of each value
before sending it on to the QueryParser--like--> description:harley
keyword:jacket

When I need to search for the same thing across multiple fields I added a
field to the document when I indexed that had the values from ALL of the
fields, a bit redundant but I can't find a better way.  I have 8 fields
indexed of 1.2 million documents for a grand total of 600MB and I still get
good search times.
