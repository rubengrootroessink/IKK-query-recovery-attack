SUBJECT: Where does Lucene recognise it has encountered a new term for the first time?
DATE: 16 Dec 2010

I’m using Lucene to index database records and text documents.

I want to provide efficient fuzzy queries over the data so I’m using a secondary 
Lucene index for all of the distinct terms encountered in the primary index.

Each ‘document’ in the secondary index is a term from the primary index with 
fields for its q-grams, phonetic key(s) and synonyms.

It’s easy to populate the secondary index after indexing all of the records and 
text documents using an IndexReader. However, to keep the secondary index up to 
date I need to recognise when new terms are encountered for the first time, but 
even looking deep into Lucene code and stepping through the indexing process 
hasn’t revealed where this occurs – I presume because it doesn’t happen in a 
single place but rather once in the in-memory term cache, once when the cache is 
flushed into a segment, and again when segments are optimised.

Is this correct? Can anyone suggest how to maintain a secondary index of terms? 
Perhaps only when the main index is optimised?

Thanks, Mike
