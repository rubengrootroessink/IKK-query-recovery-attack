SUBJECT: Can't search using numbers
DATE: 8 Sep 2003

I am able to make text searches, but am unable to search for numbers. I did
check my Analyzer class if numbers were included in the STOP-WORDS, but they
weren't.
 
Has anyone had this problem? Or does anyone have any suggestions? Any help
would be immensely appreciated.
 
Thanks.
 
David O.
