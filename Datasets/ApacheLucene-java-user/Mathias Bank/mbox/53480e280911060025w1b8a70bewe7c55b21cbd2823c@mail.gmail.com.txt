SUBJECT: Re: Creating tag clouds with lucene
DATE: 6 Nov 2009

Well, it could be a facet search, if there would be tags available but
if you just wanna have a "tag cloud" generated by full-text, I don't
see how a facet search could help to generate this cloud.
Unfortunatelly, I don't have tags in my data. What I need is the
information, what are the most used terms (or multi terms) in this
data. First I have thought of using carrot2, which uses a specialed
clustering algorithm. But I have wondered, if it is not possible to
get the most used terms out of lucene directly.

Glen has mentioned, that he is doing this for full-text data. He
mentioned that he is using the IndexReader.termDocs(Term term) method.
So I think he iterates all terms and looks in how many documents this
term exists. But what I don't see is: how does this method work with a
filter? Do you first look for all documents which are valid for the
used filter and than iterate all terms only counting documents in this
filtered set? I cannot imagine, that this is performant because I have
more than 10 mio documents (fast growing).
