SUBJECT: which version
DATE: 16 Oct 2009

hi
i am using lucene version 2.9
When calling the StandardAnalyzer constructor with the
VErsion.LUCENE_VERSION as parameter, I get the error
"symbol not found constructor
StandardAnalyzer(org.apache.lucene.util.Version)"

this is strange, as it is supposed to be correct according to the API
doc and my jar file is called lucene-core-2.9.0.jar

However, the deprecated constructor new StandardAnalyzer() (without
any parameters) worked fine.

I am confused now as to whether i am really using version 2.9
can anybody please advise?
