SUBJECT: gettotalhits vs totalhits

hi
I am wondering what is the difference between

collector.getTotalHits();//where collector is a TopScoreDocCollector
(which returns the correct value for my example = 2 docs)

and

  collector.topDocs().totalHits (which returns 0, and is wrong)

the collector was used in a search: searcher.search(query,collector);

Strangely enough, collector.topDocs().scoreDocs.length; returns the 
correct value (length = 2)

Can anyone please advise when to use what (and what are the 
differences between the objects above)
