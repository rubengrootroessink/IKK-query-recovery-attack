SUBJECT: Re: Index Rows as Documents? Help me design a solution
DATE: 26 Jul 2006

Thanks all for the responses. I am very pleasently surprised at the helpful
responses that I am getting.

Okay, I think I still haven't understood Lucene well. I am sure that I am
not solving the problem the right way. So I am explaining the problem at a
very high level here .. please tell me what my design should be:

I have GBs of logs where each row is of the type
"Col1#Col2#Col3#Col4#Col5...". Now I want to be able to search the logs for
Col1 or Col2 and get all the rows containing these two columns.

Now what I do is, I run a shell script to split the logs into smaller files
of 1MB each, then index all the files just as the lucene example works. Then
when I search for a term, I get the log-file names that contain the data.
Then I buffer-read those files and find out rows containing the data.

I am very sure this is a very bad way of solving the problem. There should
be some way of me telling Lucene that it just needs to make sure that the
two columns Col1 and Col2 can be searched, and skip the rest. Then there
should be some way of telling Lucene to store the indexes in a way that a
search query can result the complete row when searched for Col1 or Col2,
instead of file-names containing the data.

I tried to have each row as a document, but as my first mail says, I didn't
get the kind of performance I wanted. I am going to run some checks (As
Erick suggested). But Doron's email has made me wonder if I am doing it
right at all.

Can you guys please help me understand how this problem can be best solved?

Thanks a lot for the help so far
