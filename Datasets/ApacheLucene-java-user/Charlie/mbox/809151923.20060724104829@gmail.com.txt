SUBJECT: Re[2]: Span Query NLE
DATE: 24 Jul 2006

Thanks for both of you, Karl and Chris.

You both made my intention even more clearer.

So now the question is:

   Is there a powerful QueryParser.jj can process span query syntax?

(prerequisite is: have we ever defined the Span Query Syntax?)

I will be boasting if I am claim to write one now. I had only one
compiler class and never feel good about it:)

Best regards,
