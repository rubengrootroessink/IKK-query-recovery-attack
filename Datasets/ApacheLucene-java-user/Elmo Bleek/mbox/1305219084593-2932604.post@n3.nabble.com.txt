SUBJECT: Re: Can I omit ShingleFilter's filler tokens
DATE: 12 May 2011

I have found that simply having StopFilter before ShingleFilter does the
trick for #2. However, I have also been working on trying to accomplish #1,
don't create shingles across stop words. I am currently under the impression
that this will take modifying ShingleFilter. Does anyone have any
suggestions?
