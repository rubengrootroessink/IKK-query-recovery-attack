yes - i guess this is more or less what i mean. an example are the two
documents:

1 - with the titles:
"http"
"hypertext transfer protocol"

2 - with the title:
"http tunnel"

when i use multi-valued fields and do a search on "http" the title
score on the second document is higher as there is a match and the
length is shorter. as the first title of the first document would be a
perfect match this one should get the higher score instead.

disabling the length normalization sounds good - while it may not help
to find the more relevant title at least it won't give a bad score to
good titles.

ok. this could also be a possible solution. i'll evaluate both methods
and use the "better" one.

thanks for the help.
