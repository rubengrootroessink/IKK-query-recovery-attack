I don't understand what you mean with "first 'chunk' of terms from a
field". I actually tried to implement this method, but unfortunately I
face yet another problem.

Document 1:
Title-1: Rijksmuseum
Title-2: Rijksmuseum Amsterdam

Document 2:
Title-1: Amsterdam
Title-2: NLAMS

Document 1 gets the higher score in this case (when I do a search on
'Amsterdam'). The reason is that the term 'Amsterdam' has a higher
docFreq in Title-1 than in Title-2 (as Title-2 is only seldom used).

I think if I combine your .setOmitNorms(true) suggestion with this
second suggestion it may actually work - that will be my next attempt.
