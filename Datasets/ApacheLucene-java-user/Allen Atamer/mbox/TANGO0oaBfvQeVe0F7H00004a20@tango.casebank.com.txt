SUBJECT: literal search in quotes on non-tokenized field
DATE: 30 Nov 2004

Here is a problem I am experiencing with Lucene searches on non-tokenized
fields:
 
A search in quotes on a field named Build with the query "\"orig\"" does not
work but the query "origi" yields 62 hits
 
I have run indexing on the field with the following method
 
                    doc.add(Field.Keyword(data.getColumnName(j),
                            fieldValue.toString().toLowerCase()));
 
so even though the original data has "ORIGI" in the "Build" field, lowercase
is not the problem
 
Here's a log of the parsed query before going to the searcher:
 
Parsed query: (Build:"origi") for the first search
Parsed query: (Build:origi) for the second search
 
Right now we're not using a query parser / analyzer system to build the
query. We're building the query up.
The query mentioned above is a TermQuery object
 
Thanks
