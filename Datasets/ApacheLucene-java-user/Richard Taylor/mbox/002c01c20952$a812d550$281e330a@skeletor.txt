Hi,

We're using Lucene in exactly this way (even though we have java
throughout).

I have wrapped up lucene as a web service and send search requests as xml
strings that are unmarshalled on the server (using JAXB).
These are then used to build up a query and execute it returning the number
of results (storing the search for the web service client by an ID).  Then
the client requests a subset of the results (10 at a time in our case) and
these are returned as an XML string.

We initially had it set up with AXIS (trying to keep to the JAX-RPC
standards) but there were too many bugs and performace issues for our
production environment.  We finally launched with glue
(www.themindelectric.com) and I was amazed with the stability and ease of
use. To be fair though it was very easy to switch between the two and I'll
keep a watch on the AXIS development.

This allows your web service clients to be any SOAP client.
