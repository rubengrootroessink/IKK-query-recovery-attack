We're also creating multiple lucene Documents (Article) from one XML
document (ArticleCollection).

Our XML documents are quite large and we have a large quantity of them so we
use a SAX parser to process the XML and create multiple lucene Documents in
the index along the way - this is very much faster than using any DOM parser
to do the same job.

The code we're using to create the index is based on one in the
contributions directory for lucene:

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/contributions.html

Its the one called XMLDocument #1 which links to:
