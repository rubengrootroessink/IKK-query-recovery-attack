SUBJECT: Lucene Indexing and Search Policy
DATE: 21 Jan 2009

Hi,

Does Lucene take into consideration anything other than the frequency of 
the query words in a document? If it does, what are the other 
considerations?
If it is purely based on word frequency, is it appropriate for Internet 
based search (where we need to consider reference count also)?

Thank you,
Ram
