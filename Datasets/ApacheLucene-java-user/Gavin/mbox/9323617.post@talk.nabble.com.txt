SUBJECT: QueryParser and auto wildcard searches
DATE: 6 Mar 2007


Hello,

I am new to Lucene and I am trying to customise the query parser to default
to wildcard searches.
For example, if the user types in "fenc", it should find "fence" and
"fencing" and "fences" and "fenced".

I can not find a way to modify / extend the QueryParser to automatically
create wildcard queries.

Note that the query will have multiple fields, grouping and all the other
good stuff Lucene give us.

Thanks

Gavin
