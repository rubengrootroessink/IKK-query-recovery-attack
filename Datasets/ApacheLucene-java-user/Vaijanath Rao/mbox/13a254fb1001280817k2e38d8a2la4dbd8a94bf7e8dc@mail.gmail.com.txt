SUBJECT: How to get matched terms
DATE: 28 Jan 2010

Hi All,

What is the simplest way of getting the matched terms of the query with
respect to the document. So for example let's say a document has field X and
the contains of the field are "a b c" now when I do a search for 'b c'. The
document will be returned I want to get back the terms that this document
matched with the query terms. Can someone tell me the easiest way to
accomplish this.

--Thanks and Regards
