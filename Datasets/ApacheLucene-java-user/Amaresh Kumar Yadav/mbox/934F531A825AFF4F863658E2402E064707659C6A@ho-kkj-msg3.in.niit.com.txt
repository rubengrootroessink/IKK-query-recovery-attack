I guess you use lucene demo for files not for html files. 

In this case documents don't contain the fileds "title" and "summary".
And you should use "path" field instead of "title" field.

Edit results.jps
<%
                        Document doc = hits.doc(i);                    //get
the next document 
-                        String doctitle = doc.get("title");
//get its title
+                        String doctitle = doc.get("path");            //get
its title

                        String url = doc.get("url");                   //get
its url field
                        if ((doctitle == null) || doctitle.equals("")) //use
the url if it has no title
...

Also, use Luke to inspect your index.
