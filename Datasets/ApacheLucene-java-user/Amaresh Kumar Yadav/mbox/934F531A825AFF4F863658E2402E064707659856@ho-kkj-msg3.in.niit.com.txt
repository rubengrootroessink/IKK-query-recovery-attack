Dear Pasha,

I am using attached source code for indexing on windows plateform.
after compiling and making war file, build folder is created which contains
two jar files lucene-core-1.9.2-dev and  lucene-demos-1.9.2-dev
then  i set class path to lucene-core-1.9.2-dev and lucene-demos-1.9.2-dev
after setting class path i used "java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles
C:\workspace1\lucene\src" command on dos prompt for indexing

after indexing i deploy the war file on my server . and then access
http://172.17.24.81:8181/luceneweb/index.jsp   which search keyword and
return null file name link.

Regards..

Amaresh

Your source code for indexing contains something like this:
---------------------------------------------
    doc.add(new Field(filedName,  fieldValue, Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
---------------------------------------------

Or
Could you please provide your source code? How do you index your data?
