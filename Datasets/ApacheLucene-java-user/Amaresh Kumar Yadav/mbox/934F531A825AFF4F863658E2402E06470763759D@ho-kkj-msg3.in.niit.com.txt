hi all,
   
  is there a faster way to retrieve ONLY the count of results for a query?
   
  lucene ranks (scores) the first batch of docs and sorts them by rank, this
is functionality i dont need in certain queries and i assume, not doing this
can return the count faster then the hits.length()
   
  any ideas???
   
  thanks,,,
