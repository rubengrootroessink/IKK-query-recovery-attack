Actually you don't need to create text file. Get data from db and
create Document that put in index. At least you must store ID of row
in Document. Or you may store doctitle and docpath too.

For each row you shoul do something like this:

import org.apache.lucene.document.Document;
import org.apache.lucene.document.Field;

Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(new Field("ID", [here you row ID value], Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));
doc.add(new Field("TITLE", [here value of doctitle field],
Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
doc.add(new Field("PATH", [here value of docpath field],
Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
indexWriter.addDocument(doc);

After searcing you have Hits, get doc from Hits and get value of "ID"
field of that doc - now you may get row from table by ID and receive
any data.
