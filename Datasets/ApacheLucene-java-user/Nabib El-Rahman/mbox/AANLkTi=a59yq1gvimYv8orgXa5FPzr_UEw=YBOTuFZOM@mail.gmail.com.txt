Hi,

What I need is a Not TermQuery. I did not see one in the API, so I did the
following:

Query query = new BooleanQuery(new BooleanClause(new
TermQuery(..), BooleanClause.Occur.MUST_NOT)));

This did not produce the correct search result. Does anyone have any idea on
how to accomplish this?

And is here such a thing as NotTermQuery(..) ?

Thanks in advance!
