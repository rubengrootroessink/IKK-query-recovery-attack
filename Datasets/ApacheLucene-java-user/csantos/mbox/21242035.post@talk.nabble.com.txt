SUBJECT: Showing highlighted results
DATE: 1 Jan 2009


Hello,

After applying the Highlighter on the result of a fulltext query i need to
display these highlighted results for the users so they can further navigate
(click on a row and get more details). My problem is that i must relate the
showed results with the actual data in the database to allow this
navigation, but the highlighted results aren't associated with the database,
they are generated based on the search results. Is it reasonable to add a
field for the highlighted results in the respective table in the database? 
That doesn't seem an elegant solution. Does anyone has a better idea? By the
way my Webapplication uses Hibernate.

Thanks in advance.
