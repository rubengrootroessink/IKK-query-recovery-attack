In Lucene, the only way to modify a document is to delete it and replace it
with the new version.  Given that you are working with discussion threads,
you might instead consider adding fields for thread ID and thread serial
number to each article. You could then append to threads, view entire
threads in order or delete threads as you wish using Lucene's APIs.
