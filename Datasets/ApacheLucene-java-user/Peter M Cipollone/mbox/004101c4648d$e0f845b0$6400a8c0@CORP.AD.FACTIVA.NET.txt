Subject: Deleting a Doc found via a Query


> I must be missing something here, but I can't see an easy way to delete
> a Document that has been found via searching.  The delete() method of
> IndexReader takes a docNum.  How do I get the docNum corresponding to
> the Document in the Hits?
>
> I tried scanning through all the Documents using IndexReader's
> document(i) method, testing for equality (==) with my queried Document,
> but it wasn't found.  I assume this is because the Documents returned
> in Hits are copies of the Documents the document() method returns.
