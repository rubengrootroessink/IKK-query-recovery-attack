Thanks Eric.

I definitely like the idea of including the FREE Edition's WAR file to 
the Lucene code base as a demo application. On one hand, it demonstrates 
the power of Lucene and on the other, as you have already pointed out, 
it will give SearchBlox a lot of publicity.

Let me know how we can take this further.

Robert
