Hello,

This is to announce the release of SearchBlox 1.0.

Searchblox is a search application designed on a robust Java 
architecture. It enables you to deploy search on your Intranet/Internet 
sites in a matter of minutes, focusing on presentation of content rather 
than diving into details of search technology. It extends software from

as a Web Archive (WAR) and is deployable on any Servlet 2.3/JSP 1.2 
compliant server.
