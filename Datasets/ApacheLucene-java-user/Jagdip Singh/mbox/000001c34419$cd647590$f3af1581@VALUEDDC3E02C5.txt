SUBJECT: making XML from articles
DATE: 6 Jul 2003

Hi,
I am trying to use Lucene for searching articles (text files) and web
pages. I am thinking of converting those articles to XML files and then
feed to Lucene for indexing.
I have not done anything much with XML before and trying to know if this
is going to be a better idea in term of searching. 
How can I convert text into XML?
 
Please suggest me if someone has faced similar situation before.
 
Regards, 
Jagdip
