SUBJECT: accessing Lucene functionality from asp.net
DATE: 6 Jul 2003

Hi,
I have web pages in asp.net and developing search for web site using
Lucene. I have to use Lucene's API from asp.net's code to search and
also feed new web pages and articles submitted to web site for updating
indexes of Lucene. Is there anyone who did similar work i.e. used
Lucene's functionality through asp.net. 
 
Regards,
Jagdip
