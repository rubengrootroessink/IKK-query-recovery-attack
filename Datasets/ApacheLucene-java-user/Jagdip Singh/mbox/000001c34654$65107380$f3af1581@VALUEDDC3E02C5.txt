SUBJECT: How to store xml file to index after parsing
DATE: 9 Jul 2003

Hi,
I have XML file and want to store it to index for searching as well as
to database for archiving.
How can I store it to index as well as database? What should be the
table structure to store XML file? Do you think each element of XML file
has to be attribute/feature in table of there could be table with
structure like below?
Create table index (
            File_name char(100) not null,
            Modification_date int(100) not null,
            Length int(100) not null,
            Contents blob,
            Primary key(File_name)
);
 
Please give me ideas.
 
Regards,
Jagdip
