XML is an organized, standardized format so let's say your document has
the following characteristics

File name : foobar.doc
Firt line title : Foo Bar
File content :
	Blah blah blah blah 
	Blah blah blah blah 
	Blah blah blah blah 
	Blah blah blah blah 

Then you have to read the file ( simple file read, java can do this in
about ten different ways, pick one )
But each of the files characteristincs in a variable

And then parse it in a valid XML:
<doc doc_id=1>
	<file_name>foobar.doc</file_name>
	<title>Foo Bar</title>
	<content>
	Blah blah blah blah 
	Blah blah blah blah 
	Blah blah blah blah 
	Blah blah blah blah 
	</content>
</doc>


There are probably packages that will do this for you but it's so simple
you could pull it off in under a hundred lines, it's also good exercise
to familiarize yourself with XML (if you haven't played around with it
before)
