SUBJECT: Distributable CD
DATE: 4 Aug 2005


We deliver HTML web sites to our clients on a CD.  It often remains on 
that CD, and they pass the CD around, and use it when they need to do 
research on some topic.

We would like to offer them the ability to search the contents of the CD.

We can not install any software on their windows machines (that includes 
a JVM, or Microsoft's latest .net whatz-it). 

I realize this a crippled, broken process, and that I should be ashamed 
for trying to enable it.

Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations on how we could 
implement such a search functionality?

Thanks,

Dan
