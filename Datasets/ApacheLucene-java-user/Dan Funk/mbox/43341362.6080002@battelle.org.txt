Absolutely not.   I'm saying the practice of storing your documents 
outside of a Lucene, is, in general,  a good practice to follow.  Lucene 
is brilliant, but specialized.  It should be used for it's intended 
porpoise (everything should have an intended porpoise).  I wasn't 
slighting the Highlighter, my project has been very much the better for 
having used it.

I don't know.  I can run ten full page text documents through the 
highlighter and generate a search results page in about 50ms, about the 
same amount of time it took to get the hits object.  And I have reason 
to believe I may not have used the highlighter in  the most effective 
manor.  I stopped futzing with it when I felt I was getting results back 
in an acceptable amount of time.
