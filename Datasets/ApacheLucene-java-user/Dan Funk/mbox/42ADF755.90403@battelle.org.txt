It comes with Linux installed - looks like they wrapped their own - no 
official distribution.
You can, with a little effort, put debian on it ( 
http://www.eleves.ens.fr/home/leurent/zaurus.html ).

It doesn't come with Java, but you can get an official version from sun 
that works very well ( 
http://java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/pp4zaurus/ )

I re-compiled my application for java 1.1  and put the Lucene binary I 
downloaded in my path - I didn't alter it at all.  Everything worked 
right out of the box.  I should note that a GUI based application would 
have been far more difficult to port - all I had  was a web service- and 
that moved over without a hitch.
