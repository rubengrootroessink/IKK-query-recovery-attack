What you are doing is a good, scalable practice.  You need to store 
those email messages somewhere outside of Lucene, and use a unique id to 
correlate the two.  When you want to display relevant text for a search 
result, find the file on disk, and pass it through the Lucene 
Highlighter  (see the Lucene sandbox).  This will give you what you are 
looking for, and it will scale well in the future.
