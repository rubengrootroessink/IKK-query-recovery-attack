Lucene is an excellent choice. 

If I were you I would not store the un-searched fields in the index.  
There's no clear benefit. Where you store the data depends on your needs 
- I use flat files for what I'm doing - as I need them just for 
display.  If you need the functionality of a relational database, then 
that's a perfectly acceptable solution as well.

I have roughly 100,000 records currently - where each "record" is a full 
text page from a book.  I use a dual processor Pentium 4.  I get large 
result sets (10,000 hits) back in under 1/10 of a second.  I've given no 
thought what-so-ever to keeping my code tight or controlled or efficient 
- and I'm still getting great results.
