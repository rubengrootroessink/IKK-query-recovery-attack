SUBJECT: Re: Using Highlighter to highlight entire HTML documents?
DATE: 25 May 2005


 I wrote a very simple sax parser for our xml content -  I check for the 
search tokens (analyzer.tokenStream)  in the text and place a span tag 
around each found token.  This process could work well with xhtml  as well.

In other words, I could never get the highlighter to do what I wanted to 
do, but there's a lot to be learned from the highlighter source.
