You could have a parentId field in each document - which will give you a 
nice hierarchy.  You could also create a topicId (Linux, Microsoft, 
etc...) and a storyId.  At that point you can quickly identify the topic 
and story for the message - and you can also search within a specific 
thread (AND parentId=X)  or a particular topic, or a particular story.
