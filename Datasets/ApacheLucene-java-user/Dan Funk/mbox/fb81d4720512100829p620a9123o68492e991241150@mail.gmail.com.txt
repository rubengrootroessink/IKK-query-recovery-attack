SUBJECT: Re: where to store the index
DATE: 10 Dec 2005

If this is a small index and it won't change after install (you are just
using it to search, not to index), place it in a sub-directory of WEB-INF.

If it is a larger index (something you don't want to copy frequently), or it
will change after install, then you shouldn't keep it inside your web
application at all, rather you should specify an external directory outside
the web application using some sort of configuration setting, maybe specify
it in your web.xml file.
