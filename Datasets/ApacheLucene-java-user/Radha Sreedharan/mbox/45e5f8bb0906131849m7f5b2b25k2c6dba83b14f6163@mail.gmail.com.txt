DATE: 14 Jun 2009

Currently I am following a long drawn approach where
1) I find index of the matching text in the original
2) For a list of words to the left of index and to the right of index+length
of matching text
3) Then a pick some words from the 1st list and prepend to my  matching text
text and from my second list and append to my  matching text


However I really feel that I am doing something redundant and that Lucene
should be returning me  the matching text !!!

Pls Do help me out in this .
