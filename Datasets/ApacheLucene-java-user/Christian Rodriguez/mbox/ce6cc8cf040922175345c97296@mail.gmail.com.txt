SUBJECT: Transcations in Lucene + Berkeley DB
DATE: 23 Sep 2004

Hi Luceners!

I am trying to use transcations in the Berkeley DB + Lucene package
from the sandbox. Has anyone done this succesfully? I dont see any
transactions being commited or aborted in the code, so I wonder if
transactions actually work (shouldnt the main transaction that is used
for opening a DbDirectory be commited when DbDirectory.close() is
executed? Should File.rename() enclose the "delete" and "put" in a
transaction to make sure it happens atomically?

Also, has anyone used transactions to enclose Lucene operations aside
from the txn that is passed to the DbDirectory.open() function?

Thanks!
Christian
