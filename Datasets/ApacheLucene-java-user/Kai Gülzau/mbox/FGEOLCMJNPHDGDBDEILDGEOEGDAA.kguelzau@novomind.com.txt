SUBJECT: only getting Hits with score >= threshold
DATE: 10 May 2005

Hi,

i'm trying to collect Documents whose (normalized) score
is greater than a given threshold.
But i don't know what is the smartest way to do so :)

Do i have to subclass (Index)Searcher and override

  search(Query query, Filter filter, final int nDocs)

to achieve this?
