SUBJECT: Soundex, Metaphone library
DATE: 28 Apr 2003

Hi,

i don't know if anybody knows this library...sounds good to me.

http://www.companywebstore.de/tangentum/mirror/en/products/phonetix/index.html

"Phonetix is a small, but useful class-library of phonetic algorithms written entirely in
Java. It includes
implementations of Soundex, Metaphone, and DoubleMetaphone.

[...]

Phonetix also contains adapters for the Lucene search-engine. With Phonetix, applications
of Lucene can easily use
phonetic indices and searches."

Regards,

 Kai Gülzau
