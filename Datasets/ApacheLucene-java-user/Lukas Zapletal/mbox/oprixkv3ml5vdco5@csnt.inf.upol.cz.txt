SUBJECT: Multiple fields
DATE: 13 Jan 2003

Hello all!

Q1:
Is there any easy way to search more than one field?
I mean I have 'content', 'headlines' and 'title' fields.
I need to search titles with best score, headlines with better score and
content with normal score.
I want to avoid these HitCollectors... If there is no easy way can you 
write me
how this can be done with HitCollectors? My code:

 query = QueryParser.parse(str, "content", analyzer);
 Hits hits = searcher.search(query);

Q2:
What score numbers to use with these fields?
I mean 1.0001 for title or something else?
