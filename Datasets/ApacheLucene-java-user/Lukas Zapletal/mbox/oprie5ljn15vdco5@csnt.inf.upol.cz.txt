SUBJECT: Converting ISO88592 files to UTF8 and indexing`em
DATE: 3 Jan 2003

Dears,

I have a problem. I need to index Czech content that is in HTML files in 
ISO-8859-2. Is there any way to convert them to UTF and index them?
What stream or reader have I use? Is it possible?

How can I construct queries after that... Some systems have ISO-8859-2 and 
some systems Win-1250.
Is there any way to convert query string from default (system) encoding to 
UTF8?

People programming ENGLISH systems are so happy... ;-)
