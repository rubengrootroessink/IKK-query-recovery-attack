SUBJECT: Automatic analyzer resolving based on Locale
DATE: 8 May 2007

I have a use case, in which I need to select the Analyzer based on a Locale.
For example:
"nl" => DutchAnalyzer
"nl_BE" => DutchAnalyzer
"fr" => FrenchAnalyzer
"foobar" => StandardAnalyzer (fallback)

I was wondering if lucene has any sort of "AutomaticAnalyzerResolver" 
class that could do this for me?
I 'll write it myself if it doesn't exist, but it might be very handy 
for the community to have this in Lucene's jar, as when new Analyzers 
are added, they could be hooked in automatically.

With kind regards,
