SUBJECT: Re: Automatic analyzer resolving based on Locale
DATE: 9 May 2007

We 'd use a different index for each locale's language that is 
configured, however this might have an impact on performance.

Would this be attainable (maybe some day in lucene)?

- Use an IndexEverythingAnalyzer for writing,
so "werk", "werkte", "gewerkt" and "en" is indexed as-is when they are 
encountered.

- And then use a DutchAnalyzer for reading,
which if I ask "werk" searches for "werk", "werkte" and "gewerkt",
and also ignores stop words like "en" in the query.
EnglishAnalyzer would search with "werk" for "werk", "werkes", "werked", ...


- It might seem a bad idea to mix several languages in the same index,
but in reality few data comes with the meta-data which declares the 
language of the data is written in.


With kind regards,
Geoffrey De Smet
