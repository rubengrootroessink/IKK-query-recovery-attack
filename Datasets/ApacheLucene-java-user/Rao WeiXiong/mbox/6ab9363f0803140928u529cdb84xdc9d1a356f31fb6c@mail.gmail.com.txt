SUBJECT: HELP: how to list term score inside some document?
DATE: 14 Mar 2008

Dear:

If possible to list all term scores inside some document by some
simple method?  now i just use each term as the query to search the
whole index to get the score. seems very cumbersome. is there any
simple approach?



Cheers!
