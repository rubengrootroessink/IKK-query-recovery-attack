I'm confused between paragraphs 2 and 3.

In 2, you say that I don't need the index on the local machine, just an
openStream to it.

In 3, you say that I need to download the index in order to search.

I have no problem signing the applet, if it will make this project
feasible.  And downloading the index isn't that horrible either, as I
can make it only happen once a day, not everytime they connect.

Thanks for the information.
