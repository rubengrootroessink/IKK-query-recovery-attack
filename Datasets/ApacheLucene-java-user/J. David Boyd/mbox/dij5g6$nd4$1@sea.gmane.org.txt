So here comes the next part of my applet ignorance.

Can I embed the Lucene, etc, jar files in my applet so that when the
user starts up the applet, they can be used on the local machine.

This alone probably stops me from using an applet, I guess.

Anyone have any idea where the definitive rules of what an applet can or
can not do are located on the 'net?
