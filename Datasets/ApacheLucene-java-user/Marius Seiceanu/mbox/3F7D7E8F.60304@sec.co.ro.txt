SUBJECT: German stamming algorithm problem
DATE: 3 Oct 2003

Hello!

    I have an application which make searches in Lucene indexed 
documents. The documents content is in German language.
    I use Lucene 1.3rc1.

    If I search for "Universität" i get some results, but if I search 
for "universität" i get no results.

    In the CHANGES.TXT of 1.3rc1 
(http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/jakarta-lucene/CHANGES.txt?rev=1.45) 
point 11 says that stamming is not case sensitive anymore.
----------
11. Changed the German stemming algorithm to ignore case while 
stripping. The new algorithm is faster and produces more equal stems 
from nouns and verbs derived from the same word. (gschwarz)
----------
    For  "Gesetz" and "gesetz" i get the same number of results!

Thank you,
       Marius Seiceanu.
