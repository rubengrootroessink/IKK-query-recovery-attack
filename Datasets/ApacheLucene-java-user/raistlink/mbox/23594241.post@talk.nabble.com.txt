SUBJECT: Max size of index? How do search engines avoid this?
DATE: 18 May 2009


Hi,
I think I've read that there is a limit for de index, may be 2Gb for fat
machines. If this is right I ask you for good resources (webs or books)
about programming search engines to know about the techniques used by big
search engines to search among such huge data.

Thanks
