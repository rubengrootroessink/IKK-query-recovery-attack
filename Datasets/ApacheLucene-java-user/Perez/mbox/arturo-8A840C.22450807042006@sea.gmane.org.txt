SUBJECT: Exact date search doesn't work with 1.9.1?
DATE: 8 Apr 2006

Hi all,

I have a document with a date in it and I put it into a field like so:
DateTools.dateToString(theDate, Resolution.DAY), 
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED.

What I find is that a range query works:
[20060131 TO 20060601] and wildcard works e.g.
2006*
but exact matches do not work e.g.
20060130

Any ideas on how I am misusing the API?

This is 1.9.1.

tia,
-arturo
