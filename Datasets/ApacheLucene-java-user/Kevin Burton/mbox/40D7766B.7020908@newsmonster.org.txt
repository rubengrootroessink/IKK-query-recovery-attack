SUBJECT: Reasonable to expect speed improvements when not using stored fields?
DATE: 21 Jun 2004

Let's say one had a 1G index with stored fields.  The index is then 
rewritten to support non-stored fields and the resulting target index is 
only 100M.

I would expect there to be a speedup when performing searches on the 
100M index but it was actually slightly slower.  Using a RAMDirectory 
didn't speed it up much either. 

Any thoughts?

Kevin
