I think I've played with ngramj and found it very lacking. 
 
I haven't played with 'languageidentifier' in Nutch ...

I realize that my corpus isnt' the best.  That's one of the reason's
I've open source'd it.  The main improvement in ngramcat (my code) is
that if the result isn't obvious we throw an Exception so
theoreticallyi we won't see any false positives unless the language
categorization is WAY off.

LI???

I haven't benchmarked it but I'd be interested in any suggestions you have.

Hm.. interesting.. where?  URL I can reads?

Yes.  We don't handle the mixed language case very well.  The chunking
method is something I wanted to approach.

Maybe I'm being dense but what is LI performance?

Thanks.
