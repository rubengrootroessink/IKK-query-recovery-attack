SUBJECT: use of LinkedList in ConjunctionScorer hurting performance?
DATE: 7 Jun 2005

This is a strange anomaly I wanted to point out:

This is a jprofiler screenshot.  I can give you a jprofiler "snapshot" 
if you want but it requires the clientside app.

I'm not sure why this should be hot... in a linked list this should be 
fast ... maybe we're calling it too often?

I didn't have much time to look at it but I wanted to illuminate the issue.

Kevin
