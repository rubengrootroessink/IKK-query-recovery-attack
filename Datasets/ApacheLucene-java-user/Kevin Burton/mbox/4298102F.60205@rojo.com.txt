SUBJECT: Ability to load a document with ONLY a few fields for performance?
DATE: 28 May 2005

I have a Document with about 15 fields.  I only need two of them.

How much faster would lucene be if I only fetched the two fields?  Each 
field is a separate file and this would almost certainly slow down just 
the basic IO.

I think I looked at this a long time ago and there was no high level API 
for doing this and that I'd have to dive into SegmentReader stuff.

Any idea?
