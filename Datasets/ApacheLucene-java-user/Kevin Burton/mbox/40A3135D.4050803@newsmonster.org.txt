SUBJECT: Possible to fetch a document without all fields for performance?
DATE: 13 May 2004

Say I have a query result for the term Linux... now I just want the 
TITLE of these documents not the BODY.

To further this scenario imagine the TITLE is 500 bytes but the  BODY is 
50M. 

The current impl of fetching a document will pull in ALL 50,000,500 
bytes not just the 500 that I need. 

Obviously if I could just get the TITLE field this would be a HUGE speedup.

Is there a somewhat simple and efficient way to get a document with a 
restricted set of fields?  Digging through the API it didnt' seem obvious.

Kevin
