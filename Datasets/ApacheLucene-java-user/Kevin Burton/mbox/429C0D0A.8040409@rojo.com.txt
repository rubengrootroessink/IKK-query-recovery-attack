SUBJECT: Finding minimum and maximum value of a field?
DATE: 31 May 2005

I have an index with a date field.  I want to quickly find the minimum 
and maximum values in the index.

Is there a quick way to do this?  I looked at using TermInfos and 
finding the first one but how to I find the last?

I also tried the new sort API and the performance was horrible :-/

Any ideas?

Kevin
