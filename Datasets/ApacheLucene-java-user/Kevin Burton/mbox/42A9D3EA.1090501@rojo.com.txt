Has anyone tried to tweak this on a RAID array on XFS?  Its confusing to figure out the ideal
read size.

My performance benchmarks didn't show any benefit to setting this variable higher but I'm
worried this is due to caching.

I tried to flush the caches by creating a 5G file and then cating that to /dev/null but I
have no way to verify that this actually works.

I just made the BUFFER_SIZE veriables non-final so that I can set them at any time.
