Is there anyone out there that has page ranking implemented on top of
Lucene?

Just in case anyone may be thinking otherwise, when I say page ranking
I'm not referring to the ranking of results from searches.  I'm talking
about something similar to how google computes what page may be more
relevant or important (often referred to as PageRank) which is effected
in part by how many other pages reference that page.

I've been through the examples listed here:

http://www.iprcom.com/papers/pagerank/index.html

which provides information from the origianl google paper about page
ranking.  Running the examples are fairly easy, but the big question I
have is how can I practically update such data?  And is there any
potential integration with Lucene?  It would seem that one could store
the computed ranking values in the actual Lucene Document itself, but
the updates would be fairly laborious as a few minor changes in rankings
can produce a large ripple in other related document rankings.  This, of
course, would be the same issue if the ranking information were stored
outside of Lucene.  One could potentially store this in a separate
database and then look up the ranking information for each document
found and then perform updates as an external asynchronous task.

Anyone have any experience with maintaining page rankings?


Thanks,

Scott
