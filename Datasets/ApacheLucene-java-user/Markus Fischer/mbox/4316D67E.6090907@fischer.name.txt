Multiple users can authenticate to the XML-RPC server but also have 
access to different documents inside lucene.

So I need some information in the lucene index to know which ones the 
users is able to access. Currently I generate a MD5 hash of the 
username/password and store this as Field.Keyword in the lucene index 
and "AND" all queries for that key too.

I'm just wondering whether all in all that's a good idea or not and 
would else I could do.
