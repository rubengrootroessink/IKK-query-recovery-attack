SUBJECT: Creating parser query "by hand"
DATE: 29 Aug 2005

Hi,

I currently pass the search tokens as Vector to my query function and 
construct the string to pass to the QueryParse.parse() by hand.

StringBuffer qStr = new StringBuffer();
qStr.append("title:" + queryString.trim() + "^7 ");
[...]

and this append for every field I want to search in.

When I started with lucene I had found a site saying that the 
performance would be better to craft the query token by hand and not 
having QueryParse.parse() parse my string again when I've already 
everything to built the tokens myself.

Unfortuantely I can't find this site again and I can't find an example 
on how it works to actually create the tokens myself and pass them to 
the searcher.

Any help would be appriciated.

thanks,
- Markus
