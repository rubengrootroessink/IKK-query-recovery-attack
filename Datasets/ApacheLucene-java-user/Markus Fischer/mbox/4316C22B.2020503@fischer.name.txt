The authentication tunnels all requests through a single method 
"execute". Can I then automatically call some XmlRpc callback function 
to let the XmlRpc-Server do its introspection which method to call?

In my case I would only add a new parameter to the Vector and and then 
disatch it to the method based on its signature.
