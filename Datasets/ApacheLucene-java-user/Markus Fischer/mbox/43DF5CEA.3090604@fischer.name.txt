SUBJECT: Stemming german words
DATE: 31 Jan 2006

Hi,

I'm currently using the GermanStemmer and it works well. However today 
I've found two words which get stemmed to the same stemm-word.

"Suche" and "Sucht" both get stemmed to the same "such" it seems, 
however they've completely different meanings in german (Suche = the 
Search, Sucht => addicttion).

Is there a way to tune the stemmer or are there alternatives available 
or should I look for another stemmer for the german language?

thanks for any pointers,
- Markus
