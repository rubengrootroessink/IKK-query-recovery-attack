SUBJECT: Using one physical lucene index for multiple projects
DATE: 31 Aug 2005

Hi,

I've about five different projects which would need to access a lucene 
index for searching. The projects are completely unrelated to each other 
however it's all about the same: indexing HTML documents.

Since all these projects are also runnig inside the same hosting 
company, I thought about being nice to resources and actually only use 
one luceneindex for all projects.

I'm running XML-RPC to allow access to the index.

My idea was that I share a SecretKey between the projects indexers and 
projects clients. So the indexer can only add/remove documents with his 
key and the client can only access documents with his key.

The goal is not about the ultimate security solution but not to have run 
multiple Lucene instances on the machines.

I this a good idea to do it that way or would someone recommend another 
practice?

thanks,
- Markus
