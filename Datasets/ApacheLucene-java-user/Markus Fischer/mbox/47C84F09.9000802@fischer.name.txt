Thanks for the dictionary hint. So obvious, but still I haven't thought about 
it until you mentioned it!

I've had really great success with the following pattern:

* after the Lucene index was created, I generate a myspell compatible 
dictionary from it

* when the search returns no result, every term is ran through myspell suggestion

* the top five myspell suggestion of each term are re-sorted by their 
frequency from the Lucene index

Additionally: when the user only entered a single term, I'm also providing the 
second best results as alternative (did you mean x or y?).

The results have been very good so far, thanks again!
