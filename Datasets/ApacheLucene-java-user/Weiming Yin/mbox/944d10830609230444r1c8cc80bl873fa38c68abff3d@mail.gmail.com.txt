SUBJECT: Can I get the most hot term ?
DATE: 23 Sep 2006

Hi, all,
I am working with the follow situation.
1: a, b
2: b, c

When I build index with 1 and 2, it gives me three terms, a, b and c.
and 'b' is the most hot because it appears two times.

Is there a method that I get all (or a part of) terms that sorted by appears
time.
For the before example, when I get the terms it returns me
b (2 times), a (1 time), c( 1time).

Is there a method do like this?

Thanks.
