Just dont make it a phrase query. Remember a phrase is a set string.  Your
talking about combinations of non set strings.

Wouldn't that depend on how far from each other you wanted to allow
them to be?  If you have a document with 100 words indexed and you are
searching for "first second" wouldn't you have to set the slop to about
100, just in case the word 'first' is the very first word in the
document, and 'second' is the very last work in your document?
I haven't used slop factor, so this is only theory :)
