Yeah it might be an hardware issue, with a slightly smaller index with
less stored data, the performance is what we want it to be.  Just adding
5% more stored data(unidexed of course) pushes us over some sort of
threshold causing performance to tank.

I've just built a 9.3G index (admittedly tons of stored data in there,
3.3M documents) and performance is amazing (through Solr).
