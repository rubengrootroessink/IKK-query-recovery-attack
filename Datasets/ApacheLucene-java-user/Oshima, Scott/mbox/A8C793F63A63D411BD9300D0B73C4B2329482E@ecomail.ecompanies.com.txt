If not already, you may wanna create a IndexReader pool similar to database
connection pools to speed up the query process.  

In terms of network and data transfer speeds, I don't think that is a lucene
issue rather than an implentation issue on your side.  I would just use an
HttpServer to proxy all your querying rather than opening direct connection
to the index files over the network(assuming your doing that).

We built a Lucene prototype, and compared it to our current Search Engine,
Verity's K2, running on Linux.  Query times are quick, but performance of
the combined time to return hitlist data and transfer it across the network
was slow.

Any tuning suggestions?
