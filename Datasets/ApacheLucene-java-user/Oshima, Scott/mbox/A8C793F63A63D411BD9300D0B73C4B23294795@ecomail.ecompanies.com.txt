SUBJECT: character filter issue
DATE: 8 Jan 2002

Suppose we have one field with one string abc-xxx.com

When I query for abc-xxx.com it returns 0 hits.

BUT when i query for something like xxx.com it returns results fine.

not sure what lucene is doing with the dashes.  i am using the default
standardfilter, lowercasefilter, stopfilter and porterstemfilter. 

Does anyone know how to get around this?

thanks.
