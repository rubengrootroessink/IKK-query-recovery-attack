Anyone can send me a link to the lucene mailing list email archives?  these emails build up
fast and i can't store them locally, but too valuable to delete.  thanks.

Hi everyone!

Is there a good guide anywhere to compile the source code of lucene?
I don't know very well how to start, specially with javacc.

Thanks
