I would suggest you take a look at Solr -- http://lucene.apache.org/solr 
-- which requires essentially no Java knowledge to use.  It has a Python 
client which at the very least might help with the learning curve.   If 
you want to try an alternative to JSP/Servlets for your web framework, 
there's Grails/Groovy (http://grails.org/) which for me is a heck of a 
lot of fun.   BTW, there's a Grails plugin available which uses  
Compass/Lucene.   Who knows, it might be enough for you.   A lot of 
folks are using Rails/Ruby/Solr which is also worth checking out.
