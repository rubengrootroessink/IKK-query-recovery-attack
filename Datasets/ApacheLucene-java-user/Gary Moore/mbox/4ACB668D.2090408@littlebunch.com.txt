SUBJECT: Struts2 implementation
DATE: 6 Oct 2009

I'm porting one of my Struts1 Lucene search apps to Struts2.   The 
basics are working but I need to remove the Lucene search service out of 
the action classes.   I'm ready to write an interceptor but can perhaps 
also see using a plug-in like is done with Tiles.   As I'm a Struts2 
newbie, any tips/advice from anyone's experiences would be appreciated.  
Thanks
Gary
