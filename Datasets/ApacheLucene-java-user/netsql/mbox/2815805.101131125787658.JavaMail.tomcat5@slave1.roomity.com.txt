SUBJECT: [OT ANN] Roomity v 1.5 w/ video, social networking and html editor + JDNC article
DATE: 4 Nov 2005

Roomity.com v 1.5 is a web 2.01/RiA poster child community webapp. This new version ads broadcast
video, social networking such as favorite authors and html editor.
It likely already has groups and content you are already using but aggregated and safer, including
technology, Java, etc., but it only works on broadband.

It uses lucene in the backtroung, for example http://roomity.com/launch.jsp?search=luc in
RiA.
or... you can get to this mail list via http://lucene.roomity.com.
