hi Dominique,

I am looking for a crawler to feed solr index. After looking at various
posts i have settled down on two
Nutch and crawl anywhere.

I dont see any activities on Nutch wiki so wondering if its not being
developed anymore. But most forums say Nutch is standard for solr.

Crawl Anywhere looks solid. Any way for users like me to decide which one we
should go for Nutch or Crawl Anywehre?


Concern with crawl anywhere is it supports solr 1.3 index not the latest
version

Any help on the is really appreciated
