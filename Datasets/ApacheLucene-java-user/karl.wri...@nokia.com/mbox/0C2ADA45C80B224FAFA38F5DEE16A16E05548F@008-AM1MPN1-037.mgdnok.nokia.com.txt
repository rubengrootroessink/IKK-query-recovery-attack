Ah, I was not thinking of a Solr addon!  I thought you were referring to some other crawler
that I'd never heard of.

So the answer to your question is that ManifoldCF differs from DIH in at least the following
ways:

- ManifoldCF can handle a wide range of repositories, not just database tables
- ManifoldCF indexes data to Solr via the Extracting Update Handler
- ManifoldCF handles deletions as well as insertions and updates
- ManifoldCF provides a UI and a document-specific security model

Hope this helps.
Karl
