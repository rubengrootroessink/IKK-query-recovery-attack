Dear Lucene/Solr user,

It is possible you may not know of an Apache project called ManifoldCF, whose purpose is to
provide content to Solr or other search engines for index.  If you have interest in this project,
this is to inform you that the ManifoldCF book from Manning Publishing, titled ManifoldCF
in Action, is now becoming available.  This is, of course, the Early Access program, which
gets people electronic access to chapters as they appear.  The first three chapters are up
there now.

You can learn more about ManifoldCF as a project at:

Feel free to forward this message to anyone who might be interested!

Karl
