Dear Lucene/Solr user,

It is possible you may not know of an Apache project called ManifoldCF, whose purpose is to
provide content to Solr for index.  If you have interest in this project, this is to inform
you that the ManifoldCF book from Manning Publishing, titled ManifoldCF in Action, is now
becoming available.  This is, of course, the Early Access program, which gets people electronic
access to chapters as they appear.  The first three chapters are up there now.
