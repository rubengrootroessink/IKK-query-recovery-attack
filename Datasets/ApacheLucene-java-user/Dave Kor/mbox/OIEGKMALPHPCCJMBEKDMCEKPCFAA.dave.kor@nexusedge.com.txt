The first query is always slow because it includes time taken to load the
index. Index loading time is a function of archive size, meaning the larger
the archive the longer the load time. However search time is more a function
of number of search terms, meaning if your archive only contains 100 unique
terms regardless of number of files, search time won't vary much as your
archive size increases 1000 to 16000 files.
