Yes and no. Lucene uses two query classes to handle
wildcards, namely PrefixQuery and WildcardQuery. 

To cut the long story short, PrefixQuery, the faster
of the two, is expressly optimized for wildcards
searches like "foo*" and "foa*" but doesn't yet
support single character matching like "foo?". 

WildcardQuery, the slower of the two and developed
after PrefixQuery was completed, handles general
wildcard searches like "fo*l" as well as "fo?l". 

I'll see what I can do to add single character
matching to PrefixQuery over the weekend.

Try looking at Range Query.

"~" is used to toggle fuzzy search on a single word.
Thus the search "foam~" will match with terms like
"foam", "form", "foal", "roam", etc..
