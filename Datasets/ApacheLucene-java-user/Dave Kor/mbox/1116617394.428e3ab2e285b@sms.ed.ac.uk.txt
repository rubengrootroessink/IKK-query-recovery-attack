SUBJECT: A special PhraseQuery
DATE: 20 May 2005

Hi all, its me again.

I'm in need of a special version of the phrase query. For example, given a
search phrase "alpha beta gamma", I'ld like a to score documents something like
the following manner.

If document contains exactly "alpha beta gamma", score = 1
If document contains "alpha gamma beta" score = 0.9
If document contains "gamma alpha beta" score = 0.8
If document contains "gamma beta alpha" score = 0.7
If document contains "alpha beta" score = 0.666
If document contains "beta gamma" score = 0.666
If document contains "alpha gamma" score = 0.666
If document contains "alpha" score = 0.333
If document contains "beta"  score = 0.333
If document contains "gamma" score = 0.333


Has anyone done something like this? Or do I have to take apart and rewrite
PhraseScorer or SloppyPhraseScorer to achieve this?


Regards,
Dave Kor.
