Yes, its confusing. Sun calls its own encoding format as "Unicode" and the above
webpage talks about how to convert between Java's Unicode format and the UTF-8
format.

Its just a matter of specifying "UTF-8" when creating output streams. I may have
remembered wrongly, but I do seem to recall old Lucene code that was designed to
run on JDK 1.1 actually did this "UTF-8" conversion.
