SUBJECT: RE: Wildcard search - Why can't I search for *term?
DATE: 5 Apr 2002


In a way, *term searches are supported - just iterate through every term in
TermEnum. Unfortunately, this is a linear O(n) algorithm so it does become
very slow as the number of terms in the index increases. If your index is
small (eg, < 1GB), I find the search time still pretty acceptable.
Otherwise, the I suggest you be a little creative in the way you create your
index (eg, keep search terms in reverse "mret*" instead of "*term")
