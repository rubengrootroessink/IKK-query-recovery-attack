A few GB is typically considered a small index for Lucene. Without
seeing the exception call stack, its kind of hard to understand
exactly what is causing the out of memory problem. Based on past
experience, the only times I ever encountered out of memory issues
were during large queries that contain a few phrase, wildcard or fuzzy
sub-queries.
