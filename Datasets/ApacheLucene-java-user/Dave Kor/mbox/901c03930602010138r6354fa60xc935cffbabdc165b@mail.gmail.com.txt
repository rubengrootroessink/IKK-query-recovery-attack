One possible way is to use the vector space model on the set of
relevant documents returned by each query.

For example,
Relevant documents for the query "car insurance" are docids 1, 2, 4, 9, 10.
Relevant documents for the query "automobile insurance" are docids 2,
4, 8, 9, 10.
Relevant documents for the query "life insurance" are docids 3, 5, 7, 9.

Here, "automobile insurance" will be scored as more similar to "car
insurance" than "life insurance" because there is a larger set of
overlapping docids.

Lucene can be adapted for this purpose by creating a second index that
stores all unique queries and their set of relevant docids as Lucene
Documents. Instead of indexing text terms, we index docids. Finding
queries similiar to the original query, Q, is a simple matter of
querying this second index with the set of docids relevent to query Q.

Hope this helps.
