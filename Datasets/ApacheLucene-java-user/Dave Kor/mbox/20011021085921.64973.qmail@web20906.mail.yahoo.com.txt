Hmm.. are you certain that WildcardQuery is used? If
you are using QueryParser, then Terms ending with an
asterix are handled by PrefixQuery and not
WildcardQuery. 

Although I think WildcardQuery possibly could be used
with terms ending with asterix, it was never tested
this way as it is assumed that PrefixQuery would
handle such cases.

Yes.
