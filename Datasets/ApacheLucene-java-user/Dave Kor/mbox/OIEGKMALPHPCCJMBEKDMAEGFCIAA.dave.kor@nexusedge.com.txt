SUBJECT: RE: OutOfMemoryErrors searching with WildCardQueries
DATE: 12 Jun 2003

OOM occurs only if the prefix/wild/fuzzy query matches with a large
percentage of the terms in the index due to their use of term expansion.
Placing a limit to expand only the first x matching terms would solve this
problem, that is assuming that the tradeoff in accuracy is acceptable.
