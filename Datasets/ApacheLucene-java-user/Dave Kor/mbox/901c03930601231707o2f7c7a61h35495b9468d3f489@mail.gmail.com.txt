SUBJECT: Re: performance implications for an index with large number of documents.
DATE: 24 Jan 2006

Lucene scales with the number of unique terms in the index and not the
number of documents nor the size of the documents. Typically, you
should have at most 1 million unique terms for a set of 10 million
documents.

So the fact that you have 13 million unique terms in 10 million
documents tells me that the characteristics of your document set don't
follow the typical term growth rate that Lucene is designed for. You
might actually be better off using a database for storing and
searching these documents.
