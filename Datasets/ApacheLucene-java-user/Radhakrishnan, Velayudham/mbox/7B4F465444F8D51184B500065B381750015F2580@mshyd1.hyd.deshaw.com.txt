SUBJECT: Multiple Index search using SearchBean.
DATE: 23 Sep 2003

Hi folks, 

I have been using Lucene for a while. Our application needs to sort 
the result set by last modified date. I was really happy to see SearchBean
and
HitsIterator. 

My question is that can I use SearchBean for search using Multiple indices. 
I skimmed through the souce code but could not find any method to search 
using Multiple indices or an array of Directories.

Can anyone help me. Thanks in advance.
