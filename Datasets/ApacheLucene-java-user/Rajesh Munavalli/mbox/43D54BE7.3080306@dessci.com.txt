SUBJECT: Specific length field in wild card queries
DATE: 23 Jan 2006

I am looking for Lucene API/work around to answer the following 
questions. I need to find if a particular field contains terms with 
certain length. Let me explain with an example.

Lets say there are
Four fields: F1, F2 and F3
Hypothetical User Query: "F1:lucene F2:* F3:? F4:group"

I am aware that Lucene does not allow wildcard queries starting with 
"*". The aim of the query is to find "lucene" in field F1 and "group" in 
field F4 but should find only those documents where
(1) Field F2 should not be empty.
(2) Field F3 should contain indexed terms of length 1.

Thanks,

Rajesh Munavalli
