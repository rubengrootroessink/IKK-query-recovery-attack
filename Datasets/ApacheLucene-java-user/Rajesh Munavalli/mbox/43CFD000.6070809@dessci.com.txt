SUBJECT: information theory based expanded query term boosting
DATE: 19 Jan 2006

Hi,
         Has anyone experimented information theory based expanded query 
weight boosting for Lucene?

         When the user query is small, there are several ways to expand 
the query terms by synonym terms, morph terms etc. I read several 
articles on how different boosting levels affect the precision and 
recall of the expanded query. In the context of Lucene, is there a 
systematic study conducted to analyze different boosting schemes? It 
would be nice to have a theoretical proof rather than empirically 
setting boost levels for the expanded query terms. The main disadvantage 
of empirical boost levels is that there is no cross system comparison 
and is highly dependent on the test bed.

Thanks,

Rajesh Munavalli
