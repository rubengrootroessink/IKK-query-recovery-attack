SUBJECT: Re: information theory based expanded query term boosting
DATE: 19 Jan 2006

Hi Jose,
         There are several papers on that topic. But the one which 
particularly interested me was

An information-theoretic approach to automatic query expansion
Claudio Carpineto, Renato de Mori, Giovanni Romano, Brigitte Bigi
ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)

           It would be interesting to see your  results. There are two 
different problems in expanding the query.
(1) Determining the expanded terms using methods like
            (a) Dictionary lookup
            (b) Local or global analysis

(2) Assigning weights to the expanded terms. What should the weight on 
the expanded term be? Is it in the order of 10, 100 or some logarithmic 
scale?

          Do you have any results (preliminary) results on problem (2)?

Thanks,

Rajesh Munavalli
