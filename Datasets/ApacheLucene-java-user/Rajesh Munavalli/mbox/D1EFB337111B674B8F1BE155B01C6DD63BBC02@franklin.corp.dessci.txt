SUBJECT: multiple fields in position increments
DATE: 2 Aug 2005

Is it possible to have multiple fields for the same token position?

For example:
Position         Field         Token
--------         ------        ------
    0            author        Rajesh
    0            person        Rajesh
    1            contents       is
    2            contents       ....

        In the above example, the token "Rajesh" is associated with two fields. At the time
of indexing I would like to add the second token with ZERO position increment.

thanks,

Rajesh Munavalli
