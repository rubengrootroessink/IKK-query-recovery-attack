Documents should be ordered as follows
Rank 1: Documents containing section containing all terms in the order of
the query terms
Rank 2: Documents containing section containing all terms but randomly
ordered
Rank 3: Documents containing atleast n (n  < N, where N is total number of
query terms) in the same section and in order

and so on...

But considering the number of query terms to be large, I am not really
looking for the exact ranking. Anything closer would  work just fine.
However, the number of query terms is what i am more concerned about when it
comes to implementing using Phrase query versus Span query in terms of query
speed.

looking for is that you want searches for phrase like "quick brown fox" to

Wouldnt the  phrase/span query match across sections if I do not introduced
the artifical section boundry?

If you want to tweak how much the score is influenced by the proximity of

I will take a closer look at the explaination.
