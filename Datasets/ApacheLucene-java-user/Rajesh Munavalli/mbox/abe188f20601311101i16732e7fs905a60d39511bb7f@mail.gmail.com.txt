I would suggest you to look at papers on local/global document analysis. One
of the approach is to get a set of terms which co-occur with the query term
say "insurance". From the initial query they select the top 'N' documents
and compute the co-occurrence of other terms (usually those having high TF)
with query terms. The intution is that words co-occurring are related.

      Google for "local global document analysis" and "word co-occurrence
similarity"
