At what point do I add n-grams? Does the order in which I add n-grams
affect exact phrase queries later? My questions are

(1) Should I add all the 1-grams followed by 2-grams followed by
3-grams..etc sentence by sentence OR

(2) Add all the 1 grams of entire document first before starting 2-grams
for the entire document?

What is the general accepted notion of adding n-grams of a document?

thanks,

Rajesh
