SUBJECT: RE: Highlighting search results in selected documents
DATE: 28 Oct 2002

Hi,
I am asking a very basic question. 
I would like to implement search engine capabilities in my intranet.
For that what should I need to do? Shall I need to learn javacc also to
write the parser files? 
I have run the demos and see the results for lucene. But I am getting a
starting problem. Can anyone help me please?
If anyone knows or has any other documentations/URLs please send it across
to me.
Thanks & Regards,
Murthy
