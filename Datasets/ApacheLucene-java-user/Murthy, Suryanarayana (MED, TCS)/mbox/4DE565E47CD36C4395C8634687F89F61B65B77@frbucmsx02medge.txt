Hi Kelvin,
Could you please tell me the steps how to implement search engine for the
intranet site with Lucene. I have gone through the documentation at the
site.
This is a starting problem for me.

Thanks & Regards,
Murthy

Kajal,

Index the date fields using Field.Keyword, and use a DateFilter to limit 
the results you need.

Kelvin
