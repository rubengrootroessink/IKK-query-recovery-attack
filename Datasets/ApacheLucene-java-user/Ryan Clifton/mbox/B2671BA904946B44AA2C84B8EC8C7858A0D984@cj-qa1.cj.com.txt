SUBJECT: Adding to the same Keyword field
DATE: 9 Jul 2003

The Lucene API docs say that you can add to the same Field name and the text will be appended
into the field.  If I Add multiple times to the same Field name with a Field.Keyword type,
will it make one big Keyword or multiple smaller Keywords in the same field?

Basically, I want to add all the href links on a page into one Field, but I don't want them
to be tokenized (Keywords).

thx.
