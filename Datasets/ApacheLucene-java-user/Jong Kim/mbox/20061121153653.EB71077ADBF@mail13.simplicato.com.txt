SUBJECT: Use case for term vector's token position/offset?
DATE: 21 Nov 2006

Hi,
 
When I look at org.apache.lucene.document.Field.TermVector,
it defines the following 5 options as to the detailed info 
that can be stored wrt term vectors. 

1. NO
2. WITH_OFFSETS
3. WITH_POSITIONS
4. WITH_POSITIONS_OFFSETS
5. YES

It isn't difficult to understand where the basic term vector
information (ie, terms and their number of occurences - option 5)
might be useful. I believe it can be used to implement features
like "concept search" or "more like this" functionalities. 

However, it isn't clear to me how the other extra info (ie,
token position information and/or token offset information)
might be used? Can anyone help me understand what kind of 
(advanced) search techniques people use these extra 
information for, or even better, any pointer to real world 
examples?

Thanks
/Jong
