SUBJECT: Looking for a stemmer that can return all inflected forms
DATE: 14 Oct 2006

Hi,
 
I'm looking for a stemmer that is capable of returning all morphological 
variants  of a query term (to be used for high-recall search). For example, 
given a query term of 'cares', I would like to be able to generate 'cares', 
'care', 'cared', and 'caring'.
 
I looked at the Porter stemmer, Snowball stemmer, and the K-stem. 
All of them provide a method that takes a surface string ('cares') as an 
input and returns its base form/stem, which is 'care' in this example. 
But it appears that I can not use the stemmer to generate all of the 
inflected forms of a given query term. 
 
Does anyone know of such tool for Lucene? 
Any help or pointer would be greatly appreciated. 
 
Thanks
/Jong
