SUBJECT: store and query the relation between the terms
DATE: 18 Jul 2011

Hi,I have a reqiment,i need to calculate the relation between the terms.for example

Term1    Term2    relation(Weight)
iphone    ipad      0.99999
iphone   apple     0.88888
iphone   food      0.33333

theare are a lot of term in my dictionary,about 600,000.it means that  i must store about

600,000*(600,000-1) records.so it can not store in memory fully.
and when i search iphone ,i must get  top N terms(order by relation desc,get top n).

does there have open source freamework to complete this reqiment?like Lucene to store and
search the term's tf,df
Thank you!
