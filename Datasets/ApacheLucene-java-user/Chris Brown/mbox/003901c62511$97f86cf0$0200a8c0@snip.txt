I'd suggest creating the index a little differently. How about creating each 
paragraph as a document. Each document could have three fields: filename, 
paragraph number and content.

With an index like this you'd be able to easily search one field for the 
content, the hits could report which paragraph and file the content was 
found in, plus you could do paragraph specific searches if you like.
