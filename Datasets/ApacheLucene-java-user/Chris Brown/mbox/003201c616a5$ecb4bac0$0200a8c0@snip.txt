Okay, I've taken Grant's advice and aggregated the TermFreqVector's for
each term in the applicable field. It works quite well, there's just one
glitch.

Some words like "party" and "picture" appear as "parti" and "pictur". I am
using the SnowballAnalyzer, I suspect that's what's changing the words.
Short of maintaining a second index using a different analyzer, does anyone
have any ideas?
