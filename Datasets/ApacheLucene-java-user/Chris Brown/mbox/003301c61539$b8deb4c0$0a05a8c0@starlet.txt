SUBJECT: top n words within a results set?
DATE: 9 Jan 2006

Hello,

Is it possible to retrieve the top 'n' most often appearing words within a search criteria?
I've seen the High Frequency Terms code in the sandbox but it works across the whole index.

To put this question into context: We're developing website that hosts a user's photo website.
Searches can be specific to a particular user's website or be performed globally across one,
many or all websites. I've accomplished this with a field in the index called website. What
I'd like to do is give each user the top ten words that appear on their website. 

Thanks,
Chris Brown
