This is kind of a problem, in order to delete documents using terms you need
to have a keyword field which contain a unique value, otherwise you might
ending deleting more then you want.

Hi,

If I index a document like this:

IndexWriter writer = createWriter();
Document document = new Document(); document.add(Field.Text(ID_FIELD_NAME,
componentId)); document.add(Field.Text(CONTENTS_FIELD_NAME,
componentDescription)); writer.addDocument(document); writer.optimize();
writer.close();

What code must I execute to later delete the document (I tried following the
docs and whats done in the code and test cases.  I saw Terms being used to
ID the document to delete.  But I am not clear what value to put in the
Term, as I do not know how Terms relate to Fields).

Many thanks,
Mike.
