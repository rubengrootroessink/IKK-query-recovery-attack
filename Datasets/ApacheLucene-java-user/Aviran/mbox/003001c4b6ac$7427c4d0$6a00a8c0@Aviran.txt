AFIK if the term "Election 2004" will be between quotation marks this should
work fine.

Can he? If "Elections 2004" is one token in the subject field (keyword), 
this will fail, since WhiteSpeceAnalyzer will tokenize that to `Elections' 
and `2004'.
So I guess he has to write an identity analyzer himself unless there is one
provided (which doesn't seem to be the case). The only alternatives are not
using query parser or extending query parser for a key word syntax, as far
as I can see.
