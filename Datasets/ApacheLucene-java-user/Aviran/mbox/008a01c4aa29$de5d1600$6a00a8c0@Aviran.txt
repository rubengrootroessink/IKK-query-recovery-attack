You should not have more then one IndexWriter. (You can have multiple
IndexReaders, but only one IndexWriter).

As I understand it, if two writers try to acess the same index for writing,
then one of the writers should block waiting for a lock until the lock
timeout period expires, and then they will return a "Lock wait timeout"
exception.

I have a multithreaded indexing applications that writes into one of
multiple indexes depending on a hash value, and I intend to merge all the
hashes when the indexing finishes.  Locking usually works but sometimes it
doesn't and I get IO exceptions such as the following..

        at org.en.global.indexer.IndexGroup.run(IndexGroup.java:387)


Any idea on why this could be happening?  I am using NFS currently, but the
problem appears on the local filesystem as well.
