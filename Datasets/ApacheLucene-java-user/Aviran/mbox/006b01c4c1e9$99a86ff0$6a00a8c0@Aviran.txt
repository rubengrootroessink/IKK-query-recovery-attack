SUBJECT: RE: Faster highlighting with TermPositionVectors
DATE: 3 Nov 2004

Did anyone tried this class ?

I tried this class but I can't make it to work I indexed a field as new
Field("description", description,true,true,true,true); but when I call 
TokenSources.getTokenStream(_indexReader,i,"description"); I get
ClassCastException

In this class the line TermPositionVector tpv=(TermPositionVector)
reader.getTermFreqVector(docId,field); is trying to cast SegmentTermVector
to TermPositionVector. 
Is there anything I'm doing wrong. Should I have indexed the field some
other way to store TermPositionVector ?

BTW: I'm using the latest lucene source from CVS.

Thanks,
Aviran

This is great news! While I won't have the time to test this until probably
mid November I do look forward to the speed improvements as the current
highlighting mechanisms (reparsing the text) was just not performant enough
under heavy loads.
