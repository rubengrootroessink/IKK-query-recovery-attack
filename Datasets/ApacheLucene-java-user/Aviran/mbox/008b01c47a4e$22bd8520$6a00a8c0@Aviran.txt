Subject: Question on number of fields in a document.


Hi
 
I had a question related to number of fields in a document. Is there any
limit to the number of fields you can have in an index.
 
We have around 25-30 fields per document at present, about 6 are keywords,
Around 6 stored, but not indexed and rest of them are text, which is
analyzed and indexed fields. We are planning on adding around 24 more fields
, mostly keywords.
 
Does anyone see any issues with this? Impact to search or index ?
 
Thanks
ZJ
