You can only sort on indexed field. (even more than that, it'll work
properly only on Untokenized fields, ie keyword).

Subject: problem with SortField[] in search method (newbie)


Luceners,
My search looks up the whole entities. My entities are accounts, contacts,
tasks, etc. My searching looks up a group of entity's fields. This works
fine despite, I don't have indexed any entity in a document. But If I sort
by some fields from different entities, I get the following error.
 
field "shortName" does not appear to be indexed
 
The account's field I have indexed are
 
shortName,number,location,fax,phone,symbol
 
and I order by
 
shortName
----------------------------------------------------
without  any order
 
shortName,number,location,fax,phone,symbol
 
it works fine.
----
I don't understand the behavior because If I don't order the searching and I
don't have any document indexed, It works fine, but If I add an order I get
a runtimeException and I can't catch the exception  to solve the problem.
The only solution it's to index the whole fields' entitities once in a
document, but for me it's a patch.
 
Any idea,  it could help me out.
 
Thanks in advance.
