I have suggested a solution for this problem (
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30382 ) you can use the
patch suggested there and recompile lucene.

It would be wasteful for Lucene to assume any field you add should be 
available for sorting.

Adding one more line to your indexing code to accommodate your sorting 
needs seems a pretty small price to pay.  Do you have suggestions to 
improve how this works?   Or how it is documented?
