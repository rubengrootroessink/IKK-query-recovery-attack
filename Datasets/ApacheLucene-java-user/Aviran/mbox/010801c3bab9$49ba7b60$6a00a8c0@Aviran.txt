You'll need to apply some kind of filter or add another field to the index
which contains only the first word (Yes you'll need to rebuild the index in
this case)

Is it possible to create a query that would find a match in a document if
and only if the query (a one word query) matched with the first word in the
field I am searching?

Or do I have to rebuild my indexes, with a field that only contains the
first word?

Thanks, 

Dan
