For the records that don't contain a field you can put a bogus value such as
"empty" and then you can query on -UD:empty

Subject: A simple newbee question . How do i exclude a field ?


Hi ,
i use lucene to search against a flatted DB table.
I have  a table which contains the following data . 
there are 3 records which contain the code RN , 
27 which contain UD 
and 3266 which contain BLANK.

code        Number of records
-------        -------------------------
   	3269
RN	3
UD	27

if my searchString is "RN" , i get 3 
if my searchString is "UD" , i get 27 
if my searchString is "" , i get 3296 (in this case i bypass queryfilter)

Now , I need to get number of records which do not contain UD . (similar to
a DB query of NOT IN or !=). if the string is "-UD" , it doesnt work. 
Could you tell me how to construct a string for this ?

Regards
Robin
