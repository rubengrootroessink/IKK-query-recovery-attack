SUBJECT: Q: Searching - Use of field to increase score, without filtering
DATE: 17 Nov 2006

Hello everybody!

I used Weka-classification to classify document into different classes. 
In Lucene I saved the predicted classes (besides the document + 
metadata) for these docs into a field called preclasses. Now I would 
like to use this field to boost the score, if a userquery agree to the 
value of this field. But I don't like to filter by this field, which 
means: if a userquery for the field preclasses fits to the value of the 
field, all documents (indenpentent from the value  of the field 
preclasses) should be returned, but for documents where the value of the 
preclasses field matches to the user-input should be used for boosting 
the score (therefore I set the boostfactor of the field preclasses to a 
higher value than 1).

In short: The field preclasses should be used as a booster and not as a 
filter! Is this possible? And how?

Thanks a lot!

Stephan Spat
