Hi Paul,

Thanks. 
Use Nutch to do crawling. and integrate Lucene to the web application, so that can do search
online.

BTW, Nutch seems to have only Linux version, what my development is on Windows. Am i right?

Zhou,

Lucene is a back-end library, it's very useful for developer but it is not a complete site-search-engine.
A lucene-based site-search-engine is Nutch, it does crawl.
Solr also provides functions close to these with a large amount of thoughts on flexible integration;
crawling methods are rather based on feeds or other acquisition methods (see DIH for example).
