SUBJECT: a complete solution for building a website search with lucene
DATE: 8 Jan 2010

Hi ,

I am new in Lucene. 

To build a web search function, it need to have a backendc indexing function. But, before
that, should run a Crawler? because Lucene index based on Html documents, while Crawler can
change the website pages to Html documents. Am i right? 

If so, please anyone suggest to me a Crawler? like Nutch?
Thanks
Zhou
