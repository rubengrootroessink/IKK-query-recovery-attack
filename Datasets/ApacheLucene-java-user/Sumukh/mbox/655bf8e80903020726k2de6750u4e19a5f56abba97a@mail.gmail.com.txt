SUBJECT: Indexing synonyms for multiple words
DATE: 2 Mar 2009

> Hi,
>
> I'm fairly new to Lucene. I'd like to know how we can index synonyms for
> multiple words.
>
> This is the scenario:
>
> Consider a sentence: AAA BBB WORD1 WORD2 EEE FFF GGG.
>
> Now assume the two words combined WORD1 WORD2 can be replaced by another
> word SYN.
>
> If I place SYN after WORD1 with positionIncrement set to 0, WORD2 will
> follow SYN,
> which is incorrect; and the other way round if I place it after WORD2.
>
> If any of you have solved a similar problem, I'd be thankful if you could
> share some light on
> the solution.
