This not quite correct, Chinese doesn't need any stemming but Japanese
is not completely ideograph-based and it could use stemming. I doubt
anyone has done this, besides some commercial software for the japanese
market. I don't know for Korean.

Edit distance only seems to work with latin character based (writen)
languages. Spell checking Chinese, Japanese (and Korean?) is more or
less pointless, as they are inputed using input methods, which should
produce "correct" words.
