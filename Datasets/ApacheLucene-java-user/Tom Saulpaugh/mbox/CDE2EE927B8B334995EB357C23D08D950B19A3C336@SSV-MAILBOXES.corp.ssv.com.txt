SUBJECT: Change the merge factor for an existing index?
DATE: 27 Oct 2008

Hello,

We are currently using lucene v2.1 and we are planning to upgrade to lucene v2.4.
Can we change the merge factor for an existing index and then add more documents to that index?
 Is there some kind of upgrade path like using optimize to move an existing index to a different
merge factor?

Thanks,

Tom
