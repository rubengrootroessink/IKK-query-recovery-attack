SUBJECT: Split single string into several fields?
DATE: 27 Oct 2009

Hello list,
  I have some semi-structured text that has some markup elements, and
I want to put those elements into a separate field so I can search by
them.  For example (using HTML syntax):
---- 8< ---- document
<h1>Section title</h1>
Body content
---- >8 ----
I can find that the things inside <h1>s are "Section" and "title", and
"Body" and "content" are outside.  I want to create two fields for
this document:
insideh1 -> "Section", "title"
alltext -> "Section", "title", "Body", "content"

What's the best way to approach this?  My initial thought is to make
some kind of MultiAnalyzer that consumes the text and produces several
token streams, which are added to the document one at a time.  Is that
a reasonable strategy?

Thanks!
Will
