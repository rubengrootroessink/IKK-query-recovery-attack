SUBJECT: Re: Lucene as primary object storage
DATE: 28 Jun 2007

Hibernate Search (formerly known as Hibernate Lucene) is not designed  
to use Lucene as the primary and only backend. It is designed to  
complement a database.
I don't really like the idea actually: I'm much comfortable with  
having my data in a relational DB :)

So this product will not help for you request.
