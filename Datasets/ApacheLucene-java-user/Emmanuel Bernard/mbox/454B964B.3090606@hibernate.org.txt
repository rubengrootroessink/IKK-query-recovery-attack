SUBJECT: Re: Modelling relational data in Lucene Index?
DATE: 3 Nov 2006

Hi
No, he is talking about
http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/annotations/reference/en/html/lucene.html

Also note that I'm about to release a new version much more flexible
http://www.mail-archive.com/hibernate-dev%40lists.jboss.org/msg00392.html
and for the future (but flexible)
http://www.mail-archive.com/hibernate-dev%40lists.jboss.org/msg00393.html

Note that Compass is an alternative approach. I haven't really looked at 
the project in detail, the main drawback for me and some other people 
who compared the 2 were
 - it requires you to deal with a different API than your ORM
 - it does not give you back a managed (ORM) object on query results
 - it abstracts quite a lot Lucene

I guess you need to check by yourself

So, the stricture is
