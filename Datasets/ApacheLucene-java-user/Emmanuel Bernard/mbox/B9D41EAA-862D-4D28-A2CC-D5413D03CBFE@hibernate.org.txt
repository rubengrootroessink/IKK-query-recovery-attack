SUBJECT: PhraseQuery vs MultiPhraseQuery
DATE: 28 May 2010

Hello,
I am a bit confused by the two.

Is there a fundamental difference between

PhraseQuery query = new PhraseQuery();
query.add(term1, 0);
query.add(term2, 0);

and

MultiPhraseQuery query = new MultiPhraseQuery();
query.add( new Term[] { term1, term2 } );

The only different I could think of is that MPQ somehow does a OR between terms at the same
position while PQ does a AND. Am I off base?

Thanks for you help.

Emmanuel
