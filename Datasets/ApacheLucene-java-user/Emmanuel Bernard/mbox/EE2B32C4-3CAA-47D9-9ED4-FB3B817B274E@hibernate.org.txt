SUBJECT: Re: How to Update the Index once it is created
DATE: 23 May 2007

The indexation part of Hibernate Search relies on Java Persistence  
API to triggers the index update transparently. Otherwise you can  
trigger it manually to follow the crawling approach (not transparent).
Event driven vs crawling driven index update have both use cases, I  
would not say that one is really more generic than the other.

Anyway, Krishna, if you use Lucene 2.1, I like the new  
IndexWriter.updateDocument APIs, it's really neat when you have one  
of the term representing your unique id (in your case that would be  
table name + id). I don't fit into those requirements but it would  
have saved me a lot of time if I did :D
