DATE: 4 Oct 2001

I am using the StandardAnalyzer and wish to search on the numbers. But, I am getting the following
error for the query on the number. My query is headline:(-() + ("109" ))(-() + ("109" )).
Can any one suggest something ?

  Try using org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer instead of
  StopAnalyzer.  This will index numbers, etc.  Have a look at
  StandardTokenizer.jj in the sources for details.  If that grammar is not
  quite right, copy it and compile your own tokenizer.
