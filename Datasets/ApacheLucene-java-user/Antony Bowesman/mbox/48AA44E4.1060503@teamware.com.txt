For access control, we use an ownerId field in Lucene which indexes the owning 
user.  We filter all searches using ownerId.  This allows all Documents to be 
kept in a single index.

We also support sharding across multiple index files for performance/scaling 
considerations, via a hash of the ownerId, but in practice have not needed it. 
Much will depend on your search usage.

YMMV
