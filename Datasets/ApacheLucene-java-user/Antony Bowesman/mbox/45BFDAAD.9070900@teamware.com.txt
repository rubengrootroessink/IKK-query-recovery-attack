SUBJECT: Boost/Scoring question
DATE: 30 Jan 2007

Hi,

In trying to understand scoring and boosting a bit better, I tried setting a 
boost of 0.0F for a field.  As it's used as a multiplier, I wanted to see how it 
affects score.

I added a single document with two fields, one with the default boost and 
another with a boost of 0.0F.  hits.score(0) = 0.10848885, but Explanation shows:

0.0 = match required

whereas if I increase the boost to 0.001, then I get a full explanation as normal.

In the words of LIA, can someone do some 'splainin'
Antony
