Thanks for that suggestion.  However, a standard un-escaped parse gives

Input - important:conference agenda
Query - important:conference body:agenda

Escaping the : gives

Input - important\:conference agenda
Query - subject:"important conference" subject:agenda

which has caused it to generate a PhraseQuery for important conference which is 
incorrect.

The following

Input - important\:"conference agenda"
Query - subject:important subject:"conference agenda"

is correct.  Is that a bug in the middle one?
