SUBJECT: Help - FileNotFoundException during IndexWriter.init()
DATE: 31 Mar 2007

I got the following exception this morning when running one last test on a data 
set that has been indexed many times before over the past few months.

java.io.FileNotFoundException: 
D:\72ed1\server\Java\Search\00000008\index\00000001\segments_gq9 (Access is denied)

On Windows with Lucene 2.1.

The test was run with only a single thread handling an incoming queue of 155K 
requests with ~200K documents so there is no concurrency issue.  There is no 
optimisation going on.  I am warming a new searcher every minute (for load) 
using a new reader.

I know that one of the files being indexed has a virus and when I came back to 
the machine the virus scanner had popped up at some point, so my suspicions are 
that it is the cause.  I am running the test again, but can any of the gurus 
give any ideas what can cause this.

It did have to happen the day after my deadline :(

Antony
