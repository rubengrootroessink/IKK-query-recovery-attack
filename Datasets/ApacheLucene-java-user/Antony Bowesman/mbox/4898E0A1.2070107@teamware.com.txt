I created a hybrid approach that supported 1..n databases based on a hash of the 
user's user Id.  This was to allow for the situation where a single database 
would not scale - at the time there was not good information about Lucene's 
performance with large data sets.

In practice, we are now using a single database with data for all users.  There 
is an 'ownerId' field with the unique user Id in every document.

The ownerId is used as a cached filter rather than always added to the query, so 
that only that user's documents influence the score.  If it is part of the 
query, the complete document set for other users will influence the hits for 
this user.
