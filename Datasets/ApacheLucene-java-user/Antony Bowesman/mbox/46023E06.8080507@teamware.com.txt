I've not done any specifc comparisons between using a single Analyzer and 
multiple Analyzer with PFAW, but our indexes are typically 20-25 fields, each of 
which can have a different analyzer depending on language or field type, 
although in practice about 8-10 fields may use the non-default analyzer.

Performance is pretty good in any case and there's not been any noticeable 
degradtion when tweaking analyzers.
