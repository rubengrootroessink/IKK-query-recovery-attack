Hoss, I hope I misunderstood this: are you saying that the same 
IndexSearcher/IndexReader pair can not be used concurrently against a single 
index by different threads executing different queries?

The archives have several mentions of sharing IndexSearcher among threads and 
Otis says http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=492393.

Can you clarify what you meant please.

Antony
