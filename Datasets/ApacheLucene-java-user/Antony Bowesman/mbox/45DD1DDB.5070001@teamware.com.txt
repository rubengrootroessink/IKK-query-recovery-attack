SUBJECT: QueryParser bug?
DATE: 22 Feb 2007

Using QueryParser to parse *tex* seems to create a PrefixQuery rather than 
WildcardQuery due to the trailing *, rather than Wildcard because of the other 
leading *.

As a result, this does not match, for example "context".  I've swapped the order 
of WILDTERM and PREFIXTERM in queryparsr.jj but that just prevents PrefixQuery 
from ever being generated.

Is this a known problem and is there any way around it?
Antony
