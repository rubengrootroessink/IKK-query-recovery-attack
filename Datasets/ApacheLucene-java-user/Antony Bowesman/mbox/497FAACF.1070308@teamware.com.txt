It's all down to the analyzer you use when you index that field and how you 
choose to tokenize it.  If you want to always search case insensitively, then 
you should lower case the filename when indexing.

Depending on how you implemented your query parser, if you have implemented 
wildcard query support, if it's anything like the standard QP, it will not put 
the query string through the analyzer, so a search for

+filename:/*SCm*.doc

would then not find anything, so you'd need to make sure you lower case all the 
filename field searches at some point.

I use a custom analyzer for filenames, which lower cases and tokenizes by letter 
or digit or any custom chars and my query parser supports custom analyzers for 
getFieldQuery().

If you want to keep the original filename, then just store the field as well as 
index it, then you can get the original back from the Document.
