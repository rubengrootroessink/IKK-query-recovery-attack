Thanks Erick, I've been using TopDocs, but am playing with my own HitCollector 
variant of TopDocHitCollector.  The problem is not adjusting the score, it's 
what to adjust it by, i.e. is it possible to re-evaluate the scores of H1 and H2 
knowing that the original query resulted in hits on H1 AND H2.
