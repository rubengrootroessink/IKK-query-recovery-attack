Yes, hence this thread ;)  I'd not like to rely on the textmining parser only to 
discover it's not useable.  I can use POI if I have to, but it does not handle 
Word 6, which is bad, so I'd rather use TM.

Actually, the jar file is the one that's downloaded with the LuceneInAction.zip 
file from the Manning website

http://www.lucenebook.com/LuceneInAction.zip from http://www.manning.com/hatcher2/

and there's no licence file.  The book does not refer to the licence although it 
refers to the parser as 'freely available'.  The book just refers to the website 
- now unavailable.

I've tried sending Ryan Ackley mail direct.  Hopefully he will clarify its status.

Antony
