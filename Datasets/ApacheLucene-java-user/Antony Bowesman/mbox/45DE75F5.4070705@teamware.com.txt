SUBJECT: TextMining.org Word extractor
DATE: 23 Feb 2007

I'm extracting text from Word using TextMining.org extractors - it works better 
than POI because it extracts Word 6/95 as well as 97-2002, which POI cannot do. 
  However, I'm trying to find out about licence issues with the TM jar. The TM 
website seems to be permanently hacked these days.

Anyone know?

Also, has anyone come up with a good solution for extracting data from 
fast-saved files, something that neither TM nor POI can do.

Antony
