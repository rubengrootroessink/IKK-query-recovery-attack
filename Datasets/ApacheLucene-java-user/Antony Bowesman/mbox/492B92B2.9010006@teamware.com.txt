SUBJECT: Which is faster/better
DATE: 25 Nov 2008

In 2.4, as well as IndexWriter.deleteDocuments(Term) there is also 
IndexReader.deleteDocuments(Term).

I understand opening a reader is expensive, so does this means using 
IndexWriter.deleteDocuments would be faster from a closed index position?

As the IndexReader instance is newer, it has better Javadocs, so it's unclear 
which is the 'right' one to use.

Any pointers?
Antony
