SUBJECT: TopFieldDocCollector and v3.0.0
DATE: 8 Dec 2009

I'm on 2.3.2 and looking to move to 2.9.1 or 3.0.0

In 2.9.1 TopFieldDocCollector is

"Deprecated. Please use TopFieldCollector instead."

in 3.0.0 TopFieldCollector says

NOTE: This API is experimental and might change in incompatible ways in the next 
release

What is the suggested path for migrating TopFieldDocCollector usage?

Antony
