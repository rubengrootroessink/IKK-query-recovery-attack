I had a performance problem when I first started with PDFbox, which I raised on 
the PDFbox forum

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3947448

but then I debugged it to the logging issue (logging appears on, but no 
appenders).  I've not tried the non log4j version so don't know if that is free 
of the problem.  After I disabled the logging correctly, performance was 
comparable to the other Java offerings I tried.
