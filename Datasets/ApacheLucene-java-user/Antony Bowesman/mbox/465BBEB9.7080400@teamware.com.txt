I read the new IndexWriter Javadoc and I'm unclear about this autocommit.  In 
2.1, I thought an IndexReader opened in an IndexSearcher does not "see" 
additions to an index made by an IndexWriter, i.e. maxDoc and numDocs remain 
constant, so the statement

"When autoCommit is true then every flush is also a commit (IndexReader 
instances will see each flush as changes to the index). This is the default, to 
match the behavior before 2.2"

makes me wonder if my assumptions are wrong.  Can you clarify what it means by 
the IndexReader "seeing" changes to the index?

Thanks
Antony
