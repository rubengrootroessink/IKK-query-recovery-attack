Just a thought...

If Hilton wants to be aware of new Documents in the index since the previous 
search, this requires opening a new IndexReader.

If only Documents have been added to the index I expect, but am not sure, that 
the bits from the old IndexReader are still valid for the document numbers in 
the new Reader.  However, if there have been deletions or optimisation has 
occurred between reader instances, then the document ids from the old reader may 
not represent the same documents in the new reader, so the Filter for the old 
reader will not be valid for the new search against the new reader and you may 
get false matches.

I don't think there will be a problem if there are no deletions.
