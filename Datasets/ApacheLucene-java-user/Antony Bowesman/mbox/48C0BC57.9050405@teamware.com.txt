SUBJECT: Javadoc wording in IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize()
DATE: 5 Sep 2008

The Javadoc for this method has the following comment:

"This requires this index not be among those to be added, and the upper bound* 
of those segment doc counts not exceed maxMergeDocs. "

What does the second part of that mean, which is especially confusing given that 
MAX_MERGE_DOCS is deprecated.

Thanks
Antony
