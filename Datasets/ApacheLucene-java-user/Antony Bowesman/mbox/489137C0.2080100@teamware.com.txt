Michael Busch's Apache Con (2006/7??) presentation summarized with the bullet

"Per-document Payloads â€“ updateable"

Is making a document 'updatable' (in _some_ way) something still seen as a long 
term goal for Lucene?

As far as implementation is concerned, if a stored (not indexed) field may be 
updatable with 1231, is there some difficulty with making payloads, which from 
my understanding are attributed to a posting of an indexed field, updatable.  I 
guess they ultimately equate to the same thing - i.e. using a stored field to 
hold the document's "payload", but it would be an extra field to load.
