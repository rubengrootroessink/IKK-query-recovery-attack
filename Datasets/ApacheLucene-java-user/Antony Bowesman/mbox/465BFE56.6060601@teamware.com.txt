Thanks Doron, I understood "IndexReader instance" as one that was already open, 
as it's not possible to 'open' an existing object instance, the static open() 
methods create new instances.

Your explanation clarifies things.  So, the scenario where the IndexReader sees 
changes with autocommit=true is

BEGIN
IndexWriter - open
- add documents
   - some merges/flushes occur here
   IndexReader - open
   - sees index with results of earlier merges
IndexWriter - close
END

whereas with autocommit=false, the IndexReader would see the state of the index 
at BEGIN and any merges/flushes would not show.

Perhaps the text could then be something like

"(Changes to the index caused by flush operations will be visible to an 
IndexReader when it is opened prior to closing the IndexWriter)"

It would also be worth updating the isCurrent() Javadoc to clarify its 
behaviour.  Presumably, with autocommit=false, isCurrent() will always return 
true is only using the IndexWriter to add/delete documents.
