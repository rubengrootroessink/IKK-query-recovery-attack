Re: PFDBox.

I have a 2.5Mb test file that extracts in ~4 seconds.  CPU is AMD athlon 3500+ 
at 2200MHz.  While converting it creates 4.7MB file in temp directory 
(pdfboxnnnnn.tmp).

Another 3.7MB test file takes over 20 seconds to extract and it creates 15MB 
temp file.

It seems dependent on the data, but Cygwin's PDFtotext also has similar 
performance profile over the two documents.  I would revert to the PDFBox forum 
to continue the discussion.
