SUBJECT: TermEnum with deleted dccuments
DATE: 7 May 2009

I am merging Index A to Index B.  First I read the terms for a particular field 
from index A and some of the documents in A get deleted.

I then enumerate the terms on a different field also in index A, but the terms 
from the deleted document are still present.

The termEnum.docFreq() also returns > 0 for those terms even though the docs are 
deleted.

Should this be the case?  I have tried closing the reader between enumerations, 
but no difference.

Antony
