I removed the : handling stuff from QueryParser.jj in the method:

Query Clause(String field) :

I removed this section
---
   [
     LOOKAHEAD(2)
     (
     fieldToken=<TERM> <COLON> {field=discardEscapeChar(fieldToken.image);}
     | <STAR> <COLON> {field="*";}
     )
   ]
---

and you can also remove the COLON and : related bits to do with start terms and 
escaped chars if you want to exclude treating : as a separator, but from memory, 
it's the above section that does the field recognition.
