Correct.  That's one of the current search mechanisms.  It's not a major issue 
and I think I'll probably end up ducking it on the basis that the system 
directory defaults to a surname/firstname name order, but of course there's no 
guarantee that mail from other systems will have those names in that order, e.g.

#1 To: Bowesman Antony
#2 To: Antony Bowesman

makes this 'starts with' feature less useful.

Thanks again Hoss and Erick for the suggestions!  This list is excellent and I 
do wonder if you guys actually have day jobs that you are able to do as well as 
give the amount of time you seem to on this list!

Antony
