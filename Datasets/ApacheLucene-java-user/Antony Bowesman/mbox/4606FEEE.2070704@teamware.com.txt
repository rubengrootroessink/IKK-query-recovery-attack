I've been using Ryan's textmining in prefence to the POI as internally TM uses 
POI and the Word6 extractor so handles a greater variety of files.

Ryan, thanks for fixing your site.  Do you have any plans/ideas on how to parse 
the 'fast-saved' files and any ideas on Word files older than the Word 6 format?

Regards
Antony
