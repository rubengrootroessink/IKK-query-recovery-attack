SUBJECT: NOT queries

Hi,

I'm writing a mapping mechanism between an existing search interface and Lucene 
and wondered how to support a single NOT/- query.

Given the query "-attribute", then from an ealier comment by Chris Hostetter 
where he says "you can't have a negative clause in isolation by itself", I 
assume that you first have to create a BooleanClause that finds everything and 
then another Clause that removes the "attribute".

Is this right or is there another way to do it?

Thanks
Antony
