Doesn't that still have the same issue in terms of equality of conditions that 
created the filter.  If I have conditions that filter Term X, then the cached 
Filter is only valid for new requests for Term X.  Term equality is defined by 
the Javadocs as having the same Field and Text, but to cache a Query, its 
equality must be deterministic in a similar way, but it isn't.

I was hoping that Query.equals() would be defined so that equality would be 
based on the results that Query generates for a given reader.

I'm hosting an indexing framework, so I've no idea what searches or filters a 
caller will want to perform.
