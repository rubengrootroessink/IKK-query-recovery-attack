Isn't the code snippet below doing a search before attempting the deletion, so 
from the IndexReader's point of view (as used by the IndexSearcher) the item 
exists.  What is mIndexReaderClone?  Is that the same reader that is used in 
IndexSearcher?

I'm not sure, but if you search with one IndexReader and delete the document 
using another IndexReader and then repeat the process, I think that the search 
would still result in a hit, but the deletion would return 0.
