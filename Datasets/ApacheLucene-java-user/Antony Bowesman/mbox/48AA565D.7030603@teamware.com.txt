You make your own fields in Lucene, it is not something Lucene gives you.

It seems like you may be confusing what Lucene will give you.  The original file 
content and the Lucene indexes are two different things.  It sounds like you 
want to protect access to the original content on some shared storage, but that 
is not related to the searching provided by your Lucene app, or maybe I 
misunderstood your use case.
