SUBJECT: idf in scores
DATE: 7 Nov 2006

I've been trying to understand how idf is arrived at from a query.  I have a 
single Document with 9 fields.  One field "subject" has the phrase "RFC2822 - 
Internet Message Format" and a second "body" has the contents of rfc2822.

The other fields contain additional meta data.  If I search for subject:message 
I get the following explanation.

0.15342641 = fieldWeight(subject:message in 0), product of:
   1.0 = tf(termFreq(subject:message)=1)
   0.30685282 = idf(docFreq=1)
   0.5 = fieldNorm(field=subject, doc=0)

why does the idf get that value?
Antony
