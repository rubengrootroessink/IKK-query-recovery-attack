SUBJECT: How to not overwrite a Document if it 'already exists'?
DATE: 5 May 2009

I'm adding Documents in batches to an index with IndexWriter.  In certain 
circumstances, I do not want to add the Document if it already exists, where 
existence is determined by field id=myId.

Is there any way to do this with IndexWriter or do I have to open a reader and 
look for the term id:XXX?  Given that opening a reader is expensive, is there 
any way to do this efficiently?

I guess what I want is

IndexWriter.addDocumentIfMissing(Term term, Document doc, Analyzer analyzer)

Thanks
Antony
