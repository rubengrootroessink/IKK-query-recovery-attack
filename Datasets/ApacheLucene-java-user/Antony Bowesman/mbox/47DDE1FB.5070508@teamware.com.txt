One example:

1.5 million documents
Approx 15 fields per document
DB is 10-15GB (can't find correct figure)
All on one machine.  No stats on search usage though.

We're about to embark on a 25-40M documents (email data) per annum, no deletes 
over 10 years.  Planning for index distribution, but haven't decided on the 
partitioning yet.
