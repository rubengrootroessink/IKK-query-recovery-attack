SUBJECT: Modifying a document by updating a payloads?
DATE: 30 Jul 2008

I seem to recall some discussion about updating a payload, but I can't find it.

I was wondering if it were possible to use a payload to implement 'modify' of a 
Lucene document.  For example, I have an ID field, which has a unique ID 
refering to an external DB.  For example, I would like to store a short bitmap 
giving state information about aspects of the Document and this state could 
change during the life of the Document and be available to my searchers.

I've not yet played with payloads and I understand there is something in the 
pipeline about updating Documents, but is it possible to update a payload for an 
existing Document?
