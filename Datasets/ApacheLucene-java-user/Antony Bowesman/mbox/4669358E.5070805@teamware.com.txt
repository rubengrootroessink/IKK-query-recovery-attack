If you have an application Id per document, then you could cache that field for 
each reader and when you open the new reader, create a new cache of the IDs for 
that reader and then re-evaluate the bitmap according to the changed Ids.

You may be able to optimise the case for two readers by calculating the mapping 
once and then use that for each bitmap that needs reevaluating.
