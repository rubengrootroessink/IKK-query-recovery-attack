I'm doing a similar thing.  I have external Ids (equivalent to yout record_id), 
which have one or more Lucene Documents associated with them.  I wrote a custom 
HitCollector that uses a Map to hold the so far collected external ids along 
with the collected document.

I had to write my own priority queue to know when an object was dropped of the 
bottom of the score sorted queue, but the latest PriorityQueue on the trunk now 
has insertWithOverflow(), which does the same thing.

Note that ResultDoc extends ScoreDoc, so that the external Id of the item 
dropped off the queue can be used to remove it from my Map.

Code snippet is somewhat as below (I am caching my external Ids, hence the cache 
usage)

    protected Map<OfficeId, ScoreDoc> results;

    public void collect(int doc, float score)
     {
         if (score > 0.0f)
         {
             totalHits++;
             if (pq.size() < numHits || score > minScore)
             {
                 OfficeId id = cache.get(doc);
                 ResultDoc rd = results.get(id);
                 //  No current result for this ID yet found
                 if (rd == null)
                 {
                     rd = new ResultDoc(id, doc, score);
                     ResultDoc added = pq.insert(rd);
                     if (added == null)
                     {
                         //  Nothing dropped of the bottom
                         results.put(id, rd);
                     }
                     else
                     {
                         //  Return value dropped of the bottom
                         results.remove(added.id);
                         results.put(id, rd);
                         remaining++;
                     }
                 }
                 //  Already found this ID, so replace high score if necessary
                 else
                 {
                     if (score > rd.score)
                     {
                         pq.remove(rd);
                         rd.score = score;
                         pq.insert(rd);
                     }
                 }
                 //  Readjust our minimum score again from the top entry
                 minScore = pq.peek().score;
             }
             else
                 remaining++;
         }
     }
