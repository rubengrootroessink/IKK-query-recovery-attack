Another way is to use a HitCollector to collect all the hits into a Map and then 
use TermEnum + TermDocs to walk the tags / docs and see what tag the hit comes 
from.  This would be different to walking the Hits/Documents to fetch the tag 
from the Document.  Not sure if this is very efficient though, depends on the 
Document count.
