Hits will normalise scores >0<=1, but I'm using HitCollector and haven't worked 
out how to normalise those scores.

 From what I can see, the scores are just multiplied by a factor to bring the 
top score down to 1.  Is this right or is there something more to it.

Do I need to normalise scores anyway - what's the reason it's done?
Antony
