Thanks for the comments.  Where I was trying to get to was whether a match on a 
field with boost of 0.0 can ever cause the normalised score to result in 0 if 
there is also a match on a field with a non zero boost.  I'm not sure I 
understand the scoring formula :(

I've played a bit more and found:

If I search for a document where the field boost is 0.0 then the document is not 
found I just search that field.  Is this expected???

I have a configurable framework, where the field schema can have the boost set 
and I am trying to understand whether to allow >=0.0 of just >0.0 and how Lucene 
behaves with 0.0.

I know a Filter would be better to remove a field's influence on score
during search, but I'd like to understand...

OK, I hope to get to 2.1, which I'm eagerly awaiting, so will revisit 
explanations then.
