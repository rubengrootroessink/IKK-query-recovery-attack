SUBJECT: Index time boost question
DATE: 14 Apr 2011

I have a test case written for 2.3.2 that tested an index time boost on a field 
of 0.0F and then did a search using Hits and got 0 results.

I'm now in the process of upgrading to 2.9.4 and am removing all use of Hits in 
my test cases and using a Collector instead.  Now the test case fails as it gets 
one result with a score of 0.0.

Is it correct that the Collector will collect hits with 0 score.  If so, I need 
to change my test case.

Thanks
