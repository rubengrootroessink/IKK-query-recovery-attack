SUBJECT: Commercial vendors monitoring this ML? was: Lucene Performance Issues
DATE: 28 Mar 2006

Weird, I was just about to comment on the fact that since posting that
my organization has decided to use Lucene, I got calls from two
commercial vendors that didn't give me the time of the day while I was
doing my comparison analysis.

Both of them referred to some random "colleague" in the business
referring them to me.

Hi Thomas,

Sound like FUD to me.  No concrete numbers, and the benchmark they
mention.... eh, haven't we all seen "funny" benchmarks before?  Lucene
is used in many large operations (e.g. Technorati, Simpy) that involve a
LOT of indexing and searching, large indices, etc.  I suggest you try
both and see which one suits your needs.

Subject: Lucene Performance Issues


Hi, we are currently intending to implement a document storage / search
tool
using Jackrabbit and Lucene. We have been approached by a commercial
search
and indexing organisation called ISYS who are suggesting the following
problems with using Lucene. We do have a requirement to store and search
large documents and the total document store will be large too. Any
comments
on the following would be greatly appreciated.

1) By default, Lucene only indexes the first 10,000 words from each
document. When increasing this default out-of-memory errors can occur.
This
implies that documents, or large sections thereof, are loaded into
memory.
ISYS has a very small memory footprint which is not affected by document
size nor number of documents.

 
2) Lucene appears to be slow at indexing, at least by ISYS' standards.
Published performance benchmarks seem to vary between almost acceptable,
down to very poor. ISYS' file readers are already optimized for the
fastest
text extraction possible.

 
3) The Lucene documentation suggests it can be slow at searching and can
get
slower and slower the larger your indexes get. The tipping point is
where
the index size exceeds the amount of free memory in your machine. This
also
implies that whole indexes, or large portions of them, are loaded into
memory. The bigger the index, the more powerful the machine required.
ISYS'
search speed is always proportional to the size of the result set. Index
size does not materially affect search speed and the index is never
loaded
into memory. It also appears that Lucene requires hands-on tuning to
keep
its search speed acceptable. ISYS' indexes are self-managing and do not
require any maintenance to keep them searchable at full speed.


Thanks, Thomas
