SUBJECT: QueryParser, phrases and stopwords
DATE: 15 Jun 2005

I have a situation where a query such as "climate control" is returning
documents with the phrase "climate of control".  (I'm using QueryParser).

After searching, I found  the similar issue on the mailing list from
Greg Robertson
with a patch from Steve Rowe.

Looking at the source repository for StopFilter.java, the patch was applied
in November of 2003 and then reverted in Dec 2003 (by Erik), with the note:

revert position increment change due to conflict with PhraseQuery

(the patch  incremented the token position to inhibit exact matching across
removed stopword(s)).

I couldn't find any info on how/why this approach conflicted with
PhraseQuery.
Can anyone elighten me on this? Does anyone know of a way to inhibit
exact matching across removed stopwords(s)?

Pointers to nutch are appreciated, pointers into nutch where this
situation is
handled are appreciated even more :-)

Thanks, MikeB.
