checked with Luke (one doc in one index with the contents "hello,this,is,a,keyword,hello!,nicetomeetyou".
This should tokenize into "hello this is a keyword hello nicetomeetyou", but actually it does
"hello keyword hello nicetomeetyou". Does anyone know why it drops those extra terms?

StandardAnaylzer has a constructor which allows you to send your own
array of stop words. So an array with zero elements should do the
trick:


String[] stopWords        = new String[0];
StandardAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(stopWords);
