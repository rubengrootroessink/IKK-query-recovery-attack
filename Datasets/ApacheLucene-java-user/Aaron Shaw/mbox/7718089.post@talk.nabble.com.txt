Hi,

I've got the snowball analyzer working and it returns my records, however
stemming doesn't seem to really do much. It returns plurals (so if i enter
"monkey" as my search term and the word "monkeys" is in the document, it
will be returned) but nothing more than that. Is that the extent of the
stemming it does or is there more, and if so how do I get that working?

Thanks,

Aaron
