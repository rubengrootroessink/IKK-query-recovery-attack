SUBJECT: How build Lucene in Action examples
DATE: 27 Feb 2009


Hi !!!
I'm new in Lucene.I started reading Lucene in action (first edition) , i
downloaded the code from 
http://www.manning.com/hatcher2/ .
I read somewhere that that code with written in an old of lucene and i
should download the code from the new version from here:
http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/
And so i did...
I still have some problem.For example in the file Searcher.java i get this
error:
Directory fsDir = new FSDirectory(indexDir, null); <-- cannot find sybol
construct FSDirectory(... )

I also tried FSDirectory.getDirecory(indexDir, null);

I have tried many versions of Lucene.Any help????Please!!!!!
Thanks
