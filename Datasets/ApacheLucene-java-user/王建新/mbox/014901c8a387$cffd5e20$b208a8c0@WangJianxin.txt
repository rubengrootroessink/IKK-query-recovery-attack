DATE: 21 Apr 2008

I want to use lucene with some additional info,like:

1.index
    Document additionalDoc=ew Document()

    additionalDoc.add(new Field("field","AA BB","Addtional info ..............."));
    additionalDoc.add(new Field("field","BB CC","Addtional info 222222222222222222222222..............."));

    writer.addDocument(additionalDoc)

    ........


2. search

    Searcher searcher;
    ....

    searcher.search(termQuery("field","BB"));




    in this condition, I want lucene returns the additionalDoc , also know which fileds were
matched, then I will get the additional info from the matched fields.

Can lucene make it in version 2.3.1?
if cannot, Can you give me some advice?
