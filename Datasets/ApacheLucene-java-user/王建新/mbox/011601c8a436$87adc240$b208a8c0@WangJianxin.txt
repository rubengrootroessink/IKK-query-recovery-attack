        hi Chris, it is me ""

        I have a new problem, Could you give me any advice? Thank you.


        I want to use lucene with some additional info,like:

        1.index
            Document additionalDoc=ew Document()

            additionalDoc.add(new Field("field","AA BB","Addtional info ..............."));
            additionalDoc.add(new Field("field","BB CC","Addtional info 222222222222222222222222..............."));

            writer.addDocument(additionalDoc)

            ........


        2. search

            Searcher searcher;
            ....

            searcher.search(termQuery("field","BB"));




            in this condition, I want lucene returns the additionalDoc , also know which fileds
were matched, then I will get the additional info from the matched fields.

        Can lucene make it in version 2.3.1?
