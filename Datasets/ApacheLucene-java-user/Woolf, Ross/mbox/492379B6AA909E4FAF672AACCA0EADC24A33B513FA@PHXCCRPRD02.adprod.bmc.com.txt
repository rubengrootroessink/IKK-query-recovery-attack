SUBJECT: Exception invoking MultiPhraseQuery
DATE: 12 Jan 2010

I can't invoke MultiPhraseQuery.  It produces the error:
com.sun.jdi.InvocationException occurred invoking method

Here is the code:
MultiPhraseQuery mpq = new MultiPhraseQuery();

In the eclipse debugger when I try to inspect mpq after instantiating it shows the error.

I'm on Lucene 2.9.1 with Java 1.5 on Windows XP.  Is MultiPhraseQuery bad in 2.9.1?  Does
anyone know how I can find out why it is having the invocation exception?

Thanks
