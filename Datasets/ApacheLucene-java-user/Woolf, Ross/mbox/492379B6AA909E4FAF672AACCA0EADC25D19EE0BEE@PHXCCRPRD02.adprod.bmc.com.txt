SUBJECT: SmartChineseAnalyzer for Traditional Chinese?
DATE: 24 Mar 2011

As I look at the api for SmartChineseAnalyzer it indicates it is for Simplified Chinese.  Has
anyone attempted modifying it for Traditional Chinese?  Or does anyone know of any other "smart"
analyzer that is geared towards traditional Chinese?

Thanks,
Ross
