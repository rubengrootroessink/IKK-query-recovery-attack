Thanks, I'll try that.  As for the stack trace
"com.sun.jdi.InvocationException occurred invoking method"

is the total of the error I get.  And I only see this when I select "mpq" in the Variables
window and that is displayed instead of showing the mpq object.  I've tried catching the exception
but it is not catchable.  I only get the invocation exception displayed and can't inspect
mpq.

I'd try running it outside of Eclipse, and/or checking each and every
of the many configuration options in Eclipse to see if you have an old
jar that Eclipse is using, from jars you've made accessible via the
"java build path" window to projects referenced to......

Alternately, you can look for all the Lucene jars on your machine and
delete (or move) any old ones.

And if none of this helps, can you post the entire stack trace?
