SUBJECT: Problems with IndexWriter.commit()
DATE: 29 Jul 2009

I'm experiencing a problem/unexpected behavior with IndexWriter.commit().  I have an open IndexWriter
and I am writing a lot of documents to the index (addDocument).  I call a commit() and the
data is committed as expected, but now as I continue to write documents to the index I have
lost all caching from the writer (I have kept the same writer open).  Every single addDocument
thereafter is treated as if it were followed with a commit right after it and the indexing
speed comes to a crawl.  

I'm assuming this is not expected behavior since the concept of commit is to allow doing commits
while keeping the indexWriter open.  Is anyone aware of this problem?  Does anyone know how
I can rectify it and allow addDocument's thereafter to processed using the indexWriter caching?
 I am on Lucene 2.4.1.

Thanks,
Ross
