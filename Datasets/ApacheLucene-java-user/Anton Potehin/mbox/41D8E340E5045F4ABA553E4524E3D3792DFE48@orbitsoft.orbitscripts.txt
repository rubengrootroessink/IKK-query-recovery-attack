Is it possible to make search among results of previous search?

 

 

For example: I made search: 

 

Searcher searcher =...

 

Query query = ...

 

Hits hits = ....

 

hits = Searcher.search(query);

 

 

 

After it I want to not make a new search, I want to make search among found results...
