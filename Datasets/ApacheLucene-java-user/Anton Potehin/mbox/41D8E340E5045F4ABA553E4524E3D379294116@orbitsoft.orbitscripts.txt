SUBJECT: Duplicates recods in index
DATE: 8 Feb 2006

Is it possible to add records into lucene index using following
algorithm:

 

1) create Document object 

2) add 5 fields into Document (id, name, field1, field2, field3). All
fields are stored, indexed and tokenized 

3) check if the document with current id and name was added before 

4) if yes then set field3 value to 1, else 2 

5) add Document into indexWriter 

 

The 3rd point is difficult for me.

I do it to mark duplicated records with flag
