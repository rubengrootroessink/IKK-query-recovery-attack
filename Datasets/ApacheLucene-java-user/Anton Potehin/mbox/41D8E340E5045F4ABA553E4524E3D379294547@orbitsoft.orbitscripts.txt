SUBJECT: Problem with TermDocs
DATE: 20 Feb 2006

Ir is IndexReader.

termIdent is Term

 

int freq = ir.docFreq(termIdent);

if (freq > 1) {

            TermDocs termDocs = ir.termDocs(termIdent);

            int[] docsArr = new int[freq];

int[] freqArr = new int[freq];

int number = termDocs.read(docsArr,freqArr);

System.out.println(number);

}

 

 

Why number always is not equal freq (in the most of the cases number is
equal 1)?
