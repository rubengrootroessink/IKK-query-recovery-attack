SUBJECT: Re: Using Lucene for user query parsing
DATE: 6 Mar 2009

You could have single index file with all the names tagged at the time of
indexing. For the query parsing, you could have a lookup
 for common words ending which identify the business names (like Corp, Inc,
LLC, Ltd, etc.) and common words like (road, avenue,
street, lane etc) for address and separate the query terms at appropriate
places.

Another suggestion is to go with OpenNLP components and use POS tagger, NP
Chunker etc. which will better results during query parsing.
