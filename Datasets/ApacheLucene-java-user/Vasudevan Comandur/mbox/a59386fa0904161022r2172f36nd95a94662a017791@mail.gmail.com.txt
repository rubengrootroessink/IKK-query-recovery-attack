SUBJECT: Google's search Appliance relevance ranking
DATE: 16 Apr 2009

Hi,

   The question that I am posting in this group may be inappropriate and I
want to apologize for that.

   My question is, what is the relevance ranking algorithm which is used in
Google Search Appliance (GSA) because the search
   is predominantly on documents rather than web pages.

   I appreciate if any of you can send me pointers to the algorithm used by
google.

Regards
 Vasu
