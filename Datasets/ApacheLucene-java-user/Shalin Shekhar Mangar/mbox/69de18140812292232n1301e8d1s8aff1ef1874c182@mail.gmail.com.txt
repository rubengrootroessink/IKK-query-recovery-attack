SUBJECT: IndexCommit#getFileNames() returning duplicates?
DATE: 30 Dec 2008

Hello,

Solr uses IndexCommit#getFileNames() to get a list of files for replication.
One windows user reported an exception which looks like it may have been
caused by IndexCommit#getFileNames() returning duplicate file names. The
exception in his case was caused by "_21e.tvx" coming more than once.

The problem was reported to be fixed after we used new
HashSet<String>(commit.getFileNames()).

I haven't been able to reproduce the bug but I was hoping people here would
know more about this. Solr is using the 2.9-dev version. Unfortunately, I
don't know which revision that user was using. However if it is of any help,
it should be one of r707499, r719351, r723985 or r724059.
