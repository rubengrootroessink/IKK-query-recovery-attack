Yes it is :-)

I think this could be a generally useful feature?

Thinking more on this, we may not need to modify the index format at all for
this use-case. This is easily achieved in the current system by adding a
dummy document which Solr can read/write -- not very elegant but it can work
:-)

Using the version came to my mind because I didn't see it as very useful by
itself. It is just the current time stamp as a long, incremented for every
commit.
