SUBJECT: Merging with writer open on source index?
DATE: 15 Jun 2011

Hello,

IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory...) method says that the index in each
directory must not be changed (opened by a writer) while this method is
running. However, IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader...) does not say any
such thing. Would I be correct in assuming that since an IndexReader has a
static snapshot of the index, merging using addIndexes(IndexReader...) is
safe even if the source index has a writer open?
