Hi All,

I've been thinking about this problem for some time now. I'm trying  
to figure out a way to store date windows in lucene so that I can  
easily filter as follows.

A particular document can have several date windows.
Give a specific date, only return those documents where that date  
falls within at least one of those windows.

 From what I can see, the only way I can think of doing it is to  
create a special field format and create a custom filter. The filter  
isn't that useful for caching though, because every query will have   
new date (essentially NOW())

Also, note that there are multiple windows here for a single  
document, we can't just search between min start and max end.

Ideas from those more familiar with lucene would be greatly appreciated.

James
