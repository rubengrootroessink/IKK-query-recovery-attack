This would be fine with me but unfortunately not for my users.
More precisely, I need to analyze a query string from one search
engine, filter out a black list of facette queries and pass the
result on to a second search engine. This means that I have no
control over the way people enter their queries.

Is there any known query parser which handles this correctly?

Also, how does solr do this? It uses a parser derived from the
Lucene QueryParser, and I found it produces the same output,
however the search queries are still handled correctly, i.e. the
results I get indicate that deep down inside it seems to get it
right in the end.

Cheers,

Martin
