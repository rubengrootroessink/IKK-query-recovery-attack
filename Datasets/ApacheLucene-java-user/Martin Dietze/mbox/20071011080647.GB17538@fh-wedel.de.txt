I see, so my old code which was based on QueryParser was not
completely flawed :) Are there any other queries besides span
queries which can occur with qsol and do not produce valid
QueryParser syntax? 

Also I wonder why a facette query, like `foo:bar' results in a
SpanQuery `+spanNear([foo, bar], 0, true)' (I may not understand
the concept here).

Cheers,

Martin
