 yes that's just about it. We have two search engines for
different purposes. The first one indexes more fields than the
second and we want to prevent "good" search queries from failing
on the second. Supporting all theses fields on the second SE is
not a good idea since indexing all this additonal data would
have an impact on performance and index size.

This is a very interesting idea. Yet I wonder how to deal with
such terms if they are part of an AND query (actually AND is our
default operator, so that a query "body:boy secret_field\:xyzyq"
would always fail. It seems obvious that in any case you end up
parsing the query in some way...

Cheers,

Martin
