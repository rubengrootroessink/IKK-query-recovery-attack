This would be nice, but unfortunately I do not have direct access
to the solr server in my application. I need to parse queries,
filter out blacklisted facettes and then parse them on to solr
using solrj.

Maybe I am missing out on something obvious, and there's an
entirely simple way to accomplish this?

Cheers,

Martin
