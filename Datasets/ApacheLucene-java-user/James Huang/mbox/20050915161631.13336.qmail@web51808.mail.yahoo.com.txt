SUBJECT: Question: dynamic sorting
DATE: 15 Sep 2005

Suppose I have a book index with field="publisher", field="title", etc.
If a user has bought Manning books, then I like to sort the result with Manning books listed
first.
 
In essence, I'm asking for a parameterized custom sorting. Is there a way to do this?
 
Thanks,
-James
