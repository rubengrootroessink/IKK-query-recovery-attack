I think this is probably the closest thing I like to/am able to do now. If I ever get to do
this, I'll share the idea/code and seek review and suggestions.
 
Thank you very much, Mark, and all others that have helped!

I think the HitCollector approach was fine but needed
a couple of changes:
1) use a PriorityQueue subclass in place of the
SortedSet to keep only the top n scoring docs
2) multiply lucene score by a distance measurement
based on the current doc's location (doc location
being read from a cached array of type
Location[reader.maxDoc] )


Cheers
