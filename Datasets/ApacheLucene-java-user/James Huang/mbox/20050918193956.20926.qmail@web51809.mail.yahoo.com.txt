Yes, the distance is calculated at runtime, based on
longitude/latitude. Field score boosting doesn't seem
to apply. In fact, there are other dynamic factors in
addition to distance to determine the order of search
result.

So the question is, is there a way to overriding score
calculation at runtime? In the lucene/search package,
I see interfaces like Scorer, Weight and methods like
Query.createWeight(). This looks promising.
