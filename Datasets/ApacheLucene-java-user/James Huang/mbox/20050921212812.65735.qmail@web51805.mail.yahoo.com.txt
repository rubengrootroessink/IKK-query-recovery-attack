That's exactly why I don't feel mine is the best
solution. Many people have been asking about the right
pattern for Lucene in webapps, and I'm paying close
attention to those.

To open an IndexSearcher is easy; the hard part for me
is when to close it (to be ready for a potentially new
index.) Perhaps a special HTTP command to trigger
that? I don't know.
