I use a custom collector:

class ResultCollector extends HitCollector
{
  SortedSet set = new TreeSet();
  IndexSearcher searcher;
  Location me;

  ResultCollector(IndexSearcher searcher, Location me)
  {
    this.me = me;
    this.searcher = searcher;
  }

  public void collect(int id, float score) {
    try {
      Document doc = helper.searcher.doc(id);
      String zc = doc.get("zipcode");
      SearchResult sr = new SearchResult(
         score, zc, getDistance(me, zc));
      // The score in SearchResult is adjusted:
      // score *= 1.0 - distance/200.0;
      set.add(sr);
    } catch(Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }

  int getResult(int startindex, SearchResult[] result)
  {
    Iterator iter = set.iterator();
    int idx = 0;
    for (int i=0; iter.hasNext() && idx <
result.length; ++i) {
      Object o = iter.next();
      if (i >= startindex)
        result[idx++] = (SearchResult)o;
    }
    return set.size();
  }
}

The SearchResult extends Comparable.
Then, use IndexSearcher.search(qry, collector);

This seems to work. What I wish for is that sorting is
done by the search engine itself, hoping for a better
performance (and cleaner code).

Previously, I have created a DistanceComparatorSource
(similar to that in LIA-ch6); sorting by distance
works but relevance is lost.
