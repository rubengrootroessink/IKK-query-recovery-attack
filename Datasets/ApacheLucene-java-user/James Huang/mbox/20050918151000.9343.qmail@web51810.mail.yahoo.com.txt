Then this is not what I want -- if I put FIELD_SCORE
first, it'll rarely work because FIELD_SCORE's seldom
are the same, practically leaving distance sorting out
of the picture.

What I want is a "compound" score, i.e., to adjust the
score based on the distance, like this:

  score *= 1.0 - distance/200.0;

This formula seems to work well for my situation. Is
there a way to modify the score during search?

Thanks,
