SUBJECT: Search different terms for different fields (Complex Query)
DATE: 11 Dec 2001


Please help

In my LuceneDocument, I have three fields (title, library, content) and I 
would like to search for 'myText' in the content field AND it should also 
match 'myLibrary' in Library field.

"content:myText: AND "library:myLibrary"

It should only return hit if 'myText' is in the content and 'myLibrary' is 
in the library field.

I read the Lucene FAG and it mention about complex query but does NOT give 
any example.  Can someone please help me with some sample code.

Thanks

Here is what the FAG say:
"A more complex queries may contain nested queries with 'and', 'or', 'not' 
or 'phrase' relations. Queries may also contains specification of which 
document fields to match against the various parts of the query (.e.g. 
'authors' and 'title') and hints that may effects the ranking of the matched 
documents ('boost' factor)."
