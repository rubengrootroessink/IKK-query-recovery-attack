SUBJECT: Querying the values of a field
DATE: 26 Jul 2005

Hi,

I have an index with about 20 different fields.
I'd like to query my index to get the list of all different terms for
a given field.
Is it something possible in a simple way? I mean simpler than getting
every terms of the index and then keeping only those which match the
given field.

Thanks in advance,
Jean-Marie Tinghir
