SUBJECT: Problem on query syntax
DATE: 19 May 2005

Hi Lucene community,
I'm facing a strange problem, that you'll probably understand as I'm
only a newbie to Lucene.

When I search "hotliner:such" I get a 0 result. ("such" gets the same)
But when I search "hotliner:such*", I get the 277 expected results!

Why is the first query not working?

Thanks,
Jean-Marie Tinghir
