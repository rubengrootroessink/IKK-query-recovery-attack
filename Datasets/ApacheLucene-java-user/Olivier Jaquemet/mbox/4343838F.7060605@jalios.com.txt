add a shutdown hook to the Java runtime.  A shutdown hook will run if the runtime process
receives a signal eg. SIGHUP which on Unix occurs if the controlling terminal "hangs up",
etc. It won't get run on a SIGKILL, but nothing will.  It also runs if you get an OutOfMemoryException
or similar problem in the runtime, though there is no guarantee the hook code e.g. close()
won't also fail in that case.
