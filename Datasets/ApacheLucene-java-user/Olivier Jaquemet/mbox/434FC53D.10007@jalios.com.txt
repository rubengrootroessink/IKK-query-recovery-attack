SUBJECT: Lucene 1.9 release date?
DATE: 14 Oct 2005

Hi all,

Some features we would like to use for our next software revision are 
part of lucene 1.9, in order to know if we can plan to use this version, 
could you tell me when do you think lucene 1.9 stable will be released?
I could not find any roadmap on the lucene site or wiki.
