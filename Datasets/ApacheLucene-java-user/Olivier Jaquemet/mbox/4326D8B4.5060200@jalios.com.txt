SUBJECT: MultiSearcher... Multiple Analyzer
DATE: 13 Sep 2005

Hi,

I have many indices, one for each language, each one has been indexed 
using a specific analyzer.
I want to search in all my indices, but I still want/need to use the 
same analyzer that has been used for indexing.
MultiSearch only accept one query, and if I use for example QueryParser, 
I can only specify one analyzer.
Is there a (nice) way to do a multi search using as much analyzer as 
there are indices we are searching in?

Olivier
