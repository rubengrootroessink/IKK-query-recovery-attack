SUBJECT: Optimize/Indexing progress state - time remaining
DATE: 25 Oct 2005

Hi all,

Is there a nice way to get information regarding the current progress 
state of any/all those operations:
- IndexWriter optimize
- IndexWriter index
- IndexReader delete
For example, having a synchronized method to retrieve a percentage of 
completion from writer/reader in another thread would be great! And then 
it would be quite easy to compute an estimated time remaining for my 
users to know what's happening when they want to reindex all their 
content or do anything quite time consuming.

I could not find anything in the API nor on the ML regarding this.
Any suggestions?

Olivier
