How about an attribute (fullyIndexed=true/false) to keep track of whether the indexing was
successful?

We used a similar attribute for a similar problem, but stored it in the accompanying database
instead.

-h

That will work but performance may not be great.

You could also open the IndexWriter with autoCommit=false, and then  
if you hit a failure in the text extraction, call abort() to cancel  
all docs you had added to this IndexWriter?  But that's bad because  
you lose all the documents that had succeeded.

Or, on hitting a failure in one of a document's attachments, you  
could just call deleteDocument on those attachments already added, to  
"undo" them?  This is in fact how IndexWriter itself deals with an  
exception while adding a document (to avoid having only a part of the  
document in the index): if it his an exception after processing some  
number of tokens, it just marks that document as deleted.
