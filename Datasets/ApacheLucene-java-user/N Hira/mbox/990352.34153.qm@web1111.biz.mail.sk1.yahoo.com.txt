 I generally suggest that it be used as a separate WebApp, but that depends.  I would suggest
the following criteria:
1.  Fitness to use cases
2.  Effort to develop/adapt
3.  Ease of deployment
4.  Effort to upgrade/maintain

Solr does "for free" some of the things (like index reopening/Searcher-pattern) that you would
have to handle in your application if you used Lucene.  Depending on how much time you have
and how much control you need, that may be a good or a bad thing.

You should be able to "try both" side-by-side in a few hours (the tutorials are pretty decent).

Thanks a bunch.

Since I'm already inside a java based web application it would seem like
both SOLR and Lucene would be plausible.  I'm curious what other factors I
should know about in determing if SOLR or Lucene is right for me.

Can SOLR be used within a web application (as a library) or is it only a
standalone app.
