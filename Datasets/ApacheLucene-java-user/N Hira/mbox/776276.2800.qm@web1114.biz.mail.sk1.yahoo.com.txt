I don't know of a single tutorial that puts it all together, but the "rich documents" feature
implemented in Solr-284 would be where I would start:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-284

Look here if you're using Solr 1.4  -- it should address your needs:
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/ExtractingRequestHandler


Good luck,
