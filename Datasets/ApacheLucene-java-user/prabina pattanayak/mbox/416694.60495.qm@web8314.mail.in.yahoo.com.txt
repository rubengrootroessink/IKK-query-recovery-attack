what i observed is that it creates the index folder, but that is empty.
it should have one/two file named segments.gen and segments_x(any no.) .
but these two files are not being created inside the index folder.
that's why it is throwing the exception message:
no segments* file found in org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory@E:\prabina\lucene-2.4demo\index:
files :

Hello prabina,

I worked fine in windows. Could you provide the details of exception and 
also the System.out messages printed by the application.

Index folder will be created in the current directory. When you execute java 
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles <root directory>, the list of files 
available in the root directory will get indexed. In your case it is 
"E:\prabina\lucene-2.4demo\src"

I have tried the following and it worked.
D:\Program Files\lucene-2.4.0>java -cp 
"lucene-demos-2.4.0.jar;lucene-core-2.4.0.jar" 
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles "D:\Program
Files\lucene-2.4.0\src"

Regards
Ganesh
