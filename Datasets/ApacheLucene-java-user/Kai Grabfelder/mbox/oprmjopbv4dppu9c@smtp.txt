SUBJECT: Search for foo&bar is not woking - only foobar works
DATE: 24 Mar 2003

hi!

i'm quite new to lucene so i hope that this sounds not too stupid:
I'm using lucene and cocoon. Everything works fine but there is one word 
i'm not able to search for (and find) We have got a product called foo&bar 
but lucene is not able to find it on our website. the & is not indexed i 
think because if i search for "foobar" the appropriate page is found - only 
the search for foo&bar is not working. Could somebody give me a clue which 
files from the source i have to change?

I would appreciate any help very much

Greetings

Kai
