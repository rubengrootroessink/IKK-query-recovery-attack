SUBJECT: Optimizing Collections
DATE: 29 Jun 2004

Hello All,

I've finished with the Lucene collections.  I'm building collections based 
on PDFs and database queries and everything is winderful.

I remember reading somewhere that you could optimize a Lucene 
collection.  But I can't remember where and cannot find anything on 
that.  I've also read it here as well.

Could someone point me to the right direction on how to optimize a collection?


Thanks
