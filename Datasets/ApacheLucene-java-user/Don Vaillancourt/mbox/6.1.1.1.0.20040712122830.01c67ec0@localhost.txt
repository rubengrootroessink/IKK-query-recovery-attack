SUBJECT: Anyone use MultiSearcher class
DATE: 12 Jul 2004

Hello,

Has anyone used the Multisearcher class?

I have noticed that searching two indexes using this MultiSearcher class 
takes 8 times longer than searching only one index.  I could understand if 
it took 3 to 4 times longer to search due to sorting the two search results 
and stuff, but why 8 times longer.

Is there some optimization that can be done to hasten the search?  Or 
should I just write my own MultiSearcher.  The problem though is that there 
is no way for me to create my own Hits object (no methods are available and 
the class is final).

Anyone have any clue?

Thanks
