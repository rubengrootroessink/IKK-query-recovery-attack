SUBJECT: Analyzers
DATE: 10 Jun 2004

I have recently downloaded the latest version of Lucene 1.3 and was 
wondering where some of the classes are.

For example all of the analyzers except for Standard are missing from the 
binary.  Are these documented, but incomplete classes which will be 
available later, although some articles that I have read seem to have 
tested these analyzers.

Thanks
