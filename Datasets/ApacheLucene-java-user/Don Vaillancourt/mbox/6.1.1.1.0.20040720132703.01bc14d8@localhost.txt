SUBJECT: Here is how to search multiple indexes
DATE: 20 Jul 2004

Here is the code that I use to do multi-index searches:

// create a multi index searcher
IndexSearcher indexes[] = new IndexSearcher[n];  // where n is the number 
of indexes to search

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
         // use whichever IndexSearcher constructor you want
         // blah is the appropriate value to pass
         indexes[i] = new IndexSearcher(blah);
}

// This is the part which allows you to search multiple indexes
Searcher searcher = new MultiSearcher(indexes);

// do the search
Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
Query query = QueryParser.parse(expression, colSearch, analyzer);

searcher.search(query);
