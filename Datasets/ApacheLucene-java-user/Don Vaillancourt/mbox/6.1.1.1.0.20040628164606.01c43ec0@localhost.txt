SUBJECT: PDF Indexing Issue
DATE: 28 Jun 2004

I used the following code example from an article that I linked off of 
jakarta's site to index PDF files:

doc.add(Field.Text("content", new FileReader(f)));

But I realized today that this method only indexes the PDF as is.  For 
those wondering if the the PDF were actually indexed or if maybe they only 
contained images, well I verified this with LUKE and those PDFs are in 
there, but the only keywords that were indexed were the PDF defintion 
statements and encoded stuff.

So what is the proper way to index a PDF?

Thank You
