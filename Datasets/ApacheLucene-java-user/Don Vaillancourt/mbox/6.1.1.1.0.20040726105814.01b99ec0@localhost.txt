SUBJECT: RE: Anyone use MultiSearcher class
DATE: 26 Jul 2004

Thanks for the info.

Maybe the best solution to this may be to perform multiple individual 
searches, create a container class and store all the hits sorted by 
relevance within that class and then cache/serialize this result for the 
current search for page by page manipulation.
