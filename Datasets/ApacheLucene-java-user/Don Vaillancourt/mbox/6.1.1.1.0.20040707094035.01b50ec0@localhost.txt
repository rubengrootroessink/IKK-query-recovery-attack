SUBJECT: MultiSearcher is very slow
DATE: 7 Jul 2004

Hi all,

I've managed to add multi-index searching capability to my code.  But one 
thing that I have noticed is that Lucene is extremely slow in searching.

For example I have been testing with 2 indexes for the past month or so and 
searching them returns results in under 250ms and sometimes even surprising 
me at under 50ms.  All of this on my desktop computer.

If I search both indexes with the MultiSearcher class, it take over 2000ms 
to search.  I have compared the search results and they do match.  But why 
is it taking so much longer.

I'm assuming that each index is searched separately and then the Hits 
results from each search is merged and sorted.  But still, I don't think 
that this should take any longer than 750ms.

Is it just the way Lucene MultiSearcher class was engineered that makes it 
slow or is there something that I am doing wrong?

Thanks
