Hi all,

I know that this is a Lucene list but wanted to know if any of you have 
gotten this error before using PDFBox?

I've gotten the latest version of PDFBox and it is giving me the following 
error:

java.lang.VerifyError: (class: org/apache/log4j/LogManager, method: 
<clinit> signature: ()V) Incompatible argument to function
at org.apache.log4j.Logger.getLogger(Logger.java:94)

org.pdfbox.searchengine.lucene.LucenePDFDocument.getDocument(LucenePDFDocument.java:118)

at Index.indexDirectory(Index.java:265)
at Index.update(Index.java:63)
at Lucene.main(Lucene.java:26)
Exception in thread "main"

I am using all the jar files that came with PDFBox.

Anyone run into this problem.  I am using the following line of code:

Document doc = LucenePDFDocument.getDocument(f);

Thanks
