SUBJECT: Boost value and LUKE
DATE: 23 Jan 2006

Hello All,

I am testing the boost value within the latest version of Lucene and I'm 
inspecting the results through Luke.

For each FIELD that I want to boost I use the setBoost method.  And 
everything looks good.  But Luke is refusing to exposure the boost value 
and keeps returning 1.0 for the specified columns (well actually all 
columns) when I have set one column to 0.5 and the other to 0.75.

1. Is there something I am doing wrong?
2. Is there a bug in Lucene?
3. is there a bug in Luke?

Anyone have any hints.

Thank You
