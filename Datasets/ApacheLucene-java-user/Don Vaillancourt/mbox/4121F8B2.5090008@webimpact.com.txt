Wow, this is an old message.

I managed to get my code to work by using the previous version of 
PDFBox.  I had used the version of log4j that had come with PDFBox.

Someone had mentioned recompiling log4j, but I couldn't get the project 
to import the source into Eclipse, so I gave up.  But things work great 
with the version of PDFBox that I compiled with so I am fine with that.

As for the version of log4j, I could not tell you, as I said above it 
came with PDFBox, so I'm guessing that it had probably not been tested 
with the version of log4j it was being distributed with.
