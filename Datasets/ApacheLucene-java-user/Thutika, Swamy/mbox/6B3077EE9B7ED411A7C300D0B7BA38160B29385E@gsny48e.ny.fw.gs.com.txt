DATE: 9 Jan 2002

Hi,
  I am not able to delete the documents from the index. Could someone please
exaplain me as to what am i doing
  working. I attached the delete and indexing code below:

   <<IdxReader.java>>  <<DeleteFile.java>> 

  Before deleting the output of IdxReader is :
N umber of docs :1
Term<body:are>
Term<body:deleted>
Term<body:getting>
Term<body:not>
Term<body:why>
Term<body:you>
Term<path:docone>

After delete:
umber of docs :0
Term<body:are>
Term<body:deleted>
Term<body:getting>
Term<body:not>
Term<body:why>
Term<body:you>
Term<path:docone>

  Thanks in advance

Swamy
