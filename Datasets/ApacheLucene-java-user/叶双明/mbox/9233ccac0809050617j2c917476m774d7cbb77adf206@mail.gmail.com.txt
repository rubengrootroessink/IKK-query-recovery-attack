SUBJECT: Re: How can we know if 2 lucene indexes are same?
DATE: 5 Sep 2008

There is more and more complex, actually I hava a small index system can
config multiple index server for query,

In my opinion,  because  index update operating is synchronized between
different Thread that update the index, so

for indexing new data : can process data that want to index at the master,
when get the documents, add the documents to the index at the master and add
them to every slave,

for deleting data : delete at the master and every slaves at the same time,

I think we can believe  the index is indeed the same at the master and at
all slaves except other unexpected error in individual node.

And i hear about there is some frame to sync data between computers, but
just hear about.

Sorry for my englist. :)
