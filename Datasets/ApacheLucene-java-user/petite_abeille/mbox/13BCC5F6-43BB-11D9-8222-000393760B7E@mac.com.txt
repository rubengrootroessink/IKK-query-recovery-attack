Right... I'm sure that Otis knows what he is doing :)

As far as implementation goes, you have at least 3 options:

- Implement List and Map directly in Lucene's relevant objects (e.g. 
Hits and Document)
- Extend Hits and Document to achieve the same
- Wrap Hits and Document in another class which implements the relevant 
interfaces (e.g HitsList and DocumentMap)

The point of the exercise being to provide a standard interface while 
still benefiting from the underlying Lucene optimizations.

PA.
