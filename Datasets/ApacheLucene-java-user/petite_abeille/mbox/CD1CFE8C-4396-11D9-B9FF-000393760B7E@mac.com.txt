Talking of which...

It would be very handy if org.apache.lucene.search.Hits would implement 
the java.util.List interface... in addition, 
org.apache.lucene.document.Document could implement java.util.Map...

That way, the rest of the application could pretend to simply have to 
deal with a List of Maps, without having to get exposed to any Lucene 
internals...

Thought?

Cheers,

PA.
