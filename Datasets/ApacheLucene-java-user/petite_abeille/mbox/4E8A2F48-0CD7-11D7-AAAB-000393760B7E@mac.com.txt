Yep. The basic approach ZOE takes is to create one index per class and 
index the primary and foreigns key as keywords. It then query the 
different indexes to simulate a "relational" storage... Which is all 
handy, dandy... On the other hand, if you already have a relational 
database in the first place, there is no reason to go through this 
circus in the first place...

If you are so inclined, you can check the alt.dev.szobject package for 
more gory details. In particular, SZIndex deals with Lucene directly.

You can find the app and its source here:
