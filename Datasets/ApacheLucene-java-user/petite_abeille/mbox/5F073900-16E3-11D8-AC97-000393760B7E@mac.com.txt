Hehe... ;) But NLP seems to suffer more from heuristics disguised in 
fancy jargon than other fields...

Indeed.

Nope. Therefore my "tongue in cheek" comments...

Perhaps. I'm not saying it's utterly useless as a whole. But... NLP has 
a noted tendency to over promise and under deliver. Plus, it's marred 
with too much jargons.... which is suspicious in and by itself :)

For "hardcore" text analysis, perhaps. But Lucene is an low level 
indexing library. You can build something much more, er, esoteric on 
top of it. But I don't think that the core library would benefit from 
any "bizarre" additions. Plus, the core elements of the library provide 
already more than enough room to play with whatever scheme you may have 
in mind.

Perhaps. But one way or another, and as far as Lucene is concerned, you 
will be better off building something exotic on top of Lucene than 
messing around with its internals.

PA.
