This is what I noticed also: adding documents by itself is a fairly 
benign operation, but anything that triggers an index merge in one form 
or another is a killer as an index grows in size.

So, overall, adding more documents does slow down the indexing.

At least this is the impression I get. But I would love to be proven 
wrong on this :)
