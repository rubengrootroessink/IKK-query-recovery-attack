Ok. That's good as all my fields are indexed but not stored in Lucene. 
Only one field is stored in any one index: the uuid of an object (as a 
Keyword).

Ok. So, in theory, more homogeneous index should use less files all 
things being equal?

Ok. When doing the optimization, are there any temporary files getting 
created?

That's my impression also...

Yep. I guess I overlooked that.

Just to make sure: using a small merge factor (eg 2) will reduce the 
number of files or just optimize (aka merge) the index more often?

Thanks. Very helpful indeed :-)
