If you are talking about my ultra secret project "Zapata: Coding 
Mexican Style", then yes ;)

But... it uses runtime information to reach its devious ends and is 
more like a documentation tool than anything else...

Anyway, this is how it goes:

Given a set of binary jar files it builds an object graph of the 
bytecode: packages, classes, methods and so on. Complete with 
interdependencies and other handy informations. The bytecode is also 
run through a decompiler and pretty printed to normalize the source. 
Code segments are attached and indexed alongside their owners (class or 
method). All this fully indexed, searchable and cross referenced.

This is built upon the same engine used by ZOE, so the end result is 
very much along the lines of what ZOE does for email, but for code 
instead... fun, fun, fun ;)

Cheers,

PA.
