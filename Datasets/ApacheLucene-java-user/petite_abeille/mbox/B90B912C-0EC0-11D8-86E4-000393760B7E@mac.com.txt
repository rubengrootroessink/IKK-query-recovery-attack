Very similar indeed :)

Perhaps you should take a look at ZOE:

http://zoe.nu/

It uses Lucene quiet extensively to index emails type of things.

NNTP support could be a stone throw away as you would only need to 
plugin the appropriate JavaMail's Store to handle NNTP specifics.

On the other hand, I doubt that anyone has tried to index anything on 
the scale of Google's data set... NNTP or not :)
