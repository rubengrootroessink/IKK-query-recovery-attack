SUBJECT: Lucene index integrity... or lack of :-(
DATE: 26 Apr 2002

Hello,

I'm starting to wander how "bullet proof" are Lucene indexes? Do they 
get corrupted easely? If so is there a way to rebuild them?

I'm started to get the following exception left and right...

"04/25 18:34:39 (Warning) Indexer.indexObjectWithValues: 
java.io.IOException: _91.fnm already exists"

I build a little app (http://homepage.mac.com/zoe_info/) that uses 
Lucene quiet extensively, and I would like to keep it that way. However, 
I'm starting to have second thought about Lucene's reliability... :-(

I'm sure I'm doing something wrong somewhere, but I really cannot see 
what...

Any help or insight greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

PA.
