Maybe it should... ;-)

Well, this seems to be a very popular request... In fact I need 
something like that also. Unfortunately, there seems to be no 
authoritative answer as far as converting pdf files to text in a pure 
Java environment... Maybe I'm missing something here as usual?

Also, on a related note, what would be a good approach to convert any 
random document into pdf? I was thinking to have a two steps process for 
document indexing in Lucene:

- First, convert everything to pdf (with Acrobat or something)
- Second, convert pdf to text and index it.

Any practical suggestions about how to do that in a pure Java 
environment very welcome.

Thanks :-)
