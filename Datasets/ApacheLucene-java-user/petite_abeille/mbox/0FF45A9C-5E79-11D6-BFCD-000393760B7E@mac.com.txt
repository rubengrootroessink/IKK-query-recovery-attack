Sounds good... But what does it mean? I'm not that familiar with any of 
the XML, XSLT hype so I don't really understand what you are getting 
at... I just want to convert any type of document to text for indexing 
purpose... I'm not planning to do anything else with it... However, 
converting everything to PDF as a first step allow you to provide a 
"preview" of any documents even if you happen not to understand the 
original format (eg MS Office)...
