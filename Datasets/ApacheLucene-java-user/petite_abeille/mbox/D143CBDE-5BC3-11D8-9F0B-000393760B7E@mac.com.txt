Lucene deals with text. You could always serialize your objects in a 
byte array, hex encode them or something, and store that in an 
appropriate field.

Don't store your objects in Lucene :)

As other have pointed out, you will be much better off storing your 
object somewhere else (files, db, btree, whatever) and only use Lucene 
to store a reference to those objects.

For a concrete example of this approach, take a look at ZOE [1] source 
code [2].

It uses Lucene for, er, indexing and JDBM [2] to store the 
corresponding object's binaries.

Cheers,
