I honestly wish I could. Unfortunately, because of the nature of the 
application (Otis is familiar with it), I never seem to be able to come 
up with a consistent test case. I might be using Lucene in a very 
peculiar way (?) which includes a lot of concurrent read/write/delete 
on multiple indexes/threads. So I haven't managed to "can" the problem 
in a nice and tidy "batch oriented" test case. Sight...

In any case, the external symptoms are: bad file descriptor, read past 
EOF and array out of bound. Next time around, I will capture the full 
stack trace and forward it to the list if you guys are interested.

Cheers,

PA.
