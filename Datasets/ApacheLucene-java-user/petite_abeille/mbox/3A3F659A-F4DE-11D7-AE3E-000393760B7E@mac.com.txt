I see... I'm sure I could get to the lock name and scan the tmp 
directory for a match... but why such complication in the first place? 
The only thing I can think of is for application running on read-only 
media... but in such a case there is no need to a lock in the first 
place...

Cheers,

PA. Very confused.
