This mostly means finding document which are "similar" in some way(s). 
The "similitude" is mostly in the eyes of the beholder. In such a 
world, a "cluster" would be a pile of document sharing something. As 
far as Lucene goes, a straightforward way of approaching this could be 
to use an entire document content to query an index. Lucene's result 
set could be construed as a "document cluster". Admittedly, this is 
ground zero of "document clustering", but here you go anyway :)

Here is an illustration:
