Correct. This happen to be on purpose :) Does XDoclet build an 
"intertwingled" object graph of your code along the way? Performing a 
plain search on a code base is pretty trivial... what seems to be more 
interesting would be to put that in context.

Zapata does something along the line of what MagicHat does for 
Objective-C:

But from the sound of what Otis is saying this is not what you guys are 
looking for... back to the pampa then...

Cheers,

PA.
