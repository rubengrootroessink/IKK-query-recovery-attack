ZOÃ‹ can access an IMAP server to index it, but doesn't act as an IMAP 
server itself even though it provides other services (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, 
POP, FTP, etc).

As far as I know Apache's JAMES doesn't provide any IMAP interface 
either, just plain POP, SMTP and NNTP. There is some "experimental" 
IMAP code in their repository for the last couple of years.

JBoss Mail Server purports to provide an IMAP server, not sure how far 
along it is though.

http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossmail/index.html

There is something called "Dwarf Mail Server", which provides an 
IMAP4rev1 implementation, but is not open source last time I checked.

Considering how, hmmm, "byzantine" the IMAP protocol is, the paucity of 
implementations shouldn't come as a surprise :(
