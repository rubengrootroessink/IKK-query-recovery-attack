Hello,

I recently updated from 1.3 RC1 to the latest cvs version. RC1 has 
proven very reliable for me, but I needed Dmitry compound index 
functionality. Therefore the move to the cvs version.

I have been using 1.3 RC1 without any problem. But... since updating to 
the cvs version, I'm getting a lot of apparently random IOException 
related to locking:

java.io.IOException: Index locked for write: 
Lock@/tmp/lucene-5b228139f8fe55f7c74441a7d59f8f89-write.lock
         at 
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:173)
         at 
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:150)

This is most likely due to some problem on my side, but for the life of 
me I cannot track it down nor reproduce it :(

Also, the only change related to Lucene on my side was the update from 
1.3 RC1 to the cvs version. Perhaps this has triggered a "dormant" bug 
in my app. Or perhaps something has changed in the cvs version which 
impact me negatively. Other way, I'm at loss.

My guess would be that this is most likely a threading issue. On my 
side, I use a very conservative threading which supposedly synchronized 
any access to Lucene. And this hasn't changed for a good while.

Any idea where I should look in such a situation? Any "significant" 
changes related to locking on Lucene side?

For the record, this problem seems to mostly manifest itself under Mac 
OS X, running Java 1.4.1_01.

Thanks.

Cheers,

PA.
