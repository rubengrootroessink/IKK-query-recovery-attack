SUBJECT: [RFE]  IndexWriter.updateDocument()
DATE: 14 Dec 2004

Well, the subject says it all...

If there is one thing which is overly cumbersome in Lucene, it's 
updating documents, therefore this Request For Enhancement:

Please consider enhancing the IndexWriter API to include an 
updateDocument(...) method to take care of all the gory details 
involved in such operation.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

PA.
