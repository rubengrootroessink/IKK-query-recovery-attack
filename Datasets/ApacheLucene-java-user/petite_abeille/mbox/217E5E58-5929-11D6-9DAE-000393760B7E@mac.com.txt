Well, I used to have an index per class. And I have around a dozen 
classes that get indexed. When trying to switch to the latest rc (with 
the exact same code base), I ran into so many problems with the now 
infamous "FileNotFoundException" that I consolidated everything in one 
index per object store. And switched back to the com.lucene package that 
-as far as I can personally tell- is *much* more stable. I do not store 
the content of the objects in the index, just some uuid as Field.Keyword 
and other attributes as Field.UnStored. On average, there seem to be 
less than one hundred Lucene files per index.

I have this one under control... Thanks.

Please feel free to do so... ;-)

Great. That was my assumption all along...
