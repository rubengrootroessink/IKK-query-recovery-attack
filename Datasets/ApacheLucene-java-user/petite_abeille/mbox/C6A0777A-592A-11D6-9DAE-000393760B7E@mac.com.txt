:-( Well, that *very* sad to say the least... How do I know if my 
indexes are not corrupted even if everything seems to be working fine? 
Don't tell me I'm the first one to run into this kind of issues?!? How 
can I "trust" an index if there is *no* way of checking its integrity? 
And even if you happen to notice that something is fishy, there is no 
way to rebuild the index -short or re-indexing everything from scratch? 
That does not sound like a very "healthy" situation to me. "Fragile" 
will be kind for describing it...

Lucky you...

Maybe, maybe not. And most likely I'm doing something odd. In any case, 
could you point me to the "mistakes that others have already made"? Or 
did I miss something obvious here?

Thanks.
