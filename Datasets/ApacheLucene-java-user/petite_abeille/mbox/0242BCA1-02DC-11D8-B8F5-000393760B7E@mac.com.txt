SUBJECT: [OT] Open Source Goes to COMDEX
DATE: 20 Oct 2003

Hello,

This is pretty much off topic, but...

ZOE has been nominated as one of the candidate project to go the Open 
Source Innovation Area on the COMDEX Exhibit Floor.

ZOE is one of the few Java project short listed and it uses Lucene 
quiet extensively.

Show your support by voting for ZOE :)

Cheers,

PA.
