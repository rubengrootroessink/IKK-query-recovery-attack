SUBJECT: package information?
DATE: 20 Dec 2002

Hi,

Would it be possible for Lucene to provide package informations? 
Basically all the java.lang.Package attributes... Things like 
implementation vendor, name, version and so on... This would make it 
easier to identify which packages/versions are used.

Thanks.

PA.
