Ummm... I see.

I see. That's what I'm basically doing right now somehow: I index a 
document multiple time (eg an email could be indexed by subject, first 
sentence and body content). Then I do multiple searches. And use a 
"ranking comparator" to evaluate the result based on how many time I get 
a specific document plus its Lucene scores and other funky heuristics. 
Which seems to work ok, but is kind of cumbersome :-( Same deal for 
finding "related" document. Lucene is very good for finding "similar" 
document, but for "related" (think "cluster" ;-), I basically end up 
doing some term categorization and assign some multiplying factor for 
each term category. Which then I feed to Lucene to get something more 
akin to a "cluster" of document...

In any case, I was simply wandering if there was a more straightforward 
way of doing things.

Cheers,

PA.
