Hmmm... how would you do that? Something along the lines of 
aReader.terms() and then for each Term use aReader.termDocs() to try to 
figure out which document it belongs to? Something else altogether? How 
do you move the doc/terms to the other index then?

That's ok :)

Alternatively, would it be possible to use FieldsReader/FieldsWriter or 
such to move the raw data from one index to the other without ill side 
effects?

TIA.
