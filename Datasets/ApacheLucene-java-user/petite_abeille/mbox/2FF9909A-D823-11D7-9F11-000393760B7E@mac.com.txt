Thanks for the moral support :)

In any case, hard liquors and coding doesn't always mix well together, 
so obviously I was shooting myself in the foot...

For the record, I'm using a RAMDirectory which then gets flushed into a 
FSDirectory.

Deleting something means checking both the RAM and FS directory. Which 
is what I do.

But... because of the internal caching done by the IndexWriter, a 
document is not made available straight away... therefore 
IndexReader.delete(Term) returning zero and me banging my head against 
the wall... adjusting the order of operations did solve the "problem"...

Which brings a question: is there a way to influence the IndexWriter's 
internal RAM cache, beside closing or optimizing a writer?

Cheers,

PA.
