Hello,

I'm in the process of creating the "about" page for my app and I was 
wondering what are the requirements to get included in the "Powered by 
Lucene" page?

The app is a desktop application... it's not a web site. The only 
requirement I see is "Please include something like the following with 
your search results: search powered by lucene".

My question is: is it "good enough" to put the above in the about page 
or does it _has_ to be in the search results page? I'm fine with the 
first scenario (about page) but I'm very reticent to the second (search 
page). This "reticence" has nothing to do with "branding" or failure to 
give Lucene credit: it's simply that the search page is already very 
crowded and I don't think adding anything to it will improve the 
situation :-| On the contrary :-(

Comments?

Thanks.

PA.
