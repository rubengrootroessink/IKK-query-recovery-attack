Why? Nobody mentioned what value such a Map would hold... in the worst 
case scenario it could hold a Collection... or perhaps its not worth 
bothering with such esoterism and simply state that the DocumentMap 
only supports one value per key... after all... the purpose of 
providing standard interface such as List and Map is to simplify 
things... not to make them more cumbersome...
