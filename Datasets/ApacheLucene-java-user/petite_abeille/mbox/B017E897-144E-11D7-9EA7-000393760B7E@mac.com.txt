I do follow this strategy and it seems to work nicely... however it 
might be not enough :-( Another factor to consider is how homogeneous 
are your indexes: the more documents are alike the better. I tried a 
wide spectrum of combination and I settled on using one index per class 
of documents. This seems to work best for me as far as file handles go. 
YMMV.

Also, using addIndexes() progressively slow down the application to a 
crawl as the indexes to merge are continuously growing in size... Oh, 
well...

In any case, I also wanted to emphasize that I really do like Lucene. 
Thanks to all the people who contributed their time and effort to make 
this outstanding library. And special thanks to Doug for his clean and 
lean design :-)

Cheers,

PA.
