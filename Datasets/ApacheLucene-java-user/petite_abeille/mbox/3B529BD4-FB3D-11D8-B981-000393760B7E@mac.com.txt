SUBJECT: alternative query syntax?
DATE: 31 Aug 2004

Hello,

I would like to provide an alternative query syntax for ranges by using 
a colon (':') or two dots ('..') instead of ' TO '.

For example:

mod_date:[20020101:20030101]

Or

mod_date:[20020101..20030101]

What would be the correct procedure to modify the QueryParser to 
achieve this? Should I simply change QueryParser.jj's RANGEIN_TO and 
RANGEEX_TO to the appropriate character sequence and regenerate the 
corresponding Java classes with JavaCC?

Any pointers appreciated as I'm not familiar with JavaCC :)

TIA.

Cheers,

PA.
