Yes, retrofitting Document.add() in the Map interface would be a pain. 
But this is not really what I was getting at. This is more about Hits 
and accessing its values. One problem at the time :)

Agree. Document is fine as it is. It would be nice though to have a 
more or less standard interface to access the result set (e.g. 
Collection)... as consumers of Hits are more likely to be build in 
terms of the Collection API than anything specific to Lucene...

PA.
