If this works for you, I don't see any problem with it.

In general, I avoid storing any raw data in a Lucene Document. And only  
uses Lucene for, er, indexing... but this is just me :)

But lets go back to that fabled Map interface for Document... if the  
purpose of such interface is to keep thing simple it could behave just  
like Document.get() [1]:

"Returns the string value of the field with the given name if any exist  
in  this document, or null. If multiple fields exist with this name,  
this method returns the first value added."

If for some reason(s) you need multiple values per field, stick with  
getFields()...

What's wrong with that?

PA.
