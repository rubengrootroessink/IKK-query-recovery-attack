Not that I'm an expert in any of this, but clustering is a much more 
"holistic" approach than categorization. Usually, categorization is 
understood as a more precise endeavor (e.g. dmoz.org), while clustering 
is much more "fuzzy" and non-deterministic. Both try to achieve the 
same goal though. So perhaps this is just a question of jargon.

I'm confident that the owner of this site could help bring some light 
on the finer point of clustering vs categorization:
