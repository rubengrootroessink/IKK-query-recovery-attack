ZOE [1] [2] takes the same approach and uses Lucene as a relational 
engine of sort.

However, for both practical and ideological reasons, its does not store 
any raw data in the Lucene indices themselves but instead uses JDBM [2] 
for that purpose.

All things considered, update issues aside, Lucene turns out to be a 
very flexible "thin database".

Cheers,
