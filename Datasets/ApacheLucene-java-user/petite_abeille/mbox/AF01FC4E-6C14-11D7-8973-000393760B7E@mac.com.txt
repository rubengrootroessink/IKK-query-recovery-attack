SUBJECT: Searching for null value?
DATE: 11 Apr 2003

Hello,

Is there a simple way to query an index for documents which don't have 
a specific value (a keyword field in this instance). For example, I 
have documents with a category field and I would like to retrieve all 
the documents which don't have any category? Any way to express that as 
a Lucene query?

Thanks.

Cheers,

PA.
