Yep... pretty weird... but looking at openFile(String name)... could it 
somehow be possible that the name is invalid for some reasons and 
therefore doesn't exists in the Hashtable? So files.get(name) would 
return null and new RAMInputStream(file) would then raise a NPE?

This would not explain why the name is invalid in the first place... 
but that could be a start for an investigation... what do you think?

Cheers,

PA.
