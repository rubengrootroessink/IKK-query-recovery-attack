Since changing indexing strategy, I have between 12 to 20 files per 
index (including deletable and segments).

That what I see for small objects (eg with few fields).

My "richest" object has around a dozen fields.

I guess I have this part under control now.

Thanks for the explanation :-) I mostly have <n>.f<m> type files as one 
may expect.

It seems that I'm getting there... ;-)

I decided to be much more "aggressive" with all the file handles... But 
I still rely heavely on the garbage collector as I'm using the reference 
api extensively... Seems to work fine so far...

So far, my app seems to be doing fine without having to mess around with 
any system parameters... Also, it seems to be more responsive since I 
have more indexes... Go figure ;-)

Thanks.
