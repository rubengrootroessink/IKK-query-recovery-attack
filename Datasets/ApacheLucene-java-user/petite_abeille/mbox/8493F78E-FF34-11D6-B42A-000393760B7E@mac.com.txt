  "... Each vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y) in a word counts as one syllable  
subject to the following sub-rules: Ignore final -ES, -ED, -E (except  
for -LE) Words of three letters or less count as one syllable  
Consecutive vowels count as one syllable. Although there are many  
exceptions to these rules, it works in a remarkable number of cases.
