Who knows...?!? In any case, it's not public knowledge...

I use to believe in Santa Claus also... ;-)

All that said, there seems to be a real demand to do something about pdf 
to text conversion (in java preferably). I'm willing to invest some time 
and brain cell to nail it down, but I'm note sure where to start...

I'm aware of the PJ library, but it's really a pig as far as resources 
goes. Anything else?

Any (concrete) pointer appreciated.

Thanks.
