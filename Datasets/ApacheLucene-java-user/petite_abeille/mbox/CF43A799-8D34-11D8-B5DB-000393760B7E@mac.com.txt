Talking of which... what strategy(ies) do people use to minimize 
downtime when updating an index?

My current "strategy" is as follow:

(1) use a temporary RAMDirectory for ongoing updates.
(2) perform a "copy on write" when flushing the RAMDirectory into the 
persistent index.

The second step means that I create an offline copy of a live index 
before invoking addIndexes() and then substitute the old index with the 
new, updated, one. While this effectively increase the time it takes to 
update an index, it nonetheless reduce the *perceived* downtime for it.

Thoughts? Alternative strategies?

TIA.

Cheers,

PA.
