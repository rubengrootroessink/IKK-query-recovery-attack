Very nice. Thanks :)

Quick question regarding release note number 11:

What's the difference between IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]) and 
IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory[]) beside the fact that one takes an 
array of IndexReader and the other an array of Directory? Any 
functional differences? Is one way recommended over the other?

Cheers,

PA.
