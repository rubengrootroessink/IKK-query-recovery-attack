A small testing set: around 100 MB.

Most definitively.

Ooops... forgot to mention that the purpose of my testing was to test 
searching... I don't mind indexing speed that much... in any case... 
more generally I wanted to see if a buffered random access file would 
help in my peculiar situation... but no noticeable differences in my 
case one way or another... on the other hand... that could be just me 
as there is much more than straightforward Lucene indexing/searching 
going on. Let that not discourage you :-) In any case, Lucene itself is 
pretty speedy overall. The only bottleneck is index merging in my 
experience.

Cheers,

PA.
