SUBJECT: which lock belong to which index?
DATE: 2 Oct 2003

Hello,

10/01 11:25:41 (Warning) IndexWriter.<init>: java.io.IOException: Index  
locked for write:  
Lock@C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\lucene- 
08d0626209019ccc9327ba6fb063c456-write.lock

Is there a straightforward way to figure out which lock belong to which  
index? The lock name seems to be a MD5 digest of the index's directory  
canonical path (or at least this is what getLockPrefix() looks like).

Previously, the locks where located alongside the indices... so it was  
pretty trivial to know which lock belong to which index... but now that  
they are all dumped into java.io.tmpdir this is getting cumbersome...  
why the move to tmpdir in the first place? This seems to be a very  
gratuitous change, which only complicate things without providing any  
obvious value...

Or perhaps I'm missing something?

Cheers,

PA.
