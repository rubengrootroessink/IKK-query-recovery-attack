Many thanks, this was helpful. I wonder if you could just
put a paragraph in the javadocs about mergeFactor saying that 

  "it is the number of documents kept
   in memory before writing them to file. To minimize file system
   access, raise this number, but expect up to
   (mergeFactor+1)*numFilesPerSegment files to be open
   at the same time, which may be beyond the processes limit".

This would explain a lot.

  Thanks,
  Harald.
