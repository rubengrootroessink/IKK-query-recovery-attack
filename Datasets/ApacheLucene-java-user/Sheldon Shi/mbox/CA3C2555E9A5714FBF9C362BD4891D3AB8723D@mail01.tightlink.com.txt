SUBJECT: Breaking up words with a certain pattern and search by parts
DATE: 5 Apr 2002

In my project I would like to search for product code such as
MEM12345 either by "MEM" or by "12345". I can't do that right
now in Lucene 1.2. Prefix query doesn't do prefix search followed
by numbers, and there is no "end with" type of search. How do I 
modify the HTMLParser to index MEM12345 as two words MEM and 12345 
instead of one?

Thanks.

Sheldon
