SUBJECT: Inquiry on Lucene Stemming
DATE: 16 Dec 2008

Hi,


Can anyone comment if my understanding of the stemming process in Lucene is correct. From
my testing using the SnowballAnalyzer, if I passed this word "flashing" it will be trimmed
to a root word "flash" and this root word ("flash") will be the one searched not the original
word "flashing".

Is there an API in Lucene or third-party APIs that can do the following, I passed the word
"flash" instead it will search for "flashing", "flashed", "flashes" etc.?


Regards,
Jay Malaluan
