SUBJECT: on-the-fly "filters" from docID lists
DATE: 21 Jul 2010

Hello, we are trying to implement a query type for Lucene (with eventual
target being Solr) where the query string passed in needs to be "filtered"
through a large list of document IDs per user. We can't store the user ID
information in the lucene index per document so we were planning to pull the
list of documents owned by user X from a key-value store at query time and
then build some sort of filter in memory before doing the Lucene/Solr query.
For example:

content:"cars" user_id:X567

would first pull the list of docIDs that user_id:X567 has "access" to from a
keyvalue store and then we'd query the main index with content:"cars" but
only allow the docIDs that came back to be part of the response. The list of
docIDs can near the hundreds of thousands.

What should I be looking at to implement such a feature?

Thank you
Martin
