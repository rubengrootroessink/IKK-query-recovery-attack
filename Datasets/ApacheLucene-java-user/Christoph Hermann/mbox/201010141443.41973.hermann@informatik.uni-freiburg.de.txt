Thanks for the hint. Looks good.

Although i have some additional questions. It seems Playload gets added to 
every term in the index, so in my case i would store the x,y and page values 
for every word and increase the index much more than i'd need.
Any approach for preventing this?

And when searching, how can i access the payloads when displaying the result? 
I haven't found information on that so far.

regards
Christoph Hermann
