Steve, thanks for correction. You are right. The version is 3.0.3 released last Oct.

I did place an ant jar in Eclipse, and it does the job to remove some compiling errors. However,
it seems that I do need some jar file to handle the DbHandleExtractor.java and the org.apache.lucene.store.db
package, which are under contrib/db/bdb/src/java folder.

Do you know when I can find the proper jar file?

Cheng

Hi Cheng,

Lucene 3.3 does not exist - do you mean branches/branch_3x ?

FYI, as of Lucene 3.1, there is an Ant target you can use to setup an Eclipse project for
 Lucene/Solr - run this from the top level directory of a full source tree (including dev-tools/
directory) checked out from Subversion: 

   ant eclipse
