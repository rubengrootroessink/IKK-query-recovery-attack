Steve, the two links are really helpful. I still have a few questions:

1) The import statement, import org.apache.lucene.queryParser.standard.parser.StandardSyntaxParser,
doesn't work because the StandardSyntaxParser.java is not available.

Do you know where to download it?

2) The CharStream class is not available. Please see this, "public final class FastCharStream
implements CharStream"

What is it? Do you know where to download it?

3) The QueryParser class can't be resolve. Please see this, SrndQuery lq = QueryParser.parse(queryText);

Thanks,
Cheng

(Resending to the list - didn't notice that my reply went to Cheng directly)

There is an Ant target "get-db-jar" that can do the downloading for you - you can see the
URL it uses here:

<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/tags/lucene_3_0_3/contrib/db/bdb/build.xml?view=markup#l49>

There is another Ant target "get-je-jar" that does the same thing for the contrib/db/bdb-je/
module:

<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/tags/lucene_3_0_3/contrib/db/bdb-je/build.xml?view=markup#l49>
