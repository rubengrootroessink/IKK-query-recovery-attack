DATE: 15 May 2011

Hi, I created a java project for Lucene 3.3 in Eclipse, and found that in
the DbHandleExtractor.java file, the package of com.sleepycat.db.internal.Db
is not resolved. How can I overcome this?

 

I have tried to download .jar for this, but don't know which and where to
download.

 

Thanks
