SUBJECT: PAGE RANKING IN LUCENE?   <NEED URGENT HELP!>
DATE: 14 Apr 2007


I need an urgent help.
I want to change the page ranking algorithm in lucene and I do not know
where to start from and what file should I change?
I do not know what classes are involved. I have only a few days to do so, so
please help me with your complete explanation as a big favor!
Bests,
Eric
