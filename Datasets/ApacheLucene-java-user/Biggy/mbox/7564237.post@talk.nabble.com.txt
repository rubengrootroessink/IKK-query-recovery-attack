SUBJECT: Re: Searching by bit masks
DATE: 27 Nov 2006



i have the same problem here. I have an interest bit field, which i 
receive from the applciation backend. I have control over how the docuemtns
are built.
To be specific, the field looks like this:

ID: interest
1 : sport
2 : music
4 : film
8 : clubs

So someone interested in sports and music can be found by "interest & 3" =>
e.g. when using SQL.

I do not wish to Post-Filter the results
On to Lucene, Is there a filter which supports this kind of query ?

Someone suggested splitting the bits into fields:
> Document doc = new Document();
> doc.add("flag1", "Y");
> doc.add("flag2", "Y");
> IndexWriter.add(doc); 
Is this helpful at all ?

Code would be helpful too as i am a newbie
