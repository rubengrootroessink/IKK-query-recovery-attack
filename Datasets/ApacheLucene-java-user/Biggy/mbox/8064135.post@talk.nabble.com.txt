SUBJECT: Clustering Lucene with 40 Servers
DATE: 27 Dec 2006


I'm currently investigating the best ways of clustering Lucene.
I've heard of both Solr, Terracotta but do not know how well they scale.
Their examples talk of a 4 node cluster. This is way too small for my needs.

I have 30x JVMs each handling 3 requests/sec and each having their own
Lucene index. The index changes are propagated to the cluster members using
JGroups messages. This solution has more than reached its limit as JGroups
has become unstable and a source of many JVMs crashes. Based on current
traffic trends I anticipate needing to upgrade to 40x + JVMS very soon.

Can anybody suggest a way to effectivily cluster / replicate document
changes ?

P.S.: 
JMS is not a possible solution as this was the prior JGroups solution. We
had too many memory problems/queue full etc crashing the servers thereafter.
