Hi 

 

I am trying to build an application which uses JMS objects and Lucene. I
am creating Lucene Documents and sending them through JMS objects to a
queue( I am using IBM MQ Series ). There is a listener which listens to
this queue and Indexes these documents. The problem I am facing is there
is exception being thrown which is 

 

Unable to deserialize objects ..

 

Now my JMS msg object is Serialized the problem can be with Document,but
I looked up the source code of Document and saw it was serialized . Can
any one give some insights into this problem . 

 

 

    Regards and Thanks
