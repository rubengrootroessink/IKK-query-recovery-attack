Hi Otis

Here are my specifications

--Query Simple query ( one to ten parameters ) and range queries ( three
Parameters )
--Size of index 15 - 20 GB
--Hardware 2 GB RAM 2 CPU machine Intel Xeon 2.4 Ghz
--Latency should be within a second


If you can provide me with some numerical figures on the number of
queries that a single index can support.

It would be also helpful if you can provide me with the exact hardware
specifications that I would need for the above requirement. (If the
above is not sufficient)


Regards and Thanks
Kinnar Kumar Sen

It depends on:
- query complexity/type
- size of the index
- hardware (CPU, disk, RAM)
- acceptable latency
...
