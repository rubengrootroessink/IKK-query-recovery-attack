DATE: 29 Apr 2006

Hi Marc
   I have basically gone through the book Lucene in Action  where it
suggest requerying would be better, but I believe it depends on the kind
of application you have. In my case I need to rank the hits according to
some other parameters so I need the total hits at a time then rank it
accordingly. Then while paginating displaying the results in batches. 
   Can you suggest me some other way to do the same? In my case the
ranking is an absolute must and I can't put the ranking parameters
inside lucene index along with each data.

Regards
Kinnar

Hi Kinnar,

Well, I have quite a few indexes, some of which get
updated infrequently with large loads (quartley) and
then some indexes which will have approx 2000
additions a day.

Originally I planned to store the results on the
session - but I have to design for growth, both in
users and in data - I feel that eventually too much
memory will be taken up by this (which can be
mitigated by having multiple search servers) and I'll
end up timing out the session earlier than is useful.

I'm sure I read something in LIA the other day where
Eric recommended requerying, but I don't yet have any
fixed ideas about which way to go. What do you think?

Marc
