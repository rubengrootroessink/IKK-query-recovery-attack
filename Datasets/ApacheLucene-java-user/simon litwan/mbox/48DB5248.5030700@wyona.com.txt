hi all

i tried to reuse the IndexSearcher among all of the threads that are 
doing searches as described in 
(http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#head-48921635adf2c968f7936dc07d51dfb40d638b82)

this works fine. but our application does continuous indexing. so the 
index is changing and the at startup initialized IndexSearcher seems not 
to be notified to reload the index.

is there a way to force the IndexSearcher to reload the index if the 
index has changed?

thanks in advance

simon
