SUBJECT: 10Gb of .nfsXXX files about a week old in NFS based index directory
DATE: 10 Sep 2008

Hi,

We have a customer using lucene on an NFS directory, which contains  
~10Gb of .nfsXXXX files. These files are the means by which NFS  
implements delete-on-close semantics (that is, if the index writer  
commits a delete of a file that is still held open by an index  
reader, the file is renamed to .nfsXXXXX).

The version of Lucene in use is 2.2.

Our IndexSearcher is refreshed almost every minute (new IndexSearcher 
(Directory directory)) depending on whether content has been added/ 
updated/deleted.

What must be done to guarantee that lucene does not hold onto files  
that have been deleted?

Can a dereferenced IndexSearcher (closeReader=true) which has not  
been close()-ed cause lucene to be holding onto file handles of  
deleted index files?

Cheers,
Dave
