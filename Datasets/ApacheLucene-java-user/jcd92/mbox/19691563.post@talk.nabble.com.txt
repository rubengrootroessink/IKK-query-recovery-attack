SUBJECT: How to get the index file entries (IndexReader)  in different order?
DATE: 26 Sep 2008


Hi all,

The index has Millions of entries. I need to display the index content in a
JTable with columns (terms, field, freq) and the user can choose the sorting
order (field, freq, terms), (freq, term, field), etc...

What is the best solution to manage the Index sorting

I just need some entries at a time, the one displayed in the table. Thus I
just sort the entries needed in a TreeMap reading the whole index file
(which is quite slow). 

Any Idea would be welcome

Best wishes to all

JCD
