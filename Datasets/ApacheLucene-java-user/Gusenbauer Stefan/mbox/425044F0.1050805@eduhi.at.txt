Sorry for beeing late!
Only the test code wouldn't be very useful for understanding because 
there are a lot of dependencies in the other code. I can explain what I 
do: I open an IndexWrite close it then open an IndexReader close it and 
open an IndexWriter then close it. Then i try to delete the files from 
the index and only the cfs file i cannot delete. I try to get out the 
code which is involved later on. I get no failure message only the
that the fail could not be removed.
