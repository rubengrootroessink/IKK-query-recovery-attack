SUBJECT: Multiple Field Queries
DATE: 21 Mar 2005

Hello,
at the moment i cannot search through the mailinglist archives so i will 
bother you. I will search over multiple fields for example content and 
filename. The MultiFieldQueryParser is not applicable for me so i create 
the query syntax programmatically. The querystring is parsed with the 
QueryParser i use it in this example two times for content and filename 
the resulting query. Then i combine them with BooleanQuery add the 
resulting string is for example +content:test +filename:test. The 
problem here is i would like to construct a query like (+content:test) 
OR (+filename:test). Is the only alternative to extend the boolean query 
to the string and make some string operations above it and pass it 
through the QueryParser again?
Thanks
Stefan
