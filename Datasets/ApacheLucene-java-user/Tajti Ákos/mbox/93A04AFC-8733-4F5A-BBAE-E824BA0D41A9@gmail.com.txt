Dear List,

in our application there are many long documents that we index. Previously we had a problem
with lucene's scoring: some documents got low scores because their lengths. Then we started
to use SweetSpotSimilarity and it seemed to solve the problem. But now we face an other difficulty:
it's hard to set the correct parameters for SweetSpotSimilarity. For example we want the title
of a page to always have the highest boost than its content no matter how long it is.
Do you have any idea?

Thanks in advance,
Ákos Tajti
