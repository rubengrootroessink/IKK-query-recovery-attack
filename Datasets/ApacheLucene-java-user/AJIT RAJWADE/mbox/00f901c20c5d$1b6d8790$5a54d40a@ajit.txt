SUBJECT: Finding number of occurrences of a given word in a document using LUCENE
DATE: 5 Jun 2002

I am currently facing a difficulty...how do I find the number of occurrences of a particular
word in a certain document. Currently, I get some value called as score which is difficult
to interpret. I was told to use an interface called TermDocs...any more tips?

Thanks,
Ajit
