SUBJECT: Using synonyms with Lucene without WordPress
DATE: 24 May 2010

Does anyone know of any classes available that allow you to define and use your own synonyms
when searching with Lucene? I read some about WordPress but it seems those synonyms are predefined
English words. The application I am working with searches for the names of contacts and companies.
I would like for the user to be able to set "Dan" as a synonym for "Daniel" or "BOA" for "Bank
of America" ...etc
