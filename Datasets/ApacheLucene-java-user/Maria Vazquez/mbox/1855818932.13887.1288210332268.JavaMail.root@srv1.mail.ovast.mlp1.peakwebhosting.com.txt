SUBJECT: Text categorization / classification
DATE: 27 Oct 2010

I need to auto-categorize a large number of documents. They are basically news articles from
major news sources (nytimes, npr, abcnews, etc).
I'd like to categorize them automatically. Any suggestions?
Lucene in Action suggests using a set of documents to build category vectors and then comparing
each document to each of those vectors and get the closest one.
The approach seems pretty simple (from other papers I read on text categorization) but maybe
you guys know of something out there that already does this using Lucene/Solr.
Thanks!
Maria
