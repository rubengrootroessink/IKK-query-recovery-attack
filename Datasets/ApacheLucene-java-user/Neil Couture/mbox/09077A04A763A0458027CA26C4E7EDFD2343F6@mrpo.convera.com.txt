Subject: Any tools to detect language of document



I am attempting to come up with an automated way to
select which language analyzer to use on a document.

Anyone know of any algorithms available to detect
what language the document may be written in?

Are there any special Analyzers that attempt to support
multiple languages?


Thanks,
Randy
