SUBJECT: querying multiple fields
DATE: 22 Jun 2005

All,
Forgive me for the basic question. When you are querying multiple
fields using QueryParser, what is the exact code?

I tried QueryParser.parse(queryString, "SearchTerms", analyzer) where
queryString was "SearchTerms:visnu temple ImageExistsBit:1",
SearchTerms and ImageExistsBit being the two fields I want searched.
However it does not seem to do what I want it to do.

TIA,
George
