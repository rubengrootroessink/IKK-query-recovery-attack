SUBJECT: Compiling Lucene on PPC linux
DATE: 24 Jun 2004

Hello,

Has anyone had success compiling Lucene 1.3 on PowerPC linux (gentoo ppc-linux 
2.4.20)? I'm using the IBM VM 1.4.1 and Jikes 1.18.

The problem I'm getting is that Ant cannot execute the RMIC task, although 
I've checked the libraries in the IBM JDK (and set the JAVA_HOME environment 
variable) with jar and grep to determine that the classes are there. I've 
also tried using MiniRMI with no avail.

Can anyone point me in the right direction to get the RMIC task to work (or 
should I be bugging the Ant list instead)?

Thanks,
Brian Rowe
