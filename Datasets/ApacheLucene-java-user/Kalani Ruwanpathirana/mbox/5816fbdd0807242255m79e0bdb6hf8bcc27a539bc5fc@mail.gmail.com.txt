SUBJECT: Re: Ignoring XML tags when Indexing
DATE: 25 Jul 2008

Hi Marcelo,

Thanks for the reply. Yes I want to ignore all the tags and store the text
in one field. Previously used tags are not known and seems the "XMLAnalyzer"
is the
solution. Anyway I think Lucene itself does not support a XMLAnalyzer. Do I
have to do it manually?
