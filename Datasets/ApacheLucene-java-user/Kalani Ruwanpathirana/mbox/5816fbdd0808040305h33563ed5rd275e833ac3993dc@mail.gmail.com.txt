SUBJECT: escaping special characters
DATE: 4 Aug 2008

Hi,

I followed the following procedure to escape special characteres.

String escapedKeywords = QueryParser.escape(keywords);
Query query = new QueryParser("content", new
StandardAnalyzer()).parse(escapedKeywords);

this works with most of the special characters like * and ~ except \ . I
can't do a search for a keyword like "ho\w" and get results.
am I doing anything wrong here.


Thanks,
Kalani
