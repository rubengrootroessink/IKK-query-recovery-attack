SUBJECT: Ignoring XML tags when Indexing
DATE: 24 Jul 2008

Hi all,

I am searching for a way to ignore XML tags in the input when indexing. Is
there a built in functionality in Lucene to get this done?
I am sorry if this was discussed before. I searched but couldn't find a
clear solution.

Thanks in advance
Kalani
