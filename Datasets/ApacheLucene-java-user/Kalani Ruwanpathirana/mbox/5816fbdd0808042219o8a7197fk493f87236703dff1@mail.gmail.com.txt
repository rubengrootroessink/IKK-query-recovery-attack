SUBJECT: Re: Lucene excluding 'not' from search terms
DATE: 5 Aug 2008

Hi,

I guess it is with your analyzer.  What is the analyzer you are using? If it
is StandardAnalyzer it drops words like "a", "the", etc. You can use the
SimpleAnalyzer
and check.

(I am not very sure because I am also new to Lucene :)
