SUBJECT: Optimizing for long queries?
DATE: 25 Jun 2004

Apologies if this is a FAQ, but I didn't have much luck searching the
list archives for answers on this subject:

I'm using Lucene in a context where we have frequently have queries
that search for as many as 30-50 terms in a single field. Does anyone
have any thoughts concerning ways optimize Lucene for queries of these
lengths?
