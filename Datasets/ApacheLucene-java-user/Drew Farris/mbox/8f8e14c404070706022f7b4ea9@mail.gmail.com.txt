Julien,

Thanks for the advice, and the in-depth exploration of INDEX_INTERVAL
here and on the developer's list. If I have the opportunity to run
similar benchmarks comparing both modified INDEX_INTERVALS and sorted
queries,  I'll share the results as well.

You mentioned that you were using queries from query logs for your
application. Do you have a general idea of the average query length of
these queries?

Drew.
