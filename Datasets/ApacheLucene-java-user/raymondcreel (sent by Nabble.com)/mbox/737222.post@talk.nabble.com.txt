SUBJECT: custom sort
DATE: 29 Aug 2005


Is it possible to write a custom sort for a query such that the first N documents that match
a certain additional criteria get pushed to the top of the sort?  For instance say you sort
your query based on field A, but you want to tweak the results such that the first 10 documents
in the result set which have field B = some criteria will appear at the beginning of the resulting
hits collection?   

thanks much,
raymond
