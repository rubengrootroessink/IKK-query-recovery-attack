Hi,

I want to access Lucene index with SRW Web Service and the SRU. I know
that Online Computer Library Center has one implementation:
http://www.oclc.org/research/announcements/2003-11-07b.htm
But it is kind of limited to DSpace digital repository system (I will
check more about that).

Could you please advise about other implementations if any?

Thanks,
Serhiy
