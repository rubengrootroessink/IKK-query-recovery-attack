SUBJECT: DB to Lucene parsers
DATE: 13 Oct 2006

Hi,

I need to index a database with Lucene. Can you suggest where to start
looking for the DB to Lucene parsers? I will need to parse data from
MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle and several other databases. Structure of data
is pretty simple - almost flat tables. I know I can do DB -> XML ->
Lucene but may be there are other solutions?

Thanks,
Serhiy
