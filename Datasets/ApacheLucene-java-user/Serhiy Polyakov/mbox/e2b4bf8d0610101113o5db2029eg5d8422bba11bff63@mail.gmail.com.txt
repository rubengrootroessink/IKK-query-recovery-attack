SUBJECT: Lucene in Action examples complie problem
DATE: 10 Oct 2006

Hi,

I started to study Lucene following the book Lucene in Action.

I am trying to compile book examples downloaded from the book site:
http://www.manning.com/hatcher2/

When I am trying to compile first example (Indexer.java) it gives me
the following error:

LuceneInAction\src\lia\meetlucene\Indexer.java:80: cannot find symbol
symbol  : method Text(java.lang.String,java.io.FileReader)
location: class org.apache.lucene.document.Field
    doc.add(Field.Text("contents", new FileReader(f)));

I know that file lucene-core-2.0.0.jar is in CLASSPATH and other classes like
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter are working OK. The only class I
am having problem with is org.apache.lucene.document.Field;

Can you suggest something?

Thanks,
Serhiy
