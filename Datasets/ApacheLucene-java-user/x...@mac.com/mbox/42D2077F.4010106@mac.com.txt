SUBJECT: BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses
DATE: 11 Jul 2005

Did a google serach on the problem when using the range search phrase of 
  "+datefield:[199801 TO 200512]" (date stored as "YYYYMMDD") which 
returns 1 million hits.

error: org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses

Adding "-Dorg.apache.lucene.maxClauseCount=2400" to java option allowed 
the search query to run without error. The actual value needed is 
between 2300 and 2400. At 2300 the query fails.

My question is how does Lucene perform range query?  As a bunch of 
smaller boolean queries? How does one estimate the number of clauses 
required for a general query and more specifically on a range query?

Thanks.
