If Microsoft Search does as you describe. Isn't it just:

1) Open file
2) Determine file type
3) Convert file content to UTF8, if text based, and you have the API to 
read it. .html, .txt., .doc, .excel, etc.
4) Perform string search, regex.
5) Continue to next file

As far as I know, Lucene is not designed for unindexed search.
