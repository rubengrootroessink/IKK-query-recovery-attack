SUBJECT: Problem with multiple values to a single field.
DATE: 9 Jul 2005

I need to index multiple values to a single document field, such as 
category. An entry can be associated with 2 or more categories. When the 
search is performed, the user can opt to select result from documents 
containing only one category value. What would be the best way to go 
about this?

Does lucene allow me to use the doc.add() method twice for the same 
field and store two different values?

Thanks a bunch.
