Chris,

If I understand your question correctly, you are saying why is the the 
search output of lucene not returning the two lines as distinct two lines?

If you are returning the lucene search output to the web and want the 
new line \n to be dispalyed as such, you need to replace the character 
with [br] tags.

To lucene, the new line is likely used as part of the tokenizer to 
distinguish words/tokens for the index but it does not do anything 
special with it is stored or displayed. However, depending on your 
lucene client/app, you might need to tweak the client output to display 
the 2 lines separately.

I think that is your question.
