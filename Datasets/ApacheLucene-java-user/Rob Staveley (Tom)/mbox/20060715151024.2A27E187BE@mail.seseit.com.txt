Incidentally, Yonik, is the logic for
org.apache.solr.search.Sorting#getStringSortField flawed? I don't see how
the same comparator can be used for forward and reverse sorts for the
non-null values. 

Methinks it is broken for reverse sorts where you specify nulls to appear
first.

I added this test to TestMissingStringLastComparatorSource.java from
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-406, which confirms my
suspicions ...or confirms that I'd never get a job in QA:

--------8<--------
public void testSortingReverseNullFirst() throws Exception {

	Hits result;

	boolean reverse = true;
	boolean nullLast = false;
	boolean nullFirst = true;

	Sort order = new Sort(Sorting.getStringSortField("data", reverse,
nullLast, nullFirst));

	result = s.search(ALL, order);

	assertEquals("didn't get all", data.length, result.length());

	assertEquals("wrong order 2", "0", result.doc(2).get("id"));
	assertEquals("wrong order 3", "3", result.doc(3).get("id"));
	assertEquals("wrong order 4", "6", result.doc(4).get("id"));
	assertEquals("wrong order 5", "7", result.doc(5).get("id"));
	assertEquals("wrong order 6", "4", result.doc(6).get("id"));
	assertEquals("wrong order 7", "1", result.doc(7).get("id"));
}

The problem with int is that the FieldCache stores the values as an int[],
and you can't tell when a value is missing.

String sorting takes more memory, but the speed is the same.  Local sorting
with the FieldCache for strings is done via the ordinal value (no string
compare is done, just int comparisons).
