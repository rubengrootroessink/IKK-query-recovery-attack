You'll not be indexing headers or the From field specially if you simply
throw the text at the indexer. You'll not even be separating out separate
e-mail messages. You certainly need to be able to separate out e-mail
messages, to treat messages as separate documents. You'll also probably want
to MIME-decode to index attachments etc. Also you may want to unzip etc. If
you want to do this yourself, you should start by getting the Lucene In
Action book and look at the content handlers for different file types etc
etc, but reading the book will probably take a chunk out of your "couple of
days". That's why taking Tropo off the shelf is probably your best route,
assuming that Tropo's analysis is adequate for your needs, handling all of
your attachment requirements. 

Disclaimer: I'm not familiar with Tropo.

OK, we're well off topic now. If you have follow up on this can I recommend
that you don't do this via java-user@lucene.apache.org. 

You'll see from http://www.mozilla.org/support/thunderbird/faq#q2.10 that
Thunderbird stores its mail in mbox format. If you use Dovecot for your imap
server, you'll be able to use the mbox file directly. Just copy the file
over. mbox is very easy to work with. You'll have seen from looking at it
with your text editor that  there are "From lines" followed by raw RFC 822
data. You can append one mbox file to another very simply.

The mail archives and saved mail folders can be opened up and read as a text
file using textpad or wordpad. Will it be possible to index them as it is?
The mail client is Thunderbird Mailbox.

If I have to use third party software is there anything you can suggest?
