I had a similar requirement and it look me several weeks to get something
working. I think you'll need to make use of as much off the shelf software
as you can, given your timescale.

If you don't want to get your hands dirty with Lucene and like Tropo, why
not convert your local storage to mbox/maildir/mbx if it is not already in
the appropriate format and light up imapd while you index? e.g. If your
local format is PST (i.e. Outlook), take a look at

Subject: Indexing existing email archives

I was looking at "http://www.tropo.com/techno/java/lucene/imap.html" and my
understanding is it is used to retrieve and index the emails that is on the
email server. I have some stored emails in folders in my local disk and huge
list of email archives in another system. Is there a way I could index them?

I have to have this working in next couple of days. Any help and suggestions
are appreciated.

thanks,
suba suresh.
