Luke is working nicely with a XWin32 demo server, I just downloaded from
StarNet, with a bit of SSH tunnelling :-)  [I couldn't immediately figure
out how to do it with Cygwin/X.]

However, I can't see how Luke is going to show me what's occupying most of
my index.

Or you can use ssh -X for X11 forwarding. I don't know how it's working in
windows (some x client app) but great on linux(es) with huge bandwidth.
