Incidentally, I'm getting BooleanQuery.TooManyClauses when I search on
"james", but I don't when I search on "James". Surely  the number of clauses
isn't dependent on the number of hits?! 

However, I know that "fred" is relatively uncommon in my index and "neil" is
relatively common and yet "fred" is getting the BooleanQuery.TooManyClauses
and "neil" isn't. Does that make sense? 

Should the actual term used in a PrefixQuery effect the number of clauses?

I'm still trying to get my head around ConstantScorePrefixQuery. Could I
simply use this as a drop-in replacement for PrefixQuery?

: Did not check it, but solr is using SkippingFilter which is not yet
: commited in Lucene... so this will maybe not work?

Solr des not use SkippingFilter.
