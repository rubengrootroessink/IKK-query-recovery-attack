I'm attempting to delete documents matching a term on a ParallelReader and
got the error message above, presumably while adding directories to the
ParallelReader. 

I'm puzzled, because I don't need to have the same maxDoc (and numDoc) in
index directories for a ParallelMultiSearcher, so what's the deal here?
Should I delete serially... one index at a time?
