I'm trying to reduce the memory requirement of my application that has ~40
indexed fields. Would I be wasting my time omitting norms in this
application?

What would I lose by omitting norms? The ability to boost individual fields
as they are added to the index? Anything else?

[I want to check that I can get away without knowing about norms :-)]

Norms are per indexed-field.  For every document it's the product of the
lengthNorm and the index-time boost.  It's really more of an implementation
detail that you shouldn't need to know about unless you have a lot of
indexed fields and want to omit them for memory reasons.

See DefaultSimilarity javadoc for lengthNorm... it's what makes hits on
shorter fields score higher.
