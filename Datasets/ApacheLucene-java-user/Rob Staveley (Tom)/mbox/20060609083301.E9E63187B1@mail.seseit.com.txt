: Whom should I post to suggest adding a note to
:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html
: #Field(java.lang.String,%20java.io.Reader) to say that the Reader is only
: actually read from when the document is added? Without internal knowledge,

Documentation improvemnets are handled like any other code improvement --
just open a Jira issue and attach a patch.

(allthough i'm guessing a true patch isn't all that neccessary -- just be
explicitly about the method you think has bad javadocs, and include what you
think the text should be)
