This is a real eye-opener, Volodymyr. Many thanks. I guess that means that
my orphan-producing hangs must be addDocument() calls, and not in the
content handlers, as I'd previously assumed. I'll put some debug before and
after my addDocument() calls to confirm (and point my writer's infoStream to
System.out).

Hi.
My five cents :)

It might be helpful to know how lucene is working with compound files. 
When segment is flushed to disk it is written uncompound and after that is
merged into single .cfs file. If you don't change default setting for using
compound files (which is on) this is only place (I guess) for these files to
appear.

If you're working with large indexes, than merging segments can take a while
(Maybe here is your problem? :) ) (merging happens on
addDocument() call).  If you will kill indexing process during such merge
you'll get many orphaned files...

You can just run optimize on this index. You'll get three files: 
segments, deletable, <segment>.cfs; you can look name of segment in
'segments' file. Everything else is 'garbage' - you can delete it.
