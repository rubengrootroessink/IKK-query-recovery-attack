That's a really good idea, but I've got a total of 38 fields only. It is
true that some of them are empty, but that can't account for the bulk.

are you by any chance using different field names for each document -- or do
you have a wide range of field names that aren't the same for each document?
... you mentioned indexing emails, email has a very loose header structure
that allows MTAs to add arbitrary "X" headers, are you converting every
header to an indexed field?

the reason i ask is that anytime you have an indexed field with and you
don't OMIT_NORMS when you add the field, lucene allocates one byte per
document for that field to store the norm value -- even most of those
documents don't have that field.

if you've got ~25,000 documents in your index, and you add a new document
with an indexed field no other document has, then you'll see at least a 25K
increase in index size because of those norms.

(OMIT_NORMS is your friend).
