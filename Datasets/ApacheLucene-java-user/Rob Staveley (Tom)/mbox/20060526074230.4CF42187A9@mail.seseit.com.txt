SUBJECT: Seeing what's occupying all the space in the index
DATE: 26 May 2006

I am indexing e-mail in a compound index and for e-mail which is stored in
~60G (in Bzip2 compressed form), I have an index which is now 80G.

Is there a tool I can use to see how much of the index is occupied by the
different fields I am indexing?

PS: I am a newbie to the mailing list - I hope I've got the etiquette right
