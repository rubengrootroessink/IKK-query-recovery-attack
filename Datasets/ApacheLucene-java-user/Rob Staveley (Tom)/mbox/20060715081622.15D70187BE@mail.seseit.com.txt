:-) You're right! It remains the case that INT and FLOAT equivalents of
MissingStringLastComparatorSource would be useful for the reverse reverse
(i.e. not reverse) case :-)

: I was wanting to apply this to a field, which sorts on INT. Specifically
I'm
: trying to achieve reverse chronological sorting on a timestamp field,
which
: stores YYMMDDHHI (i.e. resolves to 10 minutes and doesn't handle
centuries).
: Missing timestamps are assumed to be "old" (i.e. should appear at the
end).

for the record, MissingStringLastComparatorSource isn't really needed in
this case.  If a missing timestamp field should be interpreted as "old"
then normal Lucene "reverse" sorting (either String or int) should work fine
for a reverse chronological sort -- because in normal String sorting "null"
is low, and (i'm 99% sure)  in int sorting "null" is assigned a value of 0.
In both cases, your "old"  docs will wind up where you want them.

MissingStringLastComparatorSource comes in handy when you want docs without
a timestamp value to appear at the end of your list *regardless* of wether
the user selected "oldest first" or "newest first"
