Indexing 55648 documents in a new clean directory, I see only .cfs files (+
deletable  + segments). Disk usage is 65K for all of these, which means that
each message takes ~1K of index space rather than > 10K as it does in my
99GB index.

Bearing in mind that the large index has > 5 million Lucene documents
indexed in it now, do you reckon I can merge the .fdt, .prx and .frq into a
compound index?
