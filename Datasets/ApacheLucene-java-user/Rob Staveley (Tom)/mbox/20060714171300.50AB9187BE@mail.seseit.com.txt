Chris Hostetter and Yonik's MissingStringLastComparator looks like a neat
way to specify where to put null values when you want them to appear at the
end of reverse sorts rather than at the beginning, but I spotted the note...

    // Note: basing lastStringValue on the StringIndex won't work
    // with a multisearcher.

Is that a show-stopper for MultiSearchers, or does it just mean that it is a
bit less efficient?
