DATE: 21 Dec 2006

I've found that merging a 20G directory into another 20G directory on
another disk required the target disk to have > 50G available during the
merge. I ran out of space on my ~70G disk for the merge and had to do it on
another system with ~170G available, but I'm not sure how much was used
transiently for the merge. The whole process took a long time, so I've done
limited experimenting.

[Incidentally, the two directories resulted in a 24G after merging.]

Subject: Merge Index Filling up Disk Space

Hi All,

I am using lucene 1.9.1 for search functionality in my j2ee application
using JBoss as app server. The lucene index directory size is almost 20G
right now. There is a Quartz job that is adding data to the index evey min
and around 20000 documents get added to the index every day.When the
documents are added and the segments are merged, the index size increases
and sometimes grows to more than double its original size. 
This results in filling up the disk space. We have allotted a f/s size of
50G and even that is not sufficient at times. Is there an optimum vales for
the f/s size to be allotted in such scenario.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
 
Thanks,
Harini
