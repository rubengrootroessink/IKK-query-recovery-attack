SUBJECT: Avoiding java.lang.OutOfMemoryError in an unstored field
DATE: 6 Jun 2006

Sometimes I need to index large documents. I've got just about as much heap
as my application is allowed (-Xmx512m) and I'm using the unstored
org.apache.lucene.document.Field constructed with a java.io.Reader, but I'm
still suffering from java.lang.OutOfMemoryError when I index some large
documents. Are org.apache.lucene.document.Field and
org.apache.lucene.document.Document always loaded entirely in memory?
