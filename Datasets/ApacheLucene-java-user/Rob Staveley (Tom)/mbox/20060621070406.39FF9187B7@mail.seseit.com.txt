I found that CyberNeko left style and script in the text and JTidy produced
better output, but both of them use DOM and were therefore subject to
OutOfMemory errors (JTidy being worse than CyberNeko). I've since then moved
over to TagSoup, which I needed to customise to strip style script (a simple
tweak), but "kept on trucking" with any size document.

John,

I also wrote about using NekoHTML, I think.  I prefer that to JTidy.  That
also tells you what Simpy.com uses.

Can someone please suggest a HTML text extraction library? In the Lucene
book, it recommends Tidy. Seems jtidy is not really being maintained.

Otis, what do you guys use at Simpy?

Thanks
