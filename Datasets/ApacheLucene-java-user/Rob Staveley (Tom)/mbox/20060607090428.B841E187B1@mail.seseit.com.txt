> (1)... threaddump

It hadn't occurred to me that I'd be able to do that, Chris. It took me a
little while to figure out how, because I'm running the application as a
daemon (i.e. using nohup, teeing standard output to a log file and
redirecting stdout and stderr to /dev/null), which counts out Ctrl+'\'.
SIGQUIT wasn't playing ball for me, and then I discovered
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/share/jstack.html which seems
to be what's needed for Sun 1.5 + Linux. 

However, I'm not sure what to make of:

Does that mean that the PipedReader in the following might persist beyond
the scope of this code, and be read from only when the Lucene document is
added to the index?

--------8<--------
	final PipedWriter pw = new PipedWriter();
	Thread t = new Thread() {
		public void run() {
			try {
				// Index the body text in the Lucene
document, 
				// but do not store it
				doc.add(
					new Field(
						"body"
						,new PipedReader(pw)
					)
				);
			}
			catch (IOException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
	};
	t.start();

	// Process an input stream for the content handler.
	// Tokens extracted from the stream are written to
	// the piped writer and hence made available to the
	// PipedReader used in the "body" field constructor.
	process(is,pw);	

	// Close the output stream to get the PipedReader to see EOF
	pw.close();

	// Join the thread to wait for the field to be added to the
	// document
	t.join();

	// Now go on to add other fields (metadata), and then add
	// the document to the index...

1) have you tried forcing a threaddump of the JVM when it hangs to see what
it's doing?  (i don't remember which signal it is off the top of my head,
but even if it's not responding to SIGTERM it might respond to that)

: SIGTERM. I guess I'd feel more confident about using SIGKILL, if I knew
that
: the uninterruptible hanged thread was creating a Document, which I could
: interrupt without corrupting the index, rather than adding the document to
: the index, which is liable to result in orphaned files and/or a corrupted
: index, if killed.

2) It's possible that the thread is doing both (creating and adding) at the
same time ... if you are Constructing documents using Fields that contain
Readers you get back from convertors which stream data from complex
documents as needed, then DocumentWriter may have started to write your
document, gotten to a Field with a Reader, and then your convertor may be
choking on something within the source document while it tries to stream
data to that Reader.


	...just a theory.
