Dear all, especially Otis Gospodnetic (thanks for your answer),
without ( )'s the StopFilter is doing a good job indeed, but if I put them
around parts of the query, then the searchResult is wrong. 
For example:
(field1 : xxxxx) AND (field2 : stopword) AND (field 1 : yyyyy)
So I'm afraid my problem is not solved yet. But maybe someone can try it
with the ()'s with his own tool and tell me if they've got the same problem.
Then I know whether I made a mistake.
