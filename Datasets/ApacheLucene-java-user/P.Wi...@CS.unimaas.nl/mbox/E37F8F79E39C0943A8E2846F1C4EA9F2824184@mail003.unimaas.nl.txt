I built my own analyzer and I decided not to use a PorsterStemFilter. When I
index my documents, this works great (no PorterStemFiletring occurs). But
when I want to search and enter a query, the PorterStemFilter does filter. I
use the same Analyzer for indexing and searching. I have thrown the
PorterStemFilter out the Lucene jar-file, and without an error report my
program works fine(no PorterStemFiltering anymore).
I do not understand this. What about you?
Thanks, 
Puk Witte
