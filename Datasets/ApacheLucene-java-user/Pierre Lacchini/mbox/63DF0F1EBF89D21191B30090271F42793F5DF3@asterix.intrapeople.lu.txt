Well guys, here's my (silly) question :

I got 2 Fields in my Index, for example Title and Author...

If i want to perform a complex query like : search "Williams" in fields
"Author" AND "Sword" in fields "Title" WITHOUT "House" in the fields
"Title"....
I tried this synthax : "Author:Williams AND Title:Sword -House" But it
doesnt'seem to work...
Is it possible ? Or mb i'm wrong with the synthax ???

Thx for help ;)
