You can find Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian,
Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish Snowball
stemmers/analyzers at:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/lucene-sandbox/snowball/

Doug or Otis, why don't you move these out of the sandbox and make them
integral part of Lucene?

Heya all,

I'm looking for a full French Analyser, containing a
FrenchPorterStemmer... Does anyone know where i can find one ?

And if I wanna create my own FrenchAnalyser  - I have the STOP_WORDS
list - can I remove the standard PorterStemFilter ?

In fact, can I crete a new Analyser without PorterStemmer at all ?

Thx ;)
