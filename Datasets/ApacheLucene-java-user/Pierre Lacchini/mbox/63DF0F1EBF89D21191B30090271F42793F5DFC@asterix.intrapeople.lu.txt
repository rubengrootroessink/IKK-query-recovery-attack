SUBJECT: Full French Analyser ?
DATE: 19 Mar 2003

Heya all,

I'm looking for a full French Analyser, containing a FrenchPorterStemmer...
Does anyone know where i can find one ?

And if I wanna create my own FrenchAnalyser  - I have the STOP_WORDS list -
can I remove the standard PorterStemFilter ?

In fact, can I crete a new Analyser without PorterStemmer at all ?

Thx ;)
