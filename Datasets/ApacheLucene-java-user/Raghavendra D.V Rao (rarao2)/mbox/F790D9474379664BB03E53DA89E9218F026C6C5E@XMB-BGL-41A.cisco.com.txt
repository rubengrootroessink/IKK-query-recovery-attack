SUBJECT: Problem with "BooleanQuery.TooManyClauses"
DATE: 8 Dec 2010

Hi All,

 

We have a requirement where in we need to construct a BooleanQuery, with
the TermQueries, whose count is large , but that it is somewhat fixed
number.  It could be around a 5000 or 6000.

 

At present we are hitting the BooleanQuery.TooManyClauses exception, as
the  default count of max caluse is 1024.

 

I just wanted to know if there are any performance related impact
because of setting this to some high value, using
BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount();

 

Please help.

 

Details.

Lucene Version = 2.4.0

 

 

 

 

Regards,

Raghav
