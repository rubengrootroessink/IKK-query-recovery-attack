SUBJECT: Query across multiple fields scenario not handled by "MultiFieldQueryParser" (figured out how to do it)
DATE: 9 Jul 2003

Just a note to anyone interested, I figured out how to
solve to problem I posed last week by adding the
functionality needed to QueryParser.jj. It was a
pretty specialized request to begin with - but anyone
interested - I'll be glad to let them know how it
works.
