SUBJECT: Re: Word co-occurrences counts
DATE: 24 Dec 2004

Thanks Doug and all,

I'm intending to use Lucene to grab a lot of word co-occurance 
statistics out of a large corpus
to perform word disambiguation. Lucene's looking like a great option, 
but I appear to have hit
a snag. Here's my understanding:

1) Create a Similarity implementation, where:
        tf() returns freq
    sloppyFreq, idf, coord, return 1 (cause we only need to freq to score)
2) Perform the query
3) and then:
        word in document count = 
hits.score(k)/Similarity.decodeNorm(reader.norms("contents")[k])
4) A query call such as
        "computer dog"~50
    will return a count of 2 (I assume because the match occurs 
backwards and forwards).

My problem occurs when I have the following in a text file:
    computer ...(some words)... dog ...(some words)... computer
and I duplicate the text file several times over. Performing a the above 
query will return different
phrase counts per document?

Note: I'm just working with some modified demo code at the moment.

Thanks again,
Andrew
