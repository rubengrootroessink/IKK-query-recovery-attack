SUBJECT: Parsing Word Docs
DATE: 5 Mar 2003

I'm interested in using the textmining/textextraction utilities using Apache 
POI, that Ryan was discussing. However, I'm having some difficulty determining 
what the insertion point would be to replace the default parser with the word 
parser. 

Any assistance would be appreciated.
