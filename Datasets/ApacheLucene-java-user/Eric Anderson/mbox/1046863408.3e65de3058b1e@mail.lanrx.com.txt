Samuel-

I'm basically using the software in a similar fashion to how you are. However, 
something to remember, is that the documents that you're indexing need to be in 
a location that is published by your webserver. What I did, was use the tomcat 
connectors, and mount my document repository inside my tomcat webapps 
directory. That way, it will index the path by using the demo IndexHTML command 
from a child of webapps. Then, I created JkMounts for the children of the 
webapps directory.

I'm not a developer (to say the least), and it's probably a somewhat half-baked 
way around the problems, but, my instance works, and all indexed documents are 
available via the links displayed on the results page.
