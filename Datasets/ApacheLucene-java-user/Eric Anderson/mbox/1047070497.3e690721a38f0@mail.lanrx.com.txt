Samuel-

A couple days ago, I posted the basic method that I used to perform that task.

Mount your documents as a subdirectory of your webapps directory in Lucene, and 
then you can use a tomcat connector to redirect the appropriate urls to your 
tomcat instance, where they will be served.

Works for me. I have a repository of PDF's, and HTML that I can index, search, 
and serve.
