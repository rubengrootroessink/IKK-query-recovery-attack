SUBJECT: results URLs

I'm attempting to use Lucene as a document management solution, and have the 
majority of the solution working, I believe. The biggest problem that I'm still 
facing, is that I'm unable to get the results URL's to work successfully. I'm 
sure that I'm missing something simple, but I have been unable to get this 
component to work as of yet.

Any suggestions?

Thanks for your assistance!
