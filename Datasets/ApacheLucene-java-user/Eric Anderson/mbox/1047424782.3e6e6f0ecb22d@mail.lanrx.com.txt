What platform are you running on? 

The tomcat webapp will look in /opt/lucene/index by default, for the index to 
use with the webapp. If you're running the system on linux/unix, create the 
directory /opt/lucene/index and when you run your index (java 
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index /opt/lucene/index ..) you 
should see it claim to be adding files.

If you do, in fact, see this output, then check to make sure that you either 
modify the configuration of the webapp to point to the appropriate index 
location, or change the location of your index to match where the webapp will 
look for it.
