That was more directed toward if you had it running on unix, but you may still 
need to make sure that it's available. Check your NTFS permissions, and see if 
the user that you're running tomcat as has the ability to read your index files.

The other thing (and more likely to be your issue), is that by default, the 
webapp looks in a location called /opt/lucene/index for the index. Because 
you're on a windows platform, you're obviously not going to have the index in 
that location. Look at the configuration files in lucene, and define your index 
as the c:\lucene-index
