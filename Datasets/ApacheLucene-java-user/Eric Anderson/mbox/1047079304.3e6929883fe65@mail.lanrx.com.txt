Best install reference I found was the one out on the Lucene site.

Is your index being written successfully? If you're able to use the command 
based stuff, it's likely that it is. When you create your index, do you define 
that the index will exist at /opt/lucene/index, or modify the luceneweb 
application to look for your index?

Make sure that it's readable by tomcat.

Hopefully that helps...
