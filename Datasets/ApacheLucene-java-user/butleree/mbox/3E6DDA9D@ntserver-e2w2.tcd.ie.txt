Hi,

Thanks for this, it worked and I found the IndexFiles.class

However when I run "java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles" 
{full-path-to-lucene}/src - it doesn't find the Indexfiles.class as it is in

C:\lucene\lucene-1.2-src\bin\demo\classes\org\apache\lucene\demo

I run the command from c:\lucene\lucene-1.2-src, if I change and run it from

C:\lucene\lucene-1.2-src\bin\demo\classes, I just get errors like class 
Analyzer not found.

What am I doing wrong??

My classpath is set up like this SET CLASSPATH = 
c:\lucene\lucene-1.2-src\bin\lucene-1.2.jar; 
c:\lucene\lucene-1.2-src\bin\demo\lucene-demos-1.2.jar

Help!!

Emma
