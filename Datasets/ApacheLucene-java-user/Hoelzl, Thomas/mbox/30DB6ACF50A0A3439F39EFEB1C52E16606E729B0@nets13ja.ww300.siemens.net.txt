SUBJECT: lucene can't find segments file
DATE: 17 Apr 2008

Hi all!
 
I have some problems running my lucene application on linux (suse).
 
lucene can't find segments file. is the errormessage I get in the
browser.
 
I don't understand why it is trying to find a "segments" file. My
index-dir doesn't contain that particular file. 
 
It contains the following files.
 
master:/home/thomas/keywordsearch/etc # ls
/usr/local/jboss-3.2.7/server/default/conf/index/

  ..  _2.cfs  segments.gen  segments_9

 
I have checked the index using luke and it is good. In addition it works
on Windows.
 
Can anybody tell me why it is searching for a file called "segments"?
Where is my mistake?
 
 
The indexName points to /usr/local/jboss-3.2.7/server/default/conf/index
 
code where the exception is thrown:
 
 
...
 
 try {
          searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexName);      //create an
indexSearcher for our page
                                                        //NOTE: this
operation is slow for large
                                                        //indices (much
slower than the search itself)
                                                        //so you might
want to keep an IndexSearcher
                                                        //open
 
        } catch (Exception e) {                         //any error that
happens is probably due
                                                        //to a
permission problem or non-existant
                                                        //or otherwise
corrupt index
        StackTraceElement[] es = e.getStackTrace();
                String s = "";
                for (int i = 0; i<es.length; i++)
 
s+=((StackTraceElement)es[i]).getClassName()+"+++"+((StackTraceElement)e
s[i]).getMethodName()+"\r\n";
 
%>
                <p>ERROR opening the Index - contact sysadmin!</p>
                <p><%=escapeHTML(indexLocation)%></p>
                <p>Error message: <%=escapeHTML(e.getMessage())%></p>
                <p>Error message: <%=escapeHTML(s)%></p>
<%                error = true;                                  //don't
do anything up to the footer
        }

Thanks for all help
