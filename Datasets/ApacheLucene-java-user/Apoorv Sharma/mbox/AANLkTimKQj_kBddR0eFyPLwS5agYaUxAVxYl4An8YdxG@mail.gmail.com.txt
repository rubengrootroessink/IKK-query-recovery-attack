SUBJECT: Document Order in IndexWriter.addIndexes
DATE: 30 Jun 2010

while calling addindexes or addindexes with no optimize can any gurantee be
given about the document order in the new documents given that the order of
directories/indexreader is fixed.

So is it that ith document coming from jth indexreader will always have some
x(i,j) position in the final merged index ?
