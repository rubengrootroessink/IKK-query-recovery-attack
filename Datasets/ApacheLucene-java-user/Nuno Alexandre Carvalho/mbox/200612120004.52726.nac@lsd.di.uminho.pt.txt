SUBJECT: dump/backup fs index catalog without stop it
DATE: 12 Dec 2006

Hi,

I have one java service that uses lucene as it's text search engine. This is 
working perfectly, but I don't know how to dump/backup it's filesystem index 
catalog.
Can I simply do a hot copy, without stoping the service and with index open?

Thanks in advance.
