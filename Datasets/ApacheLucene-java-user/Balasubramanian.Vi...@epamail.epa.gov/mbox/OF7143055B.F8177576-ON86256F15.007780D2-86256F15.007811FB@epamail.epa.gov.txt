SUBJECT: Highlighting PDF file after the search
DATE: 20 Sep 2004





Hello,

I can successfully index and search the PDF documents, however i am not
able to highlight the searched text in my original PDF file (ie: like
dtSearch
highlights on original file)

I took a look at the highlighter in sandbox, compiled it and have it
ready.  I am wondering if this highlighter is for highlighting indexed
documents or
can it be used for PDF Files as is !  Please enlighten !

Thanks,

Vijay Balasubramanian
