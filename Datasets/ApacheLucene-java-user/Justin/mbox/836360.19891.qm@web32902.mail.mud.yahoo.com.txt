So I learned that IndexReader objects must be closed immediately following a reopen.  But what
is the guidance after using IndexWriter.getReader()?  Does one reader need closed before getting
and using another, or can one use 2 or more readers simultaneously?  I don't see any guidance
at the following references, although there is mention that reopen() will forward back to
getReader().

Out of curiosity, I downloaded 2.4.1 and made the necessary source code modifications (attached).
 There used to be some sort of file descriptor cleanup.  With the explicit close, the descriptor
count stayed under 100.  Without the explicit close, the count hit peaks around 3000 by the
time 50,000 documents are added (still under our increased limit).  Hopefully our problems
didn't extend past leaking file descriptors by omitting the explicit close.

We must have been getting lucky.  Thanks Mark and Uwe!

That was always the same with reopen(). Its documented in the javadocs, with a short example:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_1/api/all/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#reopen()

also in 2.4.1:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#reopen()
