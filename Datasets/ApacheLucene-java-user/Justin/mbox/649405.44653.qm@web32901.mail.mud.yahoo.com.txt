SUBJECT: Problems with homebrew ParallelWriter
DATE: 23 Jun 2010

Hi all,

We've been waiting for LUCENE-1879 and LUCENE-2425 and have written our own ParallelWriter
class in the meantime.  Apparently our indexes are falling out of sync (I suspect my colleague
is seeing error messages come from ParallelReader stating the the number of documents must
be the same).

Here's a code snippet from our ParallelWriter which extends Object:

    writer1 = new IndexWriter(dir, analyzer, 
create,
      
new IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength(MFL));
    
writer1.setMergePolicy(new LogDocMergePolicy());
    
writer1.setMergeScheduler(new SerialMergeScheduler());
    
writer1.setMaxBufferedDocs(MBD);
    
writer1.setRAMBufferSizeMB(IndexWriter.DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH);

My colleague suspects that merging or flushing is being triggered on something other than
the doc count which leads to the writers' different behaviors.  I suspect our next step is
to scatter breakpoints around Lucene source (we've got trunk@926791 to take advantage of latest
NRT readers).

Does anyone have ideas on how the indexes would get out of sync?  Process close, committing,
optimizing,... they all should work okay?

Thanks,
Justin
