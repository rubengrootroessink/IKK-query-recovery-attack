SUBJECT: Updating documents with fields that aren't stored
DATE: 4 Oct 2010

Hi all,

The JavaDocs do not appear to mention that only stored fields persist 
IndexWriter.updateDocument. When opening new readers, from either 
IndexWriter.getReader or IndexReader.open, neither TermDocs nor IndexSearcher 
will find terms in fields which weren't stored.

Existing readers, however, do continue to find such terms after updateDocument 
has been called. At best, this is confusing. Is this a defect?

Thanks,
Justin
