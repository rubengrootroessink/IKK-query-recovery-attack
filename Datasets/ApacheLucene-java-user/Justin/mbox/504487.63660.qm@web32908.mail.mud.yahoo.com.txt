SUBJECT: Options for multiple filters
DATE: 3 Nov 2010

Is there a behavioral difference between:
    Query query = new FilteredQuery(query, filter1);
    searcher.search(query, filter2, n);

...and:
    ChainedFilter filter = new ChainedFilter(
        new Filter[]{filter1, filter2}, ChainedFilter.AND);
    searcher.search(query, filter, n);


I chose the former after reading performance measurements here:
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/FilteringOptions

But I'm definitely getting different results.

I also see that BooleanFilter has been added since our chosen version. Is that 
preferred to the above? Is it worthwhile to update the wiki?

Thanks for any help!
Justin
