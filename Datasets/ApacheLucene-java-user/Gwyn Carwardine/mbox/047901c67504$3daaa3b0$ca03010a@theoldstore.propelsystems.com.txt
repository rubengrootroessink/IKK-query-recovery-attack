Hi Erik. I'm sorry if I posted in the wrong place. I get very confused!

However dotLucene and the Highlighter are both distributed under the apache
version 2.0 licence (that's what it says in the licence.txt file that they
come with)

So if anyone on here understands the requirement of this Apache v2.0
licensing then I guess it may be an appropriate place to try and get an
answer after all?

Cheers, Gwyn

Gwyn,

You're asking in the wrong forum.  dotLucene is not an Apache hosted  
project.  Lucene.Net (which is no longer based on anything but Java  
Lucene) is now in incubation here, but is not dotLucene.   You need  
to check with the license of the version of dotLucene you're using.

	Erik
