I'm using the .net port of highlighter (1.5) and I notice it doesn't
highlight range or prefix queries.. Is this consistent with the java
version? Only I note my standard reference of www.lucenebook.com seems to
support highlighting.. is this using that same highlighter version (couldn't
find any verison info on the lucene apache site)

TIA

-Gwyn
