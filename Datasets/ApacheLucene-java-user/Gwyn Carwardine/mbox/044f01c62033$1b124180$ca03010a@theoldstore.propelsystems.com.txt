SUBJECT: Range queries
DATE: 23 Jan 2006

Two queries about ranges:

1. field:[a TO z] does not return the same as field:[z TO a] 

I think it should. The standard QueryParser or even the range query should
ascertain the lowest and highest and switch them around if necessary

2. How do I search for negative numbers in a range. For example field:[-3 TO
2] ?

I don't mind hacking code such that my numbers are indexed as +00000001 and
-00000001 and then I can override the query parser to change my query to
[-0000003 TO +0000002]. However.. "+" is less then "-" in Ascii terms so a
range search isn't going to work terrifically well.. Is there a standard
approach??
