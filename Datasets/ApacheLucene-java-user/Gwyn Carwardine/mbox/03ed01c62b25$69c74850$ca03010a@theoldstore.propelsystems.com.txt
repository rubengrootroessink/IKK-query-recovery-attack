The good bit about Bayesian is that it continuously learns.

The downside is that you have to teach it.

Not quite as simple as a list of rude words. 

There's an open source Bayesian mail filter called spambayes
(http://spambayes.sourceforge.net) which may lead you to interesting places.

The site will have million+ posts. I am not familiar with Bayesian
algorithms. Is there an off the shelf API that can provide this type of
capability. As for performance would Bayesian be the way to go over Lucene?

Thanks for the help,
Jeff

Hi, what scale is this website? millions of posts or under?

wouldn't it be easiler to use a bayesian algorithm to scan each new post 
before it is posted to detect whether it is acceptable or not? just a quick 
idea of my head
