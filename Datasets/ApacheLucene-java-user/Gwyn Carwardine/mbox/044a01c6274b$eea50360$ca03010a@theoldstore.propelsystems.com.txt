SUBJECT: Indexing and searching and item with attachments
DATE: 1 Feb 2006


I want to be able to store items and attachments such that they are treated
as a single document.

On the other hand I want to be able to store them separately; there is not
point in reindexing an attachment if I've simply changed the description.

Here's an example: A system used to track job candidates and their CVs.

A database keeps the core stuff, such as name, address, next availability,
salary expectation, record of conversations etc. The candidates CV(s) are
stored separately in the file system.

In this example I want to enable full text searching. I want to be able to
specify a query of "salary:[20000 TO 30000] c#". In this case "salary" will
have been taken from the database and the "c#" I would expect to be found in
the CV.

If I store the items and attachments as separate documents then Lucene will
probably return me nothing. I need to effectively store them together, but
on the other hand I don't want to have to keep reindexing attachments that
haven't changed.

Is there a standard method for dealing with this?
