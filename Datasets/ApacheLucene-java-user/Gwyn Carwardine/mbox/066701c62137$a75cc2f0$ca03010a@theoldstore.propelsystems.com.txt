Yes I think you're right. On reading the "lucene in action" chapted on
highlighting I found it squirreled in the middle of the text. I get the
feeling that whilst I have so far found query parser to be the primary
method of building queries that this is not ht eprimary method used by other
people. Otherwise I would have expected to see the first example in the book
use query parser. So what I'm not quite sure is how come the norm is using
the direct queries.

it helped, thanks

I've never used .net port of Lucene and highlighter,
but I believe we have to call Query.rewrite()
to expand the query expression when using
phrasequery, wildcardquery, regexquery and fuzzyquery,
then pass it to highlighter.

hope this helps,

Koji
