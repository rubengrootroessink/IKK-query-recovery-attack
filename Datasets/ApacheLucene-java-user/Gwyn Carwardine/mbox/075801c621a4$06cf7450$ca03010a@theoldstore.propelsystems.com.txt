Hi Erik, from my point of view Highlighter and QueryParser ARE related when
talking about the process of highlighting. If you've generated your Query
through the use of QueryParser then you really must call the Query.Rewrite
before you pass the query to the scorer which goes on to the highlighter.

When I said the first example what I meant was the first example in section
8.7 "Highlighting query terms". It looks like a very simple example but for
me it was not a realistic example. When I see these things I want to cut and
paste and use as a starting point but in this case it didn't do what I
expected and I ended up confused..

Please take my comments as constructive feedback solely from my perspective.
Please do not take it as criticism of your excellent book!
