What is the difference between these three modes of operating with
lucene... And are there any other modes/ways of operation also, using
which we can more effectively run applications with lucene.
I have heard there is also something called 'Memory' in contrib
directory of lucene source package which can also be used.

Can you please let me know how these are different from each other/how
do each of these work.. 

Regards,
