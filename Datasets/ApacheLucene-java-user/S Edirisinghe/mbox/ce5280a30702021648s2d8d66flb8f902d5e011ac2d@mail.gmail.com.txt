SUBJECT: adding keywords to a field
DATE: 3 Feb 2007

Hi,

Is is possible to add keywords to a field? for example if I add a field to a
document and then I save it to the index, after that I find it again for
edit, and want to add a nother keyword for the field. What is the new api
call to add to a stored keyword field?

thanks
