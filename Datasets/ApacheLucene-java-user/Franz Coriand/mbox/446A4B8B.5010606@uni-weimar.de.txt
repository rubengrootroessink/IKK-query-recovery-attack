There is a "TermPositions pos = reader.termPositions();" [reader is an 
instance of IndexReader] - but I have no clue, how to get a position of 
a hit in a document. What can I do with TermPosition?

So, I have all hits of my query with "Hits hits = 
searcher.search(query);" - with the help of "hits" I know the 
document(s) where I can find my query ... but how can I retrieve the 
position now?!
