Ok, so I just set in Field.java

"private boolean storeTermVector = true;"
"private boolean storePositionWithTermVector = true;"

and index my collection again. Right?

But how can I retrieve this information during my search process???
I retrieve an object of the Typ Document ... but this object doesn't 
have a "getPosition()" or "getTermVector()" methode?!
