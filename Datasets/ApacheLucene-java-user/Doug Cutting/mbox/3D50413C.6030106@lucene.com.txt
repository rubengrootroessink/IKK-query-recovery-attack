I can see the case for getAnalyzer(), but setAnalyzer() could be dangerous.

In any case, all that you invoke in your code is getAnalyzer(), and, 
actually, you could use null instead where you call it, since the only 
IndexWriter method that uses the analyzer is addDocument, and you never 
invoke addDocument() on "realWriter".

So no change to IndexWriter is required, but I would also not object to 
the addition of a getAnalyzer() method, especially if someone can come 
up with a use for it!
