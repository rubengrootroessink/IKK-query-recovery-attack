Yes, that is true, so long as you do not delete documents.  Deletions are
removed the next time the segment containing them is merged.  You can force
removal of all deleted documents by optimizing an index.

Those are good suggestions.

Also, I forgot to note earlier: you can drastically reduce the memory
requirements of this approach if a field value can be represented as an int
or long (e.g., a date).  Java's String class uses a lot of memory, around 40
bytes for a 10-character string!
