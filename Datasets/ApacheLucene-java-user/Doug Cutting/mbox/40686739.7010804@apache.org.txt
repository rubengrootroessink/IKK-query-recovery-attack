Yeah, it's a little more complicated than perhaps it should be.

I've attached a class which does this.  I think it's faster and more 
effective than what you proposed.  This only works in the 1.4 codebase 
(current CVS), as it requires the new Query.getSimilarity() method.

To use this, change the line in your test program from:

   Query balancedQuery =
     NegatingQuery.createQuery(positiveQuery,negativeQuery,1);

to

   Query balancedQuery =
     new BoostingQuery(positiveQuery, negativeQuery, 0.01f);

Please tell if you find it useful.

Doug
