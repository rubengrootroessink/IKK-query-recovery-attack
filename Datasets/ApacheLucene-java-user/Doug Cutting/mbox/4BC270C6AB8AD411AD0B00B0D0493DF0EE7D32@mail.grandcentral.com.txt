Lucene assumes that if an open file is deleted then it will continue to be
readable at least until it is closed.  So if your SQL Directory is
permitting open files to be deleted then you will encounter problems.  All
open files should be somehow locked against deletion.  If a file deletion
fails Lucene will try again later.

RAMDirectory and FSDirectory implement this correctly.
