Have a look at the index file format documentation:

   http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/fileformats.html

The only file besides segments that should exist is the "deleteable" 
file, and the files named in the "deleteable" file.  These are files 
which couldn't be deleted, typically on Win32, where you can't delete an 
open file.  Lucene will try to delete them again later, but it shouldn't 
hurt for you to delete them first.
