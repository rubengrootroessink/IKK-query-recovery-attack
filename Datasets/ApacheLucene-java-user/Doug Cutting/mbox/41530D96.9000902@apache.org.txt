That's almost right.  I originally wrote it that way to avoid having to 
ever buffer the entire text of the document.  The document is indexed 
while it is parsed.  But, as observed, this has lots of problems and was 
probably a bad idea.

Could someone provide a patch that removes the multi-threading?  We'd 
simply use a StringBuffer in HTMLParser.jj to collect the text.  Calls 
to pipeOut.write() would be replaced with text.append().  Then have the 
HTMLParser's constructor parse the page before returning, rather than 
spawn a thread, and getReader() would return a StringReader.  The public 
API of HTMLParser need not change at all and lots of complex threading 
code would be thrown away.  Anyone interested in coding this?
