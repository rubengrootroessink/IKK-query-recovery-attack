This does not sound like the problem that Lucene is designed to solve. 
Lucene can solve it, but not in a very efficient manner.

Will you use the same query repeatedly on different sets of documents? 
If so, then it sounds like you might be doing categorization.  An 
efficient way to do this is to build an index of queries and then search 
it with each new document (instead of searching documents with queries). 
  You might be able to get Lucene to work in that manner, but it is not 
ideally suited.
