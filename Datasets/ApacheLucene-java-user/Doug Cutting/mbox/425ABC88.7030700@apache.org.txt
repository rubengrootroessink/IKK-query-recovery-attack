When creating a compound segment, a "segments" file is never written 
that refers to the segment until the .cfs file is created and the .fnm 
files are removed.

The real problem here looks to be that the segments file is out of sync, 
and refers to a segment named 'v' when no such segment, compound or 
otherwise, exists.
