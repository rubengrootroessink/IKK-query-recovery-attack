Right, but the question is, would a single score threshold be effective 
for all queries, or would one need a separate score threshold for each 
query?  My hunch is that the latter is better, regardless of the scoring 
algorithm.

Also, just because Lucene's default scoring does not guarantee scores 
between zero and one does not necessarily mean that these scores are 
less "meaningful".
