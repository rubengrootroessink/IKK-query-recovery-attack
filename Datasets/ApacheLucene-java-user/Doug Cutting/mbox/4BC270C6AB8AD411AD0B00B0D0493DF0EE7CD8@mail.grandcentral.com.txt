It looks like it.

I think the real bug here is that QueryParser should not analyze the terms
in a range query.  I have modified QueryParser.jj to not do this and all of
your examples work much better.  The only downside that I can see is that
range queries, like prefix queries, become case sensitive.  That seems like
a good tradeoff to me.  Does anyone object to this?
