I've attached a patch that should help with the thread contention, 
although I've not tested it extensively.

I still don't fully understand why your searches are so slow, though. 
Are the indexes stored on the local disk of the machine?  Indexes 
accessed over the network can be very slow.

Anyway, give this patch a try.  Also, if anyone else can try this and 
report back whether it makes multi-threaded searching faster, or 
anything else slower, or is buggy, that would be great.

Thanks,

Doug
