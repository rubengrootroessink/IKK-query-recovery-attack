This can happen if your application crashes while the index was being 
updated.  In this case these were never entered into the segments file 
and may be partially written.

It should.  Except, on Windows not all old CFS file will be deleted 
immediately, but may instead be listed in the 'deleteable' file for a while.

These could also be the result of crashes.  In this case they may be 
partially written.

The safest approach is to remove files not mentioned in the segments 
file and update the index with the missing documents.  How does your 
application recover if it crashes during an update?
