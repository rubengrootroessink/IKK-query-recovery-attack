You can do this using the low-level HitCollector-based search API.

That said, I do not recommend it.  It will not make things much more
efficient.

Lucene's scores are not really that meaningful on an absolute scale: they're
only meaningful relative to other scores for the same query.  So you're best
off just displaying the highest scoring hits.  Lucene does things behind the
scenes to make this efficient.
