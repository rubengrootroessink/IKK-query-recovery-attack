Stored fields should be able to hold values with up to Integer.MAX_VALUE

300 byte UnIndexed field worked and i was able to search and find documents. after changing
the UnIndexed field to 10,000 bytes and creating a new index with the same documents, running
the same queries produced 0 hits no matter what i used as the query.
