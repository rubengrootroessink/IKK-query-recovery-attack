The Snowball project has good stop lists.

See:

   http://snowball.tartarus.org/
   http://snowball.tartarus.org/english/stop.txt
   http://snowball.tartarus.org/german/stop.txt

Snowball stemmers are pre-packaged for use with Lucene at:

   http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/lucene-sandbox/snowball/

This project should be updated to include the Snowball stop lists too. 
I have not had the time to do this.  This would be a great contribution 
if someone who is qualified has the time.

Doug
