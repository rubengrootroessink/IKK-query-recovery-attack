I think you misunderstood me.  What I meant to say was that if the term 
the user enters is very common then spell correction may be skipped. 
Very common words which are similar to the term the user entered should 
of course be shown.  But if the user's term is very common one need not 
even attempt to find similarly-spelled words.  Is that any better?
