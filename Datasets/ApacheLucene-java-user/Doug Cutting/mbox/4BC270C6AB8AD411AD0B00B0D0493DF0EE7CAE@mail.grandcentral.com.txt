I'm not sure if this is the cause of your problems, but when you're doing
deletions you need to close the reader before you open a writer, otherwise
deletions can be lost.  You're claiming that additions are lost, but could
it really be that it is the deletions which have been lost?  Try closing the
reader before you open the writer and tell me if that helps.
