DATE: 28 Nov 2005

IndexReader locks the index while opening it to prohibit an IndexWriter 
from deleting any of the files in that index until all are opened.

Lock files are not stored in the index directory since write access to 
an index should not be required to lock it while opening an IndexReader.
