You could subclass FilterIndexReader and override the norms() method to 
cook the values in the returned array, caching the cooked copy.  Then 
use different IndexReaders for different queries, each cooking the norms 
differently.  Cooking could be fast: compute a 256 byte table and use it 
to map each byte to its cooked value.  Does this make sense?
