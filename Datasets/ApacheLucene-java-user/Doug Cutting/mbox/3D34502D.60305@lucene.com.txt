Lucene does open and close lots of files relative to many other applications, 
but the number of files opened is still many orders of magnitude less than the 
number of other objects allocated.  I would be very surprised if finalizers for 
the hundreds of files that Lucene might open in a session would have any 
measurable impact on garbage collector performance given the millions of other 
objects that the garbage collector might process in that session.

As usual, one should not make performance claims without performing benchmarks. 
  It would be a simple matter to comment out the finalize() methods, recompile 
and compare indexing and search speed.  If the improvement is significant, then 
we can consider removing finalize methods.
