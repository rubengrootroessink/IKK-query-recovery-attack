I just glanced at the paper, so my analysis may be wrong, but I think 
one could implement cover density ranking in Lucene with spans (only in 
CVS, not in 1.3).  I think spans correspond to covers in this paper. 
But you'd need to alter SpanScorer.java to implement the cover scoring 
described in that paper.  And you'd probably need to use a custom 
Similarity implementation, which disables most other scoring (tf=1.0, 
idf=1.0, etc.), but exaggerates coordination.  Finally, you'd need to 
construct span queries.  Or something like that.

If someone tries this, please tell us how it works.
