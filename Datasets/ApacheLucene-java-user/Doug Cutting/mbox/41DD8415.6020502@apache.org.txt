If you're performing compute-bound work on a single-processor machine 
then threading should give you no better performance than sequential, 
perhaps a bit worse.  If you're performing io-bound work on a 
single-disk machine then threading should again provide no improvement. 
  If the task is evenly compute and i/o bound then you could achieve at 
best a 2x speedup on a single CPU system with a single disk.

If you're compute-bound on an N-CPU system then threading should 
optimally be able to provide a factor of N speedup.

Java's scheduling of compute-bound theads when no threads call 
Thread.sleep() can also be very unfair.
