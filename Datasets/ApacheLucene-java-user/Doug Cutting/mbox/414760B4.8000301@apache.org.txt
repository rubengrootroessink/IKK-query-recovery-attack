Sloppy PhraseQuery's are slower than BooleanQueries, but not horribly 
slower.  The problem is that they don't handle the case where phrase 
elements are missing altogether, while a BooleanQuery does.  So what you 
really need is maybe a variation of a sloppy PhraseQuery that scores 
matches that do not contain all of the terms...
