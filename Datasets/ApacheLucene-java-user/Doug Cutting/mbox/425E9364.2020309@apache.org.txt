If they're all at the same position you can still use slop to match the 
phrase.  So if 'power', 'query' and 'powerquery' are all at the same 
position, a search for "power query" with slop=1 will match.  Also, you 
can specify a default slop to the query parser, so when folks enter just 
"power query" it will automatically have slop=1.  This will permit some 
false positives, e.g., the text "power green query" will match with slop=1.
