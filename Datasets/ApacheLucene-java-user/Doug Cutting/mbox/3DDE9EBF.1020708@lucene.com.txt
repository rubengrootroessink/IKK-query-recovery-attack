SUBJECT: Re: How does delete  work?
DATE: 22 Nov 2002

No, in my example optimize() was never called.  The merge rule operates 
recursively.  So, after 99 documents had been added the segment stack 
contained nine indexes with ten documents and nine with one document. 
When the hundredth document was added, the nine one document segments 
were popped of the stack and merged into a single segment that was 
pushed onto the stack.  So then the top of the stack had ten segments 
each containing ten documents, i.e., mergeFactor segments of the same 
size, and these ten segments were then merged into a single segment of 
100 documents.  So adding the 100th document triggered two merges.

(One error in my previous example: the 100 document segment actually 
contains documents 0-99, not 0-100.)

A corollary of this is, when mergeFactor is 10 and no deletions have 
been made, the segments correspond to the digits in the decimal 
representation of the number of documents in the index.  So, an 85 
document index has eight segments with 10 documents and five segments 
with one documents.  (This is somewhat of a simplification, as Lucene 
automatically merges single document segments before ever writing them 
to disk as an optimization.)

It is most beneficial to call IndexWriter.optimize() only when you know 
you won't be adding documents to an index for a while, but will be 
searching it a lot.  Calling optimize() periodically while indexing 
mostly just slows things down.
