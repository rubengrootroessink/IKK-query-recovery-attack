Just because it is common practice does not mean that it is a good idea.

Why do you think Ant should be included in Lucene's CVS?  What would it make
easier?

In the past, Ant was in Lucene's CVS.  But all of the developers had a
separate ant installation anyway, both for Lucene and for other projects
they work on.  So distributing ant with Lucene was just adding unused code.
