Try typing control-break to get some stack dumps.  I also recommend 
building the current Lucene code from subversion and trying that.  There 
have been lots of improvements since 1.4.3.

It would be interesting to see a directory listing of your index, but I 
suspect it is in compound format (the default), which makes this rather 
uninformative.  If you build the current sources then you can list the 
contents of a compound-format index with IndexReader.main().  So another 
reason to try the new code!
