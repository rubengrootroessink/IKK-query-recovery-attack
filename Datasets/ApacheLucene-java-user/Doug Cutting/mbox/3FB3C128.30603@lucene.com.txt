Why is this dangerous?  Are you concerned about malicious users locking 
indexes in a denial of service attack?  If so, perhaps we should have an 
option to change where locks are stored, so that they could be, e.g., 
moved to /var/lock/lucene or somesuch which could have special protections.

Before this patch, folks could not open an index in a read-only manner 
unless they had write access to its directory.  I think that is a larger 
bug and more dangerous, as it means that anyone who can search an index 
can destroy it.

I think it is proper that locks are not stored in the same place as the 
index, as in many cases this is not writable by the searching 
application, and the lock directory should be writable by all who can 
read the index.
