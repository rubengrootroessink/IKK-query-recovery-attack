Did you try the code I just sent out?  Did it help much?

A problem with things like PrefixQuery are that they let folks easily
construct queries which are *very* expensive to evaluate.  It is no
coincidence that Google et. al. do not permit these sort of queries.  So,
while we can remove some of the GC overhead, don't forget that these are
still expensive operations and will still be rather slow.  A feature like
PrefixQuery should thus be used sparingly.
