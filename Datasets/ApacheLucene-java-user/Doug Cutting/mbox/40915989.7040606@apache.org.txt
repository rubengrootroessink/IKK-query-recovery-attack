That sounds right to me.

I think this is a good approach.

In 1.4, you can do something like:

public class NoCoordBooleanQuery extends BooleanQuery {

   private static final Similarity SIMILARITY = new DefaultSimilarity {
     public float coord(int overlap, int max) {
       return 1.0f;
     }
   };

   public Similarity getSimilarity(Searcher searcher) {
     return SIMILARITY;
   }

}

Then use this in place of BooleanQuery when you don't want coordination 
scoring.  I think that should do the trick.
