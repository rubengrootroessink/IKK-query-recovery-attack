This is because you have added some documents with "originType" as an
indexed field, and others with "originType" as an un-indexed field.  Did you
change this in your code after your index was created?  That is not
currently permitted.

As I think about it, I don't think this should be an error.  Please try
making the following change to index/FieldInfos.java.  Change the definition
of add(String,boolean) to:

  private void add(String name, boolean isIndexed) {
    FieldInfo fi = fieldInfo(name);
    if (fi == null)
      addInternal(name, isIndexed);
    else if (isIndexed)		  // if isIndexed in any seg
      fi.isIndexed = true;	  // isIndexed in merged
  }

That should fix your problem, and I don't think it will cause any others.
Please send an email to lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org telling whether this
works.

Doug

Hi !,

    I have an incremental index and the present size is about 1.34GB. I am
getting following exception for the addition of new files in the index:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: field originType cannot be an indexed
field.

        .......

Can any one suggest me as to what can be the cause ? The originType is one
of the field on which I create index. Is it related to the size of the index
?

Try using org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer instead of
StopAnalyzer.  This will index numbers, etc.  Have a look at
StandardTokenizer.jj in the sources for details.  If that grammar is not
quite right, copy it and compile your own tokenizer.
