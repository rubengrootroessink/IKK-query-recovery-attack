Dmitry Serebrennikov [dmitrys@earthlink.net] has implemented a substantial
extension to Lucene which should help folks doing this sort of research.  It
provides an explicit vector representation for documents.  This way you can,
e.g., retrieve a number of documents, efficiently sum their vectors, then
derive a new query from the sum.  This code was posted to the list a long
while back, but is now out of date.  As soon as the 1.2 release is final,
and Dmitry has time, he intends to merge it into Lucene.
