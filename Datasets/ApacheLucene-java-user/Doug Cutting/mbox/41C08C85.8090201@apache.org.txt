"0.8" means something about the result quality independent of the query).

I question whether such scores are more meaningful.  Yes, such scores 
would be guaranteed to be between zero and one, but would 0.8 really be 
meaningful?  I don't think so.  Do you have pointers to research which 
demonstrates this?  E.g., when such a scoring method is used, that 
thresholding by score is useful across queries?
