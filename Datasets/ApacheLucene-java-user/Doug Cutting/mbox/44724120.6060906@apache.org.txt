to sort the documents. I guess alot of people at this mail list can give me valuable hints
about how to accomplish this!

A HitCollector should help.  Matching documents are passed to a 
HitCollector in the order they were added to the index.  So if newer 
documents were added to your index later, then the newest N documents 
are simply the last N documents passed to the HitCollector.

Could that work?
