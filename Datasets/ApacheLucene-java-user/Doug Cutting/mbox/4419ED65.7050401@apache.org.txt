SUBJECT: Re: Lucene and Tomcat, too many open files
DATE: 16 Mar 2006

Are you changing the default mergeFactor or other settings?  If so, how? 
  Large mergeFactors are generally a bad idea: they don't make things 
faster in the long run and they chew up file handles.

Are all searches reusing a single IndexReader?  They should.  This is 
the other most common reason folks run out of file handles: they open 
too many IndexReaders.  The exception may be thrown when merging, but 
the root cause might be something else.
