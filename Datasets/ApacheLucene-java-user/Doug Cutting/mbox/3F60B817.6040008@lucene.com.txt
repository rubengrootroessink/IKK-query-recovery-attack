Why not just AND together the first and second query?  That way they're 
both incorporated in the ranking.  Filters are good when you don't want 
it to affect the ranking, and also when the first query is a criterion 
that you'll reuse for many queries (e.g., language=french), since the 
bit vectors can be cached (as by QueryFilter).
