 I've seen the methods in IndexReader, but how can I access them inside my collect method?
Are there other methods I am missing? 

No, this information is not available to the hit collector.

Why do you need this?  If it is only for summaries, then you're probably 
better off re-tokenizing those few documents that you wish to summarize. 
  If it is for query evaluation, then you're probably better off writing 
a new class of query (which is non-trivial).
