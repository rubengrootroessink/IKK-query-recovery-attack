I don't know of a Java implementation which lets you have a heap larger 
than 2GB.  In my experience, things get flakey when the heap is larger 
than 1.5GB.  So RAMDirectory may not work in this case.

Another approach that we've found useful is to, on linux, use a ramfs 
filesystem.  If you've got a 64-bit machine with 6GB of RAM, it should 
be possible to build a 5GB ramfs and put the index there.  That gives 
nearly as good of performance as RAMDirectory.
