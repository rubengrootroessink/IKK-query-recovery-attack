SUBJECT: RE: Querying an exact string match ?
DATE: 31 Oct 2001

This should work.  You should be able to find an un-tokenized field
containing spaces with a TermQuery.  Nothing should ever tokenize the
string.

Can you please supply a simple, self-contained example showing that this
does not work?

Thanks,

Doug
