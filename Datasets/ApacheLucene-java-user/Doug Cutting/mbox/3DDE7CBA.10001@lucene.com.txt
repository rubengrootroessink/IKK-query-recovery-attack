SUBJECT: Re: How does delete  work?
DATE: 22 Nov 2002

Merging happens constantly as documents are added.  Each document is 
initially added in its own segment, and pushed onto the segment stack. 
Whenever there are mergeFactor segments on the top of the stack that are 
the same size, these are merged together into a new single segment that 
replaces them.  So, if mergeFactor is 10, and you've added 122 
documents, the stack will have five segments, as follows:
   document 121
   document 120
   documents 110-119
   documents 100-109
   documents 0-100
The next merge will happen after document 129 is added, when a new 
segment will replace the segments for document 120 through document 129 
with a new single segment.

It's actually a little more complicated than that, since (among other 
reasons) after docuuments are deleted a segment's size will no longer be 
exactly a power of the mergeFactor.
