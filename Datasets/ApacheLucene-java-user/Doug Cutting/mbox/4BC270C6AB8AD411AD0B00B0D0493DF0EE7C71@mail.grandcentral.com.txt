Elliot,

I'm having trouble getting a clear picture of your indexing scheme.

Could you provide some simple examples, e.g., for the xml:
  <tag1>this is some text
    <tag2>and some other text</tag2>
  </tag1>
would you have something like the following?
  doc1
    node_type: tag1
    contents: this is some text
  doc2
    node_type: tag2
    contents: and some other text
  doc3
    node_type: all_contents
    contents: this is some text and some other text

That would help me.

My first instinct would be to have something like:
  doc1
    tag1: this is some text
    tag2: and some other text
    all-tags: this is some text and some other text
What do you need that that does not achieve?

Doug
