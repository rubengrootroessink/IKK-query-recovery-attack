When merging lots of indexes (more than the mergeFactor), the 
Directory-based method will use fewer file handles and less memory, as 
it will only ever open mergeFactor indexes at once, while the 
IndexReader-based method requires that all indexes be open when passed. 
  The primary advantage of the IndexReader-based method is that one can 
pass it IndexReaders that don't reside in a Directory (which is now 
possible, as one may completely re-implement the IndexReader API).

For most folks I think sticking with the old method is best.  It's also 
been tested much more!
