SUBJECT: don't crosspost to lucene-user and lucene-dev
DATE: 20 Feb 2003

Please send Lucene-related messages to just one of lucene-user or 
lucene-dev, *not* both.

The lucene-dev list should be considered a subset of the lucene-user 
list that is concerned with the development of lucene.  Things that 
should be sent to this list are:
   . reproducible bug reports, complete with test code
   . feature requests
   . etc.

The lucene-user list should be used for discussion of how lucene is 
used.  Issues that should be discussed on this list are:
   . use of the Lucene API
   . integrating Lucene with other applications
   . etc.

When in doubt, send your message to lucene-user.  If it turns out to be 
a development issue then the discussion can be moved to lucene-dev.

Thanks,

Doug
