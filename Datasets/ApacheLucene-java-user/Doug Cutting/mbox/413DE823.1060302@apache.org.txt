I have never benchmarked this but would be surprised if it makes a 
measureable difference in any real application.  A linked list is used 
because it naturally supports multiple entries with the same key.  A 
home-grown linked list was used because, when Lucene was first written, 
java.util.LinkedList did not exist.

Please feel free to benchmark this against a HashMap of LinkedList of 
Field.  This would be slower to construct, which may offset any 
increased access speed.
