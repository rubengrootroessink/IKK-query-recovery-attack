Your analysis sounds correct.

At base, a weight is a normalized tf*idf.  So a document weight is:

   docTf * idf * docNorm

and a query weight is:

   queryTf * idf * queryNorm

where queryTf is always one.

So the product of these is (docTf * idf * docNorm) * (idf * queryNorm), 
which indeed contains idf twice.  I think the best documentation fix 
would be to add another idf(t) clause at the end of the formula, next to 
queryNorm(q), so this is clear.  Does that sound right to you?
