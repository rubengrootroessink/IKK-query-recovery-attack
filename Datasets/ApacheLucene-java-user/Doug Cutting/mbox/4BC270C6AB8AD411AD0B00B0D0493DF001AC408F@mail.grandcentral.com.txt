I cannot replicate the problem you are having.

Can you please submit a complete, self-contained, test case illustrating the
problem you are having with the write lock.

Please test this against the latest nightly build of Lucene, from:
  http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-lucene/nightly/

Thanks,

Doug
