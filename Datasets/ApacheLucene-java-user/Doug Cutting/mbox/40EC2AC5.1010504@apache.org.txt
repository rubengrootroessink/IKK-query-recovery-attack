SUBJECT: Re: Most efficient way to index 14M documents (out of memory/file handles)
DATE: 7 Jul 2004

A mergeFactor of 5000 is a bad idea.  If you want to index faster, try 
increasing minMergeDocs instead.  If you have lots of memory this can 
probably be 5000 or higher.

Also, why do you optimize before you're done?  That only slows things. 
Perhaps you have to do it because you've set mergeFactor to such an 
extreme value?  I do not recommend a merge factor higher than 100.
