The problem is that this is hard to do from Java.  A typical approach is 
to put the process id in the lock file, then, if that process is dead, 
ignore the lock file.  But Java does not let one know process ids.  Java 
1.4 provides a LockFile mechanism which should mostly solve this, but 
Lucene 1.4.3 does not yet require Java 1.4 and hence cannot use that 
feature.  Lucene 2.0 is likely to require Java 1.4 and should be able to 
do a better job of automatically unlocking indexes when processes die.
