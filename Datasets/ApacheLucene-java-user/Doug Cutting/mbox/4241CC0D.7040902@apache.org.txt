That's my first suggestion too.  Memory consumption should not primarily 
grow per query, rather per IndexSearcher.  You're seeing 80MB of RAM 
consumed per query over an 6M document index.  That sounds plausible if, 
e.g., you're using a Sort and not re-using a single IndexSearcher.  Once 
you start re-using the IndexSearcher overall consumption should be 
around 80MB.
