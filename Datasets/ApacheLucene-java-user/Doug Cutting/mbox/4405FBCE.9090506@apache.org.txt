SUBJECT: Lucene 1.9-final release available
DATE: 1 Mar 2006

Release 1.9-final of Lucene is now available from:

http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/

This release has many improvements since release 1.4.3, including new
features, performance improvements, bug fixes, etc.  For details, see:

http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/lucene/java/tags/lucene_1_9_final/CHANGES.txt

1.9 will be the last 1.x release. It is both back-compatible with 1.4.3
and forward-compatible with the upcoming 2.0 release. Many methods and
classes in 1.4.3 have been deprecated in 1.9 and will be removed in 2.0. 
  Applications must compile against 1.9 without deprecation warnings
before they are compatible with 2.0.

Doug
