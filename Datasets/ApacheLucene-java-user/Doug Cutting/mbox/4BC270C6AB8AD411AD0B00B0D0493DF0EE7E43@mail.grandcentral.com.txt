Here are a few more ideas, none of which I'm in love with.

Use a postfix on phrases with tilde:
  "Mickey Minnie Goofy"~5

Or overloaded parentheses:
  NEAR5(Mickey Minnie Goofy)
  NEAR(Mickey Minnie Goofy, 5)
These make it look less like a phrase, which might be good.  You can use
tokenizer state names to make parens a different token after NEAR.

Or use chaining of an infix operator:
  Mickey NEAR Minnie NEAR Goofy

You could have a default NEAR slop of 10, which can be reset with tilde:
  (Mickey NEAR Minnie NEAR Goofy)~10
