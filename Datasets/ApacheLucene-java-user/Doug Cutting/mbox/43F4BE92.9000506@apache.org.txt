Unfortunately BM25 requires the document length in the score calculation, which is not provided
by the Scorer.

How do you want to measure document length?  If the number of tokens is 
an acceptable measure, then the norm contains sqrt(numTokens) by 
default.  You can modify your Similarity.lengthNorm() implementation to 
not perform the sqrt, or square the norm.
