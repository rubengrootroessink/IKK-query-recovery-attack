That's not quite right.  If you use the same IndexSearcher (or 
IndexReader) for all of the searches, then only 175MB are used.  The 
arrays in question (the norms) are read-only and can be shared by all 
searches.

In general, the amount of memory required is:

1 byte * Number of searchable fields in your index * Number of docs in 
your index

plus

1k bytes * number of terms in query

plus

1k bytes * number of phrase terms in query

The latter are for i/o buffers.  There are a few other things, but these 
are the major ones.
