I think the bug is that Tomcat changes java.io.tmpdir.  I thought that 
the point of the system property java.io.tmpdir was to have a portable 
name for /tmp on unix, c:\windows\tmp on Windows, etc.  Tomcat breaks 
that.  So must Lucene have its own way of finding the platform-specific 
temporary directory that everyone can write to?  Perhaps, but it seems a 
shame, since Java already has a standard mechanism for this, which 
Tomcat abuses...
