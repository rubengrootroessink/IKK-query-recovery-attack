Prior to 1.4, there were no format numbers in the index.  These are 
being added, file-by-file, as we change file formats.  As you've 
discovered, there is currently no public API to obtain the format number 
of an index.  Also, the formats of different files are revved at 
different times, so there may not be a single format number for the 
entire index.  (Perhaps we should remedy this, by, e.g., always revving 
the "segments" version whenever any file changes format.)

Have a look at the version of fileformats.html that shipped with 1.3. 
You can find this by browsing CVS, looking for the 1.3-final tag.  But 
let me do it for you:

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/jakarta-lucene/docs/fileformats.html?rev=1.15

According to CVS tags, that describes both the 1.3 and 1.2 index file 
formats.

I wrote the bit about "compatibility notes" when I first documented file 
formats, and then promptly forgot about it.  So, until someone 
contributes them, there are no compatibility notes.  Sorry.

The idea is to promptly break 1.3 and 1.2 code which tries to read the 
index.  Those versions of Lucene don't check format numbers (because 
there were none).  Positive values would give unpredictable errors.  A 
negative value causes an immediate failure.

The first four bytes of the "segments" file will mostly do the trick. 
If it is zero or positive, then the index is a 1.2 or 1.3 index.  If it 
is -2, then it's a 1.4-final or later index.

There was a change in formats between 1.2 and 1.3, with no format number 
change.  This was in 1.3 RC1 (note #12 in CHANGES.txt).  The semantics 
of each byte in norm files (.f[0-9]) changed.  In 1.3 each byte 
represented 0.0-255.0 on a linear scale.  In 1.3 and later they're 
eight-bit floats (three-bit mantissa, five-bit exponent, no sign bit). 
The net result is that if you use a 1.2 index with 1.3 or later then the 
correct documents will be returned, but scores and rankings will be wacky.

With the exception of this last bit, 1.4 should be able to correctly 
handle indexes from earlier releases.  Please report if this is not the 
case.

Cheers,

Doug
