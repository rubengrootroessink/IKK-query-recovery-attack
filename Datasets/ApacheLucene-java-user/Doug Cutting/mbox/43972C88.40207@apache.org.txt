Note that if you search for wikipedia.org in Nutch this is interpreted 
as an implicit phrase query and is expanded differently, as:

+(url:"wikipedia org"^4.0
   anchor:"wikipedia org"^2.0
   content:"wikipedia org"
   title:"wikipedia org"^1.5
   host:"wikipedia org"^2.0)

Note also that Nutch can use N-grams for common terms.  One can thus 
configure things so that this would be instead:

+(url:"wikipedia-org"^4.0
   anchor:"wikipedia org"^2.0
   content:"wikipedia org"
   title:"wikipedia org"^1.5
   host:"wikipedia-org"^2.0)

where wikipedia-org is a bigram term indexed when org occurs in the url 
or host field.
