Are you using a Lucene Sort?  If you reuse the same IndexReader (or 
IndexSearcher) then perhaps the first query specifying a Sort will take 
30 seconds (although that's much slower than I'd expect), but subsequent 
searches that sort on the same field should be nearly as fast as results 
sorted by score.
