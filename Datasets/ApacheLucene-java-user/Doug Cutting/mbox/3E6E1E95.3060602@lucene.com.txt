In the 1.2 release, I don't think this sort of boosting (of a complex 
clause) has any affect.  To do what you want in 1.2 you need to instead 
formulate this as follows, boosting individual terms only:

(NAME:inn^10 NAME:comfort^10 NAME:shampoo^10) (MMNUM:inn MMNUM:shampoo 
MMNUM:comfort) (SMNUM:shampoo SMNUM:comfort SMNUM:inn)

This is fixed in the pre-1.3 sources.  In 1.3 there will also be a query 
explanation feature and extensible scoring, both of which could be 
useful to you.  But I suspect that just boosting the individual terms, 
as above, will meet your needs now.
