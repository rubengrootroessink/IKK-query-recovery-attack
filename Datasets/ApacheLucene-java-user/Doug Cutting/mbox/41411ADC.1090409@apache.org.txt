I think this one is easy to threshold: ignore matching terms that are 
rarer than the term entered.

> - ignore(penalize?) terms that are common

This, in effect, falls out of the previous criterion.  A term that is 
very common will not have any matching terms that are more common.  As 
an optimization, you could avoid even looking for matching terms when a 
term is very common.

This is the meaty one.

Perhaps.  Are folks really better at spelling the beginning of words?
