This should work.  The primary risk is that they generate different terms
than the analyzer you use to tokenize queries.  So long as you're aware of
that, this shouldn't be a problem.

Can you provide more details?  A common confusion is that folks try to do
format conversion in analyzers, e.g., to have different analyzers for PDF
files, for HTML files, etc.  The better approach is to implement converters
that convert these formats to plain text, either a String or a Reader.  Then
you can use the same analyzer for documents in different formats.
