Another thing to try might be to increase IndexOutputStream.BUFFER_SIZE, 
to say, 8192.  Note that you need to 'ant clean compile', since other 
files that reference this constant need to be recompiled.  Does that 
help any?

A 64-bit JVM with NioDirectory would really be optimal for this. 
Anything else either requires opening lots more file handles, or 
synchronizing on a few file handles, neither of which is attractive.  We 
could try to keep a pool of file handles for highly contended files, but 
that's tricky to implement.
