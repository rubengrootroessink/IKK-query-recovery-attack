An index should never be left in an inconsistent state.  After a crash 
lock files may need to be removed, but that's it.

However, backing up an index while it is being modified is tricky, since 
it is a moving target.  At any single point in time the index is 
consistent, but the backup process is not instantaneous, and views the 
index at a number of points in time.
