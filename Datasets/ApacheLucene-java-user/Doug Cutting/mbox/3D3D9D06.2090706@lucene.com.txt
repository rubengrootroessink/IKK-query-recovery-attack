There's currently no API that supports this well.  The best approach at 
present would be to define a HitCollector which multiplies your PageRank 
factor into the score and collects the top-scoring hits.  (The Hits 
class does not use the HitCollector API, so you can't use it when you're 
using a HitCollector.)

Longer term, we plan to add a Document.setBoost(float) method.  The 
number supplied here will be multiplied into scores for hits on the 
document.  There will also be a Field.setBoost(float).  Both boosts will 
default to 1.0.  I'm hoping to start implementing this soon.  If you're 
interested in helping with the implementation, or have more ideas about 
this, please send a message to the lucene-dev list.

Cheers,

Doug
