Not really.  The best you can do is skip back to the previous "indexed" 
term in TermInfosReader.indexTerms, and scan forward from there.  You 
could try adding a method to that class like:

   final synchronized void seekBefore(Term term) throws IOException {
     int offset = getIndexOffset(term);
     seekEnum(offset > 0 ? offset - 1 : offset);
   }

Then you'd need to add stuff to MultiReader, SegmentReader and 
IndexReader, to take advantage of this.  It could get a little tricky, 
but it is possible.  I'm not convinced this is your best route.

Are you adding documents in date order?  If so, then you could look at 
the date of the document numbered maxDoc() - N and scan forward from 
there.  To be safe, you could start at maxDoc() - N*2 or something.

Why not have two date fields, one inverted and one not?

That doesn't sound like a bad solution.
