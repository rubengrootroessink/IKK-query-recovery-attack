Not without hacking things.  If your 1.3 indexes were generated with 256 
then you can modify your version of Lucene 1.4+ to use 256 instead of 
128 when reading a Lucene 1.3 format index (SegmentTermEnum.java:54 today).

Prior to 1.4 this was a constant, hardwired into the index format.  In 
1.4 and later each index segment stores this value as a parameter.  So 
once 1.4 has re-written your index you'll no longer need a modified version.
