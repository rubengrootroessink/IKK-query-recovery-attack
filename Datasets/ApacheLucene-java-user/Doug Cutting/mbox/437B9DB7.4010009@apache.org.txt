I would be cautious about concluding too much from a single term, since 
you may get lucky and pick a term that is close to the index point. 
Rather you should average timings over a number of terms, randomly 
ordered.  If you wish to remove i/o times, then don't time the first 
iteration.  Does that make sense?
