Ah, I see.  You have an absoulte interpretation.  I am more relative.  I 
think we're talking about a heuristic, not a law.

Matches within a sentence are scored higher than those that are not. 
And the closer matching the terms are, whether within the same sentence 
or not, the greater the score.  Given these two principals, at some 
point, as sentences get longer, a close match across sentence boundaries 
should probably score substantially higher than a very distant match 
within a sentence.  Thus missing some distant yet still within-sentence 
matches in very long sentences probably won't substantially alter the 
ranking.  Is 100 long enough?  Perhaps not.  But 1000 is certainly 
plenty long.
