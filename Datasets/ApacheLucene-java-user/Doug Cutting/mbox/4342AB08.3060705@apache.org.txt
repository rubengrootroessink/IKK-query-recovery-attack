I doubt this will speed things much.

A RAID device with higher i/o throughput might help.

Or perhaps you can just optimize the index less often.  Instead use a 
very small merge factor (i.e., 2) to minimize the number of segments. 
This will make searches faster.  Increase minMergeDocs to 1000 or so to 
keep updates fast.
