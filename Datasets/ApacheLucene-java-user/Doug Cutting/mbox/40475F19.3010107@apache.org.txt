The compound format slows indexing performance slightly, but should not 
affect search performance much.  It radically reduces the number of file 
handles used when searching, by a factor of eight or more, depending on 
how many indexed fields you have.

Perhaps the compound format should be the default format in 1.4.  Can 
folks provide any benchmarks for how it affects performance?
