You'd be surprised what people would assume!

The bottom line is that making this non-final would enable you to do 
anything that you cannot do today, and it would permit lots of folks to 
try things that won't work, get confused, and complain.  Part of the job 
of an API is to steer you towards best practices and away from dead 
ends.  If there were important functionality that would be enabled by 
making this non-final then I'd be for it.
