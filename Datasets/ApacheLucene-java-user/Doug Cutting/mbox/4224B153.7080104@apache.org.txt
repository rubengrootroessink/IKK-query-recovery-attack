'nHits - nHits' always equals zero.  So you're actually printing the 
first document, not the last.  The last document would be accessed with 
'hits.doc(nHits)'.  Accessing the last document should not be much 
slower (or faster) than accessing the first.

200+ milliseconds to access a document does seem slow.  Where is you 
index stored?  On a local hard drive?
