This is easy to do with a single index.  Here's the loop:

  1. Poll DB for updated and new documents.
  2. Delete all updated docs from an IndexReader & close it.
  3. Add all new & updated to an IndexWriter & close it.
  4. Tell DB that documents are updated.
  5. Checkpoint index.
  6. Repeat.

Deleting is much faster than adding.
