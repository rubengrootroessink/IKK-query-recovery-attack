It would be better to know more about how you're currently using Lucene. 
  For example, it is much faster to index many documents on a single 
IndexWriter rather than to create a new IndexWriter per document.  It's 
also somewhat faster to not store document text in the index.  Etc.

That said, the single parameter that can most improve things is the 
number of buffered docs:

http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#setMaxBufferedDocs(int)

Try increasing this to, e.g., 50.
