Yes, there is most definitely a pattern.  Document order is preserved.
After optimization, numbering is dense.  For example, if an index contains
six documents numbered 0 through 5, and documents 1, 3 and 4 are deleted,
then, after optimization, it will contain 0, 2, and 5, but now numbered 0,
1, 2.
