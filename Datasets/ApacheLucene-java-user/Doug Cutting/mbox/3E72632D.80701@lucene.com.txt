to me logically as well - I wouldnt know what a value of greater than 1 would mean, and why
should a term that has a score of 0 be returned in the first place! But just to be sure, I
wanted to check the range of values one can get for the Score? 

Scores passed to a HitCollector or in a TopDocs are typically between 0 
and 1, but are not guaranteed to be.  Scores from Hits object are forced 
to be between 0 and 1.

rendered. The value itself makes little sense to the enduser - so if I try to convert it to
a precentage (of what?), or star, etc... which is a better option?! any suggestions, pointers...

Scores are only designed to be a means for ranking, and not to have any 
other meaning.  Thus end users should be shown ranked results, not scores.
