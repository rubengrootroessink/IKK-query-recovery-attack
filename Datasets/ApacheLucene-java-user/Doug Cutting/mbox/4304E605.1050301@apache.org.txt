The index only has 1/128 of the terms, by default.  You're right however
that there are three arrays, not just one, I'd forgotten that.  So, with
6M terms you'd have a 50k term index.  Two 200kB arrays (pointer) and
one 400kB array (long) would be allocated, plus the data to fill them.
So the total might be closer to a few MB.
