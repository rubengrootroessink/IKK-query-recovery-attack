Thanks for performing this benchmark!

It looks like the compound format is around 7% slower when indexing.  To 
my thinking that's acceptable, given the dramatic reduction in file 
handles.  If folks really need maximal indexing performance, then they 
can explicitly disable the compound format.

Would anyone object to making compound format the default for Lucene 
1.4?  This is an incompatible change, but I don't think it should break 
applications.
