Thanks for the data.  This is exactly what I was looking for.

These are all stuck looking terms up in the dictionary (TermInfos). 
Things would be much faster if your queries didn't have so many terms.

proof OR  FIELD5: proof OR  FIELD6: proof OR  FIELD7: proof ) AND (  FIELD1: "george bush"
OR  FIELD2: "george bush" OR  FIELD3: "george bush" OR  FIELD4: "george bush" OR  FIELD5:
"george bush" OR  FIELD6: "george bush" OR  FIELD7: "george bush" )  ) AND (  FIELD1: script
OR  FIELD2: script OR  FIELD3: script OR  FIELD4: script OR  FIELD5: script OR  FIELD6: script
OR  FIELD7: script )  ) AND (  (  FIELD1: san OR  FIELD2: san OR  FIELD3: san OR  FIELD4:
san OR  FIELD5: san OR  FIELD6: san OR  FIELD7: san ) OR (  (  FIELD1: war OR  FIELD2: war
OR  FIELD3: war OR  FIELD4: war OR  FIELD5: war OR  FIELD6: war OR  FIELD7: war ) OR (  (
 FIELD1: gulf OR  FIELD2: gulf OR  FIELD3: gulf OR  FIELD4: gulf OR  FIELD5: gulf OR  FIELD6:
gulf OR  FIELD7: gulf ) OR (  (  FIELD1: laden OR  FIELD2: laden OR  FIELD3: laden OR  FIELD4:
laden OR  FIELD5: laden OR  FIELD6: laden OR  FIELD7: laden ) OR (  (  FIE
LD1: ttouristeat OR  FIELD2: ttouristeat OR  FIELD3: ttouristeat OR  FIELD4: ttouristeat OR
 FIELD5: ttouristeat OR  FIELD6: ttouristeat OR  FIELD7: ttouristeat ) OR (  (  FIELD1: pow
OR  FIELD2: pow OR  FIELD3: pow OR  FIELD4: pow OR  FIELD5: pow OR  FIELD6: pow OR  FIELD7:
pow ) OR (  FIELD1: bin OR  FIELD2: bin OR  FIELD3: bin OR  FIELD4: bin OR  FIELD5: bin OR
 FIELD6: bin OR  FIELD7: bin )  )  )  )  )  )  )  )  ) AND  RANGE: ([ 0800 TO 1100 ]) AND
 (  S_IDa: (7 OR 8 OR 9 OR 10 OR 11 OR 12 OR 13 OR 14 OR 15 OR 16 OR 17 )  or  S_IDb: (2 )
 )

All your queries look for terms in fields 1-7.  If you instead combined 
the contents of fields 1-7 in a single field, and searched that field, 
then your searches would contain far fewer terms and be much faster.

Also, I don't know how many terms your RANGE queries match, but that 
could also be introducing large numbers of terms which would slow things 
down too.

But, still, you have identified a bottleneck: TermInfosReader caches a 
TermEnum and hence access to it must be synchronized.  Caching the enum 
greatly speeds sequential access to terms, e.g., when merging, 
performing range or prefix queries, etc.  Perhaps however the cache 
should be done through a ThreadLocal, giving each thread its own cache 
and obviating the need for synchronization...

Please tell me if you are able to simplify your queries and if that 
speeds things.  I'll look into a ThreadLocal-based solution too.
