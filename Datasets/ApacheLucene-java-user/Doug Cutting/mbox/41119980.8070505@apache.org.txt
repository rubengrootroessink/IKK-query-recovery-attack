Yes, it is theoretically possible but not yet implemented.

An easy way to implement it would be to subclass FilterIndexReader to 
return a subset of documents, then use IndexWriter.addIndexes() to write 
out each subset as a new index.  Subsets could be ranges of document 
numbers, and one could use TermPositions.skipTo() to accelerate the 
TermPositions subset implementation, but this still wouldn't be quite as 
fast as an index splitter that only reads each TermPositions once.  If 
we added a lower-level index writing API then one could use that to 
implement this...
