This sounds like great potential addition to Lucene!

I encourage you to create an issue in Jira and attach your code there 
now.  (Anyone can create themselves a Jira account.)

There's no need to wait until it is cleaned up: attach an initial 
version to an issue and describe what you intend to do next, then attach 
improved versions later.  That way other folks can provide input, and, 
heaven forbid, should you for some reason lose interest before it is 
polished, someone else can complete the work.

Thanks!

Doug
