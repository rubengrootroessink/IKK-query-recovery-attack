What version of Lucene are you running?  Also, can you please send the 
stack traces of the blocked threads, or at least a description of them? 
  I'd be interested to see what context this happens in.  In particular, 
which IndexReader and Searcher/Scorer/Weight methods does it happen under?

That's impressive!  Good job finding a bottleneck!

I think that is a safe change.  FieldInfos is only modifed by 
DocumentWriter and SegmentMerger, and there is no possibility of other 
threads accessing those instances.  Please submit a patch to the 
developer mailing list.
