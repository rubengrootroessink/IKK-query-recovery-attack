If you're reindexing every night, then document boosting should work 
well.  The other approaches I mentioned would only be required if you 
can't afford to re-index frequently.

I wouldn't bother to pursue these approaches.  Document boosting should 
work well for you, since you're reindexing.

A separate title field will solve this for you.  You can, as you 
suggest, boost title clauses at query time.  Alternately, you could 
boost title fields at index time, although that's less flexible.

Note that if you put titles in a separate field and search both the 
title and the body field then title matches will tend to be naturally 
boosted, since titles tend to be shorter than bodies and hence are less 
normalized.
