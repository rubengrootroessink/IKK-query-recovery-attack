SUBJECT: Re: Using Explain and fieldNorm
DATE: 5 Feb 2004

Using the terminology in

 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html

fieldNorm is defined as

   getBoost(t.field in d) * lengthNorm(t.field in d)

These two values are multipled into a single value at index time, and it 
is unfortunately impossible to separate them at search time, when 
explanations are produced.

If you never apply boosts, fieldNorm() is just lengthNorm().  If you 
apply boosts, then it is these two factors combined.

 How does this relate to the scoring algorithm given in the Similarity javadocs?
