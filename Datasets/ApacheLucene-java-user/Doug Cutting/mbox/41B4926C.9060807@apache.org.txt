In web search, link information helps greatly.  (This was Google's big 
discovery.)  There are lots more links that point to 
http://www.slashdot.org/ than to http://www.slashdot.org/xxx/yyy, and 
many (if not most) of these links have the term "slashdot", while links 
to http://www.slashdot.org/xxx/yyy are somewhat less likely to contain 
the term "slashdot".

As Erik hinted, Nutch uses this information.  It keeps has a database of 
links that point to each page, indexes their anchor text along with the 
page, and boosts highly linked pages more than lesser linked pages.
