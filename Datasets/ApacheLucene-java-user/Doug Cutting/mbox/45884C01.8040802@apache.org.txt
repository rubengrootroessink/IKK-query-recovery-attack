The roadmap in Jira shows 21 issues scheduled for 2.0.1.  If there is in 
fact no intent to merge these into the 2.0 branch, these should probably 
be retargetted for 2.1.0, and the 2.0.1 version should be removed.  In 
general, folks should be able to see the state of release planning in 
Jira.  No dates are set for these releases, which sounds correct.

Discussion of the roadmap should probably be on java-dev.
