Yes.

That's because it uses a Hashtable, which is already synchronized.  But in
the method I sent today, when writing the long lastModified, explicit
synchronization is required.  (Java does not guarantee that 64-bit stores
are atomic.)  It also wouldn't hurt to synchronize in the jhtml example,
although I don't think its required.  It would keep multiple threads from
potentially re-opening the same index several times when it is modified,
improving efficiency.
