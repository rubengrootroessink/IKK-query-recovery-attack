How long is it taking to merge your 5GB index?  Do you have any stats 
about disk utilization during merge (seeks/second, bytes 
transferred/second)?  Did you try buffer sizes even larger than 1MB? 
Are you writing to a different disk, as suggested?

Perhaps.  I'm reticent to make it too easy to change this.  People tend 
to randomly tweak every available knob and then report bugs, or, if it 
doesn't crash, start recommending that everyone else tweak the knob as 
they do.  There are lots of tradeoffs with buffer size, cases that folks 
might not think of (like that a wildcard query creates a buffer for 
every term that matches), etc.

It might help a little if you're merging to the same disk as you're 
reading from, but probably not a lot.  If you're merging to a different 
disk then it shouldn't make much difference at all.
