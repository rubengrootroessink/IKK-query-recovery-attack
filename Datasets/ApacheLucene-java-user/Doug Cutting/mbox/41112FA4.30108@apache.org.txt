I'd like to be assured that the underlying Lucene engine will accept and support negative
boosting.  Is that the case?

Lucene will multiply negative boosts into scores just like positive 
ones.  I've never been convinced that it makes much sense to use 
negative boosts in a scoring formula such as Lucene's, but there's 
nothing stopping you from using them.
