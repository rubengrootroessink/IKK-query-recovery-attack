No, I think this is appropriate.

Nothing.  And even these can only cause an id to change if there have 
been deletions.

Not when you perform the delete.  Later, when you add to or optimize the 
index, the ids for deleted documents are reclaimed.

That is correct.

Document ids never change with an instance of IndexReader.  When you 
open a new index reader you should usually assume that ids have changed.
