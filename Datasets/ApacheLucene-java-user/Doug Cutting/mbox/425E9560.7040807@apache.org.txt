Is this not in the FAQ?  It should be...

IndexWriter can only append documents to an index.

An IndexReader is required to, given a term, find the document number to 
mark deleted.

Also, in the current sources the cost of opening an IndexReader has been 
greatly reduced.  Now the norms and the term index are read lazily, so 
that only a few tiny files are actually read when an IndexReader is 
opened, the rest are merely opened.
