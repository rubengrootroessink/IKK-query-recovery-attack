The RemoteSearchable class (in the latest CVS) will let you do this.  It 
uses Java RMI to let you search indexes on other machines.  With a 
MultiSearcher you can then search a number of independently maintained 
indexes on different machines.  MultiSearcher searches indexes serially, 
but it would be fairly simple to extend it to be able to search in 
parallel, with each search in a separate thread.  That should, in 
theory, scale fairly well, but I don't know if anyone has tried this. 
If you do, please send a message to describing your experience.
