This one is described in the source code, with the comment:

   // floating point, serial, model numbers, ip addresses, etc.
   // every other segment must have at least one digit

According to:

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardTokenizer.html

"Many applications have specific tokenizer needs. If this tokenizer does 
not suit your application, please consider copying this source code 
directory to your project and maintaining your own grammar-based tokenizer."

You need to copy StandardTokenizer.jj, change its package statement, add 
some import statements, add a JavaCC task to your build.xml, and, 
finally, modify the clause following the above comment.
