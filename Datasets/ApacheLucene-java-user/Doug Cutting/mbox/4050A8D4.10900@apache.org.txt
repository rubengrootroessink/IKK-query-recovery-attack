It sounds like you're not batching your updates.

The most efficient approch to update 1000 documents would be to:

   1. Open an IndexReader;
   2. Delete all 1000 documents.
   3. Close the reader;
   4. Open an IndexWriter;
   5. Add all 1000 updated documents;
   6. Close the IndexWriter.

Is that what you're doing?
