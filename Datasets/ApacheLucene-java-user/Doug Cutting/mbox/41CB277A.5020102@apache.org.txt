Do the CFS and non-CVS segment names correspond?  If so, then it 
probably crashed after the segment was complete, but perhaps before it 
was packed into a CFS file.  So I'd trust the non-CFS stuff first.  And 
it's easy to see the size of a non-CVS segement: it's just the number of 
bytes in each of the .f* files.
