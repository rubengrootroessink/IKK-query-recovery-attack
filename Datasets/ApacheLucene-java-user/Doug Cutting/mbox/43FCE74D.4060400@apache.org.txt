SUBJECT: Lucene 1.9 RC1 release available
DATE: 22 Feb 2006

Release 1.9 RC1 of Lucene is now available from:

http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/

This release candidate has many improvements since release 1.4.3,
including new features, performance improvements, bug fixes, etc.  For
details, see:

http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/lucene/java/branches/lucene_1_9/CHANGES.txt?rev=379190

1.9 will be the last 1.x release. It is both back-compatible with 1.4.3
and forward-compatible with the upcoming 2.0 release. Many methods and
classes in 1.4.3 have been deprecated in 1.9 and will be removed in 2.0.
  Applications must compile against 1.9 without deprecation warnings
before they are compatible with 2.0.
