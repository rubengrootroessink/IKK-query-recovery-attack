Are you adding the same 500 terms to each query?  Or even a similar set? 
  If so, then filters could help.  If the 500 terms are different for 
each query, then filters probably won't help you.

A filter requires 1 bit per document in the index.  So, if you have 1M 
documents (which is what I recall you have) then each filter will 
require around 125kB.  You could pre-populate them.  Check out QueryFilter.
