 For example, on my Win2k, I can go up to mergeFactor=300 (or so).  At 400 I get a too many
open files error.  Note: the default mergeFactor of 10 should give no trouble.

Please note that it is never recommended that you set mergeFactor 
anywhere near this high.  I don't know why folks do this.  It really 
doesn't make indexing much faster, and it makes searching slower if you 
don't optimize.  It's a bad idea.  The default setting of 10 works 
pretty well.  I've also had good experience setting it as high as 50 on 
big batch indexing runs, but do not recommend setting it much higher 
than that.  Even then, this can cause problems if you need to use 
several indexes at once, or you have lots of fields.
