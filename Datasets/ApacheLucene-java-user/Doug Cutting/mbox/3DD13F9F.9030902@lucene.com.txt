Readers can only be consumed once and they are never stored.  So a 
retrieved document will never have a Reader-valued field, and if a 
Document instance with a Reader-valued field is added to two indexes 
then this field will in effect only be added to the first index.

Other than that, documents instances may be added to multiple indexes. 
Deleting a document from an index does not alter a retrieved document 
instance.  Note however that retrieved document instances will not 
contain unstored fields.
