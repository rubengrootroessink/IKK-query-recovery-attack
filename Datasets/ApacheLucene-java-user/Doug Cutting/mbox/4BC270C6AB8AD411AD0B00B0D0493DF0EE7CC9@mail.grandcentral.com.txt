SUBJECT: RE: Prefix query case sensitive?
DATE: 30 Oct 2001

Yes, prefix queries are indeed case sensitive.  The problem is that prefixes
do not go through an analyzer, which is where lower-casing is done.  The
reason is that if you were searching for "dogs*" you would not want "dogs"
first stemmed to "dog", since that would then match "dog*", which is not the
intended query.  A workaround for this is simply to lowercase the entire
query before passing it into the query parser.
