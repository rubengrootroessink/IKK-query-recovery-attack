Normalization factors (& document boosts) are represented in the index 
using a one-byte float format with a 3-bit mantissa, which means that 
differences of plus-or-minus 1/8 are rounded to a single value.

For example, a field with 256 tokens by default has a lengthNorm() of 
16.0.  With a three-bit mantissa, values 16.0 to 18.0 are rounded to the 
same value, which means that fields with between 256 and 324 tokens will 
have the same effective length normalization.
