It degenerates to the normal cosine measure.  So it's the cosine measure 
with a few bells and whistles.

The tf(), idf(), lengthNorm() and queryNorm() are directly from the 
cosine measure, although lengthNorm()'s default implemenation uses an 
approximation.

So the non-standard bits are getBoost(), which permits incorporation of 
a-priori document weights, like PageRank, and coord(), which makes OR's 
more AND-like.  Cosine is OR-based, but, for short queries over large 
collections, AND tends to give better results than OR.
