Wildcard queries are case sensitive, while other queries depend on the
analyzer used for the field searched.  The standard analyzer lowercases, so
lowercased terms are indexed.  Thus your "SPINAL CORD" query is lowercased
and matches the indexed terms "spinal" and "cord".  However, since prefixes
should not be stemmed they are not run through an analyzer and are hence
case sensitive.  Your index contains no terms starting with "SPI" or "COR",
since all terms were lowercased when indexed.

This question is frequent enough that we should probably fix it.  Perhaps a
method should be added Analyzer:
  public boolean isLowercased(String fieldName);
When this is true, the query parser could lowercase prefix and range query
terms.  Fellow Lucene developers, what do you think of that?
