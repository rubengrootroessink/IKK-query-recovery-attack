Why not store them in the same field using positionIncrement=0 for the 
types?  Then they won't change positions of non-type tokens.  You should 
distinguish the types syntactically, e.g., prefix them with a space or 
other character that does not occur within words.  That way queries on 
this field for the term "name" won't match a type token.
