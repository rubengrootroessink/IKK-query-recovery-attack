Check out the new Explanation API in the latest CVS sources.  It permits 
one to get a detailed explanation of how a query was scored against a 
document.  Note that these explanations are designed for user perusal, 
not for further computation, and are as expensive to construct as 
re-running the query, but it sounds like that fits your needs.
