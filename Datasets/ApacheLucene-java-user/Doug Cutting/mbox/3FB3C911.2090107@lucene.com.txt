No, in fact it would be slower.  However it could be faster if (a) 
someone contributes a parallel version of MultiSearcher and (b) you're 
either running on a multiple-CPU machine, or your MultiSearcher is 
composed of RemoteSearchers, each on a different machine.  But, for now, 
the answer is no.

It seems that it may be time for a parallel version of MultiSearcher...
