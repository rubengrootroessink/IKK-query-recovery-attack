It should, but it looks like it doesn't.  I have logged a bug against this:
  http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4049

I think this is worth fixing before a 1.2 final release is made.  The
simplest approach is to turn off file-based locking in JDK 1.1.8.  Is that
acceptable?

Note that that release is still in the com.lucene.* packages.
