DATE: 20 Aug 2004

I can successfully use gcc 3.4.0 with Lucene as follows:

ant jar jar-demo

gcj -O3 build/lucene-1.5-rc1-dev.jar build/lucene-demos-1.5-rc1-dev.jar 
-o indexer --main=org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML

./indexer -create docs

It runs pretty snappy too!  However I don't know if there's much milage 
in packaging Lucene as a native library.  It's easy enough for folks to 
compile Lucene this way, and applications built this way are pretty 
small.  The big thing to install is libgcj.
