It would not be too hard to alter Lucene to use serialization for field 
values.  It might be interesting to try this and see how much bigger 
existing indexes become and how much slower indexing and search become. 
  In addition to modifying Document.java and Field.java, one would need 
to change FieldReader.java and FieldWriter.java, but not much more.
