Actually, while we're at it, Indexed and Tokenized are confounded.  A 
single entry would be better, something like:

public final class Index {
   private Index() {}
   public static final Index NO = new Index();
   public static final Index TOKENIZED = new Index();
   public static final Index UN_TOKENIZED = new Index();
}

then calls would look like just:

new Field("name", "value", Store.YES, Index.TOKENIZED);

BTW, I think Stored would be better named Store too.

BooleanQuery's required and prohibited flags could get the same 
treatment, with the addition of a nested class like:

public final class Occur {
   private Occur() {}
   public static final Occur MUST_NOT = new Occur();
   public static final Occur SHOULD = new Occur();
   public static final Occur MUST = new Occur();
}

and adding a boolean clause would look like:

booleanQuery.add(new TermQuery(...), Occur.MUST);

Then we can deprecate the old methods.

Comments?
