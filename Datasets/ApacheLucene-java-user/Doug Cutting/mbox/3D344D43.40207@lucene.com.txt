Yes, that is a common idiom.  In the case of Lucene's FSDirectory, it's still a 
good idea to close it when you know its no longer needed, to minimize the 
number of open files, but sometimes it is difficult to know when it is no 
longer needed.  Finalizers are intended for precisely this purpose.  But you're 
right, probably this should be better documented.
