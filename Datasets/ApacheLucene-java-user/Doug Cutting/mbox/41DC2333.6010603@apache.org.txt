Bill, most folks bundle appropriate versions of required jars with their 
applications to avoid this sort of problem.  How are you deploying 
things?  Are you not bundling a compatible version of the lucene jar 
with each release of your application?  If not, why not?

I'm not trying to be difficult, just trying to understand.

Thanks,

Doug
