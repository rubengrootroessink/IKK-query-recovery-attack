I'm confused.  I'm talking about the table of results you posted.  You 
measured only a single term in those, no?  I don't think results for a 
single term are representative.  If it is term 127 then it will be 
slower than average with an indexInterval of 128, and will be faster 
than average with an indexInterval of 16k.  So to get numbers that are 
representative of an average term at multiple indexIntervals you need to 
test with many terms.  Am I missing something?

Choosing a term that's slower to search actually de-emphasizes the 
effect of this change, since its query time is dominated not by term 
lookup but by posting processing.
