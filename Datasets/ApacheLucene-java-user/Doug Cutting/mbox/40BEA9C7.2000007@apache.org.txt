That sounds slow, unless your queries are very complex.  What are your 
queries like?

Multiple queries executed from different threads using a single searcher 
should not queue, but should run in parallel.  A technique to find out 
where threads are queueing is to get a thread dump and see where all of 
the threads are stuck.  In Solaris and Linux, sending the JVM a SIGQUIT 
will give a thread dump.  On Windows, use Control-Break.
