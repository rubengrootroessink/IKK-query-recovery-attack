I don't think this will make things much faster.  You'll do somewhat 
fewer seeks, but you'll have to make log(N) passes over all of the data, 
about three or four in your case.  Merging ten indexes in a single pass 
should be fastest, as all of the data is only processed once, but the 
read-ahead on each file needs to be sufficient so that i/o is not 
dominated by seeks.  Can you use iostat or somesuch to find how many 
seeks/second you're seeing on the device?  Also, what's the average 
transfer rate?  Is it anywhere near the disk's capacity?  Finally, if 
possible, write the merged index to a different drive.  Reading the 
inputs from different drives may help as well.

One way to force larger read-aheads might be to pump up Lucene's input 
buffer size.  As an experiment, try increasing InputStream.BUFFER_SIZE 
to 1024*1024 or larger.  You'll want to do this just for the merge 
process and not for searching and indexing.  That should help you spend 
more time doing transfers with less wasted on seeks.  If that helps, 
then perhaps we ought to make this settable via system property or somesuch.

Cheers,

Doug
