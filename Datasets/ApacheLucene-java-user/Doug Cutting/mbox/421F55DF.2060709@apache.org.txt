There isn't one.  It is not a part of the public API.  It is an 
unsupported internal feature.

Yes.

It was never public.  It used to be static and final, but is now an 
instance variable.

The place to put getter/setters would be IndexWriter, since that's the 
public home of all other index parameters.  Some changes to 
DocumentWriter and SegmentMerger would be required to pass this value 
through to TermInfosWriter from IndexWriter.
