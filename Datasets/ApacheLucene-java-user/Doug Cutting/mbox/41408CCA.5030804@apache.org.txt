Note that a spell checker used with a search engine should use 
collection frequency information.  That's to say, only "corrections" 
which are more frequent in the collection than what the user entered 
should be displayed.  Frequency information can also be used when 
constructing the checker.  For example, one need never consider 
proposing terms that occur in very few documents.  And one should not 
try correction at all for terms which occur in a large proportion of the 
collection.
