This just looks like a version of FSDirectory with lock files disabled. 
  I think it would be better to just make it easier to disable lock 
files.  Currently this is only possible through setting a system property.

Should we add a method like the following?

   /** Disables the use of lock files. */
   public static FSDirectory.disableLocks();
