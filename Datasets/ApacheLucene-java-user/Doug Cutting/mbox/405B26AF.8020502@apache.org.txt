Sorry.  My mistake.  You did understand my proposal, it was just a bad 
proposal.  Boosting documents is a better approach, but is less 
flexible.  I think the final proposal in my previous message might be 
the best approach (defining a custom coordination function for these 
query clauses).

Again, sorry for the false accusation,

Doug
