(and Google and others) is not a strict boolean language. For example I think the QueryParser
of Lucene do not support parenthesis: a AND (b OR C) 

Lucene's query parser does support parentheses.  As with programming 
language, if you really care about operator precedence, parenthesize 
heavily.  A fully parenthesized boolean query should always be 
interpreted correctly by Lucene's query parser.
