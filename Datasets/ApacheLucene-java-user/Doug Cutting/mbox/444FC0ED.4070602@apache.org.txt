SUBJECT: Re: RAM Directory / querying Performance issue
DATE: 26 Apr 2006

Is this markedly faster than using an MMapDirectory?  Copying all this 
data into the Java heap (as RAMDirectory does) puts a tremendous burden 
on the garbage collector.  MMapDirectory should be nearly as fast, but 
keeps the index out of the Java heap.
