You need to re-write the entire index using a modified 
TermIndexWriter.java.  Optimize rewrites the entire index but is 
destructive.  Merging into a new empty directory is a non-destructive 
way to do this.

Yes, you can go back if you re-optimize or re-merge again.

Also, there's no need to CC my personal email address.
