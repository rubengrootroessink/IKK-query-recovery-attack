No, there is no risk.  The index is never inconsistent, so long as only a
single process is modifying it.  Removing lock files is the standard
crash-recovery method for Lucene.

Lucene only supports index modification by a single process and using a
single IndexWriter object.  However, the index update code is thread safe,
so that many threads may use the same IndexWriter instance concurrently to
add documents.
