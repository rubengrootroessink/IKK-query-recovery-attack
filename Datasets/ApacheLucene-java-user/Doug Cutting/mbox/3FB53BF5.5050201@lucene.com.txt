I'm still confused what the issue here is.  If you're interested in 
stopping exact phrase matching from crossing sentence boundaries, that's 
easy to do with setPositionIncrement().  If you want to score an exact 
phrase match higher than a sloppy phrase match, and in turn score this 
higher than a non-phrasal match, this is all easy to do with Lucene. 
Depending on how much control you need, you could do it with a single 
sloppy phrase query (perhaps with a custom Similarity implementation), 
or perhaps you'd need to combine an OR query of the terms with an exact 
phrase match and with a sloppy phrase match, each with different boosts.

Certainly there are lots of scoring algorithms that one cannot easily 
implement with Lucene.  I'm just not yet clear on what you need to do 
that Lucene cannot support.

Cheers,

Doug
