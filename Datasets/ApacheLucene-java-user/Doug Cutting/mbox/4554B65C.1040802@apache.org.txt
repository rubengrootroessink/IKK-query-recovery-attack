Fields have overheads.  It would be more efficient to implement this as 
a single field with a different value for each boolean flag (as others 
have suggested).

Cached filters will be faster especially when a large portion of the 
documents have the flag set.  If, for example, you have a flag that is 
set in half the documents that is specified in half the queries, then a 
cached filter will have a large impact on not only the performance of 
those queries but on the performance of your service as a whole.
