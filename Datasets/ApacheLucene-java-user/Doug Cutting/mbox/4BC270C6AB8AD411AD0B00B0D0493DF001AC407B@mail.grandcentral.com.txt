Great!

Yes.  Looks good to me.

It is most effiecient to batch deletions and insertions, i.e., perform a
bunch of deletions on a single IndexReader, close it, then perform a bunch
of insertions on a single IndexWriter.  Usually the IndexReader that you do
the deletions on is different than the one other threads are simultaneously
using for searching, since if you close a reader while a search is underway
it will crash the search.

That also sounds fine.
