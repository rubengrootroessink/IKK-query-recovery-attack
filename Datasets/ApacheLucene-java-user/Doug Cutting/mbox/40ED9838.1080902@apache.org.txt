Sorry, I forgot to answer your question: this should work fine.  I don't 
think you should even have to delete that segment.

Also, to elaborate on my previous comment, a mergeFactor of 5000 not 
only delays the work until the end, but it also makes the disk workload 
more seek-dominated, which is not optimal.  So I suspect a smaller merge 
factor, together with a larger minMergeDocs, will be much faster 
overall, including the final optimize().  Please tell us how it goes.

Doug
