Probably.  If you modify the sources of a 1.3-final release, and build 
them, you're not building 1.3-final, but a derivative.  We could call it 
1.3-dev or something, but that would be strange, as 1.3 development is 
closed.  All development is now towards 1.4-based releases.  As a 
side-effect, even if you make no changes to the 1.3-final sources and 
build them, it builds as 1.4-rc1-dev.  I think that is still safer than 
calling it 1.3-final, since 1.3-final should be reserved for the exact 
jar file downloaded from Apache.  In general, anything ending with -dev 
doesn't have any guarantees, and the version before that is only meant 
to be suggestive.
