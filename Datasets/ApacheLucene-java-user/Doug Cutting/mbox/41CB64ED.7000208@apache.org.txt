You could use a custom Similarity implementation for this query, where 
tf() is the identity function, idf() returns 1.0, etc., so that the 
final score is the occurance count.  You'll need to divide by 
Similarity.decodeNorm(indexReader.norms("field")[doc]) at the end to get 
rid of the lengthNorm() and field boost (if any).
