SUBJECT: Re: Which operations change document ids?
DATE: 17 Nov 2003

If they're optimized at different times then the document ids could get 
out of sync, as the optimized version will have deleted documents 
removed, while the un-optimized one won't.

Also, for add/delete to keep document ids in sync you need to also be 
sure to use the same mergeFactor.
