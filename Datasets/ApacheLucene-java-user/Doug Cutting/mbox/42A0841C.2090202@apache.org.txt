I'd use 2/.  In particular, use the same field for the content, title, 
etc., even if when produced by different analyzers.  Have a "lang" field 
that names the language of the document.

At query time, use an analyzer selected by the user's environment (e.g., 
HTTP lang header).  If folks are getting false positives, where a term 
in another language that means something different is matching their 
query, they can use a "lang" pulldown to remove documents from other 
languages, implemented as a Lucene Filter.
