I looked into this.  The package name in the manifest is 
"org/apache/lucene".  But in order for this to work the package name in 
the manifest must: (a) end with a slash; and (b) name a package with 
classes in it, and lucene's classes are all in sub-packages--no classes 
are in "org.apache.lucene".

I've attached a patch that fixes (b) by adding a class in the top-level 
package.  Comments?
