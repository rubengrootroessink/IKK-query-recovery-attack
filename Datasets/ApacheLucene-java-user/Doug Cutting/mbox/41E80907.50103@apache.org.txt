The unstopped version is indeed bigger and slower to build, but it's 
only slower to search when folks search on stop words.  One approach to 
minimizing stopwords in searches (used by, e.g. Nutch & Google) is to 
index all stop words but remove them from queries unless they're (a) in 
a phrase or (b) explicitly required with a "+".  (It might be nice if 
Lucene included a query parser that had this feature.)

Nutch also optimizes phrase searches involving a few very common stop 
words (e.g., "the", "a", "to") by indexing these as bigrams and 
converting phrases involving them to bigram phrases.  So, if someone 
searches for "to be or not to be" then this turns into a search for 
"to-be be or not-to to-be" which is considerably faster since it 
involves rarer terms.  But the more words you bigram the bigger the 
index gets and the slower updates get, so you probably can't afford to 
do this for your full stop list.  (It might be nice if Lucene included 
support for this technique too!)
