Boosts for multiple fields with the same name in the a document are 
multiplied together at index time to form the boost for that field of 
that document.  At search time, if multiple query terms from the same 
field match the same document, then that document's field boost is 
multiplied into the score for both terms, and these scores are then 
added.  If boost(field,doc) is the boost, and raw(term,doc) is the raw, 
unboosted score (I'm simplifying things) then the score for a two term 
query is something like:

   boosted(<t1,t2>,d) =
     boost(t1.field,d)*raw(t1,d) + boost(t2.field,d)*raw(t2,d)

which, when t1 and t2 are in the same field, is equivalent to:

   boosted(<t1,t2>,d) = boost(field,d)*(raw(t1,d) + raw(t2,d))

The explain() feature prints things in the first form, where the boosts 
appear in separate components of a sum.

Does that help?
