These would be great.  Who will implement them?
I was only listing tasks that I plan to do.

I think the best API for such converters is a method that takes a
java.io.InputStream and returns a java.io.Reader containing plain text,
e.g.:
     public static java.io.InputStream getText(java.io.Reader);
That way they can easily be used by Lucene analyzers.

Should we put converters in org.apache.lucene.document?

Contributions anyone?

Doug
