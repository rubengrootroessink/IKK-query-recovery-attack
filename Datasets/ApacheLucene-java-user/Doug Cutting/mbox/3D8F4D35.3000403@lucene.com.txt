Lucene might be overkill, but indeed it can solve this.  So if it's not 
way too slow, you might just go ahead and use Lucene, as building this 
from scratch could be a fair amount of work.

However, if Lucene is not giving you adequate performance for this task, 
then you might just try rewriting your queries as regular expressions 
and then the text of each document to see if it matches.  This may be 
difficult if you're depending on Lucene's analysis modules to perform 
stemming, etc.
