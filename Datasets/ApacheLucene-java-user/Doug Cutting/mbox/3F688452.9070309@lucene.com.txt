If you use the same date range repeatedly then you can make things fast 
by replacing it with a filter that you re-use.  Try using a QueryFilter 
with your date range query as the query.  Save the QueryFilter object 
and use it again with future queries.  The first query will be slow, but 
subsequent queries will use the cached results of the first.

This is the recommended way to implement a "within the last month", 
"within the last year", etc. feature.  You could even pre-fetch the 
filter whenever you update the index, by evaluating a query before you 
put a new IndexReader in production, so that even the first real user 
query is fast.
