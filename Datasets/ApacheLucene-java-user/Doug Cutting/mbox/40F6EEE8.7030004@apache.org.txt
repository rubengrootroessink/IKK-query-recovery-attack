Imperfectly.

The QueryParser knows nothing about the index, so it does not know which 
fields were tokenized and which were not.  Moreover, even the index does 
not know this, since you can freely intermix tokenized and untokenized 
values in a single field.

It is very possible.  A good way to handle this is to use 
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper.
