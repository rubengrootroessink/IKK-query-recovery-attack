Lucene is in theory able to support up to 2B documents in a single 
index.  Folks have sucessfully built indexes with several hundred 
million documents.  10 million should not be a problem.

For simple 2-3 term queries, with average sized documents (~10k of text) 
you should get decent performance (1 second / query) on a 10M document 
index.  An index typically requires around 35% of the plain text size.
