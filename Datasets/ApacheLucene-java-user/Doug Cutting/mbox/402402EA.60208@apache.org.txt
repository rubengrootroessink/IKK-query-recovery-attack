Perhaps, but in theory it shouldn't be a lot worse than, e.g., accessing 
an index over NFS.  The tables might get fragmented as the index 
evolves, and database optimization might help performance.

Transactional consistency is another reason: index data and application 
data can always be synchronized.

Also, in some environments, the only supported access to reliable, 
redundant, shared data might be through a database.  An SQLDirectory 
would enable one to deploy a Lucene-based application in such an 
environment without having to, e.g., get permission from operations to 
enable NFS.
