It should not be possible to corrupt an index this way.

If you use this method, it is possible to corrupt things.  In 
particular, if you unlock an index that another process is modifying, 
then modify it, then these two processes might step on one another.  So 
this method should only be called when you are certain that no one else 
is modifying the index.

There is no index integrity checker.  I suppose one could implement one 
by implementing a NullDirectory that ignores all reads and writes, then 
use IndexWriter.addIndexes() to add the index to be checked to a 
NullDirectory.  That would parse all of the files in the index.
