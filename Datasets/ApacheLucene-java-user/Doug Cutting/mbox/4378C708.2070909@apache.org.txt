It would actually not be too hard to change things so that there was 
such a parameter that could be set on an IndexReader.  It would 
determine the fraction of entries in the .tii file that are kept in RAM. 
  So if the parameter were, e.g., 10, then only every tenth entry in the 
.tii file would be kept in RAM, equivalent to 10x the indexInterval used.
