Documents are only re-numbered after there have been deletions.  Once 
there have been deletions, renumbering may be triggered by any document 
addition or index optimization.  Once an index is optimized, no 
renumbering will be performed unril more deletions are made.

If you require a persistent document id that survives deletions, then 
add it as a field to your documents.
