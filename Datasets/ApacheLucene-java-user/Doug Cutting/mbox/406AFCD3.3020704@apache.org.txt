Does it just seem inefficient, or is is it actually too inefficient in 
practice?  Folks have benchmarked this, and, for documents less than 10k 
characters or so, re-tokenizing is fast enough.  But it can be slow if 
the majority of your documents are longer than this.

Several solutions have been proposed.  The simplest is to not scan past 
the first 10k or so for snippets unless nothing relevant is found in the 
first 10k.  I don't think Mark's highlighter yet does this, but I might 
be mistaken.

Lucene indexes record that a term is the nth term, not that it occurs at 
the nth character in the text.  The latter is needed for highlighting, 
but storing this would make indexes much larger and slower to update.
