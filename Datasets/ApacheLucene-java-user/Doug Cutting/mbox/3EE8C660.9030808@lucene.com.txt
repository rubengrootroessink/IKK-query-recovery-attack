This was discussed recently on lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org in a thread 
whose subject contains "too many hits - OutOfMemoryError".

I checked in a patch which limits the number of terms that a wildcard is 
permitted to expand into.  The default is 1000.  If a term expands to 
more than that then an exception is thrown.  Each term that a wildcard 
expands into requires around 2kB.  So this limits each wildcarded query 
term to 2MB.  If you have queries with large numbers of wildcarded terms 
then you might consider also limiting that.

This patch is in the latest version of Lucene in CVS, but not yet in a 
release.
