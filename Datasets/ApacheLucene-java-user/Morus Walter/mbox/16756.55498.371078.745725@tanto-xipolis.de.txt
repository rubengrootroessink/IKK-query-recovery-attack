A proximity search is done by a PhraseQuery with a slop.
The slop makes the PhraseQuery to perform a proximity search (so you can
argue that the name is problematic).
That's what query parser creates.

SpanQueries where introduced later. Maybe you can get the effect of a
proximity search by SpanQueries also, but that's not handled by the query
parser.
