recently there was a discussion on this list, how to use token positions
to store a sentence boundary in the index.
Basically you increase the token position by some large number (e.g. 1000)
at a sentence boundary. Then "x y"~20 won't match across sentence boundaries
(unless you use something like "x y"~1020).
