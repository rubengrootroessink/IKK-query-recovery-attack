because query parser is broken :-(

I suggested a fix some time ago (look at 
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25820) but this didn't
get into the lucene sources so far.
Otis promised to look at it but I guess he didn't find time for this so far.

OTOH if your users don't enter the query as a text string, it's a bad idea
to use query parser anyway in most cases.
