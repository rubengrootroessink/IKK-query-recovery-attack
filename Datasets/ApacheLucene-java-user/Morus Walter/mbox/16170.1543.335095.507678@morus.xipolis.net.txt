Hmm. Sorry, I was a bit unprecise (at least in the quoted part) so I'm 
not sure, if I got that correctly. Access over NFS is readonly, but 
there would be write access on the NFS server itself (local filesystem).
Is this ok? Or should I use a "update a copy of the index and exchange
indexes afterwards" strategy?
