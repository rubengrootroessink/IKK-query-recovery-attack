IIRC there are suggestions to fix that using lock mechanisms from java 1.4
(or so; I guess it's something from nio). This was placed back because
lucene doesn't require java 1.4 yet.
There are also older (2002?) suggestions to work around using jni and
symlinks for creating lock files (on unix).
Alternatively you could put the lock into a relational database, if
your project already uses one.

Sorry Chris, no references but you might search the archives of this
list.
