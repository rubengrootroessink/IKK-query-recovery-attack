You have to bundle all writes at one point and serialize deletions and
imports.
That is:
open a reader for deleting
delete the documents to be deleted
close that reader
open a writer for adding content
add documents
close that writer
begin at start.

It's up to you, whether you open a reader to delete single documents and
a writer for adding a single document or use batches of several documents,
but you cannot escape the need to serialize the writes.
