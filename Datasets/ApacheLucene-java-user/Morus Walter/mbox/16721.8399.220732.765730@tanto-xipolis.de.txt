Where's the problem?
100 is a text as well as an integer (one has to keep in mind, that treating
it as text changes sort order, which may require leading 0 to compensate).
Lucene does not understand the "words" you index anyway.

So if a document has a field `category' with content '017 049 112' and 
some `text' field with content 'bla fasel foo bar' and you do a range 
query 100 - 140 on category (search all documents containing any word, 
that is alphanumerically sorted between 100 and 140) and a apropriate 
query on text it will find, what you want.

There are some caveats like choosing an apropriate analyzer or considering
the maximum number of terms the range query covers, but in principle there
is no difference between a text field containing words and a category 
field containing categories.
