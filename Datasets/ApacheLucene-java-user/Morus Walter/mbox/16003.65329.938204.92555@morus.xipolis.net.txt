I'm not sure that I understood everything, but there's one question coming
into my mind:
Why can't you just invert your taxonomy, that is expand each drug/condition 
in the indexed documents to the list of the drug/condition classes it belongs 
to? Instead of expanding the query.

An analyzer in lucene is just the instance used in preparing a document
for indexing and a query term for searching. It does tokenisation of input
and any additional preprocessing you implement.
So your specific analyzer might take a drug as input and output all
relevant terms. That's how you could implement your aproach in lucene.
I cannot comment on combining thousands of terms in a query though.
