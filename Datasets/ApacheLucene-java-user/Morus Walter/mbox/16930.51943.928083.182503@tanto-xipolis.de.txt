A AND B OR C creates a query that requires A and B. C influcenes the 
score, but is neither sufficient nor required for a match.

IMO query parser is broken for queries mixing AND and OR without explicit
braces.
My favorite sample is `a AND b OR c AND d' which equals `a AND b AND c AND d'
in query parser.

I suggested a patch some time ago, but it's still pending in bugzilla.
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25820

Don't know if it's still usable with current sources.
