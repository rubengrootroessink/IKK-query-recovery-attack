No. You could do a ( ( french-query ) or ( english-query ) ) construct using
one query. So query construction would be a bit more complex but querying
itself wouldn't change.

The first thing I'd do in your case would be to look at the differences
in the output of english and french snowball stemmer.
I don't speak any french, but probably you might even use both stemmers
on all texts.
