a^-1 OR b
A boost of -1 means that the score gets smaller if a document contains a 
with that boost appears. So it's somehow similar to NOT a, though less strict.
A boost of 0.1 means that the score is increased less for an occurance of a.

Usually one just want's the latter, but it's not the same.
