Well you could also go through the index after merging once and delete
all duplicates.
The API allowes you to loop over all values for a given field and all
documents for a given value. So I'd just loop over all values and delete
all but the first documents.
It's an extra step but it should be fast (especially since
deleting simply means mark as deleted here).
If you optimize the index as a last step, the deleted documents will
be removed from the index.
