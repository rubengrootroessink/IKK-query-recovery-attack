Query parser cannot do that.

In that case you cannot expand the wildcard terms.

You cannot mix boolean queries and proximity queries.

What comes next to your query is phrase prefix query, but that's designed
for something like 'Cole S*' not 'Cole* S*'.

Searching for 'Cole* S*' means to search for all combinations of possible 
expansions of Cole and S. You can do that by expanding the terms yourself
but I'd expect that a) to be slow and b) to create trouble with the maximum
number of boolean terms (or memory usage).
Given that there are 10 expansions of Cole and 500 of S (that's not just
first names, that all names) you have to do 5000 proximity searches.

I would use different fields for first and last name in this case.
And if it's relevant to search for the first character of the first name,
I'd index that additionally.
