If the change rate of the index and the number of commonly used
type combinations aren't too large, cached filters might be another 
alternative.
Of couse the filter would have to be recreated whenever the index changes.
The advantage is, that you save searching for the types for each query
where the filter is reused while you can keep all documents within one 
index.
