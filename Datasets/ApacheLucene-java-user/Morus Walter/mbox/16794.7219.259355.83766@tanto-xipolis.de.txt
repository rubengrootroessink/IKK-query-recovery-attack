simply do it.
The only things you have to keep in mind, is
a) you cannot have more than one process/thread writing to lucene
b) an index reader/search will not see updates unless it's closed
   and reopened.

So all you need is your web app and your indexing process and some
way to inform the web app after indexing, that it should reopen the index.
