How did you create the phrase query?
You have to analyze the string with the same analyzer you used during
indexing and add all created tokens. Given that the analyzer creates
more than one token a TermQuery won't work.
The fakt, that you needed the quotes in query parser, indicates that this
is the case.

Did you look at the serialized form of the query created by query parser
and your attempts? That is used query.toString("some field") to see
what's going on?
