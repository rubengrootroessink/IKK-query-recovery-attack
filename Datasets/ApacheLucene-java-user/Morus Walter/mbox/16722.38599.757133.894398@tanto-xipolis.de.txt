Your number/handle samples look ok to me if the default operator is AND.

Note that wildcard expressions are not analyzed so if service is 
stemmed to anything different from service, it's not surprising that
service* doesn't find it.

I think you should look at a) what's the analyzed form of your terms
and b) how does the rewritten query look like (there's a rewrite method
for query that expands wildcard queries into basic queries).
