He said he wants to have one term less important than others (at least
that's what I understood).
That's done by positive boost factors smaller than 1.0 (e.g. 0.5 or 0.1) 
and might be called 'negative boosting' (such as breking is a form of 
negative acceleration).

If you use negative boost factors you would even decrease the score of
a match (not only increase it less) and risk of ending with a negative
score. I don't think that would be a good idea.
