Right. As long as you can control the reader instance from the update
process, it's better to do so, instead of checking, if the reader for search
is still up to date in the reader itself.

I guess the alternative would be to have a reference counting that is
increased whenever a search starts and decreased when the hits object
is no longer used.
You could then set a flag and close the index when the count reaches 0.
