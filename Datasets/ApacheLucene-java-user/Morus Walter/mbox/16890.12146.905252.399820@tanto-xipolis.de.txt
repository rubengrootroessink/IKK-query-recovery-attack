The field parameter simply defines the default field for all queries 
without an explicit field specification (<field>:).
Using 'field AND field' as default field does not make sense but does
not hurt as long as the default field is not used.
I'm not sure why you choose that.

Further name:\"john\" and name:john should be the same.
