IMO there's another option, at least as long as the number of your documents
isn't too high.
Sorting already creates a list of all field values for some field that 
will be used during the search for sorting.
Nothing prevents you from using that aproach for search restriction also.
The advantage is, that you can create that list once and use it for different
ranges until the index is changed whereas a filter can only represent
one range.
The disadvantate is, that you have to keep one value for each document in
memory instead of one bit in a filter.

I did that (before the sort code was introduced) for date queries in order
to be able to sort and restrict searches on dates.
But I haven't thought about how a general API for such a solution might look 
like so far.

Of course it depends on a number of questions, which way is preferable.
How often is the index modified, are range queries usually done for the
same or different ranges, how many documents are indexed and so on.
