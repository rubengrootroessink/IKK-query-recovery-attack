Hmm.
If user A creates a lock in /tmp and lucene crashes leaving the lock, user
B won't be able to remove the lock (unless B is root) since /tmp usually
has permissions 
drwxrwxrwt   12 root     root         8192 Jul 12 08:50 tmp/
were the 't' means that normal users may delete only their own files 
(at least on linux and IIRC solaris).

Or did I miss something?
Lucene might work around this by creating a directory in java.io.tmpdir
setting apropriate permission (can that be done with java os independently?)
and put the lock there.
