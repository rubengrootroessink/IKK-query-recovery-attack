Hi Jan,

thanks for your answer.

The computer.
Of course you're right with the nfs server. That's one drawback, but the 
idea is to have a RAID system, that might be switched to another maschine, 
if the first maschine fails. If the RAID system has enough internal 
redundancy it's failure should be reasonable improbable. 
It remains a single point of failure though.

This is not about a very high availablity solution.
We just want to have a bit more than just relying on one maschine.
Scenarios like manual switches, if a machine fails, are ok.

So far I thought about simple http calls, to send the import/delete
requests to the webservers. They are servlet servers anyway.
What improvements would you expect from using JMS?

That's an interesting idea. Unfortunately we don't have any experience
with such a setup. Any suggestions for intel/linux?

And how reliable is such a solution with respect to consistency of the
lucene index. I mean in this szenario one of the webservers would do the
import. Would it be safe to simply reopen searchers on the other webserver?
Basically that's the same question as for the nfs server.
