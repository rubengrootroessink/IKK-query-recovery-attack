if you create the query using the API use a boolean query to combine
the two basic queries.

If you use query parser use AND or OR.

Note that range queries are expanded into boolean queries (OR combined)
which may be a problem if the number of terms matching the range is too
big. Depends on your date entries and especially how precise they are.
Alternatively you might consider using a filter.
