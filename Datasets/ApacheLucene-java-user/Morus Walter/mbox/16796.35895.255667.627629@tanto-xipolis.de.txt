If your numbers are in the interval MIN/MAX and MIN<0 you can shift
that to a positive interval 0 ... (MAX-MIN) by subtracting MIN from
each number.

Alternatively you have to find a string represantation providing the
correct order for signed integers.
E.g.
-0010
-0001
00000
00001
00020
should work (in the range -9999..99999), since '0' has a higher ascii 
(unicode) code than '-'.
Of course the analayzer has to preserve the '-' and the '-' should not
be eaten by the query parser in case you use it. I don't know if there are
problems with that, but I suspect that at least for the query parser.
