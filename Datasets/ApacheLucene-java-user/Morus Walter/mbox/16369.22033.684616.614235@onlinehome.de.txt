I tried to raise that question in the first place. But there wasn't much
responce.
So I decided to make a concrete suggestion, how to change things.

To me the problem is, that there are two forms of queries
- boolean queries (a OR b AND c...)
- list of terms where some are flagged required and some are flagged forbidden
 (a +b -c ...) (in two forms: with default or and default and)

For each of these it seems pretty clear, what they mean, but if you start
to combine the two in one query, I don't know what that should mean.

What's the meaning of a OR b c +d ?
(Acutally there must be two meanings, one for default or, one for default and).
Maybe it's obvious, but I fail to see it.

Then you decide to do a complete rewrite of the query parser.
That's something I wanted to avoid.

I don't think that it matters how you implement a grammer though.
The problem here is, that you have to define the grammer first.

But I agree that doing it by JavaCC means is less error prone.

Right. Especially if there's no definition of correct...
