Hmm.
Isn't org.apache.lucene.analysis.snowball.SnowballFilter already
what you described?
It can be used like 
	result = new SnowballFilter(result, "German");
where result is some TokenStream.
(Of course you'd use "French" instead of "German" for french.)

I just tried the german snowball filter and found this quite
easy.
