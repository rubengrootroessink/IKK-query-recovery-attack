Hi,

is it intentional that '?' matches exactly one character within
wildcard terms but one or zero characters at the end of wildcard terms?

That is:
r?? matches r ra rab ...
whereas
r?b matches rab rbb ... and not rb

The AFAIK common definition of '*' and '?' (e.g. in unix glob pattern) is
to match exactly one character for '?' independent of it's position.

I think lucenes behavior comes from WildcarTermEnum.java line 157
where WILDCARD_CHAR and WILDCARD_STRING are ignored at the end of the
pattern, if the strings matched so far.

greetings
	Morus
