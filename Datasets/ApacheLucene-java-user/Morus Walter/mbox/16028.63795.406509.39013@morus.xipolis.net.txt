What's the use of a query in this scenario?
I mean, if you have a filter describing the documents you want to find,
you can simply loop over the filter and fetch the documents, for which the
bit is set, using a IndexReader.
Ok, it's a few lines of code to write (<= 10 I guess) but I don't see any
advantage from combining this with a query.
