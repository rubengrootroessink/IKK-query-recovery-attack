On unix, open files are still there, even if they are deleted (that is,
there is no link (filename) to the file anymore but the file's content
still exists), on windows you cannot delete open files, so Lucene 
AFAIK (I don't use windows) postpones the deletion to a time, when the 
file is closed.

AFAIK optimising creates new files.

The only problem that might occur, is opening a reader during index change
but that's handled by a lock.
