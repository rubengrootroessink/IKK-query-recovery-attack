boolean search allocates clauses for all tokens having the prefix or
matching the wildcard expression.

Because there are fewer tokens starting with a.

You need to create your own version of Wildcard- and Prefix-Query
that takes a maximum term number and ignores further clauses.
And you need a variant of the query parser that uses these queries.

This can be done, even without recompiling lucene, but you will have to
do some programming at the level of lucene queries.
Shouldn't be hard, since you can use the sources as a starting point.

I guess this does not exist because the lucene developer decided to prefer
a query error rather than uncomplete results.
