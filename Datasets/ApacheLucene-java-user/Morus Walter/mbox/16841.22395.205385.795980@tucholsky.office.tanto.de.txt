There used to be a list (ASCII) on some ftp server at unicode.org.
I have a version 'UnicodeData.txt' here.
It lists ~ 12000 characters in the form
01A4;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER P WITH HOOK;Lu;0;L;;;;;N;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER P HOOK;;;01A5;
01A5;LATIN SMALL LETTER P WITH HOOK;Ll;0;L;;;;;N;LATIN SMALL LETTER P HOOK;;01A4;;01A4

If you cannot find that list somewhere I can mail you a copy.

It would be a nice contribution if you could add your filter to lucenes
sandbox, once it's finished.
