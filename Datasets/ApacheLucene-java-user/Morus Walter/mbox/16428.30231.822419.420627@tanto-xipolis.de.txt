An alternative to using date ranges or date filters is to use an aproach
similar to the recently introduced sort on a integer field (cvs only, so far).

That is, 
- create an array of the dates of all documents
- extend the low level search, in a way that it uses this array and a
  upper and lower limit to do an additional selection (that's similar 
  to what the filter does)

The advantage over a filter is, that you can use the same array for arbitrary
date ranges while a filter is specific to a date range.

OTOH the array needs to be newly created whenever the index changes. The 
cost depends on the number of different dates and the array size of course.
I did some tests and found, that it takes less than .1 seconds on a
P4 2400 Mhz to create such an array for ~ 100000 documents, ~ 10000 different
dates.
So it depends a bit on how often your index changes, if that's a good way.

Another disadvantage is, that you will have to dig a little bit deeper into 
lucenes search classes.
And memory usage might get a problem, once you exceed a few million documents.
