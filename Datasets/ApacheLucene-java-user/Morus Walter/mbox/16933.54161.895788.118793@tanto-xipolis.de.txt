I guess it just patches QueryParser.jj so 
patch < {patchfile}
in the directory where QueryParser.jj is found, should do (on the command
line of course).
If you're on windows, I don't know if there's a patch programm, but you 
might get one from cywin.

Then you have to rebuild lucene.jar from it's sources...
