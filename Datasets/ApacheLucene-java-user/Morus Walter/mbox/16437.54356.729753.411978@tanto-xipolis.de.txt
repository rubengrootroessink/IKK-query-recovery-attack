You don't tell us how your ids look like, but Field.text("id", value)
tokenizes value, that is splits value into whatever the analyzer considers
to be a token, and creates a term for each token. 
Whereas new Term("id", value) creates one term containing value.

So I guess your ids are considered several token by the analyzer you use
and therefore they won't be matched by the term you construct for the delete.

Using keyword fields instead of text fields for the id should help.
