I think it would be worth to take a look at the sorting code.

The idea of the sorting code is to have an array of the dates for each doc
in memory and access this array for sorting.
Now sorting isn't the only thing one might use this array for.
Doing a range check is another.
So you might extend the sorting code by a range selection.

There is no code for this in lucene and you have to create your own searcher
but it gives you a fast way to search and sort by date.

I did this independently from the new sorting code (I just started a little
to early) and it works quite well.
The only drawback from this (and the new sorting code) is, that it requires
an array of field values that must be rebuilt each time the index changes.
Shouldn't be a problem for 60000 documents.
