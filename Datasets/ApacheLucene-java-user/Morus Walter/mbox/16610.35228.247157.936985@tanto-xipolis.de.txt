Maybe I missunderstood something, but a search shouldn't get hits, since a 
search removes hits from deleted documents (given that the term doen't
occur in other undeleted documents).

OTOH looking at the TermEnum one will still find terms of deleted documents.

AFAIK deleting a document doesn't mean removing a document from the index.
Deleting a document means marking the document deleted.
The document will be removed at the next index optimization (or 
implicit merge I guess; but I'm not sure about that)

I don't know when the frequency numbers are updated though.

So if I was Lars I'd call optimize after deleting and be on the safe side...
(which might be a problem for frequent deletions on large indexes though)
