An analyzer doesn't change the stored content. Only the indexed tokens.
So if something threw away the tags (or just the spectial characters) it
must have been before Field.Text(String, String) was called.
This of course wouldn't be surprising, since indexing xml often means
to extract the text from an xml document and index that text.
