I think he doesn't want the contents but a term list for these contents.
Something like
1	  1
4	  1
content	  2
document  2
for his sample, where the number is the fequency of the term.

I don't think that you can easily get that from one lucene index.
The easiest way to get a term listing for one field of one document is
to use the term vector support. But for a document collection that would
still mean to join all term vectors of all matched documents.

I would suggest to index the different collections in separated indexes.
Then you can simply loop over all terms.
