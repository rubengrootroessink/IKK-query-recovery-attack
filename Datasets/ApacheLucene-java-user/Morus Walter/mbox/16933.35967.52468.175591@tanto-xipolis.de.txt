I don't see an alternative to looping through all terms and look at their
frequency.

that's independent of what you search for.
sort by is done by creating a in memory array of all field values of all
documents. This array is cached and reused for further searches.

So if you use sort, doing one sort after creating the index might be useful.

For reading relevant parts of the index into OS caches, I'd rather use
the most commonly searched terms, than the most frequent ones.
