I don't think you can.
A document does not even have to be indexed yet.

So either you're dealing with some document found in the index, then you 
should have the document number already, or you have a document independently
from the index, then you have to analyze the documents content and count
yourself.

Note that term vector support might be useful if you're interested in more
than one term (but that requires the document number again).
