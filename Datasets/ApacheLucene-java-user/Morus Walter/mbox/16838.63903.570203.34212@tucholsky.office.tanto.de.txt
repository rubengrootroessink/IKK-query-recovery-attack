I guess you mean city:(... and so on.

The first query searches documents containing 'London' in city, scoring
results also containing Amsterdam higher, and containing 1_street or 2_street
in address.
The second query searches for documents containing both London and Amsterdam
in city and 1_street and 2_street in address.
Note the the + before London in the second query doesn't mean anything.
