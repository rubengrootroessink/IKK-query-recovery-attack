I think one could introduce a special syntax in query parser for
keyword fields. Query parser wouldn't analyze them at all in this case.
Something like 
field#Keyword
or
field#"keyword containing blanks"

I haven't thought through all consequences for
field#(keywordA keywordB otherfield:noKeyword)
but I think it should be doable.

Doesn't make query parser simpler, on the other hand.
