No.
You can have one IndexWriter and an arbitray number of IndexReaders, that
don't write to the index.
Despite it's name IndexReader is used for deletions. Since this is a write
operation, it cannot be done, while a IndexWrite is open.
But that's the only limitation.

IndexReaders will not see changes introduced by writers until they are
closed and reopened. And one should be aware that keeping the Readers open
after changes means that the associated files are kept open, which may result
in too many open files.

AFAIK there's no problem with searching during optimizing of an index.

IIRC the FAQ says, that optimizing should only be done, if you know, that
your index won't change for some time.
As far as I understand lucenes indexing, the reason is, that lucene will
automatically merge the index files (based on MergeFactor), which is, 
what optimizing does.
