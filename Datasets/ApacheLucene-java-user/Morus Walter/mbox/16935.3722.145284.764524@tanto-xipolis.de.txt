That searches for documents having
a in field1 but not b in field1 OR a in field2 but not b in field2 ...

so a document having one field with a but without b will be found even if
it contains b in some other field.

You need a query
(field1:a OR field2:b OR field3:c) -(field1:b OR field2:b OR field3:c)

I'm not familliar with MFQP, so I cannot say if it can help you with that.
