Hmm. I don't think keyword fields can be used with query parser,
which is probably one of the problems here.
He did try keyword fields.

IMO it should work with a text field and the same analyzer for indexing
and query parser though it might return additional hits. The latter issue
is why it's usually a bad idea not to use keyword for url values, I agree 
with that.
It should be possible to see what's going wrong from looking at 
a) the tokens generated by the analyzer and
b) the parsed query (using the to_string method).
But I'm just curious to understand why it's not working.

At the end, I'd also suggest a keyword field and not using query parser
for this field. Creating queries without query parser isn't hard.
