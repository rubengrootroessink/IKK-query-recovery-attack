There's no way to delete fields of a document in lucene. You can only 
delete documents. So update means to delete the old document for a 
given record and add the new record.

Deletion can be done based on the pk? Lucene will do the index search 
for you:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#delete(org.apache.lucene.index.Term)

The hard part is that you cannot have an index reader doing deletions
and an index writer doing document adds at the same time.
So you have to delete first and add then.

You can access all documents having a certain term using 
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html#termDocs(org.apache.lucene.index.Term)
if you really want to do that yourself...
