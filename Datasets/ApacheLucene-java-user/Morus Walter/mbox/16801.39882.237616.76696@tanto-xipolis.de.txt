I suggested that in a recent discussion and Erik Hatcher objected that
it isn't a good idea, to require that users know which field to query
in which way. I guess he is right.
If your query isn't entered by users, you shouldn't use query parser in
most cases anyway.

Look at PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper. 
You will probably have to write a keyword analyzer (unless you can use
whitespace analyzer in your case).
