If you use lucene as a search server you have to provide the query somehow.
E.g. we have an php application, that sends queries to a lucene search
servlet.
In this case it's justifiable to serialize the query into query parser
syntax on the client side and have query parser read the query again on
the server side.
I don't recall any problems with the aproach since we clean up the user
before constructing the query.
