can you post the java code used for querying?
Actually I don't understand, why you have to use one query for each 
attribute (that's what lucene calls field - right?).

Isn't doing a query:
create a searcher
create a query
do the search and get a list of hits
get the documents from the hitlist
get any field you want from the document
?

So why do you have to perform one query for each field?
