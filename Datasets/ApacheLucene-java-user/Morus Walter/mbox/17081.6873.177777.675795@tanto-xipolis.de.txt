Sure. Simply index reversed words.

The reason why QP prohibits wildcards at the beginning is performance.
If there is some prefix, only terms using this prefix need to be examined,
if they match the wildcard.
IIRC you can use wildcards in the beginning if you create the query using
the api but it will be slow.

So the performant solution is to have an additional field containing the
tokens in reversed character order.
Won't help for *foo* though.
