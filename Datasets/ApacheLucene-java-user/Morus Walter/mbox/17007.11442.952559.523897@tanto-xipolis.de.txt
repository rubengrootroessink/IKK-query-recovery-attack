Wouldn't it be easier to fake that by using a proximity query and a document
start marker?
E.g. index `xxxstartxxx some text other text'
and search for "xxxstartxxx some"~10000000 or "xxxstartxxx other"~10000000
If I understand proximity query correctly the latter should have a lower
score (given that 'some' and 'other' have equal scores). Untested though.

Alternatively it should be able to write a query that does such a scoring
directly (without the document start anchor) by the same means proximity
query uses. Proximity query uses positional information so it should be 
possible to use that information for scoring based on document position also.
