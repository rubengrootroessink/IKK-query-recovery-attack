If your field is named 'in' you shouldn't search in 'id'. Right?

Well, indexing and analyzing are different things.
UnStored means, the number is not stored (as the name says) but indexed.
And IIRC it's analyzed before indexing. Shouldn't make a difference for
a single number.

What I'd use in this case is an unstored keyword (given that you really don't
want to have the id returned from lucene, which is the consequence of
not storing).
I'm not sure if there's a method to create such a field, but you can do it
by setting the flags directly.
