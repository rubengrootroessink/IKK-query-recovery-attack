Yes. January. And it's still in bugzilla. :-(

But it would not make a difference in this case, since AND has higher 
precedence, so 
a OR b AND c 
is
a OR (b AND c)
which is correctly done as
a (+b +c) 
in boolean queries.
a +b +c is different, since it won't find documents containing only a.
Occurences of a only modify score in this case.
