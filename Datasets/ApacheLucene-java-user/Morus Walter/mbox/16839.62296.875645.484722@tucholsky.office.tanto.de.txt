I guess you missunderstood the question.

I think he want's to know how to create a query parser understanding 
something like 'a UND b' as well as 'a AND b' to support localized 
operator names (german in this case).

AFAIK that can only be done by copying query parsers javacc-source and
adding the operators there.
Shouldn't be difficult, though it's a bit ugly since it implies code
duplication. And there will be no way of choosing the operators dynamically
at runtime. One will need to have different query parsers for different
languages.
