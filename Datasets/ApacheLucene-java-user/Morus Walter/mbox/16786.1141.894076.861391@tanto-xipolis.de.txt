No. But this is an independent issue from the `stopword AND word' problem.
The `stopword AND word' problem just has to be taken care of in that context
also.
Bug 25820 basically is about better handling of AND and OR in a query.
Currently `a AND b OR c AND d'  equals  `a AND b AND c AND d' in query 
parser.

If there are no current nightly builds, I guess you will have to get the
sources it from cvs directly.

But the fix seems to be included in 1.4.2.
