how would you do that? This requires to know the ids that will be added
in future.
Let's say you start with strings 'a' and 'b'. Later you add a document
with 'aa'. How do you know that you should make 'a' 1 and 'b' 3 to be
prepared for 'aa'?

To me Erics suggestion makes sense.
The problem might be however: you have to sort all values, while keeping
the strings means that you sort only the hits.
And you should be aware that you have to rebuild the array each time the
index changes.
