SweetSpotSimilarity (I misspelled it previously) defines a range of lengths
which is not normalized (this is the sweet spot) and a slop by which longer
or shorter documents are "punished" relative to the gap from the defined
range. It takes parameters for defining the range and the slop. See here:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_1_0/api/contrib-misc/org/apache/lucene/misc/SweetSpotSimilarity.html

I am not familiar with the use of Solr for this, I hope someone else will
answer this...

If I read this correctly it seems the part about dividing by
    (Total Number of terms in that document)
does not describe the default scoring in Lucene, where this value, aka the
doc length, only takes part in the length normalization. This is also
explained here:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_1_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html

Once you are able to actually compare the score computation details
(Explain) for such two documents I think you'll be in better state for
identifying what really hurts the search quality.
