These times really are not reasonable. But 60K do not seem much for Lucene.
I once indexed ~1M docs of ~20K each, that's ~20GB input collection. The
result index size was ~2.5GB and the search times for a short query 2-3
words free text (or) query was ~300ms for a "hot" query and ~900ms for a
"cold" query. This was a single machine.

It may very well be that your settings are different - e.g. fields stored
or not (I don't recall if my fields were stored), types of queries, etc.

If you can provide more information on the scenario, people on the list
running similar settings would be able to comment:
- what queries?
- what happens if you run the same query again?
- how often are you updating the index, optimizing, opening new searchers?
- do you reuse searchers or open a new one for each query?
- how many results are you asking for? (more than 50?)
- did you measure search time on a single searcher?
  (without the distribution, even for a subset of your documents)
  what times do you measure here?
- did you try to use MultiReader instead of MultiSeracher?

Also, I understand that you partitioned the index, so that you have 10
indexes each "covering" 6K docs out of your 60K docs, right? If so, is this
just a test, preparing for a bigger index? Because if 60K docs is what you
intend to index, at least by my experience, not sure that partitioning the
index is a must.

The FAQ is also helpful, for instance
http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/LuceneFAQ#head-47995886fbb41d8e7da103f8cda2d935f99dc6c8


Last, a word of encourage, based on my experience and what I saw in this
list, it is certain you would be accelerate this,
