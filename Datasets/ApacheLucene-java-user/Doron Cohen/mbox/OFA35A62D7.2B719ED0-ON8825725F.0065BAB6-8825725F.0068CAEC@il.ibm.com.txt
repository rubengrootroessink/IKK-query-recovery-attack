Fernando, this code seems okay, in what sense is it "not working well"?

One thing to verify is that the "contentPid" field you are deleting by was
added to the index with Index.UN_TOKENIZED, otherwise the analyzer in use
while indexing might have broken or lower-cased that term (e.g.
"contentPid:C_1078") and in that case the delete-by-term would not delete
anything.

Deleting by term is a cleaner way to go, well, cleaner than deleting by id,
but if you prefer, you can do a search for the appropriate term, extract
the  docid (or docids) from the search result, and then use the (same)
reader to delete by docid. Make sure to use the same reader, because docids
found in one reader are not necessarily valid in another reader.
