Just to be sure on this, could you confirm the two appearances above:
- in
- this.in
refer to exactly the same variable?

Assuming they are, could you provide some more code:
- entire method containing the above code
- method reopen() of your FilteredIndexReader.
- method newReader()
- constructor of FilteredIndexReader if it is invoked from newReader()

Regards,
Doron
