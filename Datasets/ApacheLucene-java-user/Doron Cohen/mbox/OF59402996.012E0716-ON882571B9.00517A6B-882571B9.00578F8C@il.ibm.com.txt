I am not a C#'er so I might have misunderstood this code, still, here is my
take;

One general comment - the program sent is not self contained so it's hard
to "debug" - the singleton behavior is disabled, so it is better clean the
"wrappers" before sending the code; It is best to send the simplest (self
contained) code that generates the problem.

writer seems to be is a global variable.
when is writer instantiated? in AddDirectory()? For which path?
directory is not Lucene's Directory, right? - no Refresh() method in
Lucene's directory.

Side comment - for the (disabled) singleton behavior, searcher should be
static.

Verify that same Current.Server.Path is used for search and for indexing.

Hope (but not sure:-) this helps at all,
Doron
