The program as listed seems to accesss an existing index - since 'create'
is always <false> for both 'FSDirectory.getDirectoy(,)' and 'new
IndexWriter(,,)'. Perhaps an old lock file exists for that index, e.g.
because a program that was writing to that index was 'killed'. It seems
'cleaner' to create, at the start of the test program, a fresh index with a
few docs, and only then start the threads that attempt to add/search that
index.

Doron
