Yes, this is correct, it reads as "create 4 threads, each
adding 5000 docs to the index, and start/run the 4 threads
in parallel.

Note that a single doc maker is serving all the threads.
So another possible way to run this is:
  [ { AddDoc } : * ] : 4
This reads as: "create 4 threads, each adding docs until
the (single) doc maker is exhausted, and start/run the 4
threads in parallel. This was also discussed in
http://www.mail-archive.com/java-dev@lucene.apache.org/msg10831.html
("threads & benchmark contrib") and so these test cases are also
relevant: TestPerfTasksLogic's testParallelDocMaker()
and testParallelExhausted().

Regards,
Doron
