Yes, this Web host sometimes behaves strange when clicking a link from a
mail program. Please try to copy
   cdoronc.20m.com/tmp
to the Web Browser (e.g. Firefox), click <Enter>.
This should show the content of that tmp folder, including the
downloadable file indexingThreads.zip

Hope this works,
Doron
