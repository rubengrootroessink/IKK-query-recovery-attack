Current parser supports relaxed phrase syntax:

So for query "x y"~10 doc with "x a y" would score
higher than doc with "x a b y". You can control the effect of the
distance, programmatically, providing your own similarity class,
especially sloppyFreq(int distance);

(Doesn't help you much if you already knew all this but just
looking for how to extend the query parser...)

Current query parser (and syntax) does not support this, but see
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/spans/SpanQuery.html

and all its sub-classes, especially SpanFirst and SpanNear - with both
scoring takes into account the distance between terms.
