If space can be afforded, perhaps a simple setting is: one Lucene doc per
"page", with N+1 fields: one per each existing translation for the page,
and an additional ALL field == union of all the translations of the page.
Then, if only language L is requested, search in field L only; if there is
no language specification and the user locale is unknown, search in the ALL
field; and if there is no language specification but the user locale is
known to be L, search in both L and ALL, optionally boost the L part of the
query.
