SSN actually is a common situation.

Assume you have a (relational) database with a table of products with three
columns :
- SSN, which is also a primary key for that table,
- DESCRIPTION, which has free text (i.e. unformatted text) describing the
product.
- OTHER - additional info.
Also assume you want to allow users of your application to search a product
by its description. For each product found, you intend to fetch the data on
that product from the database and display it to the users.

This can be done in the following setup:
Create a Lucene index with two fields:
- ssn - stored, but not indexed
- description - tokenized (hence indexed) but not stored.

Now the application would send the user query to Lucene, using the
description field. For each document found, the application would fetch its
ssn (which is available from the Lucene index since it was stored). Using
this ssn, the application would fetch all sorts of data on that product and
display it to the user.

There are other possible designs of course - you may want to have
additional data in the Lucene index, but this hopefully just gives the
feeling how different fields with different settings are used in an
application.

I think you would find LIA ("Lucene In Action" book) very useful.
