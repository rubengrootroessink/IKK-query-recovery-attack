"a b c"~1 just matches more 'easily' than "a b c".
It will match for instance "a b d c". The NOT however
excludes all documents which match this, unlike requested logic.

In fact,
   Q1:      "a b" NOT "a b c"~1
is worse than
   Q2:      "a b" NOT "a b c"
in that a document containing
   "a b x c"
should have been matched, and will be matched by Q2 but not with Q1.
Both Q1 and Q2 will not match this:
   "a b x y z a b c"
which should be matched...
