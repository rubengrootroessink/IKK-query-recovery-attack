Indeed, having to re-open a searcher/reader in order for searches
to reflect index modification, can sometimes not best fit with the
logic of a certain application.

But see the features made possible with this design:
(+) searches do not feel index modifications until desired.
(++) no need to synchronize/interfere between searchers and index updates.
(+++) stable non-corruptable index without duplicating index data.
