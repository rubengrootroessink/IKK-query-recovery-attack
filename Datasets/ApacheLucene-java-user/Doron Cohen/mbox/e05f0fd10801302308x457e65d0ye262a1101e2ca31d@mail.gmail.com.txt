Hi Ajay,

IndexReader.unlock() is a brute force call to be used by applications/users
knowing that a lock can be safely removed.

finalize() on the other hand is a method that Java will call when garbage
collecting a no-more-referenced object. So it is often a place for cleanup
code. However the problem with finalize is that it is not guaranteed when it
will be called, and in fact it is not guaranteed that it will be called at
all (even as the JVM shutsdown). Therefore it is not recommended to have
logic dependency in finalize(), and Lucene in fact does not have such, as
write locks are released elsewhere.

HTH,
Doron
