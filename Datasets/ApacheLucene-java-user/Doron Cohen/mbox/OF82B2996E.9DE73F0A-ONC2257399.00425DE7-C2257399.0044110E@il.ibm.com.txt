SUBJECT: Re: Scoring for all the documents in the index relative to a query
DATE: 20 Nov 2007

You can also rely on that by default documents are
collected in-docid-order. You can therefore use your own
hit collector that when collecting doc with id n2,
assuming the previous doc collected had id n1,
would (know to) assign score 0 to all docs
with: n1 < id < n2.

In other words, you can know earlier that a certain
doc is a non-match, not having to wait until all
matching docs were collected. (well, at least I had
the impression that something like this might help you.)
