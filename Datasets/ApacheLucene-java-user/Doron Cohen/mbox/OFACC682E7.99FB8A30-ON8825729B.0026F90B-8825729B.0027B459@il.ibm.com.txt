I can't see a consistent way for something like this - assume this is done,
we might have these steps:
 query text:  aa.bb.cc*
 remove '*':  aa.bb.cc
 analyze:     aa bb cc
 add the '*' back(?):
   would it be: aa* bb* cc*
   or: aa bb cc*
Doesn't makes sense to me.

The reasoning behind not analyzing wildcard queries is also explained in
the FAQ: "Are Wildcard, Prefix, and Fuzzy queries case sensitive?"

Doron
