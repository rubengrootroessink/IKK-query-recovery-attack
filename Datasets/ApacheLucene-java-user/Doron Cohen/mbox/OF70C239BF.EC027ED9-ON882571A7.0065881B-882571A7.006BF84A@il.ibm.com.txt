SUBJECT: Re: modify existing non-indexed field
DATE: 10 Jul 2006

The lock time out exception is caused by trying to open multiple
IndexWriter objects in parallel - each of the 5 threads is creating its own
IndexWriter object in each invocation of addAndIndex(). This cannot work -
I think that chapter 2.9 of "Lucene in Action" is essential reading for
fixing this test program.

It seems that this code is just for testing multi-threading and not for
efficiency/correctness, but just in case, notice that (1) Optimizing and
closing the IndexWriter after each doc added is very inefficient, and (2)
Since a single IndexSearcher/Reader object is created only once (there's a
single call to new MyIndexer(), in the main()) - this searcher/reader would
not reflect any doc additions done afterwards.

Regards,
Doron
