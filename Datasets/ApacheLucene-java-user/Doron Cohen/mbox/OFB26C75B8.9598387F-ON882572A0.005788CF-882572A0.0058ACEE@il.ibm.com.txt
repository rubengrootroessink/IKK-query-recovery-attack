SUBJECT: Re: Indexing HTML pages and phrases
DATE: 16 Mar 2007

For search phrases there's no need to "detect the phrases" at indexing time
- the position of each "word" is saved in the index and then used at search
time to match phrase queries. (also see 'query syntax document'.)

Lucene takes plain text as document input - extraction of content text and
properties from (say) an HTML should be done external to Lucene. (also see
'Lucene FAQ'.)

Assigning Store.YES to a field added to a document being indexed would save
the text of that field in the index so that it is later (at search time)
fetchable. (also see javadocs for org.apache.lucene.document.Field.)

Regards,
Doron
