SUBJECT: Re: Grouping over multiple fields
DATE: 25 Jul 2006

Just realized that the <some text> part should also be grouped, so checked
that this variation also works:

qtxt = "some text AND  ( AUTHOR_NAME:krish OR EMPLOYEE_NAME:krish )";
--->   field:some +field:text +(AUTHOR_NAME:krish EMPLOYEE_NAME:krish)

qtxt = "(some text) AND  ( AUTHOR_NAME:krish OR EMPLOYEE_NAME:krish )";
--->   +(field:some field:text) +(AUTHOR_NAME:krish EMPLOYEE_NAME:krish)

qtxt = "<some text> AND  ( AUTHOR_NAME:krish OR EMPLOYEE_NAME:krish )";
--->   field:<some +field:text> +(AUTHOR_NAME:krish EMPLOYEE_NAME:krish)

Last case just demonstrates that '<' is not part of Lucene's query syntax
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html).
