SUBJECT: RE: Is Lucene Java trunk still stable for production code?
DATE: 15 Mar 2007

A good reason for applications to only use formal versions (vs. trunk) is
backwards compatibility (see "BackwardsCompatibility" in Lucene Wiki).

An index created with a formal version (major or minor), would be readable
(and hence upgradable) by a later version. But for interim trunk states
this is not guaranteed. For example, version 2.2 will correctly open a 2.1
index, but it might fail to open an index created with (say) the current
trunk (in between 2.1 and 2.2).
