I never tried this but I'm sure it will not work.

The phrase query scorer requires all the terms to
appear - either at the 'right' place or with slop
for sloppy phrases. Therefore if you inject two
terms in the same position the scorer will require
to find both of them in the same position in order to
match a document. This would be an AND logic, while
what you need is an OR logic.

The phrase positions are handy for something else:
supporting searching when stopwords where filtered
(either at indexing or at search or both).
