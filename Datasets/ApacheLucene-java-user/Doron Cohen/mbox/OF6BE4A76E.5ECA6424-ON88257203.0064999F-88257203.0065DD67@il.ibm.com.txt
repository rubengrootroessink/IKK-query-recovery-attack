SUBJECT: Re: Lucene in Action examples complie problem
DATE: 10 Oct 2006

Field.Text()  was deprecated in Lucene 1.9 and then removed in 2.0.
The book examples were not updated for 2.0 yet.

You should now use Field(String, String, Field.Store, Field.Index).
To have the same behavior as old Field.Text use: Field(name, value,
Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED).

For other release issues - see the FAQ entry

Regards,
Doron
