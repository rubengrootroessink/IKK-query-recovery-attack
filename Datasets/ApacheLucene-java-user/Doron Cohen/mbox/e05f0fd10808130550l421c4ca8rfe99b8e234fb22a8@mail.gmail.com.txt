The code seems correct (although it doesn't show
which analyzer was used at indexing).

Note that when adding numbers like this there's no real point in analyzing
them,
so I would add that field as UN_TOKENIZED. This would be more efficient,
and would also comply with the query parser who does not apply
the analyzer on range query terms. Anyhow this does not explain the problem
you see, because standard analyzer would not modify the numbers anyhow.

Which Lucene version version you are using?

Can you provide a small self-containing program demonstrating the unexpected
behavior?

(often just writing this small program shows leads to solve a problem like
this).
