Hi Otis, you could use the byTask package - add your-type-of-search-task.
Suffix the new task class name by "Task" - e.g. NewNameTask - and then you
can use the 'command' "NewName" in an alg file.

I am not sure you can extend/reuse the existing ReadTask for this, because
its implementation of search/retrieve/traverse assumes using certain
Lucene's API's.

Does this make sense?

Regards,
Doron
