ConstantScoreRangeQuery, right?

Yes this would be interesting, thanks - especially, how
long does it take with the deletions, vs. how long it takes to
just traverse the ids. Also, if the range query expands to
huge number of terms this can affect performance, so
it is interesting to see your query.rewrite().toString(),
or, if you can't reveal the actual tokens, just share
how many terms are there in the rewritten query.
