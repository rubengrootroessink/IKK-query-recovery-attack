I actually asked myself the same question before the previous
post - javadocs for StandardAnalyzer just has the obvious - a
grammar-based tokenizer constructed with JavaCC.... - the wiki
page AnalysisParalysis also didn't explain much on the logic
behind it.

>From the StandardAnalyzer javacc grammar :
  // floating point, serial, model numbers, ip addresses, etc.
  // every other segment must have at least one digit
  <NUM: (<ALPHANUM> <P> <HAS_DIGIT> .... etc.
  <#P: ("_"|"-"|"/"|"."|",") >
My understanding of this: a non-whitespace sequence is broken
at either of these 5 chars
   _  -  /  .  ,
unless the part that follows part has a digit, in which case
it is assumed to be (part of) a serial no., model, etc.

Seems we can improve the documentation here.
