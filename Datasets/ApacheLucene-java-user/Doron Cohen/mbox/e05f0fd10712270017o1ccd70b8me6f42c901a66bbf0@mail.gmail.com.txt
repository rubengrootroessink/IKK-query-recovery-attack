Hi Liagat,

This part of the code seems correct and should work, so problem
must be elsewhere.

Can you post a short program that demonstrates the problem?

You can start with something like this:
      Document doc = new Document();
      doc.add(new Field("text",URDU_STOP_WORDS[0] +
                  " regular text",Store.YES, Index.TOKENIZED));
      indexWriter.addDocument(doc);

Now URDU_STOP_WORDS[0] should not appear within the index terms.
You can easily verify this by iterating IndexReader.terms();

Regards, Doron
