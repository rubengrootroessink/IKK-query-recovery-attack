Lucene RangeQuery would do for the "time" and "numeric" reqs.

This is natural in Lucene.

You should be able to do it with two fields - start/end - and then you have
all the flexibility for queries. Conditions can be set on either one of
these or on both. In case that both are used, i.e. a doc matches only if
its start-to-end range falls within a certain minStart maxEnd range, you
would need two open ended range queries (or range filters) - one to apply
on the start date and one to apply on the end date, because a single range
query values must have the same field name. Also notice that open ended
range queries must be created programmatically - current QueryParser does
not support this. See using DateTools for saving the time values in a
resolution that matches your needs.

Same comments on range queries / filters apply. Be aware though that
comparison is lexicographic, so numeric values should be indexed as
strings. See NumberTools.

Apart from the XML handling (don't know about that), for the other reqs it
is just using Lucene's API.
