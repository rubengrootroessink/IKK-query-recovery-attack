DATE: 8 Mar 2007

In general I would say this is not safe, because it seems to assume too
much about the implementation - and while it might in most cases currently
work, the implementation could change and the program assuming this would
stop working. It would most probably not work correctly right from the
start for fields constructed with a Reader.

Doron
