Then I am not sure I understand you.
Take this input text:

     text by John Bear, old.

A WhiteSpaceAnalyzer would create these tokens:

   text
   by
   John
   Bear,
   old.

An NgramFilter(2,2) wrapping it would create these tokens:

   te
   ex
   xt
   by
   Jo
   ... etc.

You may use other limits but still no token would have a
white space in it.
