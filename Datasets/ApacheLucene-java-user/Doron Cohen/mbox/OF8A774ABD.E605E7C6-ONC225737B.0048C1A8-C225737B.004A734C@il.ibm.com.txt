SUBJECT: Re: How to do RangeQuery on a Computed Value of a Field?
DATE: 21 Oct 2007

You could use ValueSourceQuery for this - see
o.a.l.search.function. The trick is to create
your ValueSource class that is using two
FieldCacheSource objects - one for each location.

See http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1019
for a related example.

Note however that this solution would work well only
as long as the index is not huge. For a very large
index the loading of the entire two fields into the
FieldCache would become heavy, as will warming a new
searcher. This will be resolved once we heve a
payload-based ValueSource.
