SUBJECT: Re: Query not finding indexed data
DATE: 16 Oct 2006

Hi Antony, you cannot instruct the query parser to do that. Note that an
application can add both tokenized and un_tokenized data under the same
field name. This is an application logic to know that a certain query is
not to be tokenized. In this case you could create your query with:
  query = new TermQuery(fieldName, "IqTstAdminGuide2.pdf");

Hope this helps,
Doron
