Perhaps worth pointing out is item 9 in the changes list:
  9. LUCENE-771: The default location of the write lock
  is now the index directory...

While this is way more convenient, notice that Lucene's feature of
protecting from opening the index for update by two applications
running in parallel is weaker while upgrading to 2.1.0 - i.e.
2.1.0 would succeed to open for write even if at the same time
it is open for write by an older Lucene version.

To avoid problems, just follow these steps when upgrading:
- stop all readers (searchers)
- upgrade all readers (searchers)
- stop all writers
- upgrade all writers
