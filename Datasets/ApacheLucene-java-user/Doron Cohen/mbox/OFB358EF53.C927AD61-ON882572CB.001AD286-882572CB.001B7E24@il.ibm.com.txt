SUBJECT: Re: How to index a lot of fields (without FileNotFoundException: Too many open files)
DATE: 28 Apr 2007

Just in case norms info cannot be spared, note that since Lucene 2.1 norms
are maintained in a single file, no matter how many fields there are.

However due to a bug in 2.1 this did not prevent the too many open files
problem. This bug was already fixed but not yet released. For more details
on this fix see LUCENE-821.
