This would be achieved by UN_TOKENIZED.

The NO_NORMS just guides Lucene to avoid normalizing

resources for that).

Other than that I join Erick in wondering why all three options are needed.
It would help the list to help you if you provide
a few simple examples of: document, query, expected result.
