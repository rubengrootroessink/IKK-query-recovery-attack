I think Yonik's comment in 565 holds here -
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-565#action_12432155
- if your application is buffering deletes/updates and
then batch the deletes you probably won't see a large
improvement. But if your application does not buffer
the deletes and does not batch them, then I believe
moving to IndexWriter.delete() (and update()) should
buy you performance improvement, because IndexWriter
would now buffer the deletes for you.
