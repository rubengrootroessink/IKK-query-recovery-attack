Seems that it should work.

Few things to check:
- make sure you are indexing with UN_TOKENIZED.
- check that either both field and query text are lower-cased or both are
not lower-cased.
- use Luke to examine the content of the index (when adding as
un-tokenized);
  print the query (toString);
  - do they match each other? match your expectation?

There is no such limitation.

Hope this helps,
