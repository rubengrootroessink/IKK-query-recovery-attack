StandardAnalyzer - used here while indexing - applies lowercasing.
The query is created programatically - i.e. without a QueryParser
and in particular without tokenization (~analysis) - and so "KOREA",
while at indexing time would have been lowercased to "korea", at
search time will remain as "KOREA" and hence search will not find it.

For a few more useful hints see the FAQ entry
    "Why am I getting no hits / incorrect hits?"
