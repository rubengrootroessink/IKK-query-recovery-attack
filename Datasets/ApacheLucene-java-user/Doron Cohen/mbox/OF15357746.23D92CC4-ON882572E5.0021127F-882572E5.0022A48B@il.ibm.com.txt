The problem seems to map to "function query" - Lucene-446.
With that patch, you could create a ValueSourceQuery, based on these
external
values, and then combine it into the score of another (any) query using
CustomScoreQuery. You can override the customScore() method to combine the
scores as fits your needs.

There is one catch though - that approach assumes that values obtained from
the ValueSource match Lucene's internal docids. I think this aspect is
going
to be an issue in any solution that combines external values into the
scoring
process. If your system does not delete documents (or if you are using the
patch from LUCENE-879 (which I didn't try yet)), and, you maintain the
order
by which docs are added, this may work for you.

HTH,
Doron
