I assume '*' here is for emphasizing the query text, - this is somewhat
confusing because '*' is part of Lucene's query syntax for wildcard search.
To the question - usually no, but it depends. You could write an analyzer
that would emit a token jakartaapache for input of jakarta&apache though my
guess is that this is not the case, and jakarta&apache and jakartaapache
are two distinct words in your index. See the Lucene FAQ, in particular "
Why am I getting no hits / incorrect hits?", starting with its
recommendation to examine query.toString().

Hope this helps,
Doron
