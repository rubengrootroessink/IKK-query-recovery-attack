contrib/benchmark's syntax for parallel-execution spawns parallel threads.
I.e. something like
    [ Search ] : 20
would run 20 queries in parallel, and this
    [ Search ] : 20000 : 5
would run 20,000 queries in parallel, but starting up to 5 new threads per
second.
One more example:
    [
       { SearchTrav(20) > : 300
    ] : 500
Would spawn 500 threads each running 300 queries, where query 20 results are
traversed.
It allows various parallel settings, though not sure it covers exactly what
Glen did.

Yes this would be great!
