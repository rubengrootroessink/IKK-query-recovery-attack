Hi Deepan, The steps below seems correct, given that all the fields of the
original document are also stored - the javadoc for
indexReader.document(int n) (which I assume is what you are using) says: "
Returns the stored fields of the nth Document in this index." - so, only
stored fields would exist in the document returned by this call, and hence
only those stored fields would be added back to the index, after you are
updating this tmp_doc object with new fields.

Regards,
Doron
