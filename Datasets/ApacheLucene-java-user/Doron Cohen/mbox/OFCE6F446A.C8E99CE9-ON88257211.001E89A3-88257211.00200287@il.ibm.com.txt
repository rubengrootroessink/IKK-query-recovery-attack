Do you gain anything from storing the document fields within Lucene?  In
case not, especially if log files are kept somewhere, you cuold make all
'content' fields unstored (reduce index size), and add a stored non-indexed
ID field. It can also be a POINTER field - e.g. <log file name + start
offset + length>.  At search time, for found documents you can retrieve
this ID/POINTER field and then fetch the document from the (original) log
file. Makes sense?
