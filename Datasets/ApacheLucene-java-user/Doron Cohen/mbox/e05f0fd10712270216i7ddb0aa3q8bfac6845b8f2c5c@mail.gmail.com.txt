Hi Liaqat, I am confused, are you saying that the program creates no
index when stopwords are used?

All this time I thought the problem you get is that stopwords are indexed
as if they were regular words, but now you say no index is created..

Is there any exception thrown?
Do you see that there is no index to be found on the file system?
Or do you mean after closing the IndexWriter and opening an
IndexReader or IndexSearcher its numDocs is 0?
Or perhaps the index contains documents but your query search
finds nothing?

Again, a stand-alone Java program that demonstrates the problem
would be best and save your time and others. Lucene's Junit
tests are good examples of short programs that demonstrate
a problem, and fails unless the problem is fixed.

Regards, Doron
