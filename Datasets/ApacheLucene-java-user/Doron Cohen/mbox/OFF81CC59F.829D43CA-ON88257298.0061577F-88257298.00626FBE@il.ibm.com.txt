SUBJECT: Re: Multiple segments
DATE: 8 Mar 2007

margeDocs only limits the merging of "already saved segments" as result of
calling addDocument(). If there are added documents not yet "saved" but
rather still buffered in memory (by IndexWriter), once their number exceeds
maxBufferedDocs they are "saved", but as a single merged segment. So you
could set maxBufferedDocs to 2 (that's the minimal value) and maxMergedDocs
to 1 and add N documents to the index, - that would likely result in N/2
segments. You could probably force N segments by closing the index after
each add and reopen it before the next add. Note that while such settings
might be interesting for learning purposes, that would have an unpleasant
performance impact...  Last, calling optimize(), no matter what above
settings are, a single segment is created.

Doron
