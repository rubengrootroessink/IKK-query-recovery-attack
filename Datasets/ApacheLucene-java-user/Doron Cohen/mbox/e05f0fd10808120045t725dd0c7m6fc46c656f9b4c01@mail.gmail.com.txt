SUBJECT: Re: Query to ignore certain phrases
DATE: 12 Aug 2008

I can't see how to accomplish this without writing some special code,
and not just because of query parsing.

Phrases are searched by iterating the participating term
positions and when a match is found say for "b c" there is no way
to know whether another query "a b c d" matches exactly the corresponding
position.

Writing your own query to do this, one straightforward way is for its scorer

to maintain two exact phrase sub-scorers, but, (1) use for the score just
the
phraseFreq() found by the scorer of the inner phrase ("b c"), and (2)
if both phraseFreq() are the same - that of the inner phrase and that
of the outer phrase ("a b c d") ignore the document all together.

If this is where you're heading, start in the package javadocs for the
search package,
and see the code of PhraseScorer.

Span queries are another direction I would check for this, perhaps a higher
level
code can suffice with spans, but I don't know for sure.
