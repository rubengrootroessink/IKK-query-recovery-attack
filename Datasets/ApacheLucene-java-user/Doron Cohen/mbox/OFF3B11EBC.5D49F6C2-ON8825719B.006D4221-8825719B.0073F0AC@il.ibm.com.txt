Just a thought: using IndexModifier, you could call flush() in intervals,
say every <s> seconds or every <d> documents. If not using IndexModifier,
closing and re-opening IndexWriter should have similar effect.

Pros: (1) simple managing code, (2) content of previous docs
can be removed from disk once flush returns.

Cons: (1) few last added docs might be still stored on disk
although Lucene already saved them, (2) forced IO, so slower
indexing, (3) flush can take long (well, so can some calls to add-doc).

Regards,
Doron
