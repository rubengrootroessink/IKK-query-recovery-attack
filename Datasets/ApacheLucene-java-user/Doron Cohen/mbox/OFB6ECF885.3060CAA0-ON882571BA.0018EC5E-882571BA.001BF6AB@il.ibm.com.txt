Thinking more about this, it is possible, though not very simple and so
clean. - You would need to write your own variation of TermQuery class,
something like TfTermQuery, with its own variations of Weight and Scorer
classes. This scorer can assign the raw term frequencies as the score
(disabling the scoring part that takes into account IDF and
normalization...). You can then query with your own HitCollector to collect
the raw scores. I think this would compute what you were asking for...
