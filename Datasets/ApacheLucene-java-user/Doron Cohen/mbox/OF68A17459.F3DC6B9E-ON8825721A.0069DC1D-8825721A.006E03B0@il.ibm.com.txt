Lucene scoring - http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html - uses
pre-computed statistics, location info, and the number of documents in the
index (1 in your case). So some preparation is required before a
(stand-alone) document can be scored against a query.

You could create a single-document in-memory index, with RAMDirectory -
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/store/RAMDirectory.html
 - then you can search and score against that single document index.

Perhaps also MemoryIndex would be useful for you - in Lucene's contrib - I
never used it, but it seems very relevant to your question.
