Actually (by default) it is:
   1 / sqrt(#tokens in d with same field as t)

That system is less "field oriented" than Lucene, so you could say the
normalization there goes over all the fields.
The {0.8,0.2} args are parametric and control how aggressive this
normalization is.
If you used there {0,1} you would get
  1 / sqrt(#unique terms in d)
and that would be similar to Lucene's
  1 / sqrt(#tokens in d with same field as t)
however (in that system) that would have punish long documents too much and
would too much boost up stupid dummy short documents, and that's why the
{0.8,0.2} were introduced there.
