I hoped it would answer *some* of the questions... (not all)

Let me try some more :-)

I think "why normalizing at all" is answered in
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html#formula_queryNorm
... "queryNorm(q) is a normalizing factor used to make scores between
queries comparable. This factor does not affect document ranking (since all
ranked documents are multiplied by the same factor), but rather just
attempts to make scores from different queries (or even different indexes)
comparable. This is a search time factor computed by the Similarity in
effect at search time. The default computation in DefaultSimilarity is:
queryNorm(q) = 1/sqrt(sumOfSquaredWeights)"

I think there were discussions on this normalization. Anyhow I am not the
expert to justify this.

If I understand what you are asking, the logic is that verrry long
documents could virtually contain the entire collection, and therefore
should be "punished" for being too long, otherwise they would have an
"unfair advantage" upon short documents. Google "search engine document
length normalization" for more on this, or see also
http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec10/papers/JuruAtTrec.pdf

I hope this (although partial) helps at all,
