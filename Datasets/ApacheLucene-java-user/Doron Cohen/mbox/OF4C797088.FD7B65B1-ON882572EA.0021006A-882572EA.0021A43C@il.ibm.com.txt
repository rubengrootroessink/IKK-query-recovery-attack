Antony, your assumptions were (and still are) correct - once
an index reader is opened it is unaffected by changes to the
underlying index. Would it be clearer if the javadoc said:
"(An IndexReader instance will see changes to the index caused
by flush operations that completed prior to opening that
IndexReader instance)."?
