That code seems fine to me.

A possible explanation (which I think might be the case here but not sure)
is that getBestFragment*() only accumulates fragments scores for matches of
"unique terms" in the fragment.

Example 1: query = "xy", and the term "xy" appears once in an early
fragment but 3 times in a later fragment. In this case both fragments would
be scored equally, and hence the early fragment would be selected "best"
just because of how the sorting works.

Example 2: query = "xy zw", and the early fragment contains "xy" but a
later fragment contains both "xy" and "zw". In this case the later fragment
would be selected "best".

Does this explain what you see in your program?
