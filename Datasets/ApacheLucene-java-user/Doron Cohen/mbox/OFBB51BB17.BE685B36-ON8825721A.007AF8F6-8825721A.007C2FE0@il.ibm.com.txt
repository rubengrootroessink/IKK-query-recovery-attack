Yes this is not part of core Lucene but rather under contrib.
To use this you can either download the source and compile, or download
lucene-2.0.0.zip from the download site and use lucene-memory-2.0.0.jar
from within that zip.

Probably because sample code in that javadocs was created with Lucene 1.4.
See

Also see comments by Chris on the value (or not) of the score you would
get.
