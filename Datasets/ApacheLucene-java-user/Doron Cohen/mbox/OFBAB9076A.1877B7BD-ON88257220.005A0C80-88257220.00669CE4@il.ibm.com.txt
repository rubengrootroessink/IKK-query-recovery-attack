To my understanding the 2nd suggestion does exactly this, as long as the
highlighter QueryScorer is based on q2:

  :  (2) score only by str2, filter by str1:
  :      Query query1 = parser.parse(searchString1);
  :      Filter f1 = new QueryFilter(query1);
  :      Query q2 = parser.parse(searchString2);
  :      Hits searchHits = searcher.search(q2,f1);

Going back to the server (for q1) might take more time, but is simple. Task
wise, does not block you from programming any behavior required (e.g. the
various options that Chris mentioned). You would be able to get the same
results - returned docs, their scores, highlighting - as when not going
back to the server (for q1). Only disadvantage might be performance. Did
you get that working but saw performance problems?
