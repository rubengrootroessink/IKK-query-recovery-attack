In fact this is not guaranteed for every "later version" - only for those
up to one major step ahead. The Wiki's statement is very accurate here:

   File formats are back-compatible between major versions.  Version X.N
   should be able to read indexes generated by any version after and
   including version X-1.0, but may-or-may-not be able to read indexes
   generated by version X-2.N.
