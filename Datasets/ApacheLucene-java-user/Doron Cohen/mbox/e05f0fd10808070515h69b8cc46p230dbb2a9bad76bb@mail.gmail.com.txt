SUBJECT: Re: Stop search process when a given number of hits is reached
DATE: 7 Aug 2008

Nothing built in that I'm aware of will do this, but it can be done by
searching with your own HitCollector.
There is a related feature - stop search after a specified time - using
TimeLimitedCollector.
It is not released yet, see issue LUCENE-997.
In short, the collector's collect() method is invoked in the search process
for each matching document.
Once 500 docs were collected, your collector can cause the search to stop by
throwing an exception.
Upon catching the exception you know that 500 docs were collected.
