SUBJECT: Re: What is the advantage of setting using compund file to false
DATE: 10 Oct 2006

A bit of clarification:
Lucene index is made of multiple "segments".
Compound format: stores each segment in a single file - less files
created/opened.
Not-compound format: stores each segment in multi-files - more files
created/opened.
Not-compound is likely to be faster for indexing.
Optimizing the index (no matter if compound or not) would merge index
segments into one segment - this would also make search faster.

Also see http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/fileformats.html
