Is that perhaps Lucene 1.4.3?
(Current release is 2.1.0, I am not aware of 1.3, such
old version is not even in the releases archives).

The static parse() was deprecated at 1.9 and removed
at 2.0, so it must be Lucene 1.9 or older.

Anyhow, at least from Lucene point of view (I am not
familiar with GATE), by instantiating (each time) a new
QueryParser object and using it, there should be no
thread safety problems.

Regards,
Doron

I think "singleton" would not be a good idea, thread safety wise.
