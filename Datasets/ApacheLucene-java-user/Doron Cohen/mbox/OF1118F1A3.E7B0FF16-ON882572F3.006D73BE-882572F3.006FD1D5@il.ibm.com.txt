I think it splits by hyphens unless the no-hyphen
part has digits, so:
  np-pandock-a7
becomes
  np
  pandock-a7
This is for the indexing part.
For the query part, prefixQuery is not subject to standard analysis
(just lower casing), so you could be even more surprised that
this query:
  Np-pandock-L2
would find that document (it would become a phrase
query "np pandock-l2"), but this query:
  Np-pandock-L2*
would not find any document, because it would become
a prefix query
  np-pandock-l2*
and at indexing such token (np-pandock-l2) was never created.

Using Luke you should be able to see the tokens in the
index as well as how the query is parsed (under
query details).
