If you have the stop-words in a file, say one word in a line,
they can be read like this:

    BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new
FileInputStream("Urdu.txt"),"UTF8"));
    String word = r.readLine();    // loop this line, you get the picture

(Make sure to specify encoding "UTF8" when saving the file from notepad).
