SUBJECT: Re: SpanNearQuery - inOrder parameter
DATE: 19 May 2011

Hi Greg,

I created http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3120 for this problem,
and attached there a more general test that exposes this problem, based on
your test case.

I am not sure yet that this is indeed  a problem to be fixed with regard to
span queries (see more there in JIRA) but at least I would like the test
case to be in JIRA.

Could you provide some context on why is this a problem for you?
That is, what is preventing you from specifying in-order?

Doron
