Lucene phrase query does not support 'sub parts'. But you may
want to look at o.a.l.search.spans. It seems that a span-near query
made of span-term queries and span-or queries, setting (max)span as
~the length of your phrase and setting in-order=true would get
pretty close.

About performance I hope others can comment, cause I never compared
this to phrase query. When you do try this, please tell us of any
interesting performance results!
