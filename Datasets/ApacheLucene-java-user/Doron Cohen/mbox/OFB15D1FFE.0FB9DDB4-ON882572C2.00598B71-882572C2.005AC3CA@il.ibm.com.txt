If only the index is maintained on NFS (say input is on local disk or DB or
such) it may help to index to local disk and only occasionally (once a
day?) copy/update to an index maintained on NFS (and used there for search
I assume). A faster NFS is much simpler/better of course. But if this
delayed NFS update is of interest to you, perhaps try it first, roughly,
and if deciding to go this way, there were a few relevant discussions
lately on ways to safely/efficiently copy from a dynamic (updating) index
to another index. Mmm... thinking of the mentioned complexities of this
copying not sure I would go this way, - but - it might suit you, and
perhaps other can add on their experience with this type of setup.
