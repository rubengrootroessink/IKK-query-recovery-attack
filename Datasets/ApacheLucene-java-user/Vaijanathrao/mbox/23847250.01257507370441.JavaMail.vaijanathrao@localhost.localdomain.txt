SUBJECT: PhraseQuery Problem
DATE: 6 Nov 2009

Hi All,

One of things that we want to do in our application is to assign the score to a doc which
is  something like this
score = (# terms matched to the query) / ( total number of terms in the document for the field
). 

We want it to implement this as a part of PhraseQuery, as we also have other requirement.
But in PhraseQueryScorer we only get the phrases which have matched for a document but not
the total number of terms for the queried field. Is there a way i can get the total number
of terms in the document for that field without doing reader.doc(docId,fieldSelector ).

Can anyone suggest me alternate approaches for this. I am using lucene-2.4.1
