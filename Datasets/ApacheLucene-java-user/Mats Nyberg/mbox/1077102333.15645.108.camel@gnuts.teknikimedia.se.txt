SUBJECT: status of AND as default logical operator for QueryParser
DATE: 18 Feb 2004

what is the status of the default operator feature of QueryParser?

i want to have a lucene enabled app using AND as it's default operator
using the code: 

  QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(FIELD, service.getAnalyzer());
  parser.setOperator(parser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
  Query query = parser.parse(queryString, FIELD, service.getAnalyzer());

results are however not as expected but rather the QueryParser still
uses OR.

is this not the way i am supposed to use the feature? 
why is it not working?
