SUBJECT: retrieving matched slop
DATE: 21 Mar 2007

I have an app that searches a single document against many queries.  
Lets say the document was

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

and my queries are

SpanNearQuery("quick","brown",50)
SpanNearQuery("quick","fox",50)

I would like to retrieve the slop or some sort of score that was matched 
when I'm searching.  Since the first one requires no slop, it would 
return 0 or the highest score and the second query would return 1 for 
slop as fox is one word away from quick.  Is there any way to retrieve 
these values?

Russ
