Alice,

If you have a computer that crashes once you put a lot of load on it, 
I'd say you have bigger problems then the speed of the indexing.  A 
computer should not crash, no matter how much load you put on it.  If 
you have such a huge database, I can't believe that you don't have 
access to other computers.  You can even use workstations and run the 
indexing at night, and then merge it to a central repository. 

Lucene does allow for index merging, right?
