SUBJECT: Distributed Indexes

I'm wondering if this is a problem that lucene users have already 
tackled.  I have four copies of the application using a lucene index.  
They are located on two physical servers with two copies on each server 
accessing two copies of the lucene index.  I use Windows FRS (File 
Replication Service) to replicate the index between the two servers. 

Things work well most of the time, but sometimes, I believe under load, 
the index doesn't get a chance to propagate before another write takes 
place and it gets corrupted. 

What would you recommend I use to keep the index in sync between the 
four copies of the app?

Russ
