I would like to provide a simple web search of our web site.  We have a 
lot of dynamic content, and instead of searching through the database, I 
would like to use some some sort of crawler to index the site.  Is there 
one available that generates Lucene indexes? 

I looked into Nutch, but it looks a bit complicated to set up.  I'm not 
really interested in running Nutch as web app, maybe only do update 
indexes, and I would like to use Nutch/Lucene jars to do the searching. 

Can someone recommend a crawler?

Russ
