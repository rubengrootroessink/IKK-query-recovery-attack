SUBJECT: IndexReader locking index
DATE: 1 Dec 2007

I am using MoreLikeThis functionality in my code.  This code is running 
on four separate servers.  When I ran tests, it seemed to be fine, but 
looks like under heavy use, the index file is always locked, and when I 
reindex all the docs, it doubles the size of the index (my guess is the 
old files are not being deleted). 

Since my index is only about 11mb, I would like to load it into RAM.  
I'm not sure if this is compatible with MoreLikeThis?  How do I load the 
index into memory and then open and IndexReader on it?  Also if I load 
it into memory, how can I find out when changes have been made to the 
index file on disk so that I can reload it? 

Russ
