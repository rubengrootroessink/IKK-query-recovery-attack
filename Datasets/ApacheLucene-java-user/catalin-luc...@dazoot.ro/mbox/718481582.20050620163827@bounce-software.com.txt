i think cluster by md5 is more appropriate.

i want to return just the 1st image (the more relevant one). no use to
show duplicates in an image search app.

well, i am not sure either.
one solution would be when i iterate through the hits collection and
send them to the webapp, to group them by md5 or some.

is this a good way to do it ?
(the bad thing is i would have to do lots of hits.doc(index) in
advance, to make this group by md5 thing, and if the results are
paginated << which is the case >>, on the 2nd page i would need to
keep in session the last "index" or to recalculate it again.. - oh
nein !:)

in sql this would be:
select distinct md5, url, alt from table group by md5 order by score asc;

if i had the score in the DB (which is not the case).
