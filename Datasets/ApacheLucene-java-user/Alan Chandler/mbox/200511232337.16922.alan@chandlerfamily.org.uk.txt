One simple question that I am looking at.

My home page wants to have a summary of perhaps the most recent five blogs 
entries.

It looks as though I can use the Datefield class to store the publication date 
in an orderable form - so that I can effectively do a ordered search using 
this field as the sort field.  

Is there anyway to limit the number of hits returned in the search to 5 (or 
does it not generate any storage overhead to return them all and just use the 
first 5)
