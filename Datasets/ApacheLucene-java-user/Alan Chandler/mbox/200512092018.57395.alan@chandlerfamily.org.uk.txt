SUBJECT: Confused again ... Getting at results
DATE: 9 Dec 2005

I am slowly making may way through lucene, as witnessed by earlier threads to 
this mailing list.

But I am stuck again, going round in circles with the Javadocs.

I want to display the results of a user entered search where for each document 
I put out a small summary with the searched for words highlighted.

When I wrote the Analyzer for my documents, I produced the tokenstream  to 
generate Token objects with the start end end positions of each term in them

Now, from my Hits object I can find each document I need to output, but how do 
I get back to the Tokens I originally produced.

I suspect it has something to do with FilterIndexReader and its nested class 
FilterTermPositions, but I can't see how to link these to the seach I have 
just done

How is it done?
