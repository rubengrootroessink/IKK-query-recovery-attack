SUBJECT: Is there any timing constraints with lucene.
DATE: 6 Dec 2005

I have implemented a "Database" on top of lucene and am currently testing it.

When I manually step through my test suite in the debugger, it works fine.

When I run it without the debugger it fails.

The peice that fails is a where I update a document (by using a IndexReader to 
create a IndexSearcher to located it, the IndexReader to delete it and then 
close it) and then an indexwriter to put it back again(then optimize and then 
close it),  

I then immediately attempt to read it again (via IndexSearcher and a manually 
constructed query using a TermQuery and a Term). When I do this slowly it 
works, when it is running at full speed it doesn't.

Is there any attempt to create some background thread to update the index that 
could cause the problem?
