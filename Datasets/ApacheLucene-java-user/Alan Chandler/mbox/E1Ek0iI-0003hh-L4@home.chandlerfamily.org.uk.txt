Yes, I am doing all of that for the majority of what I am doing.  The tricky 
one is getting an index of all my documents stored.  This could be more than 
one pages worth. 

But I found a copy of chapter 3 of your book on the web, where you recommend 
that you re-do the query for each page (I assume by querying and then 
calculating n based on page number and items_per_page to the call 
hits.doc(n);
