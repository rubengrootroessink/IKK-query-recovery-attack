Well I have managed to flattern to a very simple test case that matches what I 
think should be in the index and this test case works (ie does NOT show the 
problems I was seeing before)

luke tells me the file based index also seems to have what I expect in it, so 
I guess the next step will be to run my test case over the file based index.

Now I KNOW that my understanding of the Boolean Query is correct, I think I 
will focus my attention on whether or not I have left an indexWriter open, or 
not re-opened the searcher after some updates.
