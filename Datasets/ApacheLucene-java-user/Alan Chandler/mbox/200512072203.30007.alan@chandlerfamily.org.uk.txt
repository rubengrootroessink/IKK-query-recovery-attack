Thanks for the example - even if its not quite what I do, it gives me 
something to aim at.

Unfortunately, my current test is a lot more convoluted than that (because 
things are in layers).  I will try and break it down like you have done into 
a flat form and see were I get to, but its going to take a little time to do.

I think one of the things I am doing is inserting and deleting the "config" 
document a few times in the process and thats going to take a bit of work to 
flatten.  This test was about number 35 in a massive sequence of building 
functionality on top of functionality.
