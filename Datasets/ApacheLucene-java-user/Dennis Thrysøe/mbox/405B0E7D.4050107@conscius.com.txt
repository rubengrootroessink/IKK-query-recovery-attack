Hi,

It doesn't seem to work though - unless I'm missing something.

I've tried to index the field both as Keyword and as UnStored.

I'm constructing a PhraseQuery myself (no query parser used), so I don't 
know if I should add a single or multiple terms to the PhraseQuery.

The following (simplified) debug output gives no hits:

ADDING: Document<org.apache.lucene.document.Field@7bc0ac 
Keyword<name:art> Keyword<uri:/dt art>>

SEARCHING: +(name:art) +uri:"/dt "
