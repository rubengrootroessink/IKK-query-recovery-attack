I've figured out how to use the WhitespaceAnalyzer for creating the 
PhraseQuery, but I suspect I should use the same analyzer when indexing 
(sot the leading slash isn't removed).

This is a problem though, because I'm using the StopAnalyzer. Have I 
overlooked a way to specify a specific analyzer for a single field when 
indexing?
