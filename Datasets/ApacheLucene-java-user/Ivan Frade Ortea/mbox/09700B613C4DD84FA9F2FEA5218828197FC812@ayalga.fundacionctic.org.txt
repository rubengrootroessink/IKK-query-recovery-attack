SUBJECT: Store index in database
DATE: 22 Aug 2005

Hello,

 I'm working in a big j2ee application with some documents (5000 aprox.) in a database. Now
i'm indexing it without any problem using lucene with FSDirectory. But the use of files in
j2ee app is not a "good-design" choice. So i was thinking in store index in database (using
JDBCDirectory, for instance) but i cannot find references to this approach online, seems that
nobody use it.

 Is there any "so-easy-that-i-cannot-perceive" question to avoid this approach? could be a
performance problem? Have anybody an idea of performance using database instead of filesystem
to store the index?

 Thank you in advanced.

Iv√°n Frade.
