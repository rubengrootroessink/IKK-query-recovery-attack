SUBJECT: Is it safe to use reopen on IndexReader
DATE: 31 Mar 2010

Is it safe to use reopen on IndexReader if their are other threads who had
readers out or do I need to use a ref counter to make sure all readers are
checked in?

Secondly right now we also check this when we reopen
IndexReader ir = indexSearcher.getIndexReader();
                    indexSearcher = new IndexSearcher(ir.reopen(true));
                    if(ir != indexSearcher.getIndexReader()){
                        ir.close();
                    }
Is the if(ir != indexSearcher.getIndexReader()){   check needed?

Thanks,
