SUBJECT: Question about many fields within a single index
DATE: 30 Dec 2009

I have a situation where I might have 1000 different types of Lucene
Documents each with 10 or so fields with different names that get
indexed.

I am wondering if this is bad to do within Lucene.  I end up with
10,000 fields within the index although any given document has only 10
or so.

I was hoping not to have to have many indexes under the covers if I
can avoid it but I don't want performance to suffer either.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
