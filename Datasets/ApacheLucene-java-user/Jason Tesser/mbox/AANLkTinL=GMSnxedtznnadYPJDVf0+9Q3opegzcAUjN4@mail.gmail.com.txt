SUBJECT: Proper way to deal with shared indexer exception
DATE: 25 Feb 2011

We are having issues with FileChannelClosed and are NOT calling
Thread.interrupt.  We also start to see AlreadyClosedException on Reader.

*
*

we are running the latest 3.0.3


We have code in my lucene Util class like this  http://pastebin.com/ifbxhVLi

*
*

we have a single shared searcher and a single writer which is only checked
out once not shared single threaded http://pastebin.com/YF8nmwg0

*
*

we use to call destroy in all the caches of the first paste bin which I
think is a problem

*
*

 1. what would be the recommended way here?

*
*

in other words if I catch AlreadyClosedException ace OR
ClosedChannelException OR IOException what would be the best to do with my
shared searcher

*
*

2.  is reopen enough?  or should I get a brand new searcher?


Thanks,
