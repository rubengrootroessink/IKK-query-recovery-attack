SUBJECT: Trouble compiling JCC
DATE: 27 Apr 2010

I'm trying to compile JCC, using  python setup.py build

This is what I get:

~/pylucene-2.9.2-1/jcc$ python setup.py build                   running 
build
running build_py
copying jcc/config.py -> build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.5/jcc
running build_ext
building 'jcc._jcc' extension
gcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes 
 -fPIC -I/usr/lib/jdk/java-6-sun-1.6.0.17/include -I/usr/lib/jdk/java-6-sun-1.6.0.17/include/linux

 -Wno-write-strings
cc1plus: warning: command line option "-Wstrict-prototypes" is valid for

char>::wrap()â
jcc/sources/JArray.cpp:945: error: âPyObject* JArray<signed char>::wrap()â 
previously defined here
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

I saw a message posted (http://markmail.org/message/mi3uuwiuz5qb23rl ) 
saying that it is using the wrong header files., but I don't know how to 
change the header files that it is using.

I'm trying to build pylucene-2.9.2-1 on Ubuntu 8.04.

What other information would be useful?

Thanks,
Herb
