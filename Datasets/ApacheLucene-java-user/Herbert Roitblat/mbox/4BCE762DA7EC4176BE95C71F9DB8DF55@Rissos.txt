SUBJECT: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
DATE: 10 Apr 2010

Hi, folks.
I am using PyLucene and doing a lot of get tokens.  lucene.py reports version 2.4.0.  It is
rpath linux with 8GB of memory.  Python is 2.4.
I'm not sure what the maxheap is, I think that it is maxheap='2048m'.  I think that it's running
in a 64 bit environment.
It indexes a set of 116,000 documents just fine.
Then I need to get the tokens from these documents and near the end, I run into:

java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded

If I wait a bit and ask again for the same document's tokens, I can get them, but it then
is somewhat likely to post the same error on a certain number of other documents.  I can handle
these errors and ask again.

I have read that this error message means that the heap is getting filled up and garbage collection
removes only a small amount of it.  Since all I am doing is retrieving, why should the heap
be filling up?  I restarted the system before starting the retrieval.

My guess is that there is some small memory leak because memory assigned to my python program
grows slowly as I request more document tokens.  Since I'm not intending to change anything
in either my python program or in Lucene, any growth is unintentional.  I'm just getting tokens.

 we use lucene.TermQuery as the query object to get the terms.

I cannot share the documents nor the application code, but I might be able to provide snippets.

One last piece of information, the time needed to retrieve documents slows throughout the
process.  In the beginning I was getting about 10 documents per second.  Towards the end,
it is down to about 5 with about 5 second pauses from time to time, perhaps due to garbage
collection?

Any idea of why the heap is filling up and what I can do about it?

Thanks,
Herb
