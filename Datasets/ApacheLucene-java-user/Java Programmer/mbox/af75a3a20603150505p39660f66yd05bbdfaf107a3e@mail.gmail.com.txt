Reply to myself hate this :(

What about such solution:
Split path like string into smaller tokens and index them as seperate words eg:
#Top/World/Poland/# #Top/World/# #Top/#
so if I ask about word #Top/# I will get all the results for this
category, without making so many boolean queries.

Is there a better solution for my problem?

Best Regards,
Adr
