SUBJECT: Writing and searching same time
DATE: 29 Nov 2006

Hello,
I have trouble with writing and searching on lucene index same time,
all I did so far is making a class which has 2 methods:
private String indexLocation;
	
public void addDocument(int id,String title, String body) throws IOException{
		IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter(indexLocation, new
SimpleAnalyzer(), false);
		Document doc = new Document();
		doc.add(new Field("id",Integer.toString(id),Store.YES,Index.NO));
		doc.add(new Field("title",title,Store.NO,Index.TOKENIZED));
		doc.add(new Field("body",body,Store.NO,Index.TOKENIZED));
		indexWriter.addDocument(doc);
		indexWriter.close();
}
	
public List<Integer> search(String query) throws IOException, ParseException{
		IndexSearcher indexSearcher = new IndexSearcher(indexLocation);
		MultiFieldQueryParser queryparser = new MultiFieldQueryParser(new
String[]{"title","body"}, new SimpleAnalyzer());
		Query q = queryparser.parse(query);
		Hits hits = indexSearcher.search(q);
		Iterator it = hits.iterator();
		List<Integer> output = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		while(it.hasNext()){
			output.add(Integer.parseInt(((Hit)it.next()).getDocument().get("id")));
		}
		indexSearcher.close();
		return output;
}
What I don't like is that I have in each method opening IndexWriter
and IndexSearcher, I try to open them once and keep opened throught
whole lifecycle of application (which would be very long cause it
would be search for news working as webservice), but when I wasn't
close IndexWriter then IndexSearcher wasn't seen any new documents in
index. Next step was keeping IndexWriter open and reopen only
IndexSearcher but in this case also IndexSearcher was seen old index
without new documents. So my final version is this above, but could it
be better, without closing IndexWriter after each addition, and
opening IndexSearcher before each search query? What is the best
pattern of doing such systems?

Another question: do I need provide any synchronization on
indexWriter.addDocument(doc) method? I see that it isn't synchronized,
so maybe programmer need to do it himself?

Best regards,
Adr
