Hello,
I created small Lucene's application which stores lot of my users
infomation, on of it is zipcode in numeric format eg. 50501, 63601 -
zip codes are stored in Text fields so they are fully searchable what
I want now to do is getting all unique zipcodes which was stored so
far. Something like SQL: select distinct zipcode from ...
Is it possible?

Best regards,
Adr
