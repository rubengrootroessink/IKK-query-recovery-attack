SUBJECT: Grouping results by choosen field
DATE: 17 Mar 2006

Hello,
I tried to search myself for soultion, but without any good result, so I
want to ask group.
My problem concerns result grouping, the best example will be Google search
where you have results sorted by relevance, and also grouped by domain (they
have little indent/margin). In my project I want to get similar
functionality, without very huge CPU consumption.

Can you share any helpful hints ?

Best Regards,
Adr
