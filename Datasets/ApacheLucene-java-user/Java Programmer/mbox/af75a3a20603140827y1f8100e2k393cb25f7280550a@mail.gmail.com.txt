SUBJECT: Searching in paths
DATE: 14 Mar 2006

Hello,
I have problem with indexing / quering paths eg I put
"/home/users/apache/txt/qqq__docu.txt" in field called "path", I wanted to
submit query to find all documents which are provided by my user apache, so
i tried to query Lucene as AND path:/home/users/* but not results were find
by such query if I asked any other field without / the results are provided
eg AND title natio*.
Where am I doing mistake? What I can do to ask for paths (and all what is
below of them)?

Best Regards,
Adr
