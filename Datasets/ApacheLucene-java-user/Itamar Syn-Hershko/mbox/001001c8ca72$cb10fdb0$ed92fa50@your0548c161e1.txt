SUBJECT: Options of Field constructor accepting Reader
DATE: 9 Jun 2008

Hi all,
 
I was wondering why only the Field constructor which accepts a String offers
Store and Index options? I understand there might be no logic in offering
them for the TokenStream constructor, but what's wrong in Storing an input
from a Reader, that 2.3.2 does not allow it?
