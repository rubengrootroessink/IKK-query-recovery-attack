SUBJECT: Having 2 fields, each using different analyzers?
DATE: 31 Jan 2008

Hi all,

Since Analyzer is set per IndexWriter, which is being added a Document,
which has several fields, I was wondering how would I store 2 different
fields in a Document, each being passed through a different Analyzer? The
idea is to have 2 fields of the same content, one stemmed and one is not,
both are tokenized and not stored. The rationale is Hebrew indexing (yes,
again :) ).

Itamar.
