Hello again,

If I wanted to do this programmatically, how would I do this (retrieve a
list of all terms in a field for a specific document - better if it was in
alphabettic order and with frequency data)?

Thanks,

Itamar.

You can use Luke to rebuild the document. It will show you the terms of the
analyzed document, not the original content.
And this is what you want, if I understood you correctly.
