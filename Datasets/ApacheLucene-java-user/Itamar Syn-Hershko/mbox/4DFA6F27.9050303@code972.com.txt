SUBJECT: Coloring search results based on score?
DATE: 16 Jun 2011

Hi all,


Interesting question: is it possible to color search results in a 
web-page based on their score? e.g. most relevant results in green, and 
then different shades through orange, yellow, red and then white.


Theoretically, one could take the highest score and color based on 
proximity / distribution, but the highest score can be invalid in itself.


I could bring in a hardcoded cutoff point, where results are not 
considered relevant and not color any results if the highest score 
doesn't go above that threshold (e.g. score = 1.0), but then again - 
complex queries can yield relevant results with low scores.


So my question is: has anyone ever tackled this issue, and is this even 
doable?


Thanks in advance!


Itamar.
