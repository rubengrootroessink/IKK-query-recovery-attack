Storing all that info per-token as payloads will bloat the index. 
Wouldn't it be wiser to use a special token to mark page feed and end of 
paragraph (numbers of which could be then stored as payloads), and scan 
the token stream per document to retrieve them back? some extra 
operations for retrieval, but much smaller index...
