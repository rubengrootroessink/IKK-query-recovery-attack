SUBJECT: Changing QueryParser operator images
DATE: 28 Sep 2010

Hi all,


I'm trying to customize the "AND", "OR" and "NOT" operators being used 
by the QP, without changing anything in the core. I noticed a previous 
attempt, but it seems to have died quietly a few years ago [1].


Unfortunately, even changing the hardcoded values seems impossible, as 
they are inaccessible or readonly - or both.


How can this be done, if at all? has anyone ever did something like this?


Itamar.
