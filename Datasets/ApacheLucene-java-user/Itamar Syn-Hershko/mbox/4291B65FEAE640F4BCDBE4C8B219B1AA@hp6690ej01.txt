That would be next(Token) I believe. The reason it was deprecated afaik was
to force a reuse of the Token object, to gain more performance.

Subject: recommendation for deprecated StandardTokenizer.next() method?


Hello,

Does anyone have a recommendation for implementing the function previously
done by the deprecated StandardTokenizer.next() method?

and/or, can anyone point me to where I might find the reason it was
deprecated?

Thanks, Allasso
