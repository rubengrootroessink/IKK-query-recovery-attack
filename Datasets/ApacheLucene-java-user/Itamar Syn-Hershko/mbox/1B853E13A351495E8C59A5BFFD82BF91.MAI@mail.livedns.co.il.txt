SUBJECT: Getting Terms Position Gaps
DATE: 18 May 2008

Hi all,
 
How can I see the position gaps in my indexed field? I've set up some sort of mechanism to
increment position gap for specific terms in specific circumstances, and I want to make sure
it is working as expected. I've tried Luke but it doesn't seem to be able to view this info.
 
Thanks in advance,
 
Itamar.
