SUBJECT: [ANN] First of a kind open-source effort for advancing Hebrew IR
DATE: 8 Jun 2010

Hi all,

Indexing Hebrew texts for later retrieval is not a trivial task. Of all
languages, Hebrew seem to be the toughest to handle. Although several
solutions exist, they are not necessarily providing the best results in
terms of relevancy. Either way, there is no freely available solution
allowing to index Hebrew even at the very basic level.

HebMorph was started with this in mind. It is a free, open-source effort for
making Hebrew properly searchable by various IR software libraries, while
maintaining decent recall, precision and relevancy in retrievals.

During the work on this project, we will try and come up with different
approaches to indexing Hebrew, and provide the tools to perform reliable
comparisons between them. This project's ultimate goal is providing various
IR libraries with the best Hebrew IR capabilities possible.

Complete details are available at http://www.code972.com/blog/hebmorph/. As
we progress, updates will be posted to that blog, to our mailing list, and
on twitter (#HebMorph).

If this is of an interest to you, we would appreciate your feedback and
help. Please use our mailing list, or contact me privately, for any
inquiries.

Itamar Syn-Hershko
