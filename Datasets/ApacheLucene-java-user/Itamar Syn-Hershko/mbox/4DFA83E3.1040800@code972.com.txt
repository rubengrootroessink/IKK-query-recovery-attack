SUBJECT: Re: Coloring search results based on score?
DATE: 16 Jun 2011

No, that was not what I meant.


I'm not interested in coloring the actual text, but in giving the user 
an indication of how relevant the results are. Instead of displaying the 
result score, I want to give some visual meter to show that. The highest 
ranking result will be green if the it is really relevant to the query, 
yellow if less and so on.


My question is if there's a good enough way to measure this - for 
example if the first results is 20 times the score of the second, or 
that's something I can't really do...
