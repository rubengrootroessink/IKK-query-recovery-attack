SUBJECT: Rebuilding Document from index?
DATE: 22 Feb 2008

Hi,
 
Is it possible to re-create a document from an index, if its not stored?
What I'm looking for is a way to have a text document with the text AFTER it
was analyzed, so I can see how my analyzer handles certain cases. So that
means I don't care if I will not get the original document. I want to see
the document as the index knows it.
 
Thanks in advance,
 
Itamar.
