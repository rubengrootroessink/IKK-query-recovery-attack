For what it worths, I did something similar in my BidiAnalyzer so I can
index both Hebrew/Semitic texts and English/Latin words without switching
analyzers, giving each the proper treatment. I did it simply by testing the
first char and looking at its numeric value - so it falls between Hebrew
Aleph and Taph then its Hebrew, else its Latin. I wonder how you would spot
a French word in an English text for instance (aren't there parallel words?)

Itamar.

I think Karl Wettin has one that is a patch in JIRA.  Try searching there.
