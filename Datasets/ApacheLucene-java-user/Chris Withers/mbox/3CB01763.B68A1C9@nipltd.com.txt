Hi there,

I'm new to Lucene and have what will hopefully be a couple of simple questions.

1. Can I index numbers with Lucene? If so, ints or floats or ?

2. Can I index dates with Lucene?

In either case, is there any way I can sort the results returned by a search on
these fields?
Also, can I search for only documents which have been indexed with a range in
one of these fields?

For example: I only want documents where the 'cost' field is between 1000 and
2000 and where the date of manufacture was prior to 13th June 1978.

cheers,

Chris
