SUBJECT: Re: "Orphan" segment files
DATE: 4 Oct 2004

Dmitry,

Thanks for the help and pointers thus far. I know (or believe at the least)
that the files are not referenced by opening "segments" and "deletable" with a
hex editor.

I've explored the possibility of an exception that is not recorded to a log
file or written out to screen, so have double checked my code for exception
handling. I do not see any exceptions being logged, nor do I see them being
written out to the screen.

These segments about the size of my full index. Based on that, I have been
wondering it may be during optimization that something fails. But strangely, I
do not see exceptions as mentioned above. The only other thing I can think of
that may cause this is if someone shuts the indexer application down while
optimization is taking place.

Thanks again,
Ed
