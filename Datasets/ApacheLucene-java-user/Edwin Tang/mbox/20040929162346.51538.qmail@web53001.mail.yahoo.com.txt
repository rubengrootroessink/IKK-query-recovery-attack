SUBJECT: "Orphan" segment files
DATE: 29 Sep 2004

Hello,

I'm seeing in my index directory some segment files that are not included in the segments
or
deletable files. These segment files show their last modified date to be anywhere between
a couple
of days ago to a few weeks ago. I'm wondering why these files are not contained inside segments
or
deletable. Is it safe to delete them manually?

Thanks,
Ed
