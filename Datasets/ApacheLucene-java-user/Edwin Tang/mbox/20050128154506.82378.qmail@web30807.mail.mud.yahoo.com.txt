SUBJECT: Loading a large index
DATE: 28 Jan 2005

I have three indices really that I search via ParallelMultiSearcher. All three
are being updated constantly. We would like to be able to perform a search on
the indices and have the results reflect the latest documents indexed. However,
that would mean I need to "refresh" my searcher. Because of the size of these,
it's taking some time to load, and so search speed from the end user
perspective seems slow. What can I do to minimize or do away with the time it
takes to loading a new searcher... from the end user perspective that is?
