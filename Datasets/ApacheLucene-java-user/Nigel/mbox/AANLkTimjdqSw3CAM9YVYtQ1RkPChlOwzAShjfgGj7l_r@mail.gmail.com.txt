SUBJECT: Re: Will doc ids ever change if nothing is deleted?
DATE: 14 May 2010

Yes, I realize that storing document IDs persistently (for example) is a Bad
Idea. Partly I'm asking just to make sure I understand what's going on.

There is a use case, though.  In some cases between when we do a search and
return some doc ids, and when we use those doc ids to load some documents,
the index could be reopened.  Normally the same IndexReader instance would
be used for both the searching and the loading and so you'd be assured that
the doc ids would be stable.  But sometimes when searches are distributed
across multiple remote indexes (and non-Lucene search systems) some
aggregation needs to occur before results are loaded, and references to the
IndexReaders can't be maintained across that process.  Currently we remember
the index version associated with a search result (i.e. a set of document
ids) so we can verify when loading the documents that the version is the
same, and therefore the IDs are still valid.  I'm wondering if this is
overly restrictive.  For example, if I knew that no documents had been
deleted, and if (per my original question) only deletions would trigger
renumbering, then the doc ids from a search result could be used on an index
with a newer version.

Thanks,
Chris
