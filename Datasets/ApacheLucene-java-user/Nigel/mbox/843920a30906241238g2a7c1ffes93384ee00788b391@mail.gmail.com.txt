Hi Mike,

Yes, we're indexing on a separate server, and rsyncing from index snapshots
there to the search servers.  Usually rsync has to copy just a few small
.cfs files, but every once in a while merging will product a big one.  I'm
going to try to limit this by setting maxMergeMB, but of course that's a
trade-off with having more segments.

It sounds like surely any swapping out of the JVM memory could cause big and
unpredictable performance drops.  As I just mentioned in reply to Uwe, our
poor performance times don't always directly correlate with index updates,
but it may be that the damage is done and the effects are only seen sometime
later.

We don't store norms (since we don't care about sort order), and we don't
have any deleted docs (since the index is read-only on the search servers).
What exactly is stored in the field cache?

p.s. I haven't tried SSDs yet, or for that matter faster disks of any sort.
First I'd like to get a better understanding of what I/O is required and
when during the search process, ideally to be able to have an approximate
model that predicts I/O based on the query (the way a DBA might do when
estimating how a SQL query would work with certain tables and indexes).

Thanks,
Chris
