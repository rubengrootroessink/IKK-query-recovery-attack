I'll definitely try this, and thank you for the GC options details that you
posted previously.  I have a test server that's exactly the same
configuration as our production boxes, which I need to use to try this out
(with the same indexes of course).  It's busy doing some unrelated work at
the moment but next week I should be able to do some tests.

Thanks,
Chris
