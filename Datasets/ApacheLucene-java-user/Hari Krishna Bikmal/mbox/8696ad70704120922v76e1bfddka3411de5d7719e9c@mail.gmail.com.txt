SUBJECT: filename search with lucene
DATE: 12 Apr 2007

I am trying to make a ftp search engine for searching filenames(not the
content). I am thinking of using apache net commons for acessing ftp servers
and want to implement the indexing,searching part      using lucene. Can
anyone tell me how to use lucene in this context.
