SUBJECT: RE: How to make mutually exclusive lists of results
DATE: 22 Jun 2008


I tried this first, and I was having trouble iterating over them.


If I do something like this

hit.getDocument().getField("CountryID").toString()

I get a big long BS object.. not just the result of my search.

I also tried messing with the tokenStreamValue(), and had the same result. 
How do I just get the value "countryID" out of the document?
