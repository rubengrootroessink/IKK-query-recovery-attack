SUBJECT: Frequencies sorted by frequencies

Hi All,
I am trying to figure out a quick way to find the top N documents sorted
by frequency of a term.

I found:

IndexRead.termDocs() 

which provides an enumeration of doc() and freq() but it returns an
enumeration sorted by doc number.   Is there a way to get the results
sorted by freq?  Or is there another query I can run the find these
results?

Thanks in advance,

Sandy
