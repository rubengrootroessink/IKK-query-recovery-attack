DATE: 4 Mar 2008

Indexing with lucene/nutch on top of/instead of DB indexing for:

1) relativity scoring
2) alias searching (i.e. a large amount of aliases, like first names)
3) highlighting
4) cross-datasource searching (multi DB, DB + XML files, etc).

As for best approach to externally index, I do not have any direct
pointers.  I would recommend looking at an ETL tool that can be extended
for this purpose (I've started writing a plugin for Pentaho, but got
pulled off and haven't finished it -- and that was for Solr, not
lucene/nutch).
