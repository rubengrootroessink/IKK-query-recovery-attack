One side-note is various content management tools already handle a lot
of data extraction (POI/PDFBox/etc).

In the case of Jakarta Slide and Apache Jackrabbit, both use Lucene
under the covers to index this data.

Not sure if you want to take the approach of putting your documents as
'managed' under a content management tool, but that's another avenue to
investigate.
