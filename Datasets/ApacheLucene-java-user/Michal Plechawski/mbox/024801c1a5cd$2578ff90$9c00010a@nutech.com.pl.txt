That's one of ways to make the analysis composition explicit. Another way is
to make Analyzer interface to return two token streams: normalizedStream()
and unnormalizedStream(). I won't argue which is better.
BTW: great thanks for adding possibility of analyzing different fields with
different token streams in 1.2, that was the real problem in 1.0.
