SUBJECT: Re: How do i get a text summary

Am I missing something?  Isn't this exactly what Lucene does?

Put in a value when you create your Document, get it back out when it comes
back from a search, right?

Want a text summary? Put it in to the document...

I just started playing with Lucene so maybe I'm missing something, but these
question seems quite fundamental to what Lucene is all about.
