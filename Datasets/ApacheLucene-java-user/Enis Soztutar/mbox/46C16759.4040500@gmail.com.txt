Hi,

I want to define different implementations for the functions in 
Similarity class. For example i need to define sloppyFreq() different 
for fields "foo" and "bar". Is there a way around this?

Also i wonder why the fieldname is passed to some of the functions in 
Similarity (such as Similarity#lengthNorm()) but not all of them. Does 
anybody know the reason for this?

Thanks.
