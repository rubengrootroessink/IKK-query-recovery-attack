Hi,
Do you know which one is faster? The date filter or data range query?
Regards,
Hui

	Hi,
	
	I guess that you could apply a filter when you search. This way you could
	filter Documents based on dates that are "between", "after" or "before":
	
	// filter out Documents that are "modified, published, ..." after the
	current date
	DateFilter filter = DateFilter.Before(YOUR_DATE_FIELD, new Date());
	Searcher searcher = ...
	Query query = ....
	Hits hits = searcher.search(query, filter);
	
	Regards,
	Per
