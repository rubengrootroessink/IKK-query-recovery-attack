Very interesting!
Do not know about RBAC. Could RBAC support/integrate with LDAP or NT OS user access control?

	I was bored this week so I've been exploring how Lucene can be used for Role-Based Access
Control. If you're interested, I have a blob entry at http://affy.blogspot.com/2003_04_27_affy_archive.html#200212974.
This is my first somewhat significant effort at using Lucene, so if y'all have any comments,
I'd love to get constructive advice.
