SUBJECT: RE: indexing xml files with relative links to dtds
DATE: 14 Feb 2003

I know some Java xml parsers like the one from Oracle use classpath to locate the xml files,
for Xerces, it may use the current directory as the base directory ( I am not 100% sure about
this ), then you may try to force your current directory to be the current xml directory.
It is more an XML question, I suggest you submit to another xml group.
 
Regards,
Hui

	Ok, I used parser.setFeature to turn the validation
	off. This helps, but it turns out there are entity
	references in the XML files as well. These are causing
	the same problems the DTD references were causing
	before...
	
	Any suggestions with regards to this?
	
	Thanks,
