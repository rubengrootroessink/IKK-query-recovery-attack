So what ispell dictionary actually is? List of rules for translation 
some words (or sentence?) to 'base form'? Or what?
If it is so, then as I understand it is actually possible to create some 
analyzer which gets ispell dictionary as parameter
and this way to get a full power of ispell dictionaries in Lucene? Or am 
I wrong somewhere?
