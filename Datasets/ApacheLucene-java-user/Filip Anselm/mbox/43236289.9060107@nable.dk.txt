SUBJECT: How do I avoid reindexing?
DATE: 10 Sep 2005

...well the title says it all

I index some documents - all with the same fields... One of the fields,
"id" is unique for the indexed documents. If i try to index a document
with an id, that is already indexed - the old document should be updated
or replaced with the new document, so that I avoid indexed documents
with the same id. How is the best way to do this?

thanks

- Filip
