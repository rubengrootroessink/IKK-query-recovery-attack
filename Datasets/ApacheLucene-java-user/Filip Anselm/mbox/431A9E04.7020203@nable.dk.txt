SUBJECT: Re: How to search between dates?
DATE: 4 Sep 2005

jian => I'll try the RangeQuery first, and if it doesn't give any
perfomance problems I'll just stick to that method - it's easy, simple
and doens't involve other systems. But thanks for info...

How do I combine two queries - one made by the QueryParser and the
programmatically made RangeQuery?
