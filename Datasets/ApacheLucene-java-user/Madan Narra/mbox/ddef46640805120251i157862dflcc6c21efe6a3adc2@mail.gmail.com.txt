Hi All,

I am very much new to Lucene and want to extend my skills over this tool....

But i am in need of a quick assignment which i would need to complete
soon...so haven't got much time to read over the docs/books over net..

So please suggest how can i archive the below task and the rest i can make
over.

I have a inbound file of around 10k records , each line is a new record.

I need to search for a word or phrase in the inbound file, and retrieve all
the line data which consists the word.

Ex:

102652;ABN AMRO  Monthly Income Plan-Regular Plan-Growth Option;13.3054
102653;ABN AMRO  Monthly Income Plan-Regular Plan-Monthly Dividend
Option;10.0011
102654;ABN AMRO  Monthly Income Plan-Regular Plan-Quarterly Dividend
Option;10.0498
102645;ABN AMRO  Short Term Income Fund-Institutional Plan-Daily Dividend
Option;10.0104
106524;AIG India Treasury Plus Fund-Institutional Plan-Daily Dividend
Option;10.0109
100601;Canara Robeco Cigo-Growth Plan;21.88
101620;Franklin India International Fund;10.3648
100948;Franklin India Monthly Income Plan-Growth;23.1588

As Shown above, if i search for "*Franklin*" i  need to show up the below
thing :

101620;*Franklin *India International Fund;10.3648
100948*;**Franklin ** *India Monthly Income Plan-Growth;23.1588

If i search for "*ABN*" , than the result should be as below :

102652;*ABN *AMRO  Monthly Income Plan-Regular Plan-Growth Option;13.3054
102653;*ABN *AMRO  Monthly Income Plan-Regular Plan-Monthly Dividend
Option;10.0011
102654;*ABN *AMRO  Monthly Income Plan-Regular Plan-Quarterly Dividend
Option;10.0498
102645;*ABN *AMRO  Short Term Income Fund-Institutional Plan-Daily Dividend
Option;10.0104

Hope my question is clear and understanding...

Please help me over how could i achieve the above process to search for a
word in the file and display the results as discussed.

Thanks,
