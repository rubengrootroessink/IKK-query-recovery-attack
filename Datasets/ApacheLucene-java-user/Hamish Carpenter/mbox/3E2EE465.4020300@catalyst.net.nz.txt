DATE: 22 Jan 2003

We had a similar problem (under linux) but have had no issues during 
testing on windows.

We did two things to solve the problem:
1) Increase the file limit for the program to 4096.  The alleviated but 
did not completely solve the problem.  Under stress testing we would 
still fall short of the maximum number of file handles.
2) Implemented a cached IndexSearcher.  This is using Peter Halacsy's 
IndexSearcherCache slightly modified to be a singleton and return cached 
searchers for a given directory. This code was found in the list archives.

More optimisation and a lower marge factor will help things but the 
files open will skyrocket when you have simultaneous searches each using 
its own IndexSearcher.
