SUBJECT: Re: use Lucene LOCAL (looking for a frontend)
DATE: 28 Jan 2004

Hi,

My company has implemented a socket based interface for lucene.  To index and query documents
you need to construct and xml document and then send it to our "luceneserver" which listens
on a socket (can be same machine or different).

I can email this to you if you wish, it is ~2.5Mb including all libs to run it.  It is currently
licensed under GPL.

btw; installing tomcat to test the lucene webapp locally is not too difficult.
