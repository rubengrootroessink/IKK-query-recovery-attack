DATE: 20 Jun 2008

Hello there! I trying to query for a specific document on a efficient way.
My index is structured in a way where I have an id field which is a unique
key for the whole index. When I'm updating/removing a document I was
searching for my id using a Searcher and a TermQuery. But reading the list
it seems that its a bit of overhead, using a reader.termDocs(term) would be
faster.

Here's a piece of code:

private void deleteFromIndex(String id){
        Term term = new Term("id",id);
        IndexReader reader = readerManager.getIndexReader();
        TermDocs termDocs = null;
        try {
            termDocs = reader.termDocs(term);
            while(termDocs.next()){
                int index = termDocs.doc();
                if(reader.document(index).get("id").equals(id)){
                    reader.deleteDocument(index);
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }finally{
            if(termDocs != null){
                try {
                    termDocs.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }

problem is, reader is not returning any term. When I switch to query it
works. My documents have all being indexed using BrazilianAnalyzer, don't
know if that could be the reason.

Regards
