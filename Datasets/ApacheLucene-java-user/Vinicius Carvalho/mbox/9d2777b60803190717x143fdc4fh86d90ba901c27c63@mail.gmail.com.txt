SUBJECT: Lucene on a cluster environment
DATE: 19 Mar 2008

Hello there! I have just started with lucene. Bought the Lucene in action
book [right now I'm at chap 4, plus the 10th chapter, great explanation by
Terence from jGuru, really nice stuff], also I'm reading most that I can at
the wiki :)
Still a bit lost with some stuff, mostly with clusters :)
Our app is running in a cluster environment, now we are going to add search
support for it, and lucene was the choice for it. Since I have many SLSB
spread across the cluster, I would like to know some blueprints to use
lucene in these situation.

Our first idea, was to store the IndexWriter as an MBean inside Jboss and
use it as an HA-Singleton, which would guarantee its uniqueness inside the
cluster. I just would like to get some feedback from you guys on it :)

Best regards
