SUBJECT: Question on number of fields in a document
DATE: 12 Mar 2010

Hello there! We are indexing metadata for our medias. One ideia is that each
user adds its own metadata, so each document may have different
number/name/type of fields. Is this ok on Lucene? I mean, is Lucene ok with
the this relax approach.

Also, considering that each user may define its own metadata, we may have
several different types of fields. Is there a limit for this?

Regards
