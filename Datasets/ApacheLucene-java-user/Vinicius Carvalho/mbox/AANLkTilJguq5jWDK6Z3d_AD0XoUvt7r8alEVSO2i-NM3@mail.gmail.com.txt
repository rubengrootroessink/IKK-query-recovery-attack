SUBJECT: Stop words filter
DATE: 23 Jun 2010

Hello there! I've been using lucene as a Fult Text Search solution for some
time. And  although I'm familiar with Analyzers and Stemmers I never used
them directly.

I'm testing a few experiments on Sentiment Analysis and our implementation
needs to perform stemming and stop word removal. I thought using lucene
built-in support to spare me some coding time.

Is there any example? I'm trying

TokenStream stream = analyzer.tokenStream("", new StringReader(inputStr));

Problem is that I could not find a way to get the result tokens. I was
expecting something like stream.getTokens:Token[] :P

Could someone point me in the right direction?

Regards
