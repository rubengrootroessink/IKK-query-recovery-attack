DATE: 20 Mar 2008

Hello there! Is it possible to chain analyzers? If I don't know what is the
locale of my document, and considering that all of my docs will always
either be in English/Spanish/Portuguese, is it possible to chain analyzers
to remove stop-words from all those locales? I know that stem would be a
much more complicated (or even not possible) solution.

Regards
