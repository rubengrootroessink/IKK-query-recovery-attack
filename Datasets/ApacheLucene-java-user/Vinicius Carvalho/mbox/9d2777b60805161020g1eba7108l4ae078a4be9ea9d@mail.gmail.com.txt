Hello there! We are starting with lucene, and in order to prove it's usage
one of the benefits is performance. I do know that lucene (as other full
text search engines) provide many more benefits than using a SGDB.
Ok, so here's a simple test:

I have a Table with 17.700 rows. It is stored on mysql, and has no index on
the title row.

A query using: SELECT * FROM MOVIE WHERE LOWER(TITLE) like '%matrix%'. It
returns 9 matches in 4ms (I'm not counting the opening connection time)

Ok, now, I have indexed this same table in lucene (indexed title,id, and
stored both). After performing a termquery(term("title","matrix")) the time
was 27ms (not counting the indexsearcher  instantiation time).

I know its a dumb test, but what can be done in order to speed things up?

Regards
