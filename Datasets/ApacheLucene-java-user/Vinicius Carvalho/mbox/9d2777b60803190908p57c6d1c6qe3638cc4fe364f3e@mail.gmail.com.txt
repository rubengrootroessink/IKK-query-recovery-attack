SUBJECT: Adding new documents to index
DATE: 19 Mar 2008

Hello there! Since I've just begun with lucene, some concepts are kinda new
for me :). One of the is the whole indexing process. Well, AFAIK, indexing
should happen in a batch process right, to maximize the time spent on this
operation. One issue tough, is that our client wants "instants search
results", I mean, after something is added, the next search should have it
available. Well, it's almost impossible to convince him (and I believe you
guys know how this works) that indexing should not happen online (maybe I'm
just wrong here as well).

Well, my question is, when I have a reasonable amount of indexed data, how
expensive is to add a new document? Does it re-builds the entire index? I
believe we'll have a small amount of data (when compare to things I've seen
lucene is capable of), probably 50k of html docs, 10k of pdf, and 5--6
million rows of database information. With that scenario, an online index
(plus optimize) would be a good idea?

Best regards
