SUBJECT: IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.UNLIMITED at what price?
DATE: 10 Dec 2009

I was wondering where I might read about the cost of using
IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.UNLIMITED versus
IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.LIMITED.

 

Are thee any consequences over and above the obvious one that you are going
to analyse more content in your IndexWriter when you have more than 10,000
characters in a StringBuffer?
