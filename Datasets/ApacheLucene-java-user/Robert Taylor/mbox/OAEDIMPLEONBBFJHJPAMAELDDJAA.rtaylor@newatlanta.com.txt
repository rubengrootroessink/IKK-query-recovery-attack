SUBJECT: Lucene and Struts
DATE: 12 Sep 2003

I have a web application developed with Struts and I wish to add the ability
for users to search the web application content.

Some of the web application pages are directly accessible via a URL and
others are only accessible via a Struts action mapping URL.

All of the web application pages are composite pages (similar to Tiles)
where
each page includes and populates a template with content. The content may
come from various locations but the runtime result is a complete page.

After downloading Lucene and working with the demo applications I quickly
realized the problems voiced by Marco Tedone  in this archived message:

http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg04656.html


I read through the thread and it didn't appear that there was a
simple/elegant solution.

I was wondering if anyone has come up with a simple/elegant solution for
using Lucene
with Struts/Tiles.
