I agree that this makes indexing rather straight forward, but....
then I have to build/use a content management system for my
existing web application(s). That's not going to fly for me right now.
Maybe in the future - but for now, I need to provide content-searching
capability for my web applications.


Why is indexing the site using a crawler not such a good idea for web
applications
where 99% of the content is static? If the content changes, you just rebuild
the indexes. This solution works if I have a legacy web site or one deployed
as a web application. It works if my pages are composite or atomic. It works
if
my content is dynamic or static.
