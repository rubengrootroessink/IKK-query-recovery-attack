DATE: 3 Mar 2009


hi:
how many size of the index is the lucene's limit on per server ? I mean that
the speed of the search is very fast and doesn't be affected by the huge
index !
which is the limit on per server,if the index is bigger than it ,the speed
of the search will be low!
any expert have a experience to tell me ?
thank you!
