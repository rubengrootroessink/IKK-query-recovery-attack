SUBJECT: Sorting by multiple dependent fields
DATE: 23 Mar 2011

I'm trying to sort on two dependent fields.  I realize that if they were 
independent I could use new Sort(SortField...) with lots of SortFields, 
but I need to compute something based on two fields.

Let me explain:

I'm searching for things near your location (as specified by longitude 
and latitude).  I've got the search working correctly (with the help of 
NumericField), but now I need to sort the results by distance from you.  
The closer things appear at the top of the list.  I can't store the 
distance, because I'll never know where you are searching from, so I 
need to calculate it at the time I sort.

How can I do this?  I'm thinking I might need to subclass the Sort 
object.  Or can I subclass the SortField object and give it two field names?

Thanks in advance!
