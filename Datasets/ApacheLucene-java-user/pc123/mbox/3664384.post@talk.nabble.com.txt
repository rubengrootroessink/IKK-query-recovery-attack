DATE: 30 Mar 2006


Hi,

Yes, the 2nd case, we have a MultiSearcher taking an array of Searchable
(each doing the lookup to different server machines) on the client side and
RemoteSearchable taking an instance of MultiSearcher on the server side. 
How to find out which searcher a hit comes from with a MultiSearcher?

Thanks .
