I was able to get PDFBox to work with my JSP webpages. 

I think you will have to in a way write your own code to do the PDF
files (while still calling the Lucene functions)

         doc = LucenePDFDocument.getDocument(file);

Does it support indexing the contents of pdf files? I have found one
project
called PDFBox that can be integrated with Lucene to search inside of the
pdf
files. Currently, Lucene can only search for the pdf filename. I tried
with
PDFBox and I got the following message when I typed the command: java
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index c:\\index .. 

log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger
(org.pdfbox.pdfparser.PDFParse
r).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.

Can anyone advise?

To update, try removing the '-create' from the command line.  The demo
code
supports incremental updates.  It will re-scan the directory and figure
out
which files have changed, what new files have appeared and which
previously
existing files have been removed.
