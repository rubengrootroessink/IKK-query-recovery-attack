Hi,

I'm using the Multi Field Search to search all the fields of my
documents during the search. 

When it returns results the scores are numerically low - .06, .17, etc.
I would think if I searched for "Dog" and there was a doc with "Dog" in
the title and several times in the contents of a document that it would
receive a score more like 1.0 or close to it.

Is there a way that I can tweak the score?

I tried using Boost but that did absolutely nothing.
