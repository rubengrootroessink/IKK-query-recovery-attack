We sure do have a recurring theme lately :)  Analysis!

Please refer to my article at java.net:

	http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/07/30/LuceneIntro.html

Look at the AnalysisDemo code.  Copy it over and try it out on the text 
you're using and the Analyzer you're using.  The bracketed text that 
comes out are the "tokens" that you can search on.  It is very very 
important to understand this process and to really know what terms come 
out of text you hand it - otherwise it is a mystery why some things can 
be found and some things cannot despite your expectations to the 
contrary.

A follow-up to the Analysis is querying - and QueryParser has it's own 
set of quirks and caveats related to how things are tokenized/analyzed. 
  And, I've got just the follow-up article for you handy...

	
http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/11/07/QueryParserRules.html

If you digest both of these articles (analysis one first please) then I 
think a lot of questions that get asked on this list will be implicitly 
answered.  Understanding analysis is key.
