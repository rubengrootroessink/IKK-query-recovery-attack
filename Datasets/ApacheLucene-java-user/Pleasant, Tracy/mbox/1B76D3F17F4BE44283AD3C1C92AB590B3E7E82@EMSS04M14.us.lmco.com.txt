DATE: 5 Dec 2003

Maybe I should have been more clear.

static Field Keyword(String name, String value) 
          Constructs a String-valued Field that is not tokenized, but is
indexed and stored. 

I need to have it tokenized because people will search for that also and
it needs to be searchable. 

Should I have two fields - one as a keyword and one as text? 


How would I do that when I want to return search results..

Right now, in the results page it will have something like
<a href="display_record.jsp?id=AR334">Record AR334</a> 

Then in display_record.jsp:
     Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher("index");
     String term = request.getParameter("id");

     Query query = QueryParser.parse(term, "id", new
StandardAnalyzer());

     Hits hits  = searcher.search(query);

Would it have to be something like:
     TermQuery query = ???

or 
     Query query = QueryParser.Term("id");

? ? ?

You really should use a TermQuery in this case anyway, rather than 
using QueryParser.  You wouldn't have to worry about the analyzer at 
that point anyway (and I assume you're using Field.Keyword during 
indexing).
