As a spinoff, I was wondering if anyone has been happy with indexing and searching Word docs.
What about reading the contents? Any problems?

Check out jakarta POI (http://jakarta.apache.org/poi ) particularly the HPSF
API. It allows you to extract metadata like Title, Author, etc. from OLE
documents.
