SUBJECT: Question from a new user : IndexSearcher.doc
DATE: 20 Jun 2010

Hello everybody,

I am new to Apache Lucene and it seems to fit perfectly my needs for my
application.
However I'm a little concerned about something (pardon me if it's a
recurrent question, I've searched the archives but I didn't find something
about that)

So here is my case :

I have index a few files (like 10) and I'm trying to search something stupid
in it. The word "test". So after opening everything etc... (assuming it
works also) I do that :

*Term test = new Term("text_comment","test");*
*        Query query = new TermQuery(test);*
*        TopDocs top = searcher.search(query, 10);*

I want to recover the first document (I have 2 documents in TopDocs), I do :

*IndexSearcher.doc( top[0].doc)*

I searched a little bit in javadoc and I saw that this method uses "int" as
a parameter
I'm a little bit concerned about this... At the moment, I have 10 documents
so that's ok, but if I want to index let's say 20 files documents, how will
the IndexSearcher.doc(int) be able to retrieve documents ?
Same problem if 100.000 files have the word "test" in "text_comment" will I
still be able to get these 100.000 documents or is it going to be a problem
?

Thank you very much.
