SUBJECT: Re: Question from a new user : IndexSearcher.doc
DATE: 20 Jun 2010

Hello Simon,

As I told you, I am quite new with Lucene, so there are many things that
might be wrong.
I'm using Lucene to make a search service for a website that has a large
amount of information daily. This amount of information is directly avaible
as text in a Cassandra Database.
There might be as much as 10.000 new documents added daily, and yes my
concern is it possible to retrieve more documents than the integer max value
?
I don't really see also how the IndexSearcher.doc( ) really works, because
it seems like we give this method an ID and it is going to search in the
indexed documents. So what exactly is going to do this
IndexSearcher.doc(int) ?

*Or are you concerned about retrieving all documents
containing term "XY" if the number of documents matching is large?*
*
*

I'm also concerned by this problem, yes

Could you explain me a little bit how it works, and how Lucene enables one
to retrieve a very large number of documents even if it uses int ?

Thank you for your answers,
Victor
