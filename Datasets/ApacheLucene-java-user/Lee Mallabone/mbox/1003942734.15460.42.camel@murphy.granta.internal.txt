Okay, I'm now not entirely certain how useful a generic solution will be
to me, given the non-generic nature of the content I'm indexing. I think
there a lot of optomizations I can make that wouldn't be generic.

I'll play around and see what I come up with - if anything turns out to
look sufficiently generic that it might be useful, I'll post it to the
list.

Thanks for your thoughts,
