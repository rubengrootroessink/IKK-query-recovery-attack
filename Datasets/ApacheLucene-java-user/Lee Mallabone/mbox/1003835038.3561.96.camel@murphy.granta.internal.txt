I'm indexing HTML documents marked up with comments to indicate field
boundaries. So I'd typically have:

<!--field:section_title-->
blurb
<!--field:text-->
more blurb

and so on. The documents were indexed by looking for each field marker
and then adding the subsequent lines to the relevant field.

In order to obtain a generic solution for context generation are you
suggesting I write a method that takes plain text, (eg, text form of
document) and a query, and assumes the plain text is in the query's
default field?

This doesn't seem quite as useful as getContext(Hashset queryTerms,
Reader originalDocument); which is what I was originally aiming towards.
