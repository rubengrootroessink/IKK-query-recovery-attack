SUBJECT: Determining hit field
DATE: 31 Oct 2001

Hi,

(Apologies if this shows up twice). 

If I do a search such as "field1:jim OR field2:bob" is there any way to
determine for each document that was a hit, which field caused the hit?

Or rather, since they both might, is there any easy way to find out
which fields definitely didn't cause a hit?

Regards,
