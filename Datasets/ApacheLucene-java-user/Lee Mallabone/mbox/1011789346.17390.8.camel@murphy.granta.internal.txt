SUBJECT: mutiple wildcards
DATE: 23 Jan 2002

Hi,

I've been trying to use the wildcard query but am getting strange
results. Could anyone answer the following questions?

1) Will the wildcard query work as expected with a wildcard at the
beginning of a term?
2) Does wildcard query work as expected with more than one wildcard in
the term?

My reason for asking is that I've been getting some really strange
results doing both of the above, and I'm not sure if it's my code that's
wrong, or if I'm just using Lucene incorrectly.

Thanks in advance,
