SUBJECT: bug with phrase searching
DATE: 13 Nov 2001

Hi,

If I index a document with Lucene that contains the phrase "metal or
alloy" using the StopAnalyzer, then when I do a phrase search on just
"metal alloy", the document is a valid hit.

I'm assuming this is because 'or' is a stop word so isn't indexed, as
the slop is still set to 0. Shouldn't the fact that those two tokens are
not a phrase be recorded? Is the current behaviour intended? I consider
it a bug, but am unsure how to go about fixing it...

Regards,
