SUBJECT: Implement SpanScorer on 2.9 lucene lib!
DATE: 30 Sep 2009

Hi, i updated my lucene lib to 2.9.0 and i'm trying to instanciate the
spanscorer but the constructor is protected.
I looked in the javadoc of lucene and saw 2 subclasses of it
(PayloadNearQuery.PayloadNearSpanScorer,
PayloadTermQuery.PayloadTermWeight.PayloadTermSpanScorer).
Using this classes is the best way of implementing spanscorer??
I was using queryscorer but after update to the new lib the highlither
stopped hightlithing my wildcard queries, and i'm rewriting.

Thanks,
