SUBJECT: Reducing memory use!
DATE: 7 Oct 2009

Hi,
i read in some places that reusing the Document e Field instances reduces
the memory use when indexing, is that true??
but looked into Field class, it can only set the name, value and the other
params on the constructor, they dont have a set method.
if reuse them really reduces memory use, how do i do that?

Thanks,
