SUBJECT: Cannot find gdata-server
DATE: 5 Dec 2008

I have setup lucene, test run it and go through samples. 
Now I have been working on setting up GData server by consulting Getting
Started guide
"http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/GdataServer/GettingStarted". 
I have setup JDK, Ant and Tomcat as required. I have checked out the
working copy of GData from svn (at
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/) as specified in
"Getting Stated Guide". 
But I can not proceed the guide, as I can't find the path from
"gdata-server" folder onwards in checked out copy, I think all the
direct links to gdata-server portion of the source
tree are broken. I tried to find other GData Server mirrors to download
the code and binaries but couldn't succeeded.

Can you direct me to any mirror or link, where I can find GData Server
code and binaries ? I will be grateful to you.
