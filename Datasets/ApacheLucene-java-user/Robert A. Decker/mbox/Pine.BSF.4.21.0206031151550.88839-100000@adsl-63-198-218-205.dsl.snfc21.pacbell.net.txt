SUBJECT: Re: QueryParser query inside a Boolean query?
DATE: 3 Jun 2002

uberQuery is a BooleanQuery. uberQuery.toString(null) in one example
search produces:
+type:MedicalInformation      +product:acticin      +name:He*

In this case, He* should return to me a document that has in its name the
word 'Head' (I can't remember but the full name of the document but is
something like 'Use in Treating Head Lice')

Instead, I can only get this document if I type the full word 'Head' (I
use a lowercase filter so 'head' works as well)

name is a QueryParser query, as is product. MedicalInformation is a
TermQuery.

These are added like:
uberQuery.add(typeQuery, true, false);
if (productQuery != null) uberQuery.add(productQuery, true, false);
if (nameQuery != null) uberQuery.add(nameQuery, true, false);
