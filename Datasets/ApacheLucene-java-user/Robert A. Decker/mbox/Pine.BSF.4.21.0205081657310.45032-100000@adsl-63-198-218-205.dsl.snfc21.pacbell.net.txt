SUBJECT: How to get number of indexed documents non-programatically?
DATE: 8 May 2002

I was just wondering if there's a way to get the number of documents
indexed in a lucene index without running any java code? For example, is
there some human-readable information that can be found in the index
files?

thanks,
rob
