First, I assume you were working with the same documents with both, and
the same queries, on the same hardware? 

Can you tell me a bit more about the inktomi system?  What are its
costs? How is it distributed and installed? What type of OSs, hardware,
etc? And, what I'm really interested in, how is it developed? Is it a Java
distribution? A C app? C++, etc?

hmm... I just saw the 'Details' worksheet that you sent. Very
interesting. So, the Inktomi app is a java app? Or was that just the
client?

thanks,
Robert A. Decker
