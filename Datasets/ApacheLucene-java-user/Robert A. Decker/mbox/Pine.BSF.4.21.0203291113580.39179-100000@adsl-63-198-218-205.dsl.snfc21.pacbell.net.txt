Thank you. That actually clears up a lot of my confusion. I've gone a bit
further in my code, to the point of doing searches into my index, and it
looks like everything is working quite beautifully.

I really didn't expect the indexes would be as small as they are, and so
assumed that it wasn't working properly.

One thing I've found that wasn't obvious from the documentation is that if
you want your indexed text to be analyzed, it's not enough to pass in the
analyzer to the indexer. I actually seem to have to index the text before
hand, and so I'm not quite sure what the analyzer is doing and why it
needs to be passed into the indexer.

thanks,
rob
