SUBJECT: What does it take to optimize?
DATE: 3 Apr 2002

My index is larger than it should be. My deletable file has entries. I'm
trying to optimize the index, but it just doesn't seem to be doing
anything. Here's how I'm trying to optimize:

IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(pathToIndex,
                                     fragmentAnalyzer,
                                     false);
writer.close();
writer.optimize();



thanks,
rob
