SUBJECT: Getting the terms that matched the HitDoc?
DATE: 29 Mar 2002

I've been looking around the org.apache.lucene.search.* code and can't
seem to find an answer to this.

I would like to present the terms that matched for each document in the
Hits. For example, to the user it would look like:

***********************************************************
Search Phrase: double blind study found injections
Search Terms: (doubl blind studi found inject)

Results:
Doc1 doubl blind studi found inject
Doc2 doubl blind studi found inject
Doc3 doubl blind studi inject
Doc4 studi inject
...
***********************************************************

Is there a way to get the search terms that were used in the relevance
scoring?


thanks,
rob
