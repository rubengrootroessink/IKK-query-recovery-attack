SUBJECT: Older versions of Lucene?
DATE: 21 Mar 2002

I'm on Java 1.1.8, and can't upgrade beyond that for quite some time due
to testing requirements.

I've managed to compile in and use the 1.2 StringBuffer class that is
required by Lucene. However, I'm getting tons of 'Integer constant out of
range' errors when building. For example:
   0xfffffffffffffffeL, 0xffffffffffffffffL, 0xffffffffffffffffL,
0xffffffffffffffffL

Are all out of range...

Did the size of a long change from 1.1.8 to 1.2? If so, is there a way to
use 1.1.8 and lucene?

If not, is it possible to use an older version?

thanks,
rob
