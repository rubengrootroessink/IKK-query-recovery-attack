SUBJECT: Re: Getting the terms that matched the HitDoc?
DATE: 29 Mar 2002

Thanks. This seems to work for stored fields (although I haven't completed
all of the steps). However, I want it to work with an indexed, but
unstored field, and I'm not getting anything back in my termDocs.

There must be some way to do it because this information is what is being
used in the scoring.

I'll keep poking around the source code, and if you or anyone else has any
more suggestions they would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,
rob
