SUBJECT: is this possible in a query?
DATE: 1 Aug 2002

I have a Text Field named product. Two of the products are:
Cathflo OrthoMed
OrthoMed

When I search for "Cathflo OrthoMed", I correctly only get items that have
the product "Cathflo OrthoMed". However, when I search for "OrthoMed", not
only do I get all "OrthoMed" products, but I also get all "Cathflo
OrthoMed" products.

Is there a way, when searching on a Field.Text type, to limit the above
"OrthoMed" search to only "OrthoMed", and to exclude "Cathflo
OrthoMed"? The solution has to be generic enough to work with any
combination of product names.

thanks,
rob
