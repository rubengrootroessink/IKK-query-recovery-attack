SUBJECT: Exact match query on a field in index which has been indexed using StandardAnalyzer
DATE: 13 May 2008

Hi,

I have a field in index which has been indexed using StandardAnalyzer and as
TOKENIZED. Now I would like to write a query which returns the hit if there
is a exact match on the field value.

Say, if field value is : Member of Technical Staff
then "member of technical staff" OR "Member of Technical Staff" should
returns this document. Note that I am writing the phrase query for matching
the query string.
