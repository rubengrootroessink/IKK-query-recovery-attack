Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org mailing list.

I'm working for my owner, who can be reached
at lucene-user-owner@jakarta.apache.org.


Messages to you from the lucene-user mailing list seem to
have been bouncing. I've attached a copy of the first bounce
message I received.

If this message bounces too, I will send you a probe. If the probe bounces,
I will remove your address from the lucene-user mailing list,
without further notice.


I've kept a list of which messages from the lucene-user mailing list have 
bounced from your address.

Copies of these messages may be in the archive.
To get message 12345 from the archive, send an empty message to:
   <lucene-user-get.12345@jakarta.apache.org>

Here are the message numbers:

   1140
   1138
   1139
   1141
   1142

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at nagoya.betaversion.org.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<archive-lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org>:
/opt/ezmlm/sbin/archive: Cannot open file "/opt/ezmlm/archive/jakarta.apache.org/lucene-user/200203"
