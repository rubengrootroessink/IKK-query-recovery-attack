SUBJECT: Fields with same name but different boosts
DATE: 24 Nov 2003

Hello,

I have the following problem: in my application I'm trying to store set 
of keywords and their weights. Since the number of keywords is variable 
(and can be as high as 40) I decided to use a single field to store it. 
In other words, I want to use a single field with multiple values to 
store a keyword histogram of the document.

Now, I'm wondering how do I encode the weight of keywords... If I do the 
following:

Field f = Field.Keyword("kw", "value1");
f.setBoost(10.0);
doc.add(f);
f = Field.Keyword("kw", "value2");
f.setBoost(20.0);
doc.add(f);

Now the question is: what is the boost value for the fields when I 
search? Is it equivalent to "value1^10.0 value2^20.0" (which is my 
intention), or rather "value1^20.0 value2^20.0"?

If the latter, do you have any suggestions how to achieve the original 
effect?

Thanks in advance!
