That's also how other implementations do it - you need to set an 
arbitrary threshold, and if the profiles score below that threshold then 
an "unknown" value is returned (or null, or Exception).

LI = Language Identification. Sorry for the confusion.

Someone mentioned the Linguini paper, where they found that using "short 
words" features gives similarly good performance as using ngrams.

See also the following papers :

http://www.xrce.xerox.com/Publications/Attachments/1995-012/Gref---Comparing-two-language-identification-schemes.pdf
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/40861.html
http://www.xs4all.nl/~ajwp/langident.pdf

In general, using stop words works only for texts above certain minimum 
length (greater than with n-gram methods), and then gives nearly 100% 
accuracy.

Language Identification performance - in the sense that a given 
identifier "performs" better if it can correctly identify more 
languages, using shorter input text.
