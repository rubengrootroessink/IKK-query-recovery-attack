It may or it may not be the same bug ... I'm not sure, but the symptoms 
are the same. The bug would occur also during partial merges, which 
Lucene initiates itself in the background, even if you don't call 
IndexWriter.optimize().

Please create a JIRA issue describing the symptoms (precisely!), and the 
versions of Lucene involved.
