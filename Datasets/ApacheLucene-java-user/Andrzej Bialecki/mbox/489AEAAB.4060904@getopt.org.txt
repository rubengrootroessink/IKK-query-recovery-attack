Two additional comments:

* the topN results from such incomplete search may be way off, if there 
were some high scoring documents somewhere beyond the limit.

* if you know that there are more important and less important documents 
in your corpus, and their relative weight is independent of the query 
(e.g. PageRank-type score), then you can restructure your index so that 
postings belonging to highly-scoring documents come first on the posting 
lists - this way you have a better chance to collect highly relevant 
documents first, even though the search is incomplete. You can find an 
implementation of this concept in Nutch 
(org.apache.nutch.indexer.IndexSorter).
