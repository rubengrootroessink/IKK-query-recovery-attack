Luke has some bugs, that's for sure, but not as many as one would think 
;) I recommend the following exercise:

* first, check what the "Rewritten" query looks like, in both cases. 
This could be enlightening, because depending on the choice of default 
field and query analyzer results could differ dramatically.

* then, if a query succeeds in matching one or more documents, open this 
document and view its fields using "Reconstruct & edit", especially the 
"Tokenized" version of the field. At this point any potential mismatch 
in query terms vs. analyzed tokens in the field should become apparent.
