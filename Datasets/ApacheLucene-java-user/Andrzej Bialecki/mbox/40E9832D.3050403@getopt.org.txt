... and here lies your problem. StandardAnalyzer lowercases the tokens, 
and strips most of the non-letters from tokens. I suggest using Luke 
(http://www.getopt.org/luke) to look inside your index, and see the 
terms as they ended up in the index, and to try out some other analyzers 
to see which is the most appropriate in your case.
