AFAIK they don't provide a separate converters' API, which is a pity.

The results of the conversion are I think one of the best, if not the 
best, that you can get with OpenSource tools, but the fact that all 
converters are so entangled with the rest of the application practically 
excludes their use in high-volume applications...
