Not that difficult - assuming Lucene supports it. From your list of 
requirements, I think most of these functions are rather difficult to 
implement in the logic part due to limitations in Lucene - at least not 
efficiently. You cannot add a field per se, only add a document which 
contains additional fields. Similarly, you cannot update a field, you 
can only delete a document, and insert a new one with different values. 
Also, I don't think it's feasible to delete fields in the index - this 
would mean re-adding _all_ documents with one field less...

Apart from that, there's no rocket science here, it's just a matter of 
adding some GUI and logic. Thinlet-based applications are easy to modify 
in the View layer, so it's up to the Controller part, if it can be coded 
at all...
