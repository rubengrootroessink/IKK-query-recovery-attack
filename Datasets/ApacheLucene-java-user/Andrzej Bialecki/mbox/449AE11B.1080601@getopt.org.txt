It's straightforward to implement one that keeps the last three tokens 
in a fifo buffer, and then outputs the whole buffer as a phrase.

You will need to store these phrases as terms, i.e. the stuff you return 
in your TokenStream should be this:

term1: token1 token2
term2: token1 token2 token3
term3: token2 token3
term4: token2 token3 token4

Ah, if you can afford the reindexing, then indexing word n-grams would 
be indeed a better option. I had to deal with existing indexes, so I 
resorted to a "dirty hack" way. It's not based on searching, but rather 
on traversing the TermPositions, using IndexReader.termPositions(term). 
It is very intensive, but for tens of thousands docs it is still 
feasible within a couple hours time - which may be still quicker than 
reindexing ...
