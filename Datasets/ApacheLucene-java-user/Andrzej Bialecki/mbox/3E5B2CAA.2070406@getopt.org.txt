No, I'm not - this is clearly stated in the class javadoc. I meant to 
try it out in my application, but haven't got to it yet - I need to 
address first the base functionality, not performance; so, I don't have 
the modified FSDirectory yet... The class is taken from Multivalent 
browser, and is subject to BSD-equivalent license - which means you can 
use it for whatever purpose, and if it turns out to be useful, it can be 
included in Lucene distribution.
