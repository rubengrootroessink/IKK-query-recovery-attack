I didn't give any URL, that's why.. :-) Otis got the package, and he
agreed to put it up somewhere. I can send the ZIP file to you as well,
if you prefer, but I'd rather avoid sending it to the list - it weighs
ca. 1.2MB... To give you some taste, I attached one of the more complex
class diagrams. Each class and member on the picture is linked to a 
javadoc entry that is displayed in another browser frame.

Re: collaboration/activity/sequence diagrams: the tool I'm using is
TogetherJ 6.0, and while class diagrams it produces are quite decent,
sequence diagrams that it creates automatically require significant
manual work - they simply contain too many low-level details, so that
it's difficult to see the broader picture. In the package I made I
created two such diagrams, for two interesting scenarios - one is for
IndexSearcher.search(), the other for IndexWriter.addDocument().

TogethetJ can also convert sequence diagrams to collaboration, and vice
versa. Re: activity diagrams - it doesn't offer such possibility, but
I've seen a demo of commercial version of Poseidon (www.gentleware.com -
free version download), which has a pretty sophisticated support for
this type of diagrams, including even "step-through" function that
visualizes the dynamics of interactions.
