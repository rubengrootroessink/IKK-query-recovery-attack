What you describe is also known as "snippets". In all implementations 
known to me search engines use cached copies of the plain text content 
in order to produce snippets - there is no re-parsing needed, but 
storage requirements are higher.

You can do it in Lucene by storing the plain text content in a stored 
field, and then using the highlighter package from the sandbox to 
produce snippets.
