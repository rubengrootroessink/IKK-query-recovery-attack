You seem to be somewhat confused about what Lucene really is. It's just 
a library, and not an application. It's up to you to provide the logic 
and glue, or to extend any existing demo application to accomodate your 
needs. It's also a _plain_ _text_ search library. So if you want to 
index anything else you need to first convert it to a plain text format.

That's essentially what OOParser does in Nutch. It extracts data from OO 
documents and converts it to plain text. Disregard other stuff in that 
plugin - it has to do with how Nutch passes this data to storage (and 
indexing takes place in a completely different step, so you won't find 
it here). Just use the parts that extract plain text data - and then use 
this plain text data to add fields to Lucene documents.
