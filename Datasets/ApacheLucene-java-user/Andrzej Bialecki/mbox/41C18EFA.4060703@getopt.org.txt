Although my knowledge of Arabic is equal to zero, I suggest that you 
should see how your query looks like after it is parsed 
(Query.toString()), and then compare it to the terms that are actually 
stored in the index. There is a chance that you e.g. apply the stemmer 
twice by using incorrect analyzer, or don't add the stemmed terms to the 
index, or similar. I suggest using Luke (http://www.getopt.org/luke) to 
diagnose your problem - in the "Search" tab you can also view the final 
query terms.
