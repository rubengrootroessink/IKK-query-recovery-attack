Hello,

My knowledge of Korean is near absolute zero... however, your example 
above looks like a typical stemming process for any Western language. 
The stem is not necessarily a valid dictionary word, just something that 
uniquely "labels" a group of related words created from the same root - 
and the transformation from inflected words to a stem can be expressed 
as a series of "patch commands" (insert/remove substring).

I successfully used a Java package, originally created by Leon Galambos 
from Egothor project, to create an algorithmic stemmer for Polish 
(http://www.getopt.org/stempel). The advantage of this particular 
approach is that you don't have to encode specific grammar rules in the 
stemmer, the stemmer learns rules by itself from a training corpus. Such 
training corpus consists of pairs of inflected and base forms, and the 
library automatically learns these "patch commands", i.e. instructions 
for inserting/removing parts of an inflected word to arrive at the base 
form. This training process results in creating a stemmer table, 
reusable even for previously unseen words (based on the similarity of 
character patterns in input words).

I suggest to try the code from the link above and test how it works, 
even if you only have a moderately-sized training corpus (~500 pairs) 
the results should be positive.
