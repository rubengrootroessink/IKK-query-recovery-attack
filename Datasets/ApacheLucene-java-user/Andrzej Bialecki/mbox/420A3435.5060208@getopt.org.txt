You are welcome - you can take any parts except for Thinlet.java (which 
is LGPL-ed).

Yes, I can confirm that all the parts of Luke that I wrote are under 
ASL, and I would actually prefer to donate it than to maintain it all on 
my own, especially with the recent speed of development.

Regarding Thinlet - there is some ongoing discussion on forking the 
project (it's a long story), and we're lobbying up to put the fork under 
  ASL - but it's up to the original author to decide this, and he's 
rather reluctant to let it go like this...

So, if anyone wants to rewrite Luke in Swing, SwiXML or something else, 
he's more than welcome - but this won't be me, because I hate Swing 
programming...
