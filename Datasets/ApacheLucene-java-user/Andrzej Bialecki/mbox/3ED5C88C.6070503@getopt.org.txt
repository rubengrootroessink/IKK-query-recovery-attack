I highly recommend it - it works pretty well, it's stable, mature, and 
most of all free :-) Sure, it has a well-known range of problems, e.g. 
with calls to functions that require structs, but as it happens most of 
the automation interfaces don't use them. I've been using it for 
Java-Windows integration on various occasions, solving such "taboo" 
problems like reading/creating Windows shortcuts, file conversion, 
reading Outlook mail etc.

It works also with DLL's, although this is a bit more involved... It 
uses an extensible marshaller/de-marshaller, so if you know COM pretty 
well you can extend it to handle any conceivable parameter types.
