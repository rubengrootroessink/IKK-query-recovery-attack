I think no specific reason - Lucene is able to index just pure text, 
anything else must go through format converters first. So, the "plain 
text from a db" case is relatively simple...

Yes.

This is the simplest way for creating an infrequently-updated index. If 
you need to do freqeuent updates, then depending on the size of your 
index you may want to play some tricks with RAMDirectory, temporary 
indexes or somesuch, but for the scenario that you described so far it 
is not needed.
