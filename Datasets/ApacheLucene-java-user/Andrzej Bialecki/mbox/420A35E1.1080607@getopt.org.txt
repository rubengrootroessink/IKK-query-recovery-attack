Soundex and Metaphone have been specifically designed for English. I 
know from my experience with Swedish and Polish that their results for 
other languages can range from mediocre to extremely bad. You should 
definitely not blindly trust them, but perform careful tests using some 
test corpus.

For Slavic languages you can use Daitch-Mokotoff instead, but I have no 
idea about Dutch...

Another suggestion: did you try the solution developed by Dave Spencer 
(look for NGramSpeller)?
