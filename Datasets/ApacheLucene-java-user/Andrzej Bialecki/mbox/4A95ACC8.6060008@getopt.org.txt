SUBJECT: Lucene Search Performance Analysis Workshop
DATE: 26 Aug 2009

Hi all,

I am giving a free talk/ workshop next week on how to analyze and 
improve Lucene search performance for native lucene apps. If you've ever 
been challenged to get your Java Lucene search apps running faster, I 
think you might find the talk of interest.

Free online workshop:
Thursday, September 3rd 2009
11:00-11:30AM PDT / 14:00-14:30 EDT

About:
Lucene Performance Workshop:
Understanding Lucene Search Performance
with Andrzej Bialecki

Experienced Java developers know how to use the Apache Lucene library to 
build powerful search applications natively in Java.
LucidGaze for Lucene from Lucid Imagination, just released this week, 
provides a powerful utility for making transparent the underlying 
indexing and search operations, and analyzing their impact on search 
performance.

Agenda:
* Understanding sources of variability in Lucene search performance
* LucidGaze for Lucene APIs for performance statistics
* Applying LucidGaze for Lucene performance statistics to real-world 
performance problems
