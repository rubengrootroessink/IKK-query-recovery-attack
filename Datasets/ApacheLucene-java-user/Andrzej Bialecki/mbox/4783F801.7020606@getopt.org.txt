True, although function query tends to bring more overhead ...

While we're on the subject of complex scoring - I read an interesting 
paper (I don't have a link now), which discussed a so called bucketed 
scoring. The idea is that if your basic scoring is good enough to ensure 
that top-N results are highly relevant, then you can split these results 
into buckets of k documents (let's say 10 ;) ), and within each bucket 
apply arbitrary re-ranking function, which is then very inexpensive to 
perform because of the limited number of documents.

Example: you have a large corpus of web pages, and you want home pages 
to appear first, even if they score somewhat lower - and it doesn't pay 
off to modify the base scoring, because of overfitting, i.e. the scoring 
would be good for home pages but poor for other relevant documents.
