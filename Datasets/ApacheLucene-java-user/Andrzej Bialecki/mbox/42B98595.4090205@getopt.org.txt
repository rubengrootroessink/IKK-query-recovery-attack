No, they don't.

They are not simply different - they represent completely different data 
structures, only accidentally named the same...

In Lucene API there is no such thing as "indexLocation". You probably 
refer to the search demo application, included in Lucene distribution. 
If that's the case, then the answer is no - it won't work with indexes 
created by Nutch. However, if you use Lucene API, you can work with them 
just fine - they are normal Lucene indexes, just the field names, and 
analyzers used are different.

I suggest you to look inside the demo app., and see how Lucene's API is 
used.
