Hi,

Regarding Luke - actually, it would not be so difficult to implement 
this (at least for me ;-) ). Save for some minor exceptions, Luke opens 
an IndexReader once, and I could add another version of the Open dialog 
to use open multiple indexes.

(I can't promise, however, to do it quickly - I'm finalizing a couple of 
projects now, so this has to wait a bit...)
