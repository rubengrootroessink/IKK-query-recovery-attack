Hmm. This brings up a question: the algorithmic stemmer package from 
Egothor works quite well for Polish (http://www.getopt.org/stempel), 
wouldn't it work well for Arabic, too?

I lack the necessary expertise to evaluate results (knowing only two or 
three arabic words ;-) ), but I can certainly help someone to get 
started with testing...
