I'm using successfully a combination of Office automation via Jawin 
(free Java/COM bridge) to convert PPT files. You need to learn a bit 
about the pseudo-object model of PowerPoint to properly convert various 
objects, but this information can be found at msdn.microsoft.com.

Obviously I'd love to learn about an alternative, because then I could 
free my clients from dependance on Office... I already use POI to 
convert XLS and DOC files, and it works _very_ well.
