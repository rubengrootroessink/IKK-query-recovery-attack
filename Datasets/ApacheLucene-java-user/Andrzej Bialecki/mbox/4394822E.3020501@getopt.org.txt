What you (probably) need is to browse through all terms in the index. 
You can do this with Luke - go to the "Documents" tab, and on the 
right-hand side you have a term browser. For each term you can display 
the list of documents containing this term.

Also, you could use the Overview tab, and the Top N terms for a specific 
field, with a large N.
