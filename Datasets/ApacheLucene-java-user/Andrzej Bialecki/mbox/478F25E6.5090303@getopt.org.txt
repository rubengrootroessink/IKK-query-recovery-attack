The conventional wisdom is to use RAMDirectory in such scenarios. I.e. 
you commit frequent updates to a RAMDirectory and frequently reopen its 
Searcher (which should be fast). Periodically, merge the RAMDirectory 
index with your on-disk index - you need to open a new IndexSearcher in 
the background, warm it up with the latest N queries, and when it's 
ready you swap searchers, i.e. you close the old one, purge the 
RAMDirectory (since it was synced to the on-disk index), and start using 
the new IndexSearcher.

And again, start accumulating new docs in the RAMDirectory, etc, etc ...
