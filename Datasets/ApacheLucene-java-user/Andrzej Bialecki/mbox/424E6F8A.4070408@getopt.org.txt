Stemming doesn't have to produce intelligible words, it's the 
lemmatization that does. As long as the stem is unique, and all 
inflected forms of a single base form map to the same stem, it's ok.

In the case above the probability of another word producing the same 
stem "mose" is very low, so this stem is ok, too.
