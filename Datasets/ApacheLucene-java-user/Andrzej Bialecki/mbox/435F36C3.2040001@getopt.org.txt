This doesn't look good. Open the "segments" file with a hex editor and 
check it - is it just "_1d" there (apart from other unrecognizable stuff)?

You can try to manually "explode" the compound format into individual 
files, and then try to go from there - please look at 
org.apache.lucene.index.CompoundIndexReader how to read the compound 
format. In the best case, this could mean that you will have to recreate 
the .fnm file, in the worst case... well, you already know. :-/

No, this is very unlikely. What is more likely the cause is that the 
application (or machine) crashed during write or optimize.

Upgrade?
