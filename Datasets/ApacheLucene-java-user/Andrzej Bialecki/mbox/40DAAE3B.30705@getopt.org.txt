Time to refresh my russian... :-) Ok, the problem seems to be in the 
RussianAnalyzer - it uses RussianLetterTokenizer, which filters out 
anything which is a non-letter - I'm afraid it filters out also the 
wildcard at the end. Not only that, it then passes the tokens through a 
RussianStemmer, which further mutilates the tokens.

Please try the "Parsed query view" on the "Search" tab to see what is 
the result of your query, or paste your query into the text area on the 
AnalyzerTool plugin ("Plugins"), and see what tokens you get using 
RussianAnalyzer.

I just did it, and the result for "высказал*" was "высказа" - clearly 
not what you wanted.
