Yes, that's precisely the idea. It combines the advantages of simple 
(hence fast) scoring inside the IR system, with a complex (hence slow) 
reordering of a small sample of results, performed outside the IR system 
prior to delivering the results.

It should definitely be something outside Lucene - it's meant for cases 
that require more complex ranking (or faster) than those available 
through function query. I only mentioned this here because it is simple 
to implement, yet produces useful results difficult to obtain through 
the usual means (similarity, boosting, even function query).
