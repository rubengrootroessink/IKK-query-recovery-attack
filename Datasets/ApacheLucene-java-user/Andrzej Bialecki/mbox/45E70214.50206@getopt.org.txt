Nutch maintains a set of separate DBs (using Hadoop 
MapFile/SequenceFile), where inlinks are stored (together with their 
anchor text). During indexing this data is pulled in from the DBs piece 
by piece using the URLs as "primary keys".

Nutch doesn't update _any_ data structures in-place - all "update" 
operations involve creating new data files and optionally deleting old 
data files. This includes also indexes - new indexes are being created 
from newly updated pages, and then only individual Lucene documents are 
deleted from older indexes to get rid of duplicates. After a while, 
really old indexes are removed completely, because their content is 
likely to be present in one of the newer indexes.
