Isn't the latter a pre-requisite for the former ? ;)

Regarding the subject: in many cases when I needed this information I 
used a brute-force method (traversing the term positions), and usually 
for moderately-sized indexes this was quick enough, i.e. in the order of 
minutes or hours. Of course, if you need something as quick as a search 
operation, this won't do.
