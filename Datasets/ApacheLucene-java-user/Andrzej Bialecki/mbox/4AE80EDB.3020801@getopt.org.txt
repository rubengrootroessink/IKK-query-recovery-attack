It's also possible to do the tokenization ahead of time, i.e. before you 
pass the document to IndexWriter. You can construct the TokenStream 
using your own analysis chain, and use Field.setTokenStreamValue() - 
this way you will index exactly the token stream you want, and you can 
even create other fields in the document (or split this token stream 
into several fields).
