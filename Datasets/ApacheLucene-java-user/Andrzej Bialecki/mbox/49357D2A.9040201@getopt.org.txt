Well ... It could be done, but not easily.

First, NutchDocumentAnalyzer is dependent on other Nutch classes (so you 
need nutch-${version}.jar) but they in turn depend on Hadoop (so you 
need hadoop-core*.jar), which in turn depends on a dozen or so other 
jars ... All of this needs to be added to classpath.

Second, this analyzer doesn't have a no-args constructor, it needs a 
Hadoop Configuration argument. Luke can handle only no-args or single 
String arg constructors. I would have to change the way Analyzers are 
instantiated in Luke so that you can pass an existing instance (e.g. one 
that you created in the scripting plugin context).

Third, NutchDocumentAnalyzer uses CommonGrams, which in turn _require_ 
the presence of a common-grams.utf8 resource on the classpath.

To summarize: unless you want to get your hands dirty with Luke 
internals it can't be done.
