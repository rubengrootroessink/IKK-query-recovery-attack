Hello,

Since you are trying this anyway, and looking for ways to improve 
indexing times... Could you perhaps try to replace use of 
java.io.RandomAccessFile in FSDirectory implementation, with the 
attached implementation? It supposedly increases I/O throughput by 
orders of magnitude, by using partial buffering.
