You may want to use Luke (http://www.getopt.org/luke) to see the details 
of your index. You should be able to find documents by using a simple 
term query on the Documents tab, and then move on to the Search tab and 
see how your more complex queries are being rewritten.

It's also possible that some of the hits fall below the threshold of the 
default HitCollector.
