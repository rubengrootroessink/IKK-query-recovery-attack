I guess ;) that generally speaking there is no good answer to this - the 
same token stream could have been produced by varying analysis chains, 
even across indexing sessions that append to the same index.

Yes.

Theoretically one could store such information in 
IndexCommit.getUserData(). The lack of standardized metadata is an 
issue, of course - we could start experimenting with this in Luke, to 
see whether we can squeeze a subset of Solr schema there.
