Paul,

I'm in the process of moving Luke to Google Code, to give others a 
better chance of providing patches and new features. The project should 
be already up, with the issue tracker etc.

	http://code.google.com/p/luke

The Thinlet L&F is poor, I know - but my Swing skills are poor too, so 
either you have to bear with it, or do the port from Thinlet to Swing 
yourself ;) Keyboard shortcuts are hardcoded somewhere deep in Thinlet, 
but likely they could be made configurable.

You can find an EPS version of the Lucene logo here:
