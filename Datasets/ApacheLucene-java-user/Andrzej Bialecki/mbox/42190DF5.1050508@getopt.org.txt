SUBJECT: ANN: Luke 0.6 - Lucene Index Toolbox
DATE: 20 Feb 2005

Hello,

I'm pleased to announce that the new version of Luke, the Lucene Index 
Toolbox, is available for download at:

	http://www.getopt.org/luke

You can find the full list of changes and new functionality at the URL 
above. The most interesting addition is the introduction of a scripting 
framework based on Mozilla Rhino JavaScript engine. Two of the new 
plugins (Custom Similarity designer, and the Scripting console) make use 
of this framework.

To all people who provided their comments, suggestions, bug-fixes and 
patches - thank you! If you feel I missed your input in this release, 
please keep nagging... ;-)

-- 
Best regards,
Andrzej Bialecki
