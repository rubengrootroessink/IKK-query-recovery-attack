If you added 2-grams, then it would look like this (constructing also 
special start/end grams):

conts -> _c co on nt ts s_
const -> _c co on ns st t_

which gives 50% of overlap.

In another system that I designed we were using a combination of 2-4 
grams, albeit for a slightly different purpose, so in this case it would be:

conts:
	_c co on nt ts s_, _co con ont nts ts_, _con cont onts nts_

const:
	_c co on ns st t_, _co con ons nst st_, _con cons onst nst_

and the overlap is 40%.

Yes, sounds like a good idea. Even though it increases the size of the 
lookup index, it still beats using the linear search...
