In short: unless you created TermFrequencyVector when adding the
document, the answer is "with great difficulty".

For a working code that does this see here:

http://code.google.com/p/luke/source/browse/trunk/src/org/getopt/luke/DocReconstructor.java

If you really need such kind of access in your application then add your
documents with term vectors with offsets and positions. Even then,
depending on the Analyzer you used, the process is lossy - some input
data that was discarded by Analyzer is simply no longer available.
