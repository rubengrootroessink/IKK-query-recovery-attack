Correct, that's exactly how this function works in Luke.

For each term it checks whether the term belongs to the document, 
retrieves all positions of this term and puts the term at correct 
positions in an array, which represents all terms of the document. 
Finally elements of this array are concatenated using spaces.

That's all there is to it :)
