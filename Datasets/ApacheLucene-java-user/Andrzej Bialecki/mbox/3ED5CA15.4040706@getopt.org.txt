Yes, I checked this solution in the past, but (unless something changed 
drastically) OpenOffice converters and Java integration are coupled 
tightly with the whole suite, so basically you have to install the whole 
suite (50MB?) just to be able to use the converters. In my case (a 
desktop utility) that would be an overkill... However, for server-based 
converters this could make a lot of sense - but then I believe you can 
work directly with the internal OO object model instead of xml files.

And I agree that their Java SDK has almost everything you may want, even 
a nice document bean that allows you to work with a document editor in 
JComponent.
