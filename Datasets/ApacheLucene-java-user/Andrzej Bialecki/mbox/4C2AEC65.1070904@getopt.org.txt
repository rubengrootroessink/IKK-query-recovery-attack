There are some other low-level ways to do this, but the easiest is to
use a FilterIndexReader, especially since you just want to add a stored
field - implement a subclass of FilterIndexReader that adds a new field
in getFieldNames() and document(int). Then use
IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]) to create the output index.

Not really, and the re-construction is very costly. Indexing is a lossy
process, so not all content can be recovered. See the "Reconstruct &
Edit" functionality in Luke (http://www.getopt.org/luke).
