Ok, I just realized that I need to collect more input from you, so that 
the diagrams will be more useful for the public at large.

When I work in Together on coding stuff, I usually set the level of 
diagram details to Implementation (then it shows all class members, all 
parameters in method signatures, in short - as much as it can do). 
However, the diagrams are usually rather cluttered, for any package 
above 10 classes or so. When I need to grasp conceptual dependencies, I 
set the detail level to Design, and then it shows only the 
method/attribute names, types, and visibility (no parameters, no initial 
values). It presents a much cleaner picture, but you can't immediately 
see method signatures - you can see them only when you click on them 
(this works in documentation too - you need to click on a diagram to see 
the classic javadoc entry in a separate frame).

I also assume that we want to see classes and members with any kind of 
visibility (including private).

Also, another diagram option is to use UML style for classes (i.e. class 
members are presented as name(parameters...):type) or Java style ( type 
name(parameters...) ) - I guess more people would want the Java style...

Let me know what you think - as I said, after you decide on something, 
it's 10 minutes to generate the diagrams.
