* Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Carlos Castillo, Flavio Junqueira, Vassilis 
Plachouras, Fabrizio Silvestri, 2007: Challenges on Distributed Web 
Retrieval: "The disadvantage of term partitioning is having to build 
initially the entire global index. This does not scale well, and it is 
not useful in actual large scale Web search engines. There are, however, 
some advantages of this approach in the query processing phase. Webber 
et al. show that term partitioning results in lower utilization of 
resources [49]. More speciﬁcally, it signiﬁcantly reduces the number of 
disk accesses and the volume of data exchanged. Document partitioning 
however is still better in terms of throughput, because of an uneven 
distribution of work load in term partitioning."

* Claudine Badue, Ricardo Baeza-Yates, 2001: Distributed Query 
Processing Using Partitioned Inverted Files (note that their conclusion 
that global partitioning is more efficient than local partitioning is 
based on a crucial assumption of being able to distribute the load 
efficiently. Other papers indicate that this is a very complex issue).

* Claudine Badue, Ramurti Barbosa, Paulo Golgher: Distributed Processing 
of Conjunctive Queries. This paper evaluates the bottlenecks in an 
engine with local index partitioning.

* Justin Zobel, Alistair Moffat, 2006: Inverted Files for Text Search 
Engines

* Claudio Lucchese, Salvatore Orlando, Raﬀaele Perego, Fabrizio 
Silvestri, 2006: Mining Query Logs to Optimize Index Partitioning in 
Parallel Web Search Engines

* Ronny Lempel, Shlomo Moran, 2002: Optimizing Result Prefetching in Web 
Search Engines with Segmented Indices

... and quite a few other papers that I don't remember now ... please do 
a search for "distributed IR" on ACM or Citeseer.
