Please take a look at the analyzer implementation that Nutch uses 
(org.apache.nutch.analysis.NutchDocumentAnalyzer), which uses 
CommonGrams to detect which tokens need to be output as phrases. In your 
case you already know what are the phrases you want to output as tokens, 
but the idea is still the same - the original token stream is modified 
to output both individual terms and phrases.
