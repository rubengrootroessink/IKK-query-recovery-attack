Well ... Sure, nothing can replace a human mind. But believe it or not, 
there are studies which show that even human experts can significantly 
differ in their opinions on what are key-phrases for a given text. So, 
the results are never clear cut with humans either...

So, in this sense a heuristic tool for sentence splitting and key-phrase 
detection can go long ways. For example, the application I mentioned, 
uses quite a few heuristic rules (+ Markov chains as a heavier 
ammunition :-), and it comes up with the following phrases for your 
email discussion (the text quoted below):

(lang=EN): NLP, trainable rule-based tagging, natural language 
processing, apache, NLP expert

Now, this set of key-phrases does reflect the main noun-phrases in the 
text... which means I have a practical and tangible benefit from NLP. 
QED ;-)

Best regards,
Andrzej
