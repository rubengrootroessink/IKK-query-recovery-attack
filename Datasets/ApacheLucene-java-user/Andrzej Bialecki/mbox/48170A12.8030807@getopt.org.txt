DistributedFileSystem performance for random seeks is several times 
worse than that of LocalFileSystem. This directly impacts Lucene 
response time.

One solution would be to implement the searching as an application that 
executes in a distributed fashion (not sure if map-reduce is the best 
model here), but first copies the indexes to LocalFileSystem.
