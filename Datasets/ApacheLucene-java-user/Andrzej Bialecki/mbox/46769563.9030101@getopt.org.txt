Another good old trick is to index field values (tokenized) with 
appended special starting and ending tokens, e.g. instead of "Hiran 
Magri" use "_start_ Hiran Magri _end_". Then you can query for fields 
that are exactly equal to a phrase, while still retaining the 
possibility to search by individual terms and phrases not equal to the 
field value.
