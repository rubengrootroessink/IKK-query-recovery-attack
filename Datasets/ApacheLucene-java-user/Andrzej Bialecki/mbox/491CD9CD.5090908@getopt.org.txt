SUBJECT: [ANN] Luke 0.9 released
DATE: 14 Nov 2008

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce that the new release of Luke - the Lucene Index 
Toolbox - is available for download (or WebStart use) here:

	http://www.getopt.org/luke

Changes in v. 0.9:
------------------
This release adds many functionality enhancements and advanced features 
available in Lucene 2.4.

* New features and improvements:
   o Added new tools:
     + Check Index - checks Lucene indexes for problems, and can fix some
       of them. This is a GUI front-end to the Lucene CheckIndex tool.

     + Export to XML - exports index data and metadata to an XML file.
       This is available both from the GUI and from the command-line.

   o Significantly improved Optimize and Cleanup tools.

   o Added ability to set norms on any indexed field in a document, or a 
range of documents.

   o Delete multiple documents by specifying ranges of document numbers.

   o Added support for new field functionality: omitTF and binary fields.

   o Improve the low-level information about the index, including format 
version.

   o Show interesting details about IndexCommit points and associated files.

   o Add short explanations of index files' functions.

   o Improve document reconstruction - now the information from 
TermFreqVector can be used if available. Also, DocReconstructor can be 
used outside of Luke.

   o Significantly improved advanced search options - QueryParser 
settings, Similarity and HitCollector settings.

   o Read-only functionality is supported directly in IndexReader.

* Bug fixes:
A lot of effort went into refactoring the code, moving away if possible 
from the spaghetti code influenced by Thinlet and into a modular design. 
Still much needs to be done here. :(

This means that there are likely many more bugs than in the previous 
release, although I tested all functionality to make sure that there is 
no data loss.

HOWEVER, if you work with precious data, it's always a good idea to use 
the "Read-only" option.

As usually, bug reports or suggestions for improvements, or even better 
patches, are welcome!
