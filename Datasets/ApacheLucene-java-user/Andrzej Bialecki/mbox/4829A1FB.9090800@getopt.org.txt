Yet another option ... In the past I used a licensed copy of MS Office 
to extract things that I wanted, using a bit of OLE automation and 
VBscript. Worked reasonably well, in the sense that I had no issues 
whatsoever with extracting the content _and_ formatting from any 
documents that could be normally opened with MS Office - however, 
performance was an issue, ie. it was slow, CPU/memory hog, and 
occasionally it would get stuck in a weird state when only complete 
reboot would help.
