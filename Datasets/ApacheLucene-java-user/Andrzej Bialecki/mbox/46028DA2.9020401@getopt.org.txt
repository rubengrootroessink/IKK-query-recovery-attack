So long as it meets the Apache license conditions regarding the 
distribution it's not forbidden. It could be confusing or superfluous, 
but it couldn't be illegal.

Actually, I often find myself in a similar situation to "rubdabadub". 
I'm working on several commercial projects that use and modify 
Lucene/Nutch, and often such modifications are proprietary (about 
equally often they are not, and are submitted as patches).

Over time, the issue of tracking the vendor source tree and merging from 
that tree (per svnbook) to several different private svn repos becomes a 
tricky and time-consuming business ... I'd welcome any improvements here.

It seems I need to find some time to get more familiar with bzr ...
