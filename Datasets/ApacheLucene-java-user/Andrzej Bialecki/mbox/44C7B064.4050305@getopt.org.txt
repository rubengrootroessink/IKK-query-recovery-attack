Just for the record - I've been using javamail POP and IMAP providers in 
the past, and they were prone to hanging with some servers, and resource 
intensive. I've been also using Outlook (proper, not Outlook Express - 
this is AFAIK impossible to work with) via a Java-COM bridge such as 
Jawin or JNIWrapper plus Redemption . This also tends to be rather 
unstable, and requires a lot of fine-tuning ...

So, be prepared to suffer quite a bit. ;)
