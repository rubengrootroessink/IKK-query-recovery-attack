Then perhaps this value should be removed from the Luke's display ... 
because it will always read 1, and it's a correct value (see below).

Document.setBoost / getBoost is _only_ guaranteed to return the same 
value if a document is newly created, i.e. it hasn't been stored & 
retrieved. This is related to the way Lucene stores boost values in the 
index - in order to save storage space the boost value is never stored 
explicitly, instead during the storing process it's multiplied by every 
field's lengthNorm, and stored together as a single-byte float.

(Actually, it's a function of the current index format - perhaps in the 
future Lucene will be able to store these values separately using 
another type of storage. So far there was no pressing need to do this).
