Yes.

Lucene doesn't have any "web page" - Lucene is a library. This means 
that you are using some kind of web application based on Lucene. The 
exact details of how a query is run with the index (e.g. the default 
field, analyzer, etc) depend on the application. You cannot just blindly 
use a specific application (which assumes specific things about the 
index) with any random index, and hope that it works...

Well, perhaps the only exception to that rule would be Luke 
(http://www.getopt.org/luke), which you should try anyway to get a 
better understanding of what's in the index.

What is the query? What is the analyzer?
