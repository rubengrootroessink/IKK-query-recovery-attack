SUBJECT: Re: how to get results without getting total number of found documents?

Vlad,

Please check published papers on sampling inverted indexes and 
multi-level caching - this is most probably what Google and other major 
search engines use.

You can see a simple implementation of this principle in Nutch - the 
index is sorted in decreasing order by a PageRank-like score (the logic 
for this is in IndexSorter.java), and then when running a query we only 
collect top-N results, and extrapolate total numbers over the whole 
collection, assuming certain model of term distributions 
(LuceneQueryOptimizer.LimitedCollector).
