(note: this is a low-level hack, you can damage your index beyond repair).

Take a look at FieldInfos class, and how it creates the *.fnm file for 
each segment. You can re-write these fnm files using new field names. In 
case of compound indexes you will need to "explode" them first to a 
non-compound format.

Make sure you write out these files using exactly the same order of 
fields, otherwise you will end up in big trouble ;)
