Take a look at SOLR-1632. Indeed, it's not possible to do this using 
Similarity alone. You will need something like the DFSource class in 
that patch, i.e. a subclass of IndexSearcher, where you populate 
term->DF map with values obtained from the full index, and then you use 
this map to calculate IDF.
