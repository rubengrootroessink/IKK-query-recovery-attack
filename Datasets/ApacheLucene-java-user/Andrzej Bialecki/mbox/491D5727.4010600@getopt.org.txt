Sorry about that - I'm glad it was disposable data. BTW, if you have a 
small test index with multiple commit points could you please send it to 
me off the list?

Theoretically when you open a read-only IndexReader you can't delete 
anything using that IndexReader, but in practice Luke directly accesses 
the underlying Directory in many other places ... I forgot about the use 
of IndexFileDeleter - and indeed passing the read-only flag here can 
solve this, because then I can always use KeepAllDeletionPolicy when 
opening read-only.

Thanks for the report!
