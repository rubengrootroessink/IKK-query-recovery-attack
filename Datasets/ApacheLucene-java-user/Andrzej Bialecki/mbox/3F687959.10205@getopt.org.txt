A word of warning: PDFBox is fantastic, I agree - but some PDFs are not 
so... In my application I experienced numerous hangs when PDFBox would 
start parsing some PDFs (I can send the files to Ben if required), and 
then got stuck in an infinite wait somewhere... So I came up with a 
workaround: I run the parser in a separate thread, while waiting in the 
main thread, and then after a certain timeout I kill the processing 
thread and return.
