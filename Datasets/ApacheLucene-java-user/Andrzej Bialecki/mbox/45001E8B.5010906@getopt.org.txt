No, it can't (at least not yet). As a workaround you can extract these 
portions of text to another field (or multiple fields), and then add 
them with a higher boost. Then, expand your queries so that they include 
also this field. This way, if query matches these special tokens, 
results will get higher rank because of matching on this boosted field.
