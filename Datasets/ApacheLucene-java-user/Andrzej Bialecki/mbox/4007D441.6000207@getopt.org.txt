I realize this is not exactly the answer, but you may want to try one of 
the new features of Luke (http://www.getopt.org/luke), namely the query 
result explanation.

Currently the best way to start Luke is to use Java WebStart. Then open 
an already existing index, go to the Search tab, enter a query (use 
"Update" button to see exactly what it is parsed into), press Search, 
and then highlight one of the results and press "Explain".

It was revealing for me to see how weights, boosts, normalizations etc. 
are applied "under the hood" so to speak, especially for  Fuzzy or 
Phrase queries.

After experimenting a little, you may want to consult the classes in 
org.apache.lucene.search (e.g. Scorer and Similarity) to see the gory 
details.
