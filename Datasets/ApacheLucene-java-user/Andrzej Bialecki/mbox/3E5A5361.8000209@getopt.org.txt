Wow, that was fast... :-) Yes, it seems this is the functionality I'm 
looking for. Do you think it would be possible/feasible to modify the 
searching classes so that they create Explanations at the same time I'm 
running the query? Should I expect a similar cost for that as creating 
Explanations separately?

BTW: I tried to contact you regarding some help in a commercial project. 
Is <doug@lucene.com> the right way to do it?

Thanks!
