I wish that were the case ;)

No, this simply means that you will be able to use the xml-query-parser 
instead of the regular one (actually wrapping the regular one, but 
that's an impl. detail). There will be a checkbox to switch between the 
parsers, and in the future we can turn this into a dropdown if there are 
more parsers available.
