Just a comment: for ext2fs and BSD FFS (dunno about NT) scalability 
issues with this approach can be partially addressed by building a tree 
of subdirectories, instead of using just one. I.e. a file named 
"myThesis.pdf" would go into /m/y/t/myThesis.pdf. This way the time 
needed to list the files in a given directory is reduced (both unixes 
can already cache the inode numbers for name/inode lookup, so there is 
no significant time increase to lookup a longer path).

FreeBSD also has a special kind of filesystem, which uses inodes in a 
flat space (no directories). It was specifically designed for storing 
large numbers of files efficiently. Recent versions of Java on FreeBSD 
(1.4.2) seem to be very stable and performing well, so that could also 
be an option.

After all, a filesystem _is_ a kind of very specialized database... ;-)
