SUBJECT: ANN: Luke 0.45 released
DATE: 17 Jan 2004

Hello,

"Release early, release often.." - well, perhaps too early in the case 
of 0.4 :-) There have been some small but annoying bugs in that release, 
which merited a quick fix. As a bonus you will get some new features as 
well... Standard text follows:

Luke is a Lucene index browser and diagnostic tool, available under 
Apache License. Please see the following link for more details, 
binaries, sources and Java WebStart version:

     http://www.getopt.org/luke

Note to Java Webstart users: you should get the new version the next 
time you start Luke.

Note to others: just use Java WebStart, ok? ;-)

Changes in v. 0.45:

     * Added more details to the Overview panel.
     * Add support for undeleting all deleted documents.
     * Add Boost column to Document view.
     * Use nicer formatting for numbers in the Explain window.
     * Fix for not updating the parsed query view when pressing Search.
     * Fix the JNLP file to require J2SE 1.3+.
     * By popular demand, add a single self-contained JAR to the binary 
distribution.
     * Minor restructuring to increase reuse.

Screenshots have been updated, too. Enjoy!
