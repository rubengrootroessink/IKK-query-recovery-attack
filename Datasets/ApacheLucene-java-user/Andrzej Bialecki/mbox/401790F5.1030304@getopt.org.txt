There are other tricks you can use here, too... In one of my projects I 
had a need to store a list of weighted keywords. No problem storing 
multiple tokens under the same field name, as Erik explained above. 
However, in Lucene you can only apply a single boost value to a field. I 
ended up encoding the keywords like "10.0 keyword" and then writing an 
analyzer which skips the initial numbers when processing this particular 
field (which was stored, indexed and tokenized).
