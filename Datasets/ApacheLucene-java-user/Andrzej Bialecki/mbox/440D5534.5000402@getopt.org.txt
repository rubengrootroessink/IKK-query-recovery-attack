A few comments:

* you can use your own crawler, and then only write some glue code to 
convert the output of that crawler to the format that Nutch uses.

* Nutch can be run in a so called "local" mode, without using NDFS

* the core map-reduce and I/O functionality has been split to its own 
project, Hadoop, where the development is taking place at a furious rate 
;-) This code is completely independent of Nutch or Lucene. You can 
implement your own data processing using this framework.
