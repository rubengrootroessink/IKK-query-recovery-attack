Luke simply iterates over all terms, and collects terms and their 
positions in a selected document, and then builds an array of terms, 
inserting them at correct positions. If there are gaps in positions, it 
inserts nulls.

For a large index with many terms this could take long (an hour?) - 
whether it's a viable option to you depends on the value you put on that 
document's data, and how often you need to do this ...
