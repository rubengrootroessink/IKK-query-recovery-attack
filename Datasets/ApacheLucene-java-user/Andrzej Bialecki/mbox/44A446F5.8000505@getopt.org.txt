Well, in practice it does help - see the way this is done in Nutch 
(src/java/org/apache/nutch/searcher/LuceneQueryOptimizer$LimitedCollector). 
Performance-wise, with large indexes this makes a big difference.

The problem that you need to address, though, is how usable are partial 
results, i.e. if you are reasonably sure that by collecting only partial 
results you are not missing important hits, which would have been found 
had you let the search collect all results ... This facility in Nutch is 
used only if posting lists are sorted by decreasing document importance 
(see IndexSorter for details), so that we collect first the most highly 
ranking hits, and skip low ranking ones.
