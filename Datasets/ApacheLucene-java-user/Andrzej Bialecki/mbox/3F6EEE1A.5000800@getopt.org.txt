TagSoup is great - however, it is not maintained nor developed (the same 
could be said about JTidy as well, but TagSoup's history is much 
shorter...). I'm using HTMLParser (http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net) 
for my application, and it also works very well, even for ill-formed 
input. It's also very actively developed.
