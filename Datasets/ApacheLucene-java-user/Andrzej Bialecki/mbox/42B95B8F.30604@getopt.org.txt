Nutch already uses Lucene, in fact it wouldn't be able to do without it. 
Nutch creates so called "segments" (meaning is different from Lucene 
segments), which can be indexed to produce Lucene indexes, which are 
then used for searching.

I suggest to use Luke (http://www.getopt.org/luke) to investigate such 
index first, before using it in a separate application. Nutch uses 
non-standard analyzer, so that the terms in the index are sometimes 
different (e.g. some words are combined into bi-grams).
