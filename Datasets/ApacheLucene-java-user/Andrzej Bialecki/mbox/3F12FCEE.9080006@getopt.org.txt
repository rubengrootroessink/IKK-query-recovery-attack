Well, you can resize the main window.. :-) Regarding column sizes: 
that's a limitation of the GUI toolkit (soon to be fixed) - if you can 
wait patiently a couple weeks for the new release of that toolkit, I can 
add this as well...

In any case, if you're referring to the "Search" panel, then you can 
always double-click on one of the search results, and it will be 
displayed in the "Documents" panel, where you can not only see all the 
fields, but also copy them to clipboard...
