SUBJECT: ANN: Luke 0.4 released
DATE: 11 Jan 2004

Hello all,

I'm pleased to announce that Luke v. 0.4 has been released. Luke is a 
Lucene index browser and diagnostic tool, available under Apache 
License. Please see the following link for more details, binaries, 
sources and Java WebStart version:

	http://www.getopt.org/luke

Note to Java Webstart users: you should get the new version the next 
time you start Luke.

Note to others: just use Java WebStart, ok? ;-)

Changes in v. 0.4:
------------------
* Use Lucene 1.3-FINAL. The WebStart version has been changed, so that 
it uses two separate JARs - one contains Luke, the other Lucene.

* Added support for compound index format. It's also possible to change 
the format during optimization.

* visualization of the query parsing. When you change the Analyzer or 
default field, or perform a Search, you can see the QueryParser's idea 
of what the final query looks like. Suggested by Erik Hatcher.

* added functionality to view the explanation for a hit.

* bugfix for broken behavior: when selecting "Show All Docs" on the 
"Documents" view, the program would use a QueryParser, whereas it should 
simply construct a primitive TermQuery. This bug could result in 
mysterious "No Results" on the search page. Spotted by Erik Hatcher.

Thank you for your comments and contributions!
