I believe all Win32 JVM-s have a limit of ~1.3GB (~1.9GB if using 
rebase.exe), which quite often can't be reached anyway due to memory 
fragmentation. Read here for a somewhat funny analysis:

*nix OS-es on 32-bit platforms indeed have 4GB addressing space, but at 
least 1GB of this space is reserved for kernel use ... If I'm not 
mistaken most 2.6.x Linux distros run now with 1GB/3GB split between 
kernel/user space, and 2.4.x kernels ran with 2GB/2GB split.
