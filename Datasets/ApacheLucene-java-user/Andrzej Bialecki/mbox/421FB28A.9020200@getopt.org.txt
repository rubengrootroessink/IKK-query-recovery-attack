Well, you could try to use the "Reconstruct & Edit" function - this will 
give you an idea what tokens ended up in the index, and which was the 
last one. In Luke 0.6, if the field is stored then you will see two tabs 
- one is for stored content, the other displays tokenized content where 
tokens are separated by commas. If the field was un-stored, then the 
only tab you will get will be the reconstructed content. In any case, 
just scroll down and check what are the last tokens.

You could also look for presence of some special terms that occur only 
at the end of that document, and check if they are present in the index.

There are really only few reasons why this might be happening:

* your extractor has a bug, or
* the max token limit is wrongly set, or
* the indexing process doesn't close the IndexWriter properly.
