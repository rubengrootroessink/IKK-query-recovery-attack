Hmmm... doesn't want to work for me, though - I tried it also this way. 
It returns a non-null Package instance, but getImplementationVersion and 
any other version-related methods return null. And I'm pretty sure the 
manifest is there, and it contains the following values:

Name: org/apache/lucene
Specification-Title: Lucene Search Engine
Specification-Version: 1.9-rc1-dev
Specification-Vendor: Lucene
Implementation-Title: org.apache.lucene
Implementation-Version: build 2005-02-16
Implementation-Vendor: Lucene
