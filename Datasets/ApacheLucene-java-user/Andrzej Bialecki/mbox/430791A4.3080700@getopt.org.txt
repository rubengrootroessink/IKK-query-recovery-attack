Erhm... Not to rain on your parade, but Googling for "ngram java" gives 
a lot of hits. http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngramj and also 
"languageidentifier" in Nutch are two examples of Open Source Java 
implementations. Each can be used with Lucene.

A lot depends on the reference profiles (which in turn depend on the 
quality of your training corpus - in this case, your corpus is not the 
best choice, because each text contains a lot of foreign words). It was 
also found that the way you create ngram profiles (e.g. with or without 
surrounding spaces, single length or mixed length) affects the LI 
performance. For documents with mixed languages it was also found that 
methods, which combine ngrams with stopwords, work better.

Additionally, simple methods based on cosine similarity (or delta 
ranking) don't give correct results for documents with mixed languages. 
In such cases input texts are chunked, and each chunk is analyzed 
separately, and then the scores are combined... etc, etc... millions of 
ways you can do this - and of course no method is perfect. :-)

So, there is still a lot to do in this area, if you come up with some 
unique way of improving LI performance...
