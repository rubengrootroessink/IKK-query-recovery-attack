Yes.

Lucene does not provide this functionality (yet?). If you try to read 
from index a document that contains "unstored" fields, you will get 
nulls instead of their values. In other words, you cannot read the 
Document instance, modify it, and then add it - because you will lose 
all information from "unstored" fields. Also, when you re-add the 
document all fields need to be analyzed once again.

"They" (me and Luke :) do it the hard way - we iterate over all terms in 
the index, and then iterate over all documents which contain that term. 
If the enumeration contains the selected doc number, terms and their 
positions are put in the target term array. After going through the 
whole index, we end up with an array containing all terms and every 
position of each term in the document. This array is then concatenated 
using spaces. That's it - not really a solution, rather a hack.

This could be sped up using term vectors (Lucene 1.4.x), but you first 
need to build your index with term vectors.
