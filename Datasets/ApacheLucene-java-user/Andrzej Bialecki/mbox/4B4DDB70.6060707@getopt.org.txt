Internally stored/indexed fields are handled like that.

Actually, you can implement your own Fieldable, and return what you want 
from its methods. You can also use Field constructor that takes the 
stored value, and then use Field.setTokenStream(TokenStream) - it 
doesn't override the stored value.
