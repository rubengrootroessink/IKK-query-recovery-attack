What you describe reminds me of a special case of a more general 
visualization technique called Tilebars. Tilebars are an N x M 
histogram, where N rows correspond to N query terms (or clauses), and M 
columns represent buckets of score contributions distributed over the 
sections of the document. Each cell is then colored according to the 
portion of score that it contains.

The coloring schema may be non-linear, and the document division into 
chunks may not be linear either.

You can then collapse Tilebars if you wish in one or both dimensions, e.g.:

* N x 1 represents relative score contributions from each query term
* 1 x M represents the distribution of score contributions along the 
length of document
* 1 x 1 represents the relative score of all clauses for the whole 
document, relative to other documents (the difference is in coloring)
