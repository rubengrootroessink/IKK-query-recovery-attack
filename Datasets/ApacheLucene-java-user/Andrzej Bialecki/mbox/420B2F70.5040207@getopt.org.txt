However, it matters how you have read in the files in your Java 
application. Did you use InputStreamReader with the default platform 
encoding (probably 8859-1), or did you specify UTF-8 explicitly?

By default Luke uses the standard platform-specific font "dialog". On 
Windows this font doesn't support Unicode glyphs, so you will see just

select the display font.
