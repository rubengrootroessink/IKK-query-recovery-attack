SUBJECT: [ANN] Luke 0.9.9.1 release
DATE: 20 Nov 2009

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce a new release of Luke - the Lucene Index Toolbox.

Please note that Luke development has moved to Google Code, and the 
downloads are available from the following page:

	http://code.google.com/p/luke/

In addition, all other parts of the Google Code infrastructure are now 
available, such as the Issue Tracker, SVN, Wiki, etc. - please don't 
hesitate to use them :)

Changes in v. 0.9.9.1:

This release upgrades to Lucene 2.9.1 jars and Hadoop 0.20.1 jars.

New features and improvements
-----------------------------
     * Add per-field value decoders, for displaying field values that 
should be interpreted as numeric or date or binary values.
     * Improve the Analysis plugin to switch between the mixed and the 
only-new API.
     * Improve visibility and layout of Thinlet tables.
     * Add display of commit user data Map
     * Add ability to edit per-commit user data Map

Bug fixes
---------
     * Term frequency vectors were not displayed for selected field.


Enjoy!
