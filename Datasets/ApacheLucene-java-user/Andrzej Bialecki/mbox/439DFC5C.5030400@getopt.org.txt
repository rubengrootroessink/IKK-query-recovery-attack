In Nutch the default is 128. And yes, changing this requires re-creating 
the index (actually, it's enough to optimize it, so that the .tii file 
is re-written).

Thank you for the detailed analysis. Currently we pursue a totally 
different approach: limiting the size of the index by clever selection 
of the most promising postings, and resorting the posting lists so that 
they are ordered according to a "pagerank"-like value, so that we could 
skip postings coming from less significant docs. Please see the 
nutch-dev discussion for more details.

Oh, BTW:  I just found the DisjunctionMaxQuery class, recently added it 
seems. Do you think this query structure could benefit from using it 
instead of the BooleanQuery?
