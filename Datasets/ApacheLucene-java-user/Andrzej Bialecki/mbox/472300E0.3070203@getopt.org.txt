These questions already have an answer in Nutch (see the 
org.apache.nutch.indexer.IndexSorter, and 
org.apache.nutch.searcher.LuceneQueryOptimizer$LimitedCollector).

One method that I'm familiar with is the following: you can split the 
result set into several large-ish bins, and apply arbitrary sorting 
methods within each bin. Studies show that if you pick the right bin 
size, users will rarely look into the second and the following bins, so 
the task is reduced to the sorting of the first bin, e.g. 100 top 
scoring docs.
