Perhaps you could do this using FilterIndexReader implementation, i.e. 
wrap your original index within this filter and then invoke 
IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]). If you override 
FilterIndexReader.document(int, FieldSelector), which retrieves the 
stored fields of a document, then you can change the values of stored 
fields only, just before they are added to the new index. Note that this 
works ONLY for non-indexed fields that are stored (i.e. Store.YES, 
Index.NO) - if a field is both stored and indexed then you need to 
modify the postings too, which requires overriding other methods.
