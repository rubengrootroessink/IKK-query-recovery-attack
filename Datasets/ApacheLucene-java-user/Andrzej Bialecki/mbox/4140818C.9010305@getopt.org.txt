...or prepare in advance a fast lookup index - split all existing terms 
to bi- or trigrams, create a separate lookup index, and then simply for 
each term ask a phrase query (phrase = all n-grams from an input term), 
with a slop > 0, to get similar existing terms. This should be fast, and 
you could provide a "did you mean" function too...
