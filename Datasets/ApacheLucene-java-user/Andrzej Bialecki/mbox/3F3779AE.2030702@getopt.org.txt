SUBJECT: Luke v 0.2 - Lucene Index Browser
DATE: 11 Aug 2003

Dear Lucene Users,

I'm glad to announce that a new version of Luke is available for 
download, and as a Java WebStart application.

Luke is a diagnostic tool for Lucene (http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene) 
indexes. It enables you to browse documents in existing indexes, perform 
queries, navigate through terms, optimize indexes and more.

Please go to http://www.getopt.org/luke and give it a try. You can 
either use the Java WebStart version, or just download the JAR file with 
binaries. Full source code is available, under Apache license.

Changes in v0.2:

* Add Java WebStart version.
* Add Read-Only mode.
* Fix spinbox bug (really a bug in the Thinlet toolkit - fixed there).
* Allow to browse hidden directories.
* Add a combobox to choose the default field for searching.
* Other minor code cleanups.

Thanks to all who provided their comments and suggestions!

Andrzej Bialecki
