Let me pipe in on behalf of the Nutch project... The work that Doug and 
Mike are doing is on a branch, so you will want to check out the following:

	svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/nutch/branches/mapred

The distributed work units are performed by arbitrary implementations of 
appropriate interfaces, so it should be possible to provide 
implementations that handle just Lucene indices.

The MapReduce code is still under heavy development, but it will provide 
the core of Nutch for the next version. Any pair of hands (and eyes) 
interested in this work will definitely help!
