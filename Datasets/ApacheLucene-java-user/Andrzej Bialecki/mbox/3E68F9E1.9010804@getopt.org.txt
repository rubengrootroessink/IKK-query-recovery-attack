I fully agree that nothing can beat a handcrafted UML diagram, made by 
someone who knows which details are irrelevant for the key concepts. 
That's what the models are for - to present a complex reality in an 
abstract, simplified way, by disregarding things that are not important 
for the purpose of explaining the concept...

However, automated tools still can go a long way, especially if you 
don't have time or expertise to create diagrams on your own, with 
unknown code base...

In my experience, for creating class diagrams tools like TogetherJ do 
acceptable job when used to automatically reverse-engineer existing 
source code. But in the case of sequence diagrams they are just 
pathetic... You'll have a chance to see two of them in the package I 
sent to Otis. :-)
