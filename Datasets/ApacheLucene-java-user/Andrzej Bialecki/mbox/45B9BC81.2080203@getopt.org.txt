I'm working on a regular basis with indexes containing several million 
documents. Somewhere around 10 mln documents, depending on the hardware 
and the type of queries, you will need to consider splitting the index 
into parts distributed over several machines - but below that size you 
should be able to get sub-second responses to typical queries.
