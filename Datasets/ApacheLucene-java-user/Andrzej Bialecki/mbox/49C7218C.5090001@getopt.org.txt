Try the following:

* open your index, and mark all documents as deleted except 1/Nth that 
should fill the first shard. Close the index, BUT DO NOT OPTIMIZE IT!

* create IndexWriter, and use addIndexes to add the original index. Only 
non-deleted docs will be copied.

* open the original index and use undeleteAll() to revert the deletions.

* mark the next 1/Nth documents as deleted
...
* repeat the cycle as many times as needed

A more elegant version of this algorithm can be implemented using 
FilterIndexReader.
