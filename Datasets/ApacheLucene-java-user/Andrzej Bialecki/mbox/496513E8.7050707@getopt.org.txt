Luke currently uses the same method as you used, i.e. creates a TermEnum 
and traverses all terms. This is fast enough and doesn't require access 
to implementation details.

There is a faster way to do it, but it's not exposed through API. 
SegmentReader (a concrete impl. of IndexReader) opens a TermInfosReader, 
which has a field SegmentTermEnum:indexEnum, which in turn has a field 
"size", and this is the number of terms. Accessing this information this 
way would be messy - it's better to propose that this information should 
be added to API.
