Ah, indeed - I was working with 2.3.0 release ... then there should be 
no visible performance difference if using the trunk version of 
IndexSearcher.

The only difference now between the IndexSearcher method and 
ConjunctionScorer would be when the supplied filter would match many 
documents. IndexSearcher always runs skipTo on the filter first, so 
potentially it would stop at many docIds that aren't matching in the 
scorer - whereas the ConjunctionScorer tries to order sub-scorers so 
that "sparse" scorers are checked first.
