Yes, I use CJKAnalyzer all around. When searching I translate 
character-entities in order to find anything. When displaying search 
results, I don't see anything that looks as being part of an eastern 
character set. instead I see accented latin - and mathematical symbols.

When I don't pass entities by the way things get really nasty:
query passed: >Θ??µ░╕<
 char(Θ, LATIN_1_SUPPLEMENT)  char(?, LATIN_1_SUPPLEMENT) token found : 
 >Θ< length: 1
 char(?, LATIN_1_SUPPLEMENT)  char(µ, LATIN_1_SUPPLEMENT)  char(░, 
LATIN_1_SUPPLEMENT) token found : >µ< length: 1
 char(╕, LATIN_1_SUPPLEMENT) searching contents:"Θ µ"

This was a query for two japanese characters.
