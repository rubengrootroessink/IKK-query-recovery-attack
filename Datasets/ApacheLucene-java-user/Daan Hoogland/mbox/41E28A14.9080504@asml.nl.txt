SUBJECT: Re: IndexWriter failure leaves lock in place
DATE: 10 Jan 2005

Joseph (and others),

I'm not an expert on lucene either. Your mail just rang a bell and I 
thought I'd contribute the ring for any expert to use. I have found 
stale locks on a system running on solaris/iplanet with the FSDirectory. 
The same code does not pose a problem on a windows/apache/tomcat 
environment. I cannot reproduce the problem yet, and I'm not sure if it 
is new to version 1.4 (the system has been running with lucene 1.2 before).
