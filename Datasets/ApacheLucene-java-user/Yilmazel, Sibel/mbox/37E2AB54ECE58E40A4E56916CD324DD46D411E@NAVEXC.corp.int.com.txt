We currently use AltaVista. It uses its own dictionary to expand
queries. 

For Lucene, we would like to experiment with different dictionaries to
see if the precision improves. WordNet is one alternative, that we know
of, with Lucene and I was wondering if there are any other dictionaries
for Lucene... Any comments would be appreciated.

Maybe you could specify your question: what exactly are you trying to do

with WordNet and why are you looking for alternatives?
