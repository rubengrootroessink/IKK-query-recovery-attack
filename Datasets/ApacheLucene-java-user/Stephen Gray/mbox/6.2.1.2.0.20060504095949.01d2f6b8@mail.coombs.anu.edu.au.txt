SUBJECT: Re: Updating index if there is a database changes
DATE: 4 May 2006

Hi Kirin,

Once you've updated an index using IndexWriter or IndexReader you just need 
to close and re-open your IndexSearcher so that searching includes the 
changes. There is a great library callled LuceIndexAccessor at the link 
below that manages this for you. It creates an IndexReader/Writer/Searcher 
and hands out references to classes that need to use them. When you want to 
read/write you just get a reference to the appropriate object from the 
index accessor, then release it when you've finished. If you make changes 
using an IndexWriter then release the reference, it waits until all 
IndexSearcher refs have been released, then recreates the searcher 
automatically.

The link is:

You might also like to look at DelayCloseIndexSearcher at

Steve
