Hi,

My understanding is that once you have added documents to your index you
need to close and reopen your IndexReader and Searcher, otherwise the
documents added will not be available to these.

You might want to try LuceneIndexAccessor
(http://www.blizzy.de/lucene/lucene-indexaccess-0.1.0.zip) which is very
good - this caches a single copy of IndexWriter, IndexReader and
Searcher, and hands out references to your application. Once the index
is changed with IndexWriter, and the reference to IndexWriter is
released, it automatically closes and re-opens the IndexReader and
Searcher for you.

Regards,
Steve
