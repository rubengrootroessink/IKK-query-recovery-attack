SUBJECT: How to pull document scoring values
DATE: 28 Sep 2004

Hi,

I'm trying to learn the Scoring mechanism of Lucene. I want to fetch
each parameter value individually as they are collectively dumped out by
Explanation. I've managed to pull out TF and IDF values using
DefaultSimilarity and FilterIndexReader, but not sure from where to get
the fieldNorm and queryNorm from. 
Also is there any reference about how normalisation has been
implemented? 

Any idea?

Thanks,
Zia
