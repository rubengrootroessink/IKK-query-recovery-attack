In a past life, Lucene (1.2, I believe) could be tricked into this
behavior if an ill-behaved app added fields with embedded \0's in their
value property.  If I recall, the \0 could end up being written in the
term data and corrupting the index for future readers.  It was awhile
ago - apologies if this turns out to be a red herring.
