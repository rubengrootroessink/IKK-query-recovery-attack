SUBJECT: Re: memory consumption on large indices
DATE: 14 Mar 2007

I'm searching a 20GB index and my searching JVM is allocated 1Gig. 
However, my indexing app only had 384mb availible to it, which means you 
can get away with far less.  I believe certain index tables will need to 
be swapped in and out of memory though so it may not search as quickly.

With a 1.8gig index you could try the jvm default (64megs) and see how 
it works.
