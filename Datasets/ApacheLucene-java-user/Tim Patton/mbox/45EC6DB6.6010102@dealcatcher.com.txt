SUBJECT: Missing .tii File
DATE: 5 Mar 2007

I'm not sure how, but in moving an index over from 2.0 to 2.1 and 
changing my own code one of the .tii files got deleted.  I still have 
the .tis file though, can I rebuild the missing file so I can open my 
index?  Luke won't open it now and I just want to make sure everything 
is ok before opening a writer and possibly doing some permanent damage.
