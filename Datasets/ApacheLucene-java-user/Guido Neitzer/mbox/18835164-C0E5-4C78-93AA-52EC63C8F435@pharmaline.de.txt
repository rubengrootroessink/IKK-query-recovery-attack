Hi.

Is it correct that in Release 1.9.1 a WRITE_LOCK_TIMEOUT is hardcoded  
and there is no way to set it from outside?

I've seen a check-in in the CVS from a few days ago which added  
getters/setters for this, but ... there is no release containing  
this, right?

So, my question is: Is it save to use a nightly build for production  
use?

Thanks,
cug
