Thank you for the help.  It seems that just changing "memory usage" setting to "programs" from
default of "system cache" fixed the issue.  Now it takes only about 4 GB of system cache instead
of 26 GB, and search performance is back to normal (fast).

Found a great page about the problem using Domino:
http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21270452

They appear to have compiled all the little bits of info that I have
seen elsewhere, and describe the problem being fixed just as you did.
