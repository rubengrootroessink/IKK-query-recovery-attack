SUBJECT: caching fields for query performance
DATE: 25 Jul 2008

If I have a frequently queried field, which has a single value per document (such as language),
how can I pre-cache all field values, such that the underlying query processing always uses
memory cache (never disk i/o) for that particular field?  I don't know if it is possible without
some custom query processing, which may be difficult in my case.

We have incoming ad-hoc Boolean queries, for instance:

+topic:m&a +topic:earn  +company:MSFT +language:(ENG FRA RUS)


We have translated contents per-language, so frequently, the language clause may contain up
to 30 language field values.  The performance differences between:

+topic:m&a +topic:earn  +company:MSFT +language:(ENG FRA RUS)

And

+topic:m&a +topic:earn  +company:MSFT

Is very significant (mostly since language is OR clause).

So is there some way to optimize query processing on a per-field basis, such that language
clauses are processed more efficiently?

Thanks
Bob
