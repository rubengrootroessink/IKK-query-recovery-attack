SUBJECT: windows file system cache
DATE: 16 Aug 2008

Anyone else run on Windows?  We have index around 26 GB in size.  Seems file system cache ends
up taking up nearly all available RAM (26 GB out of 32 GB on 64-bit box).  Lucene process
is around 5 GB, so very little left over for queries, etc, and box starts swapping during
searches.  I think changing file system cache size setting is needed.  Anyone else have same
issue?
