SUBJECT: Can't get a DateFilter to work
DATE: 14 Dec 2001

Hi,

I really tried everything to get a DateFilter to work but I failed. :-(

What I did was:

Indexing:

doc.add( Field.Keyword("last-modifed",
DateField.timeToString( timeInMillies ) );

e.g.
millies: 1008269714990
field value: 0cv6xr772

If i submit a "normal" query, looking for 0cv6xr772 I find the entry, i.e.
the entry should be indexed correctly.
If I search for a text in the body of the element I find about 30 entries
including the one mentioned above with last-midified=0cv6xr772.

If I repeat the same query with

DateFilter filter=new DateFilter("last-modified", 0, 2008269714990);
Hits hits = searcher.search(query, filter);

I do not get any results. What am I doing wrong?
Any help appreciated.

JAn
