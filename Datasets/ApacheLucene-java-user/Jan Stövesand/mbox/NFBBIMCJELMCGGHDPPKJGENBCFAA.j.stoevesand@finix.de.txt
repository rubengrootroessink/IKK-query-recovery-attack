SUBJECT: Strange Results with German Analyzer
DATE: 20 Dec 2001

Hi,

I used a German Analyzer for Indexing and Searching. afaik, the search is
case insensitive. At least I get the same searchresults for

kapitalanlagen
Kapitalanlagen

But, for some words the Analyzer behaves somewhat funny:

Holland -> 22 results
hollAnd -> 22 results
hollanD -> 22 results
HOLLAND -> 22 results

holland -> 1 result (!) which is NOT in the 22 results mentioned above.

I have no idea and my knowledge about Searching, stemming, indexing etc is,
well, small.

Jan
