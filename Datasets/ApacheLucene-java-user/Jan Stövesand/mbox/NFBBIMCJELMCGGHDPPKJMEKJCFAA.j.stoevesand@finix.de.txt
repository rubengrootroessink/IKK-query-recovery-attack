SUBJECT: AW: AW: Can't get a DateFilter to work: SOLVED
DATE: 17 Dec 2001

The problem is solved.
There was a small difference in the code used for searching with/without a
Datefilter. The error was in the code building the actual result set and NOT
in the code doing the search itself. That's why I didn't see it.
Now everything works find.

Thanks to all who helped.

Jan
