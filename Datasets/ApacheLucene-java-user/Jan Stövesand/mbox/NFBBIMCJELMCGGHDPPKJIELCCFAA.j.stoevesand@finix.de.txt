SUBJECT: Using a DateFilter without a query
DATE: 17 Dec 2001

Hi,

is it possible to use a DateFilter without a query. I would like to get all
Documents from within a certain period of time WITHOUT specifying any query
except the range of dates.

OR

Is there something like query that will always return all documents from an
index?

Jan
