Hi,
I investigated this issue further and found out that StandardTokenizer is
actually desirable for my needs - I need to index emails, acronyms, etc. So
I'll use package org.apache.lucene.analysis.StopFilter as a starting point
to try and write a custom TokenFilter to discard numbers, then just extend
BrazilianAnalyzer and use this custom TokenFilter as the final filter in the
chain. I believe the end result will be simpler and cleaner this way.
Best regards,
