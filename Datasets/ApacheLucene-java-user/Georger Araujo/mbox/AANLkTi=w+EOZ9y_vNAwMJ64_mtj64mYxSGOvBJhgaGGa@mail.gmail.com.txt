SUBJECT: Extending org.apache.lucene.analysis.br.BrazilianAnalyzer to discard numeric tokens
DATE: 6 Feb 2011

Hi,
I started using Lucene a few weeks ago, and I must say I'm amazed. Hats off
to the developers and the community!
I'd like to write a custom analyzer whose only difference to
org.apache.lucene.analysis.br.BrazilianAnalyzer is that I want it to discard
numeric tokens from the input. I've looked at the code and also at the
discussion in [1], but I'm lost about what is the simplest/cleanest way to
go.
What do you think?
