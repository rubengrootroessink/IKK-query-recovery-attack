Thanks Yonik.

So, if rebuilding the second index is not an option
due to large no of documents, then ParallelReader will
not work :-(

And I believe there is no other way than
parallelReader to search across multiple indexes that
contain related data. Is there any other alternative?
I think, MultiSearcher or MultiReader will only work
with multiple, unrelated indexes.

Regards,
Rajesh
