Hi Mathieu,

I can definitely store the foreign key inside the
dynamic index. However if I understand correctly, for
ParallelReader to work properly, doc ids for all
documents in both primary and secondary (dynamic)
index should be in same order.

How can we achieve it if there are frequest changes to
the dynamic index? The doc ids will keep on changing
as we delete and re-insert records in dynamic index.
As Karl pointed out, there is a hack available in JIRA
that can take care of this doc id update issue, but it
is not an official patch and not tested for
performance.

How are people updating their indexes when used in
conjuction with ParallelReader. I think ParallelReader
will work well for data partitioned between 2 indexes
(static and dynamic). However, I am not finding any
better approach to just update the dynamic index.

Regards,
Rajesh
