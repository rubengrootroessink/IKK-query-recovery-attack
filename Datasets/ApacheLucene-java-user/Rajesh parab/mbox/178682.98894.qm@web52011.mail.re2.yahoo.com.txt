Thanks Ian.

I agree with you on lowercasing of characters. My main concern is specific to stemming done
by analyzers.

For example, StandardAnalyzer will stem words like playing, played, plays, etc. to a common
tokan "play" which will be stored in the index. Now, during searches, we would need same stemming
to be performed on search tokens so that we can use equals searches and get correct results
back. In this example, the search term "playing" or "plays" may not return the document as
it is indexed with token "play".

What I am not really getting it how I can use the same analyzer during searches is I am constructing
queries manually.

Regards,
Rajesh
