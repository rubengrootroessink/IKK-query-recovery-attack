Thanks Mark.

Can you please tell me more about the Lucene add-on you are talking about? Are you talking
about Compass?

Regards,
Rajesh

Lucene is probably not the solution if you are looking for a relational 
model. You should be using a database for that. If you want to combine 
Lucene with a relational model, check out Hibernate and the new EJB 
annotations that it supports...there is a cool little Lucene add-on that 
lets you declare fields to be indexed (and how) with annotations.
