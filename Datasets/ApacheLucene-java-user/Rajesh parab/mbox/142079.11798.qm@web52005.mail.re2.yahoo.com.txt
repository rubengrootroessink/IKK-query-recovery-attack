SUBJECT: Using analyzer while constructing Lucene queries
DATE: 13 Jan 2009

Hi,

For proper results during searches, the recommendation is to use same analyzer for indexing
and querying. We can achieve this by passing the same analyzer, which was used for indexing,
to QueryParser to construct Lucene query and use this query while searching the index.

The question is - How can we use the analyzer that was used for indexing, if we want to construct
Lucene queries manually using Query classes (like BooleanQuery, TermQuery, PhraseQuery, etc)
instead of using QueryParser?

Is there any way to achieve it?

Regards,
Rajesh
