Thanks Karl.

How do we specify the primary key or doc id so that
newly added document will use the same doc id. Do you
have any sample code that makes use of this patch?

Secondly, there was a comment saying it is a proof of
concept and not a real project. Is anyone using this
patch on their production environments? Will this fix
get rolled into latest Lucene release?

Regards,
Rajesh
