SUBJECT: Question on storing object hierarchy in Lucene Index
DATE: 31 Oct 2006

Hi,

Lets consider the following object structure.

           X
            |
            --------- Y
                         |
                         --------- Z

The objects Y and Z does not have an existance on their own. They are owned by object X.

How do we effectively search such object structure using Lucene? The way I see is to denormalize
this object structure and save the values of X, Y and Z in same field separated by some separator.
During searh, again combine the values of X, Y and Z while constructing the query.

Are there any best practices around storing the such data structure inside Lucene Index?

Regards,
Rajesh
