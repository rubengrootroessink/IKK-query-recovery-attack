SUBJECT: Re: Modelling relational data in Lucene Index?
DATE: 3 Nov 2006

Thanks for feedback Chris.
 
I agree with you. The data set should be flattened out to store inside Lucene index. The Folder-File
was just an example. As you know, in relational database, we can have more complex relationships.
I understand that this model may not work for deeper relationships.
 
What I am mainly interested in is just one level deep relationship. But, I would like to search
on the additional attributes of the related object. For example, in the relationship for Folder-File,
I would like to use additional file attributes as search criteria along with file name while
searching for folders.
 
The way I see is having single filed for the related object and all its additional attributes
and use some separator while capturing this data inside Lucene Field object. For example -
        
            new Field("file", "abc.txt<sep>image");
 
But, I am not quite sure if this model will work.
 
BTW. I did not understand what you meant by the detached approach. Can you please elaborate?
 
Regards,
Rajesh

For this specific question, you can create index on files, search
files that of type image, and from matched files, find the unique
directories(can be done in lucene or you can do it via java).

Of course this does not scale to deeper relationships. Usually you do
need to flattern the database objects in order to use lucene. It's
just trading space for speed.

I would prefer a detached approach instead of Hibernate or EJB's
approach, which is kind of too tightly coupled with any system. How to
rebuild if the index is corrupted, or you have a new Analyzer, or
schema evolves? How to make it multi-thread safe?
