SUBJECT: Lucene 2.3.0 and NFS
DATE: 4 Apr 2008

Hi,

We are currently using Lucene 2.0 for full-text
searches within our enterprise application, which can
be deployed in clustered environment. We generate
Lucene index for data stored inside relational
database.

As Lucene 2.0 did not have solid NFS support and as we
wanted Lucene based searches to work properly in
Clustered environment, we had decided on following
approach:
1. The index generation happens on a machine (could be
one of the cluster nodes or a separate machine) and
once the Lucene index is generated, we copy all the
index files to the database.
2. The index search request on each cluster node
retrieves the index files from database (during first
search or after index update), copies to the file
system and use it for searches.
3. Thus, each cluster node has its own copy of the
index and it keeps on picking up latest version if it
is available inside database.

This has worked fine for us till now, though we will
not be able continue with this model in future as we
want to support Lucene based searches across our
application and also want to index large components
inside our application like Wiki, forums, etc. As the
index will grow, storing and retrieving index files
from database will not be an efficient operation.

My questions are:
- Will we be able to use NFS if we move to Lucene
2.3.0?
- Will there be any significant performance impact on
index generation and searches if we move to NFS?
- Is Lucene + NFS combination supported for all
operating systems? (We support Windows, Solaris, AIX,
HP-UX, Red Hat Linux)
- Is there any other alternative available other than
NFS?

I will really appreciate your comments/thoughts on
this topic.

Regards,
Rajesh
