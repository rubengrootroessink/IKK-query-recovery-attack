SUBJECT: RE: How to extract Document object after the search?
DATE: 3 Feb 2009


Hi,

I have not seen much time difference between when I load the single field &
all the fields of a document.

After search, lucene cache the documents into the memory. Is there any way
to configure the no. of documents to be cached into the memory?

what could be the benefit in using FieldSelectorResult.LOAD &
FieldSelectorResult.LAZY_LOAD?

Regards,
Sourabh
