SUBJECT: How to extract Document object after the search?
DATE: 2 Feb 2009


As per Lucene documentation - 
"For good search performance, implementations of this method should not call
Searcher.doc(int) or IndexReader.document(int) on every document number
encountered. Doing so can slow searches by an order of magnitude or more."

My question is - what's the other way to get the Document object to avoid
performance bottleneck?
