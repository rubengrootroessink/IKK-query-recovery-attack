DATE: 2 Oct 2002

there have been numerous problems/bad features with the hot-spot mode 
on sun's linux vm, the reason for this is that hot-spotting is 
optimizing your code by doing very weird stuff with your code :-)

anyway i'm glad -classic works well for you. the bad performance is a 
known problem with the linux-kernel java threading system. When it 
comes to threads windows jvms outperforms linux jvms because of kernel 
internal things i don't even try to understand...

i have used the 1.3.1 linux jvm from ibm with great stability, how does 
the ibm jvm perform against the sun jvm when it comes to thread 
performance?

there is also a 1.3 jvm from a group called "blackdown" that is free 
and optimized for linux. there was some talking in the news about it 
being very good at threading... you could try it..  ( 
http://www.blackdown.org/ )
