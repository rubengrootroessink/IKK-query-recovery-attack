SUBJECT: Problems with exact matces on non-tokenized fields...
DATE: 26 Sep 2002

Hi, i have a problem with getting a exact match on a non-tokenized 
field.

I have a Lucene Document with a field named "element" which is stored 
and indexed but not tokenized. The value of the field is "POST" 
(uppercase). But the only way i can match the field is by entering 
"element:POST?" or "element:POST*" in the QueryParser class.

Have anyone here run into this problem?

I am using the 1.2 release version of Lucene.

Mvh Karl Øie
