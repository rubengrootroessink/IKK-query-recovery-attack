Thanks Doug.  I see my mistake now.

I should have used IndexSearcher(Directory directory), where directory is an instance of URLDirectory.
 Instead I used IndexSearcher(String path).  

That seems obvious, and the approach is vastly superior.  I have no idea why I didn't do it
that way before.  

Thanks,
David

 I would prefer to extend classes or interfaces instead of modifying them.  I have no requirement
to update the search index from the applet.

Why do you need to modify IndexReader, rather than just pass it a 
different Directory implementation?
