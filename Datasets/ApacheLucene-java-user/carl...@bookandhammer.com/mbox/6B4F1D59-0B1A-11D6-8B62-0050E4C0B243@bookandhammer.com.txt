SUBJECT: Re: Parsing of queries.; NEAR queries
DATE: 17 Jan 2002

I guess what I would really like is

"Microsoft Word" NEAR3 "Microsoft Excel"

Where I could combine the phrases together with a NEAR operator.

Usually, at least in my mind I am searching for words or phrases near 
other words or phrases, not a set of words
close to each other.

So I like the idea of having
a NEAR8 b
It could be
a NEAR(8) b, but that seems too programmer like and I don't think in 
general people get the concept of slop, like the concept of near. So 
something like "a b c"NEAR(5) is really cryptic.


Oracle intermedia uses NEAR(a,b,#,directional).
Even more cryptic.

Any other thoughts?
