SUBJECT: Re: Search all words of a query
DATE: 12 Feb 2002

Hi,

Right now you must either use the form foo AND bar or +foo +bar
to accomplish what you want to do before you send the query to the 
QueryParser.

Another alternative is to parse the query yourself and then create the 
queries using the BooleanQuery with the required flag set. This is 
somewhat difficult if you want to keep all the current QueryParser 
functionality.
One last option is to copy the current QueryParser and modify it to meet 
your needs.

Hope this helps.
