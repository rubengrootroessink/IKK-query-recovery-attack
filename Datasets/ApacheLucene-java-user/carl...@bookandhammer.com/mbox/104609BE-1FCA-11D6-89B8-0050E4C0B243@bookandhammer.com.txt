SUBJECT: Re: Searching multiple fields in one Index of Documents
DATE: 12 Feb 2002

Hi Charles,
Currently Lucene does not give you a query which will search all fields.
The easiest way to do this is to great a queryString will all the fields 
based on the enteredSearchString.

So if someone enters "foobar" then convert this into
category:foobar OR body:foobar
where the format is [fieldname]:[query string]
Of course you can use AND or OR depending on what you want to accomplish.

Hope that helps.
