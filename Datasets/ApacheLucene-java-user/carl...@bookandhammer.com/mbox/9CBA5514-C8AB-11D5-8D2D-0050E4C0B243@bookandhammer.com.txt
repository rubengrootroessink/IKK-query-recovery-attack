SUBJECT: example to SearchFiles typo
DATE: 24 Oct 2001

There is a bug in the demonstration documentation.

It says to search use the following

 > java -cp lucene.jar:demo/classes 
org.apache.lucene.IndexFilesSearchFiles

It should read

java -cp lucene.jar:demo/classes org.apache.lucene.SearchFiles

I hope this helps.
