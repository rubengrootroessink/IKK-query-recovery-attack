I had the same problem and have started to write down all my own notes 
and experiences. I was hoping this could be put into a manual/tutorial 
in the future.
I was going to wait until it was a bit more robust, but let's see if we 
can create some coordination.

Is anyone else out there creating a tutorial. I would be willing to 
compile and coordinate all the different parts for the people who want 
to contribute.

If there is already an effort going on, lets make sure everyone knows 
about it, if not please email me if you are willing to work on a part of 
the manual.

Thanks
