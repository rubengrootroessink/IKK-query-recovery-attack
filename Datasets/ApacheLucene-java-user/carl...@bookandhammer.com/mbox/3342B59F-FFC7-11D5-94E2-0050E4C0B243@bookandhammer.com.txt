SUBJECT: case sensitive boolean keywords
DATE: 2 Jan 2002

Hi,

Is there any reason why the boolean terms (AND, OR and NOT) are case 
sensitive?
For example
Query 1: "test and process"
	removes "and" as a stop word and does an or search (198 results in 
my test case)

Query 2: "test AND process"
	performs a boolean search with AND (5 results in my test case).

If I change the queryParser to include the lower case "and", "or" and 
"not" will that cause other problems?

Thanks

--Peter
