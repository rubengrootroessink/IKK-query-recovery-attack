Hi,

I don't fully understand what you are looking to do, but here is one 
idea.
One technique that the Lucene demo uses is to store the path in the 
index (it can be indexed or not).
So, when you create the document, have one of the fields in the document 
be the path. Fields in a Lucene document don't have to be part of a real 
file, they are just fields that you add to be stored, indexed or 
tokenized into the index.


I hope this helps.
