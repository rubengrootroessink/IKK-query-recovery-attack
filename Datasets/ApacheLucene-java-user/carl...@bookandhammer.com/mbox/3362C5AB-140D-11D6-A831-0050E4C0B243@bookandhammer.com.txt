SUBJECT: Lucene website updated
DATE: 28 Jan 2002

The Lucene website has been updated.

It now includes links to a new section called Getting Started by Andrew 
C. Oliver. Check it out, it's really great.

There is now a contributors section. This contains links to others 
contributions that are not part of the Lucene distribution.
If people have more contributions, please submit them to the user 
mailing list with a useful header including the word CONTRIBUTION, so we 
can add it to the list.

This update also includes some new links to the JGuru Lucene FAQ, and 
the Lucene Bugs.
