SUBJECT: Proximity operators in lucene
DATE: 24 Oct 2001

Hi,
Does anyone know if there is a way to use a proximity operator (like 
near or within) in the lucene engine?
For example, if you want to know that microsoft is within 3 words of ibm 
you could use
microsoft n3 ibm

If not, how difficult is this to add the the indexing and searching 
system?

Any thanks would be appreciated.
