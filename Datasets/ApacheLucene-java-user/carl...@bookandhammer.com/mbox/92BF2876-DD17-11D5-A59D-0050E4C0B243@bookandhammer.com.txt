What happens to the document numbers when documents are deleted and the 
segment merged?
Is the document number of all the documents reset to be sequential based 
on some offset for each segment?

Is there any pattern that might be followed instead of recreating the 
entire array. I know this probably won't be a problem unless creating 
the entire array takes a long time, but
I think I might be in the case.

Thanks
