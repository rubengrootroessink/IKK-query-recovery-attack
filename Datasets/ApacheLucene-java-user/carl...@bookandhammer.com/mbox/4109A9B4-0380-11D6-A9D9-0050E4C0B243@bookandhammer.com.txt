SUBJECT: QueryParser Grammer working with Standard Analyzer Grammer
DATE: 7 Jan 2002

Hi,
I am setting using the standard analyzer to create terms for my 
documents. However, it seems that the Queryparser, will not allow these 
characters in the query string.
For example, I have the term at&t. When I enumerate through the list of 
terms in my index, that term is there.
When I type in at&t as my query string, I get a lexical error 
"Encountered after : "&t"

I reviewed the QueryParser grammer and found that it didn't accept the 
character &.

If I add a "&" to the QueryParser grammer will this work?
Also, I want to add a "." as a TERM_START_CHAR so I can find ".net"
I also want to add "/" to find "os/2".

I guess what I am asking: are there any special characters that I should 
look out for and not add into the grammer?

Thanks

--Peter
