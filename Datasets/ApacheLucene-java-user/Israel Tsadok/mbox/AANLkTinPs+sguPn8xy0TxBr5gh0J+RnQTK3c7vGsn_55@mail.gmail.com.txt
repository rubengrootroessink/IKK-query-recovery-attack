TopDocsCollector.topDocs() does return the results sorted, by score. It
basically returns a slice of a PriorityQueue.
You can take a look at the
source<http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/trunk/lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/TopDocsCollector.java>,
it's one of the easier parts of the code.
