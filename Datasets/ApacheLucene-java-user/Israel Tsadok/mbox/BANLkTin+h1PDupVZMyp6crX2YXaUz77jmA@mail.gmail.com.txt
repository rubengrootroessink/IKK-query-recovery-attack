SUBJECT: RemoteSearchable deprecated. What to replace it with?
DATE: 16 Jun 2011

I use a ParallelMultiSearcher to search across a bunch of RemoteSearchables,
pretty much as recommended in Lucene In Action, First Edition, with the
appropriate adjustments for Lucene 3.0. This seems to be completely
deprecated in 3.1.

What is the simplest way for me to continue having the ability to search
across multiple servers?
