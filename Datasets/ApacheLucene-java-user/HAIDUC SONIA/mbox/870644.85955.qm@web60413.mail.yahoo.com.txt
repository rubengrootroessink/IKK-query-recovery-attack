SUBJECT: Re: Scoring for all the documents in the index relative to a query
DATE: 19 Nov 2007

I am trying to order all the documents in the index according to their similarity to a given
query. I am interested in having a complete list of *all* the documents in the index with
their score. From what I understood by reading some documentation, Lucene internally assigns
scores to all the documents in the index according to their similarity to the query, but when
returning the hits, all the scores that are less than 0 are rounded to 0 and only the documents
with the score > 0 are returned as hits. But what I would like to get is the list before
this intermediate processing, so the list of all the documents with their raw score. I am
trying to compare Lucene with LSI and for the comparison I want to do, I need the entire list
of documents. Is there a way that I can get that with Lucene?
I hope I explained it clearly this time. If you need more details let me know.

Thank you,
Sonia

Could you explain a bit more what problem you're trying to solve?
The reason I ask is that your question doesn't make sense to me,
since I have no idea what you expect by the term "negative score".

My simplistic view has been that all the docs returned via Hits
or HitCollector have scores > 0, and all the rest have scores of 0,
and this view is supported by the explanation of
HitCollector.collect

" Called once for every non-zero scoring document, with the
document number and its score."

You might also get value from this page:
