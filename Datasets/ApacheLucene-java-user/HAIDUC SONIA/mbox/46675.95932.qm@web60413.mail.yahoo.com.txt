Thank you guys for your prompt answers. I'm a beginner with Lucene and I still had some unclarities
regarding its scoring function. Your answers really cleared things up for me. I guess a direct
comparison with LSI is not possible after all, only the comparison between LSI and the pure
VSM. 

Thanks again,
Sonia
