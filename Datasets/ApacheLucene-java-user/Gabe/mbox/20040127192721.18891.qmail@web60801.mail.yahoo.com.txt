SUBJECT: arrays of values in a field
DATE: 27 Jan 2004


If I have a group of documents and I want to filter on
a category, it is fairly straightforward. I just
create a Field that contains the category and filter
on it. 

However, what if I want the field "category" to have
multiple possible values? Is there a known best way to
filter on that? 

I imagine it is possible to "hack" it by, say,
creating a field with value:
|category1|category2|category3| etc. 

And then query "|category1|"

I was wondering if there was a better way.

Thanks,
Gabe
