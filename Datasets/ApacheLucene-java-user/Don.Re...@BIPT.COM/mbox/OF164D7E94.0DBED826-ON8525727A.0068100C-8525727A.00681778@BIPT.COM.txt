Thanks, that is as I suspected, but it was not clear.

Hi Don,

No, Lucene does not require all documents to have the same set
of fields. It is different from a database table - it is all very
flexible. So doc1 can have fields f1, f2, and doc2 can have fields
f2 f3, and doc3 can have only field f4, and doc4 can have no fields
at all (likely that doc4 would not be very useful for doc4, but
it is possible).

Regards,
Doron
