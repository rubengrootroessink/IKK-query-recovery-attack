SUBJECT: Retrieve all documents from Index, How to?
DATE: 27 Mar 2002

Hi all,

I indexed all records in DataBase.  One of the field in my index stores 
primary key from DataBase (each key is in different document). Is there a 
way that I can retrieve all documents from index ?  I need to validate if 
all records is indexed.

I try search for * but it return empty result.

I'm using StandardAnalyzer with Field.KeyWord for the PrimayKey field and 
everything else is Field.Text

Thanks for your help.
