I think I kown why lucene do not implement IndexReader.deleteDocument(Query)


when use IndexReader.deleteDocument(docId), reader set this docId in
IndexReader with BitVictor, not delete real document
in index. so it will influence search result in real time. And lucene
retrieve 100 Hit in first time,if you want retrieve another Hit, lucene
will  search again and return the Hit you want. That is why this problem
happen.

poor english :")

we can iterator hits.id(i) but can't pass reader.deleteDocument(hits.id(i));
why?
