I just had that problem as well. I got around it by writing my own
Analyzer and Tokenizer. I called the Tokenizer WhitespaceTokenizer and
it basically delimits tokens based on whitespace instead of the default
Character.isLetter(ch). There is a test: Character.isWhitespace(ch) that
I used instead of the isLetter. Then the Analyzer was just like the default
only it used my WhitespaceTokenzier.

This does however present some other problems like punctuation. You don't
really want each word at the end of a sentence being tokenzied with the
period attached, but that's just something to add to the Tokenzier code.

I'm still in testing phases, but when I get a complete solution I'll post
the
code. Hope that helps!

Jonathan

Hello all:

I'm trying to add searching for strings containing special characters,
for example, 'c++'. I'm currently using StandardAnalyzer and the
'+' character is being ignored. Is there any way of doing this?

Thanks,
Ravi.
