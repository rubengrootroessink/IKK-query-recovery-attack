I'm a new user of Lucene. Can I get in on those examples as well? Thanks,

Jonathan

Doug:

I can send you a couple of simple examples illustrating the new RangeQuery,
WildcardQuery as well as some custom Analyzers, Tokenizers etc. that I've
been fooling around with.  I'll try to document them in an "understandable"
fashion.
Give me a day or so...

Rob
