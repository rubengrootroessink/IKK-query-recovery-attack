Hi...

I have been looking for PDF and Word document parsers.  I have tried the contributions page
on the Lucene site as suggested by a Lucene User. The PJEtymon does not have a Windows version.
 The XPDF does not do the parsing very well. 

Can someone  suggest some better Word document or PDF parsers other than the ones I mentioned
here, .

Thanks

Anita Srinivas
