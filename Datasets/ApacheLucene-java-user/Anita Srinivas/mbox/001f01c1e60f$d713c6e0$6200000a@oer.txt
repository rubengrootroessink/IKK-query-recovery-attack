Hi,

I am a newbie..

I am testing by writing a jsp file where I convert Pdf files to txt which works fine(xpdf-windows
version). Next I want to index these files so as to include the new txt files in the index.

I typed the following at the cmd prompt
java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index indexpath ..

This works fine 

But when I call the command prompt frm jsp and execute this command. It does not include the
new txt files.

Can anybody tell me where I'm going wrong?

Regards,
Anita Srinivas
