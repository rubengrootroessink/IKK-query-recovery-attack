Thanks...easy, I know how to do it that way.

I've thought a bit more about why the protocol and host are not added into
the index as part of the path and I think I understand why.  I hope I
understand it correctly.

This is more of a java/JSP than a Lucene question.
Looking at the JSP code I see that it does
 String url = doc.get("url");
You then can do
server = request.getServerName()
to get the name of the server you're running on.
And then just use standard string manipulations to create the path.

You can also, when you create the index have go to /web/htdocs and index
from there. That way doc.get("url") will not include /web/htdocs in the
path.
