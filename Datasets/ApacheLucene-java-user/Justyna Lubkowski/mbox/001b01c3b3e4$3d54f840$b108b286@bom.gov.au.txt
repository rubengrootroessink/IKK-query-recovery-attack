SUBJECT: Advice needed on Indexing
DATE: 26 Nov 2003

Hi,

I'm new to Lucene and have just started to familiarise myself with the API.

I'm trying the web demo out, running IndexHTML.

I'm wondering if it is possible to include the protocol and host as part of
the path which is put into the index.  What is the simplest way to approach
this?

At the moment my results display the url as
"/web/htdocs/test/apple/grannysmith/"
I need to display something like
"http://www.mysite.com/test/apple/grannysmith"

Any advice on how to move in the right direction would be appreciated.

Thanks - Justyna.
