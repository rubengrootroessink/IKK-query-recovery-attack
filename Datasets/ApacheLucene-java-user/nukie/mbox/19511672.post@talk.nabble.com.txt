SUBJECT: Using Hits as document space for new search
DATE: 16 Sep 2008


Hi!
I'm writing application that should be using lucene for searching threw
~2000000 documents. 

Search criterias i'm collecting using BooleanQuery and ChainedFilter. 
Avarage search takes 150 ms, what is acceptable in my case.
But i should have hits count for ~20 more variants of search criterias (by
increasing search criterias count).  

This looks costly. I thougt about using current Hits as document space for
new, more detailed search. 
Is this possible or there is another performance tricks for getting hits
count ?
