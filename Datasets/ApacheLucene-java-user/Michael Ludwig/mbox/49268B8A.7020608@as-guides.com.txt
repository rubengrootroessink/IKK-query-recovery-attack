This notation falls short of achieving the goal to make lexicographical
order coincide with numerical order. First, negative numbers won't sort
in ascending order; -1 will come before -2. Second, negative exponents
aren't accounted for at all. Third, there are probably other problems.

Take a look at Steven Rowe's post in this thread for better
thought through ideas.
