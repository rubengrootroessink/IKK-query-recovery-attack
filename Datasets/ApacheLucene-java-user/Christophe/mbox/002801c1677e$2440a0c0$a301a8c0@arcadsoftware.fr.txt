Hello,

Thanks to Brian Goetz, the new version of the QueryParser in CVS should
now
correctly handle non-ASCII characters, such as diactritics, kana and
kanji.
Can the folks who have reported problems with this please try the new
version?  If you don't want to compile it for yourself, wait until
tomorrow
and try the nightly build at:
