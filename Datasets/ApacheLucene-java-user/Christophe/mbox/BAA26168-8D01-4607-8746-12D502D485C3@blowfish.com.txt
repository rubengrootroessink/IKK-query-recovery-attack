I must admit I was not sure I understood your question, either.  In  
order to search, Lucene needs an index.  That index is maintained by  
the IndexReader and IndexWriter classes.  Are you contemplating  
having your own index and index format?  In that case, it's not clear  
to me how much leverage you will be getting using Lucene at all.   
Could you explain in more detail what you are trying to do?
