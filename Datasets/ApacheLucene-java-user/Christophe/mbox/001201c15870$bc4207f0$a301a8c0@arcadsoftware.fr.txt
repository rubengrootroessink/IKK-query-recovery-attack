DATE: 19 Oct 2001

I'm very interrested to store lucene index in a database.
Currently, I use it in EJBs and I'd like to replace io access by jdbc
access.
It would be great that the jdbc solution don't required a specific database
(ie : Oracle or MSsql).
So, is there a way to have a generic JDBC solution ?
