DATE: 25 Jan 2008

Thanks everyone for their ideas and suggestions! Some had occurred to us
but were discarded because we feel our solution needs to be automated --
45 million pages are a lot of thrust on any human-driven effort.

I like Itamar's idea of doing "competing" OCR, and keeping the best
result. Unfortunately OCR software is far from cheap, and the cost of 2
different product licenses may be too high for the project.

I've also looked into the Tesseract/OCRopus, but while the ideas are good
it ain't there yet.
