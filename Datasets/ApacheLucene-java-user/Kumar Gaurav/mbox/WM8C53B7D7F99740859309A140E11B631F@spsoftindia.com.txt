SUBJECT: Does Lucene Java 2.3.2 supports parsing of Microsoft office 2007 documents...
DATE: 27 Jun 2008

Dear all,

 

Currently I am using Lucene jave 2.3.2 demo to parse Microsoft 2003 and 2007
docs and PDF files.

It is able to parse files with *.pdf, *.doc, *.xls etc. 

But it does not search in files of Microsoft 2007 docs.

It shows indexing *.docx and other Microsoft 2007 doc files.

 

Does Lucene java supports parsing of extensions *.docx, *.pptx, *.mpp i.e.
Microsoft Windows 2007 documents?

If it supports, what should be done in Lucene demo 2.3.2 to search queries
on file with above mentioned extensions?

 

Thanks

Kumar
