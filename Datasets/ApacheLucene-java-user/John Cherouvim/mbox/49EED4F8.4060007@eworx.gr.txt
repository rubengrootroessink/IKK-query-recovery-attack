SUBJECT: SpellChecker locks folder
DATE: 22 Apr 2009

Hello

After I call the SpellChecker.indexDictionary method the directory which 
contained the lucene index is locked. I cannot rename of delete the 
folder (windows).

In the source of SpellChecker lines 352-353 I see that after the 
indexing is done the index is reopened:
searcher.close();
searcher = new IndexSearcher(this.spellIndex);

Why does that second line exist at all?

thanks
Ioannis
