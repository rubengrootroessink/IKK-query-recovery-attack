SUBJECT: lucene and UTF-8

Hello

I'm having some problems indexing my UTF-8 html pages. I am running 
lucene on Linux and I cannot understand why does the index generated 
depends on the locale of my operating system.
If I do set | grep LANG I get: LANG=el_GR which is Greek. If I set this 
to en_US the index generated will be different. Why is this the case? My 
HTMLs are all UTF-8.

Also, is there a lucene index browser? I am currently using Luke, which 
is good but it doesn't show the Greek UTF-8 from within the index 
correctly. Is this a matter of a setting in Luke?

Regads,
J.
