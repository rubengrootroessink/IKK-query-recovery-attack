SUBJECT: SQL Distinct sintax in Lucen
DATE: 11 Jan 2005

Hi all.
 
I'm starting to use lucene and I wonder if it is possible to make a
query syntax to ask for one string which can be in two different fields
and filter duplicated results like with distinct in SQL syntax.
Something like:
 
distinct (+string OR OtherField:(+string))
 
Thanks a lot
