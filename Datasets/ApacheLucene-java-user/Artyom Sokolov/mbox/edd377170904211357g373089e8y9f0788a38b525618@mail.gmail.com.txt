SUBJECT: Appropriate analyzer

Hello.

Currently I'm trying to find something like an analyzer to solve the
problem.

Actually, what I need is next: search on a query string step-by-step,
trimming last char on each step. Small example:

In index we've: abc, abcdef, xyz
When search on abcdefgh the most relevant result should be abcdef, while
searching on abcde the best one is abc.

Thanks.

Sincerely,
Artyom Sokolov
