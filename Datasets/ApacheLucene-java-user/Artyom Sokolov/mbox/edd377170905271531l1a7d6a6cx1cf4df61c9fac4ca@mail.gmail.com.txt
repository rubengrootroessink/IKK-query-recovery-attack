SUBJECT: Re: Using JBoss Cache as directory for Apache Lucene
DATE: 27 May 2009

Well, I'm just playing with these and trying to create distributed
search engine which could store index in JBoss Cache (data grid) and
manage index with GridGain (compute grid) intelligently. Consider one
has really huge index(es) to search (tens or hundreds of gigabytes).
One idea is to distribute it on several data nodes and when search or
index operation requested transfer it to the corresponding data node
and perform the action (or may be do it in parallel manner). Nodes
created by GridGain are members of p2p network so there won't be SPOF.

It's all just an idea, nothing more, so if you have something to say
please let me know. It will be appreciated. I am just starting to
learn it so if I'm getting wrong in some place please tell me that :)

Thanks.
