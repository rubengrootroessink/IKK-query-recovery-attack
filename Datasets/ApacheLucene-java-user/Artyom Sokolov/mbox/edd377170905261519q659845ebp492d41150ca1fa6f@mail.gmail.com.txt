SUBJECT: Using JBoss Cache as directory for Apache Lucene
DATE: 26 May 2009

Hello.

Has anyone tried to store Lucene index in JBoss Cache? Are there any
good implementations of Lucene Directory for it? I found
http://viewvc.jboss.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/jbosscache/jbosscache-lucene/jbosscache/src/java/org/apache/lucene/store/jbosscache/
but I can't find any documentation or testimonials on it.

Basically what I would like to do is to store Lucene index in JBoss
Cache and manipulate it with application written with GridGain support
(GridGain supports JBoss Cache almost out of the box).

Please share your thoughts.

Thanks.
