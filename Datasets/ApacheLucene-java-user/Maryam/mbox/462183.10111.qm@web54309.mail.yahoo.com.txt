SUBJECT: How can I index Phrases in Lucene?
DATE: 22 Mar 2007

Hi, 

I know how to index terms in lucene, now I wanna see
how can I index phrases like "information retreival"
in lucene and calculate the number of times that
phrase has appeared in the document. Is there any way
to do it in Lucene?

Thanks
