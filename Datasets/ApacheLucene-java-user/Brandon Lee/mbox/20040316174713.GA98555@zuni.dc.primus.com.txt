SUBJECT: FAQ 3.41 (modify index while searching)
DATE: 16 Mar 2004

Hi.  In the Lucene FAQ, 3.41; it's stated:
  http://lucene.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/faq/faqmanager.cgi?file=chapter.search&toc=faq#q41

  41. Can I modify the index while performing ongoing searches ?

  Yes and no. At the time of writing this FAQ (June 2001), Lucene is not
  thread safe in this regard. Here is a quote from Doug Cutting, the
  creator of Lucene:

        The problems are only when you add documents or optimize an
        index, and then search with an IndexReader that was constructed
        before those changes to the index were made. 

  A possible work around is to perform the index updates in a parable
  and separate index and switch to the new index when its updating is
  ...

Is this still true?  Looking on the mailing list, it seems like people
are doing this w/ the caveat that any Readers created will not include
documents added by any subsequent Writers.

Also, this FAQ does not state the consequences of this - will Lucene
crash if using a Reader where a subsequent Writer adds documents?  How
about in the case of optimize?

Thanks for any help.
