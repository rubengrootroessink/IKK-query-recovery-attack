Hi,

I have a situation, where stored, un-indexed fields can contain  
potentially large amounts of data. Is it possibly to read the contents  
of a field incrementally? That is, do not load the complete contents  
from disk, but read X bytes at a time. Does the Reader returned by  
Field.readerValue() work that way? Or is this only possible with  
tokenized fields?

Thanks!

Regards,
Günter
