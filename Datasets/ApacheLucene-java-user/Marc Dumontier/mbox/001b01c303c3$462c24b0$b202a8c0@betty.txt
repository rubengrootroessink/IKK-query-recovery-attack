SUBJECT: any C++ implementations in the works
DATE: 16 Apr 2003

I was wondering if there's any open source projects attempting to create a C++ implementation
similar to Lucene.

I use lucene for a project which has modest text indexing needs for XML data, but i need an
implementation which can index BER encoded ASN.1, and I only have those parsers available
in C/C++ (130GB of binary data)
