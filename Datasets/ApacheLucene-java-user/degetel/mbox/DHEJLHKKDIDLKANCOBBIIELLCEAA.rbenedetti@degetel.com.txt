SUBJECT: lucen compared to other open source solutions
DATE: 4 Jun 2002

Hi,

I have a small question.
I am quiet new in this field of indexing & searching content.
I already used lucene in aproject & it was succesfull !

now I have to consider other solutions.
Do you know where I can find some arguments to choose lucene compared to the
swish-e solution ?
functionnal differences ?
scalability ?
performances ?

is there any benchamrks somewhere ?

thanks
roland

Dario,

Yes, we may improve coding style over time, but there are no plans for
doing that in the immediate future.  I know, it's not ideal, so we all
have to get used to those few exceptions.
