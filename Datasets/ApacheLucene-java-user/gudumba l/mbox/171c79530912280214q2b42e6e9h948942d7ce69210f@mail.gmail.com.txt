SUBJECT: relation among Terms included in Query
DATE: 28 Dec 2009

Hello All,
            I have observed extractTerms() in the class
org.apache.lucene.search.Query which returns set of terms extracted
from user input query. Is there any chance of getting the
connecting-operator between all those terms. for example.. Term1 OR
Term2 AND Term3 ..    or  Term1 AND Term2 AND Term3 , etc..
Thanks.
