SUBJECT: lucene memory usage, caching...
DATE: 31 May 2006

Hi experts,

Does Lucene do any caching of Document fields during a search?
If I perform a search and retrieve some fields in the Document hits,
then I repeat the same search, are those fields cached in memory?  It
doesn't seem to be -- I'm performing several thousand unique search
and retrievely a large text field from each Document, but the memory
usage by the Lucene java process seems very low compared to the total
size of all those fields.

Just curious if there are any config params or other way to tweak
Lucene's caching strategies...

Thanks,
~Heng
