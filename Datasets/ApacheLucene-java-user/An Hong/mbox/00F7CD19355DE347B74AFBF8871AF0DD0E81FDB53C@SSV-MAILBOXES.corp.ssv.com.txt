SUBJECT: Old Lucene src archive corrupt?
DATE: 2 Mar 2010

Hi,
I'm trying to download some old Lucene source, e.g., http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/lucene-2.9.0-src.zip<http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/lucene-2.9.0-src.zip>
I get "unexpected of Archive" report from WinRar, which never has had problem with zip files.
 It's also the same problem with lucene-2.9.1-src.zip and perhaps with other versions as well.
Please check.
Thanks,
An Hong
