SUBJECT: Upgrading an old index to 2.4 format
DATE: 24 Feb 2009


I've several existing indexes in 2.1 file format.  If these indexes have multiple segments
and have not been optimized, a call to IndexWriter.optimize() should create a newly merged
segment of the latest 2.4 file format.  Is this true?  And, is there a way to force a file
format upgrade on a 2.1 index that's already in optimized state?
Thanks,
An
