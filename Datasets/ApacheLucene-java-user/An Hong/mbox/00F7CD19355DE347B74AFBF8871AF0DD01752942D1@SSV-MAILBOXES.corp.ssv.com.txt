SUBJECT: IndexWriter.rollback() logic question
DATE: 24 Feb 2009

A question about IndexWriter.rollback() logic.  Its javadoc says that it "Close the IndexWriter
without committing any of the changes that have occurred since it was opened."  So if I do
1.  Open  IndexWriter
2.  Add doc1
3.  Commit (successfully)
4.  Add doc2
5.  PrepareCommit()
6.  Rollback()

Is doc1 in the index?  If not, I wonder how come rollback() does not roll back to the last
successful commit() state instead?
Thanks,
An
