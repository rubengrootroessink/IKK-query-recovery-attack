Thanks Otis!

What do you mean by building it in batches? Does it
mean I should close the IndexWriter every 1000 rows
and reopen it? Does that releases references to the
document objects so that they can be
garbage-collected?

I'm calling optimize() only at the end.

I agree that 1500 documents is very small. I'm
building the index on a PC with 512 megs, and the
indexing process is quickly gobbling up around 400
megs when I index around 1800 documents and the whole
machine is grinding to a virtual halt. I'm using the
latest DotLucene .NET port, so may be there's a memory
leak in it.

I have experience with AltaVista search (acquired by
FastSearch), and I used to call MakeStable() every
20,000 documents to flush memory structures to disk.
There doesn't seem to be an equivalent in Lucene.
