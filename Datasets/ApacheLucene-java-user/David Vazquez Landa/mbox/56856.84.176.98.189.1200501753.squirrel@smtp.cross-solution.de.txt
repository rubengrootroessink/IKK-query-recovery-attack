Uhmm... A simple question:

I have a lucene index (the directory with the segment* files) in HDFS.
This index is created by Nutch (who acesses files in HDFS seamlessly). My
question is if there is a way of reading this Lucene Index without having
to copy it to the local filesystem first...

Thanks :D
