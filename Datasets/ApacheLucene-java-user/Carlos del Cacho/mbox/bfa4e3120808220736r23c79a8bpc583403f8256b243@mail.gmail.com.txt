SUBJECT: question about modifying indexed Documents
DATE: 22 Aug 2008

Hello,

I'd like to modify a Field in an already indexed Document. The only way so
far that I have found is to delete the document through an IndexReader and
add a new one with an IndexWriter. This has the undesirable property that it
alters existing search results for a given keyword. Is there a better way to
do this?

Thanks,
Carlos
