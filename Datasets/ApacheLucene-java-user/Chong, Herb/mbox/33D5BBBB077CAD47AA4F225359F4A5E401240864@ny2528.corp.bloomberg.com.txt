i don't know of any open source search engine that incorporates interterm correlation. i have
been looking into how to do this in Lucene and so far, it's not been promising. the indexing
engine and file format needs to be changed. there are very few search engines that incorporate
interterm correlation in any mathematically and linguistically rigorous manner. i designed
a couple, but they were all research experiments.

if you are familiar with the TREC automatic adhoc track? my experiments with the TREC-5 to
TREC-7 questions produced about 0.05 to 0.10 improvement in average precision by proper use
of interterm correlation. my project at the time was cancelled after TREC-7 and so there haven't
been any new developments.

Hmm... Are you perhaps familiar with some open system which doesn't? I'm 
curious because one of my projects (already using Lucene) could benefit 
from such feature. Right now I'm using a bastardized version of Markov 
chains, but it's more of a hack...
