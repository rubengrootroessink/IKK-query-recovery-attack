multiple threads on a single disk will likely results in significantly slower searching, possibly
an order of magnitude or more slowdown depending on many factors such as available RAM, etc.

That's the solution I have in mind, since I do not
have multiple machines avaiable to me. Would
multi-threads on a single disk produces any
performance advantage? since i don't see CPU is
utilised 100% normally. In this case, does the
bottleneck happens on the mutli-thread concurrent
process sharing or on the single disk read? if its the
latter, probably, I can get away by putting multiple
indexes on seperate hard disks, but still runs on
single CPU.
