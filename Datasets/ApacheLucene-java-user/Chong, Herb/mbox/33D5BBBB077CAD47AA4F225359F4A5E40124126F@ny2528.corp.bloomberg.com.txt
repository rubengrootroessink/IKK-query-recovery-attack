can you share a description of the heuristics you used to clean up the text? i am facing the
same problem right now handling email. i'm not interested in the rules you use as much as
the tools you use to implement the rules.

This "clean-up work" is actually trickier than the summarising itself 
and it is usually very domain-specific. That's the reason why I haven't 
proposed to contribute the summariser to Lucene, because the clean-up 
code is not generic. The summariser itself is just one class with 300 
lines, but without prior clean-up the quality of its summaries is 
insufficient.
