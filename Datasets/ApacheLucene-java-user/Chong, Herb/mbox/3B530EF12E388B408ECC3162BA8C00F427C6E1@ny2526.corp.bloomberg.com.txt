Obsession with indexing performance is not healthy.  Before changing any 
settings convince yourself that indexing performance is a real problem 
for your application.  How often do you re-index from scratch?  Are you 
really having any difficulty keeping up with the rate of change of your 
collection?  Perhaps your development time would be better spent 
focussing on other parts of your application.
