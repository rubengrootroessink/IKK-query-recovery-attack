it's the line with the close(). so the remedy then is to make sure that it is called only once.
what is the recommended way to process two folders worth of documents then? do i need to create
a new IndexWriter object for each folder i process?

Assuming it's writeLock.release(), an easy explanation would be that 
close() was called twice on the same IndexWriter. Perhaps the demo has a 
bug that ends up doing this in some cases?
