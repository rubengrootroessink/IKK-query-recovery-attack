no change in 1.3RC2. the crash is at the same statement, although the absolute line number
has moved.

this is the demo IndexFiles application with a change in the main() method to allow specifying
more than one file/directory in the parameter list. i also modified the FileWriter class to
save the first 300 bytes of each document in an Unindexed field. i used the 1.2 version of
the demo application to as my base for these changes. the application is being run with a
1000M JVM size. there are about 120,000 documents averaging about 600 bytes in size.

Could you try the latest CVS version or 1.3 RC build and see if the 
problem has been resolved?
