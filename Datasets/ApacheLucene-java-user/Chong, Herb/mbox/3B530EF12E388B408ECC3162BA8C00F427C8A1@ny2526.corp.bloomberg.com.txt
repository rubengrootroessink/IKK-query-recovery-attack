there are a couple of people who participated in TREC that used a relational database to directly
store the postings list for each term. from what i recall, search performance in terms of
elapsed time was reasonable, not particularly fast nor slow. i gather that each term's posting
list was an individual BLOB in the database. the term string was used as the index column.
i believe the group used stemming.

Also, in some environments, the only supported access to reliable, 
redundant, shared data might be through a database.  An SQLDirectory 
would enable one to deploy a Lucene-based application in such an 
environment without having to, e.g., get permission from operations to 
enable NFS.
