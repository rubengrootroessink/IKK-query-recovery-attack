it solves one part of the problem, but there are a lot of sentences in a typical document.
you'll need to composite a rank of a document from its constituent sentences then. there are
less drastic ways to solve the problem. the other problem is that Lucene doesn't consider
the term order in the query unless the query is formulated as a phrase. a simple bag-of-words
query doesn't make use of the ordering of terms that apply in a given language.

In the Lucene-sense of things, sounds like you're after one Document 
per sentence.  You then get your boundaries automatically as well as 
the "distance weighting" through the coord() Similarity function.  At 
least that seems like a close approximation of what Lucene offers.  
Thoughts?
