Word documents with FastSave enabled contain the original document and then deltas to the document
until the deltas exceed a certain size and then they are merged back into the document. that
means that unless you run the deltas, you won't know what the actual final contents are.

Unfortunately, it is not quite so easy.  I am not sure about Word
documents but PDFs usually have there contents compressed so a raw
"fishing" around for text would be pointless.  Your best bet is to use a
package like the one from textmining.org that handles various formats for
you.
