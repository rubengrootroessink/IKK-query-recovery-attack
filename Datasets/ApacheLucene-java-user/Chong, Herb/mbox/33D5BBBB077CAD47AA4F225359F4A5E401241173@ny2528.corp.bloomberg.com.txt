Well, not quite, User normally enters a search string
A that normally returns 1000 out of 2 millions docs. I
then append A with 500 OR conditions... A AND (B or C
or ... or x500). I am trying to optimse the 500 OR
terms so that it does not do a full 2 millions docs
search but on the 1000 returned. Would this help?
