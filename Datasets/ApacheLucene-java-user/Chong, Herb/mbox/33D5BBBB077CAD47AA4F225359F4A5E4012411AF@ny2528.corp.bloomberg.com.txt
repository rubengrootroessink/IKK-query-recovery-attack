the core of the search engine has to have certain capabilities, however, because they are next
to impossible to add as a layer on top with any efficiency. detecting sentence boundaries
outside the core search engine is really hard to do without building another search engine
index. if i have to do that, there is no point in using Lucene.

Query expansion can (and I believe should) be done efficiently outside 
the core of search engine. After all, it's a process of changing the 
query according to some expansion/rewriting algorithms, but it is still 
the unchanged search engine that in the end has to answer the new query...
