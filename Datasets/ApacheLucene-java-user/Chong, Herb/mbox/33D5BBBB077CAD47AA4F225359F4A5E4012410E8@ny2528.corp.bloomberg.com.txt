the parser isn't the problem. the crash is in IndexWriter and that is a part of Lucene, not
the demo. doesn't matter if the demo causes it.

120k documents?!  You're asking a lot of the *demo*.  It was not ever 
meant to be a production-quality HTML or text file processor.  My 
suggestion is that you create your own custom indexer code using 
something more production quality for HTML parsing like Neko HTML or 
JTidy.
