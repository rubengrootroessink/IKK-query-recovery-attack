if you are handling inter correlation properly, then terms can't cross sentence boundaries.
if you are not paying attention to sentence boundaries, then you are not following rules of
linguistics.

Not sure what you mean by "terms can't cross sentence boundaries".  If 
you're only using single-word terms, that's trivially true.  What is it 
that you're trying to achieve, exactly?  (Your comment makes it sound 
as though you simultaneously want and don't want sentence boundaries, 
so I'm confused.)
