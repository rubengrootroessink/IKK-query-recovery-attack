you're describing ad-hoc solutions to a problem that have an effect, but not one that is easily
predictable. one can concoct all sorts of combinations of the query operators that would have
something of the effect that i am describing. crossing sentence boundaries, however, can't
be done without having some sentence boundaries as a reference. on top of this, there is a
relatively simple concept which, if implemented, takes away all the ad-hocness of the solutions
and replaces it with a something that is both linguistically and mathematically sound and
on top of which won't materially make the engine core more complicated. that concept is that
multiword queries are mostly multiword terms and they can't cross sentence boundaries according
to the rules of English.

Certainly there are lots of scoring algorithms that one cannot easily 
implement with Lucene.  I'm just not yet clear on what you need to do 
that Lucene cannot support.
