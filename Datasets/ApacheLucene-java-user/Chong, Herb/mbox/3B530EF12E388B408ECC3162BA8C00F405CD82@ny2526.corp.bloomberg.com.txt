SUBJECT: index size question
DATE: 14 Jan 2004

this should probably in the FAQ. what happens when i index tens of gigabytes of documents on
a platform that doesn't support files larger than 2GB. does Lucene automatically stop merging
index files intelligently so that its files don't exceed 2GB in size, or must i manage the
incoming documents such that no index file exceeds 2GB?
