there is nothing i said about NLP. in fact my specific statements exclude NLP. the processing
i am describing covers a linguistic observation and a constraint. a sequence of terms in the
query receive a higher score when it occurs inside a single sentence than when it crosses
a sentence boundary. also, there are many situations where NLP processing doesn't do any query
expansion and reduces the number of possible documents that a query can match, thereby speeding
up search. query expansion is only one way to use NLP, and i am not even interested in NLP
changes to Lucene.

Hope this isn't out of context - but Dan makes a very valid point.
Besides the potential performance slowdown if NLP was always applied to
a users query - there are times that an exact term match is desired
without the "query expansion" that an NLP process normally requires.
