it has its limitations. that is why i am looking at what it would take to solve some of them.
parsing documents to recognize sentences and storing sentence boundaries in the index would
solve the ones that are most limiting. superposing interterm correlation on top of Lucene
isn't very useful because then you have to build a new almost-duplicate index. since when
people type in more than one word as a query, they almost invariably mean phrases, a search
engine that doesn't take advantage of that isn't making use of fundamental linguistic knowledge.
what has to be stored isn't much, but implementing it can be.

I get the feeling you're looking for reasons that Lucene is inadequate. 
  This may be the case for the uses you're speaking of, but there is 
quite a bit of flexibility with Lucene in terms of Analysis, scoring, 
and custom Query implementations that all relate to what you've been 
speaking of.  And, of course, Lucene is a low-level component of which 
a higher level piece could be built around.
