i suggest that you use a special tokenizer that breaks chemical names into their constituent
parts and index them as if they were words.

Yes and yes. Users range from Information Professionals to "naive" end
users.
If there's a string like "N-(t-Butyl)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-nitroxyl" users
can be expected to search for "dinitro", "3,5-dinitro", "nitrobenz" etc.

There are also sequences of amino acids or DNA that users might want to
match
partially.
