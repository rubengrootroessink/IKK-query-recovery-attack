you are storing the same information both ways. the string gets analyzed and discarded, just
like with the Reader.

Hi,

I have seen the example SAX based XML processing in the Lucene sandbox (thanks to the authors
for contributing!) and have successfully adapted this approach for my application.  The one
thing that does not sit well with me is the fact that I am using the method Field.Text(String,
String) instead of the Field.Text(String, Reader) version, which means I am storing the contents
in the index.
