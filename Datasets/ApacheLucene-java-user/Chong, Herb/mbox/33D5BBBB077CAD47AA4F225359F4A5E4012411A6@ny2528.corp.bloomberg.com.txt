What you can do is use a pos tagger (i.e. a maximum entropy model based 
or  Brill tagger if you just have english) and use a data mining 
algorithm for weight your terms.
May be you can use a hidden Markov model for that.

You can build this on top of lucene, shouldn't be that difficult.

But may be I understand you wrong.. ..
