SUBJECT: Word co-occurrences counts
DATE: 23 Dec 2004

Hi all,

I have a curious problem, and initial poking around with Lucene looks
like it may only be able to half-handle the problem.

 

The problem requires two abilities:

1.	To be able to return the number of times the word appears in all
the documents (which it looks like lucene can do through IndexReader) 
2.	To be able to return the number of word co-occurrences within
the document set (ie. How many times does "computer" appear within 50
words of  "dog") 

 

Is the second point possible?

 

Thanks all, and happy holidays,

Andrew
