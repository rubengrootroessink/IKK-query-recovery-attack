Thanks Erick for the information.

Actually I am using RemoteParallelMultiSearcher with 10 Search Servers, my
crawler program freequently add new documents in to all the Search Servers
in a distributed manner. So in this case, if I add a document in a
particular index, I need to restart the searcher program in that server.
right? Can I do this with a remote call, or I want to add a new method to
Searchable interface?

Thanks,
Sunil
