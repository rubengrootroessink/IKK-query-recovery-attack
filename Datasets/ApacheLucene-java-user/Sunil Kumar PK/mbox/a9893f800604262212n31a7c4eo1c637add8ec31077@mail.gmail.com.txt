DATE: 27 Apr 2006

Hi,

I have added some code in the Lucene 1.9 - source code for Lucene
RemoteParallelMultisearcher performance benchmark.

 I have recorded the time to execute the  'searchables[i].docFreq(term)' (in
MultiSearcher.java) method in both client and server, and for  '
searchable.search' (in ParallelMultiSearcher.java) method also.i have also
recorded the total time taken to get hits object.

I have tested different complex boolean queries and taken the average time
for each queries.  But while doing this i am stucked with some doubts.
Please find my doubts listed below.

What I have understood from Lucene Remote Parallel Multi Searcher Search
Procedure is first compute the weight for the Query in each Index
sequentially (one by one, eg: - calculate "query weight" of index1 first and
then index2) and then perform searching of each index one by one and merge
the results.

I want to know is there any possibility or method to merge the weight
calculation of index 1 and its search in a single RPC instead of doing the
both function in separate steps.

Another query I have to clear is In RemoteParallelMultiSearcher the method
"docFreq (Term term)" is not parallelized, why it is not
parallelized, and please specify any reason for that.


Regards

Sunil
