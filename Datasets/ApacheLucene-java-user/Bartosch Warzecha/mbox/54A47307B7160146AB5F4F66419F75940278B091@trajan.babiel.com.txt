SUBJECT: HTML parser??
DATE: 3 May 2005


Hello,

I´m building a search engine for HTML-Dokuments, and I´ve got a HTML-parsing
problem.

This documents are in german. In this documents are different special
characters, and different ways of writing this special characters, like "ö",
"&ouml;" and "&#246". Do somebody know a parsing engine that has no problems
with all this different ways to write this special characters?

Thanks

b.warzecha
