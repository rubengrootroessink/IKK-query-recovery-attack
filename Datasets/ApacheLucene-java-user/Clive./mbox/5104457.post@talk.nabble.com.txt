SUBJECT: Lucene Dynamic http Web Page Search
DATE: 29 Jun 2006


Hi, 

I am working on adding a search feature to a web site that uses single
database driven aspx pages and would like to know if Lucene can search using
the http url address or database to index from. 
As current I can only see Lucene being able to search physical files in a
windows folder.

Any ideas?
