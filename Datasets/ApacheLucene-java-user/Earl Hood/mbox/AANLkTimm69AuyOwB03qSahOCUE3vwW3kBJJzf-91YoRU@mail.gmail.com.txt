SUBJECT: Forcing specific index file names
DATE: 14 Dec 2010

It is possible to always have Lucene end up with the
same set of index filenames for each index generation
process?

I have an application that creates an index for a
set of files, and generally, the index files created
are the following:

_0.cfs  segments_2  segments.gen

However, it appears sometimes, I get the following:

_2.cfs  segments_4  segments.gen

Not sure what triggers the difference, however, is
there a "rename" operation so I can rename
the files to be like the first list?

Thanks,
