I have to create patch sets against two version of a data
set in a directory tree structure, and the data set contains
a lucene index.

However, if the filenames are not consistent for the index,
then the delta program thinks they are completely new
files vs just doing an xdelta on the index data.

If renaming is not possible, the delta program will
have to have lucene awareness about variations in
the filenames between two versions of a data set
tree.  I guess I will have to do this if I am going
to be lectured about how to develop software.

>From a design perspective, I figured if the process
that builds the data sets and the lucene index can
be modified to make sure the lucene index files are
consistently named, the delta computation program
can stay agnostic about lucene and just do a basic
tree differencing algorithm.
