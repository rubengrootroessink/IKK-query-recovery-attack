Thanks Chris! This works with lucene2.1 and greater (breaks with lucene2.0)

A follow up question, anyway to rename and to delete a field.

Rename field: I tried to use a hex editor to edit the .fnm file (screwed up
my index, but I was careful and followed the index format)
Deleting a field: ideas?

Thanks
