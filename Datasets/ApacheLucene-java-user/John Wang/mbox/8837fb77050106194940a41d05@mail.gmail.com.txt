SUBJECT: reading fields selectively
DATE: 7 Jan 2005

Hi:

   Is there some way to read only 1 field value from an index given a docID?

   From the current API, in order to get a field from given a docID, I
would call:
 
    IndexSearcher.document(docID)

     which in turn reads in all fields from the disk.

   Here is my problem:

           After the search, I have a set of docIDs. For each
document, I have a unique string identifier. At this point I only need
these identifiers but with the above API, I am forced to read the
entire row of fields for each document in the search result, which in
my case can be very large.

           Is there an alternative?

I am thinking more on the lines of a call:

           Field[] getFields(int docID,String fieldName);

Thanks

-John
