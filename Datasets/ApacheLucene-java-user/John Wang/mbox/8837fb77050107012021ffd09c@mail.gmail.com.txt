DATE: 7 Jan 2005

Thanks guys for the info!

After looking at the patch code I have two problems:

1) The patch implementation doesn't help with performance. It still
reads the data for every field in the document. Just not storing all
of them. So this implementation helps if there are memory
restrictions, but not if you are after performance.

2) We are bundling Lucene in our application, we are trying very hard
not having to change Lucene code and thus divert from the Lucene code
base. This patch implementation requires you to make changes to
SegmentReader.java. I am hoping not having to do that.


Any ideas?

Thanks

-John
