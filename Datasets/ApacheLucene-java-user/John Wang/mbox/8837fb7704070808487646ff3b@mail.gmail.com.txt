SUBJECT: final Token
DATE: 8 Jul 2004

Hi gurus:

Please forgive some more of my ignorant questions :)

The Token class is declared as final. 

The tokenizers and the analyzers I am writing produce token objects
with more information encapsulated than the Token class defined in
lucene.

So it makes sense to me to be able to derive from it. 

I see that even within the Lucene API, classes such as
org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.Token are created and the
corresponding Tokenizers are customized maybe because of this
limitation.

Am I missing something? Can this class be "unfinaled"? 

Thanks

-John
