Hi Paul:

      Thanks for the pointer.

       How would I extend from the patch you submitted to filter out
more documents not using a Filter. e.g.

      have a class to skip documents based on a docID: boolean
isValid(int docID)

      My problem is I want to discard documents at query time without
having to construct a BitSet via filter. I have my own memory
structure to help me skip documents based the query and a docid.

Thanks

-John
