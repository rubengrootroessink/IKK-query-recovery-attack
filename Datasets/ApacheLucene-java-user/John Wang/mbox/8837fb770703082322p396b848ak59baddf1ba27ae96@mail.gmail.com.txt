SUBJECT: FieldCache: flush cache explicitly
DATE: 9 Mar 2007

I think the api should allow for explicitly flush the fieldcache.

I have a setup where new readers are being loaded very some period of
time. I don't want to rely on Java WeakHashMap to free the cache, I
want to be able to do it in a deterministic way.

It would be great if this can be added to Lucene, I can create a bug
if the Lucene gods agree to it :)

Thanks

-John
