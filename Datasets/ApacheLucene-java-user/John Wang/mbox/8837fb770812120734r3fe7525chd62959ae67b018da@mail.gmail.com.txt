this describes the upcoming 2.0 release, which is in the ill-named
branch: BR_DEV_1_5_0
We are still doing some development work on that, feel free to check out the
branch and we will be doing a release shortly.

some features we aimed for 2.0 and also reasons for the api changes:

1) support for selection expansion: The ability to select a value in a
field, and allow the sibling facets to come back, e.g. intersect with other
fields and keep the current field not intersect with selected value. This is
rather tricky to be fast, e.g. doing 2 searches.

2) allow the framework, ability to handle derived data, e.g. build facets
from data not necc. on index. Some examples, in linkedin's case, being able
to facet on different distances of the social graph, etc.

3) Being able to handle multi valued facets, e.g. 1 docid -> into multiple
values.

4) being able to do 1) on range facets.

etc..
