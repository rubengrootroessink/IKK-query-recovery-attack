SUBJECT: knowing which field contributed the search result
DATE: 16 Feb 2005

Hi:

   Is there way to find out given a hit from a search, find out which
fields contributed to the hit?

e.g.

If my search for:

contents1="brown fox" OR contents2="black bear"

can the document founded by this query also have information on
whether it was found via contents1 or contents2 or both.


Thanks

-John
