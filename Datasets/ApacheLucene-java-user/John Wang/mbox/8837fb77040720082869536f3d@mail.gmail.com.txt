Hi:
   I am trying to store some Databased like field values into lucene.
I have my own way of storing field values in a customized format.

   I guess my question is wheather we can make the Reader/Writer
classes, e.g. FieldReader, FieldWriter, DocumentReader/Writer classes
non-final?

   I have asked to make the Lucene API less restrictive many many many
times but got no replies. Is this request feasible?

Thanks

-John
