SUBJECT: search performance enhancement

Hi:

   I posted a bug (36147) a few days ago and didn't hear anything, so
I thought I'd try my luck on this list.

   The idea is to avoid score calculations on documents to be filtered
out anyway. (e.g. via Filter object passed to the searcher class)

   This seems to be an easy change.

   Also it would be nice to expose a method to return a score given a
docid, e.g.

   float getScore(int docid)

   on the Scorer class.

   I am gonna make the change locally and do some performance analysis
on it and will post some numbers later.

Thanks

-John
