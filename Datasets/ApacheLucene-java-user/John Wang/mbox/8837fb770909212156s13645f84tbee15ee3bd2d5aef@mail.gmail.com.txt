SUBJECT: 2.9 NRT w.r.t. sorting and field cache
DATE: 22 Sep 2009

Looking at the code, seems there is a disconnect between how/when field
cache is loaded when IndexWriter.getReader() is called.

Is FieldCache updated? Otherwise, are we reloading FieldCache for each
reader instance?

Seems for operations that lazy loads field cache, e.g. sorting, this has a
significant performance issue.

Please advise.

Thanks
