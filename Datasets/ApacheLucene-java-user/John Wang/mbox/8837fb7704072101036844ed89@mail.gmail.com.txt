a mechanism for adding Writers and Readers to the indexing/searching process at the application

separate files (thus, not harming the index file format).  They could be used to read/write
an arbitrary amount of metadata at the term, document and/or index level w/o affecting the
core Lucene index.  Furthermore, previous versions could still work b/c they would just ignore
the new files and the indexes could be used by other applications as well.

 Of course, the trick is figuring out how it fits into the API (or maybe it becomes a part
of 2.0).  Not sure if it is even feasible, but it seems like you could define interfaces for
Readers and Writers that met the requirements to do this.
