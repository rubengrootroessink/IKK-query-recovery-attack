SUBJECT: Re: random accessing term value
DATE: 26 Mar 2008

I am not sure how term vectors would help me. Term vectors are ordered by
frequency, not in lex order. Since I know in the dictionary the terms are
ordered by lex, seems it is possible for me to randomly get the nth term in
the dictionary without having to seek to it.

Thoughts?

Thanks
