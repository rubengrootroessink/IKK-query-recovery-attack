Hi:

   I have been playing with Lucene's term postings, e.g. iterating
over TermEnums etc.

   For a field, say F, with values: {a, b, c, d, e}, is there a way to
get the index of a value, e.g. for a, return 0, and for c, return 2.
In a way, I am interested in getting the distance between Term("F","")
and Term("F","d") for example.

Thanks

-John
