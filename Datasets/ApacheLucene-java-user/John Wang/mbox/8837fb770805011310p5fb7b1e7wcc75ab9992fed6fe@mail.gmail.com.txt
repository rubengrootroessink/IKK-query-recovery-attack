I am not sure why this is the case, docid is internal to the sub index. As
long as the sub index size is below 2 bil, there is no need for docid to be
long. With multiple indexes, I was thinking having an aggregater which
merges maybe only a page of search result.

Example:

sub index 1: 1 billion docs
sub index 2: 1 billion docs
sub index 3: 1 billion docs

federating search to these subindexes, you represent an index of 3 billion
docs, and all internal doc ids are of type int.

Maybe I am not understanding something.
