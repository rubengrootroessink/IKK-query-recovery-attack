Hi guys:

    Running into a question with IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize:

    I am trying to expand a smaller index by replicating it into a larger
index. So I am adding the same directory N times.

    I get an exception because noDupDirs(dirs) fails. For this call, is this
check neccessary?

    I temporarily commented it and the resulting index seems to fine.

Thanks

-John
