SUBJECT: final modifier on IndexReader class
DATE: 8 Jun 2005

Hi:

   Why is there a final modifier on IndexReader.finalize? IndexReader
is an abstract class and therefore is meant to be derived. The problem
here is I am not able to provide a finalize method for my subclass
since the finalized method is "finaled".

    I will create a bug.

Thanks

-John
