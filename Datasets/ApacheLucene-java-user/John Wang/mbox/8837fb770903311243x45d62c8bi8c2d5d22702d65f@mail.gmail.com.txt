SUBJECT: API to get index info
DATE: 31 Mar 2009

Can we have an API that exposes index information, e.g. number of segments
etc.? (or simply make SegmentInfo(s) public classes)
We currently do this by working around package-level protecting  by sneaking
in a subclass in the org.apache.index package. We are moving towards OSGI,
and split-packages is a no no.

Thanks
