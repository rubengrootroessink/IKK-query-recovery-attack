SUBJECT: indexing api wrt Analyzer
DATE: 13 Mar 2008

Hi all:

    Maybe this has been asked before:

    I am building an index consists of multiple languages, (stored as a
field), and I have different analyzers depending on the language of the
language to be indexed. But the IndexWriter takes only an Analyzer.

    I was hoping to have IndexWriter take an AnalyzerFactory, where the
AnalyzerFactory produces Analyzer depending on some criteria of the
document, e.g. language.

    Maybe I am going about the wrong way.

    Any suggestions on how to go about?

Thanks

-John
