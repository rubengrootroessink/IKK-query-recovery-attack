SUBJECT: Pooling indexReader
DATE: 29 Jun 2008

Hi:
   I had some code to do indexReader pooling to avoid open and close on a
large index when doing lotsa searches. So I had a FilteredIndexReader proxy
that overrides the doClose method to do nothing, and when I really want to
close it, I call super.doClose(). This patter worked well for me prior to
2.3. With 2.3, the close is doing the reference counting out side of
doClose, and since close is final, my pattern is broken.

   Am I using the api incorrectly? how would I accomplish this task?

Thanks

-John
