SUBJECT: File locking using java.nio.channels.FileLock
DATE: 16 Dec 2004

Hi:

  When is Lucene planning on moving toward java 1.4+?

   I see there are some problems caused from the current lock file
implementation, e.g. Bug# 32171. The problems would be easily fixed by
using the java.nio.channels.FileLock object.

Thanks

-John
