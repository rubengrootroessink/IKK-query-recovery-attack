SUBJECT: changing index format
DATE: 24 Jun 2008

Hi:
   I am trying to add couple more values to the TermInfo file and want to
keep the index backward compatible. But I see values such as docFreq etc.
are stored as a VInt, so I couldn't do things like using the signed bit to
determine whether to read/write the extra values.

  Any suggestions?

(I tried to implement a read/write impl for signed VInt, but it didn't work
out too well :( )

Thanks

-John
