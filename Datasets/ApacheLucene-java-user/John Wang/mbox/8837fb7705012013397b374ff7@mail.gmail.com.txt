SUBJECT: lucene2.0 and transaction support
DATE: 20 Jan 2005

Hi:

   When is lucene 2.0 scheduled to be released? Is there a javadoc
somewhere so we can check out the new APIs?

    Is there a plan to add transaction support into lucene? This is
something we need and if we do implement it ourselves, is it too large
of a change for a patch?

Thanks

-John
