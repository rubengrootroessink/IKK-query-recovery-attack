Hi Grant:

    For our corpus, we don't rely on idf in scoring calculation that much,
so I don't see that being a problem that much.

    About performance, instantiating 1 indexWriter for a batch of say 1000
docs, e.g. iterate over 1000 docs and do addDocument; comparing with
instantiating and closing 1000 indexWriters each doing 1 addDocument. Are
you saying the expected performance is the same? I thought when you call
addDocument, it adds to memory and flush when segment needs to be merged or
writer closes.

    Maybe I am missing something.

Thanks
