Yes, but usually it's a good idea to add documents in batch and not having
to reinstantiate the writer for every document and then closing it.

It would be nice if one can specify to the writer which analyzer to use.

PerfieldAnalyzer wouldn't work because different analyzers may apply on the
same field depending on the doc, e.g.

if (field1.name.equals("fr"))
    use FrenchAnalyzer on content field
etc.
