SUBJECT: finalize delete without optimize
DATE: 7 Dec 2004

Hi:

   Is there a way to finalize delete, e.g. actually remove them from
the segments and make sure the docIDs are contiguous again.

   The only explicit way to do this is by calling
IndexWriter.optmize(). But this call does a lot more (also merges all
the segments), hence is very expensive. Is there a way to simply just
finalize the deletes without having to merge all the segments?

    If not, I'd be glad to submit an implementation of this feature if
the Lucene devs agree this is useful.

Thanks

-John
