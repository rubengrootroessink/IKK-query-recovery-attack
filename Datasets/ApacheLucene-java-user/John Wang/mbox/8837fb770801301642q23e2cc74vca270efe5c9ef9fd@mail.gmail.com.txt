SUBJECT: appending field to an existing index
DATE: 31 Jan 2008

Hi all:

    We have a large index and it is difficult to reindex.

    We want to add another field to the index without reindexing, e.g. just
create a new inverted index, dictionary files etc.

    How feasible is it to add this to lucene?


Thanks

-John
