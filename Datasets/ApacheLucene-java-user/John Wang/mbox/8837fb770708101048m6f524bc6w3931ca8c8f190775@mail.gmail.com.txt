SUBJECT: scorers and filters
DATE: 10 Aug 2007

Hi Lucene Gurus:

    More of a performance question:

When you pass a Filter to a searcher to do a search, the searcher is
basically doing the full search and then intersect against the bitset given
by the filter. This seems wasteful when there are lotsa hits returned by the
scorer and filter only has only a few docs, e.g.

     Running a MatchAllDocsQuery given a Filter with only 1 doc.

    Right now Scorers don't know about filters, only the searchers do. And
scorers are doing most of the computation, but it seems scorers should make
use of the filters as the corpus before doing any score computation.

    Seems to me this is an area that deserves some attention.

Thoughts?

Thanks

-John
