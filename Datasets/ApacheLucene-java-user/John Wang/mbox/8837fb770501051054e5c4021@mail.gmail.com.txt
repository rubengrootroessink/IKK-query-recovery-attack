SUBJECT: multi-threaded thru-put in lucene
DATE: 5 Jan 2005

Hi folks:

    We are trying to measure thru-put lucene in a multi-threaded environment. 

    This is what we found:

     1 thread, search takes 20 ms.

      2 threads, search takes 40 ms.

      5 threads, search takes 100 ms.


     Seems like under a multi-threaded scenario, thru-put isn't good,
performance is not any better than that of 1 thread.

     I tried to share an IndexSearcher amongst all threads as well as
having an IndexSearcher per thread. Both yield same numbers.

     Is this consistent with what you'd expect?

Thanks

-John
