SRS is a biology databank equivalent of Lucene 
and it uses this query syntax for range searches:
  [lib-field#100:200]  -- lower:upper bounded
  [lib-field#:200]  -- upper bounded only
  [lib-field#200:]  -- lower bounded only
('field#' denotes numeric range search,  'field:' denotes text searches)

A lucene range search syntax equivalent:
  field:[100 TO 200] -- lower and upper bounded
  field:[ TO 200] -- upper bounded only
  field:[100 TO ] -- lower bounded only
