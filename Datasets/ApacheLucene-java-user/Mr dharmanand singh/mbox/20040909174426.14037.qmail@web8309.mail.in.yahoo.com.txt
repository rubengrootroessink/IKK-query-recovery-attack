SUBJECT: Lucene working example.
DATE: 9 Sep 2004

I used lucene in one of my projects which required
searching content on web pages. I wrote my own jsp and
html parser that handled major cases and it
successfully parsed almost all my required web pages.
I also came up with an example implementation
(http://dharmanand.tarundua.net/lucene_eg.war) as I
didnÂ’t find very good working examples on the internet.
