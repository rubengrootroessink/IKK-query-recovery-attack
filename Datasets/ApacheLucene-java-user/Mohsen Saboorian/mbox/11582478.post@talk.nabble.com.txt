SUBJECT: User Defined Matcher
DATE: 13 Jul 2007


Is it possible that I inject my own matching mechanism into Lucene
IndexSearcher? In other words, is this possible that my own method be called
in order to collect results (hits)? Suppose the case that I want to match -
for example - "foo" with both "foo" and "oof".

Thanks in advance,
Mohsen.
