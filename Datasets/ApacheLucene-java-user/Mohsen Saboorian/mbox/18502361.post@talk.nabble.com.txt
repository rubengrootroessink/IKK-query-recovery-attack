SUBJECT: Doesn it make sense cache IndexReader?
DATE: 17 Jul 2008


Hi,
I have a set of indices in different languages (very smal indices: on
average each index directory has 10,000 documents, which has an overall size
of less than 2mb). I want to know if this is a good idea to cache
IndexReader (once opened) somewhere and further reuse it? My application is
single-threaded, but I have memory concerns, since the indexing and search
is totally done on client machines. 

Does it make sense to have all IndexReaders cached (for example if opening
an index reader takes some time). Does Lucene load some part of index in
memory as soon as a call to IndexReader.open() is done?

Mohsen.
