Kastern, thanks for the reply.

If it wasn't thread-safe I may need a cache? I think the cache cannot be
used on a non-thread-safe environment since it exposes same instances to
different threads.

My indices are readonly. Once created never change. If the memory footprint
for an open IndexReader is very low, I can keep all the gradually opened
index readers open.

Thanks for the suggestion. I will use it for the most commonly used index.
