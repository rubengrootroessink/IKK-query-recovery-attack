SUBJECT: Leading and trailing wildcard together
DATE: 21 Apr 2007


Hi,
I've noticed that from Lucene 2.1 leading wildcard can be enabled using
QueryParser.setAllowLeadingWildcard(true), however I wasn't able to search
for *Foo* (while "?Foo*" and even "?*Foo*" works). Is it possible to have
leading and trailing star wildcard together?

Thanks.
