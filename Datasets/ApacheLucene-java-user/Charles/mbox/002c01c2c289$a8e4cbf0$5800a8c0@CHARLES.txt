SUBJECT: Cannot match field containing value "No"
DATE: 23 Jan 2003

Hello all,

I seem to be having trouble matching the value "No". The snippet of my insert index code looks
like this:
--------------------
IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter("indexTest", new StandardAnalyzer(), true);
Document doc = new Document();  
doc.add(Field.Text("YesNo", choice));  
writer.addDocument(doc);
writer.optimize();
writer.close(); 
-------------------
where the value of the variable choice is either a "Yes" or a "No"
and the code to search it looks like this :

---------------------
IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(IndexReader.open("indexTest"));     
Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();  
Query query = org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.parse(queryString, "YesNo", analyzer);
                   
Hits hits = searcher.search(query);        
System.out.println("Found "+hits.length()+" match");                   
---------------------
where the value of queryString contains the user input which is wither a "Yes" or "No"


Whenever I insert a "No", I would not be able to retrieve it (the output will show 0 mtaches)
even though I use the same analyzer. Any other values like "Yes","n","y" would get hits. 
Has anyone went through similar errors? Is this a bug or is it some limitation, where lucene
can't accept string values of "No"? Or am i missing something? 

TIA,
Charles
