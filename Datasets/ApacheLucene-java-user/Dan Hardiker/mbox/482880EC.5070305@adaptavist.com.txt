SUBJECT: Numerical Range Query
DATE: 12 May 2008

Hi,

I've got an application which stores ratings for content in a Lucene 
index. It works a treat for the most part, apart from the use-case I 
have for being able to filter out ratings that have less than a given 
number of rates. It kinda works, but seems to use Alpha ranging rather 
than Numeric ranging.

Here is the Java code I am using:

luceneQuery.add( new RangeQuery( new Term(RateUtils.SF_FILTERED_CNT, 
minRatesString), null, true), BooleanClause.Occur.MUST );

For context:

* luceneQuery is a org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery
* RateUtils.SF_FILTERED_CNT is the String containing the appropriate 
field name "rating-filtered-count"
* minRatesString is an integer as a String

Here is where the field is added into the index:

document.add( new Field(RateUtils.SF_FILTERED_CNT, String.valueOf( 
filteredCount ), Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED) );

For context:

* document is a org.apache.lucene.document.Document
* filteredCount is an int (counting the number of rates that have occurred)

Unfortunately it doesn't work quite as I expected as if I have 5 
documents in the index:

# 5 ratings
# 9 ratings
# 1 rating
# 0 ratings
# 11 ratings

If minRatesString is "5" then only the first document is returned, if 
it's "1" then the 3rd and 5th are returned, if its "6" then none are 
returned. It appears to be filtering alphabetically (starting with the 
first digit/character and matching on that) rather than numerically.

Oddly enough, if I sort on that field ... it works as I expect.

Am I missing something?

the right terms - please advise me! I tried to find a way to search the 
archives specifically, but I could only browse them month by month.
