Thats just it. It's not stored : see the javadocs for Field.text(string,reader):
"Constructs a Reader-valued Field that is tokenized and indexed, but is not stored in the
index"

As opposed to :
  Field.Text(String name, String value)
which says:
"Constructs a String-valued Field that is tokenized and indexed, and is stored in the index,
for return with hits."

So, you're getting nulls because you're not storing the field for subsequent retrieval.

Are you deliberately trying to be obnoxious or is it just a natural gift?
You'll find people here more helpful if you dont resort to insulting them.
