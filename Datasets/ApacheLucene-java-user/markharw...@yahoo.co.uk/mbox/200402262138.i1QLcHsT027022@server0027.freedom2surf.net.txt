I tend to think of scaling in two dimensions: scaling by volumes of users and scaling by volumes
of data. The former is addressed through replicated indexes 
and the latter by segmented indexes. 
Distribute replicated segments across multiple boxes and create a broker which
a)Determines which segments to query
b)Load balances query requests across the replicated servers for each segment
c) Merges responses

Make sure your communications are batched to avoid too much fine-grained "chatter".

This is the basis of a scalable architecture.

Cheers
Mark
