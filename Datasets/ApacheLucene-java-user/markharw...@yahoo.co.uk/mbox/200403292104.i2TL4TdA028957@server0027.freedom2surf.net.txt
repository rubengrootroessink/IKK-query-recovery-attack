The other issue with this approach I'm still struggling with is simply the cost of creating
the temporary index. I don't know if you got a chance to look at the "FastIndex" 
implementation I put together using TreeMaps. I was getting a 2x speed improvement over RAM
indexes but it was still 4 times slower than the basic 
cost of tokenization used by the current highlighter code.  Costs for processing 50k worth
of docs are as follows:
fast indexing : 1182 ms
ramindexing : 2413 ms
just tokenizing :  310 ms

Still quite an overhead and I couldn't see any obvious means of improving on this.
