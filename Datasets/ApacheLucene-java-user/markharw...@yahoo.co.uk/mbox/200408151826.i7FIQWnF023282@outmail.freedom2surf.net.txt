Hi Pasha,
I think the advice you gave is for an earlier version.
With the latest version things have moved around and you would have to: 
    //use a max fragment size > size of text to ensure you get all text in one fragment
    highlighter.setTextFragmenter(new SimpleFragmenter(400000));
    // call getBestFragment....
   String result =highlighter.getBestFragment(tokenStream,text);

Cheers
Mark.


public String getBestFragment(TokenStream tokenStream, String text)
