Hi Doug,
Thanks for the post. BoostingQuery looks to be cleaner, faster and more generally useful than
my 
implementation :-)
Unless anyone has a particularly good reason I'll remove the link to my code that Stephane
put on the Wiki contributions page. 
I definitely find BoostingQuery very useful and would be happy to see it in Lucene core but
I'm not sure its popular 
enough to warrant adding special support to the query parser.  

BTW, I've had a thought about your suggestion for making the highlighter use some form of
RAMindex of sentence fragments
and then querying it to get the best fragments. This is nice in theory but could fail to find
anything if the query is of these forms:
a AND b 
"a b" 
When the code that breaks a doc into "sentence docs" splits co-occuring "a" and "b" terms
into seperate docs
this would produce no match. I dont think there's an easy way round that so I'll stick to
the current approach of scoring
fragments simply based on terms found in the query.


Cheers
Mark
