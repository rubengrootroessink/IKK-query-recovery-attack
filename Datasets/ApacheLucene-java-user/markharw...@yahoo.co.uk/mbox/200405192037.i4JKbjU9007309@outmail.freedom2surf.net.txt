I see the code you have is taken from the example in the javadocs. Unfortunately that example
wasn't complete because the class didnt
include the method defined in the Formatter interface. I have updated the Javadocs to correct
this oversight.

To correct your problem either make your class implement the Formatter interface to perform
your choice of custom formatting or remove the "this" 
parameter from your call to create a new Highlighter with the default Formatter implementation.

Thanks for "highlighting" the problem with the Javadocs...

Cheers
Mark
