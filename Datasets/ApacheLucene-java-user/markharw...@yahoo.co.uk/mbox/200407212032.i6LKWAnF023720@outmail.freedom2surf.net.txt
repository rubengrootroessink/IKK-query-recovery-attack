Technically not true, as of a few months ago. The good news is the highlighter has been redesigned
specifically to use TokenStreams not Analyzers. This would enable you to pass the token position
information
in from a pre-computed store of token positions. The bad news is that such a token-position
storage 
feature has not been added to core Lucene yet. 
If it ever is added the highlighter is already set up to make good use of it.

Cheers
Mark
