SUBJECT: RE: Lucene 1.2 "Hit Highlighting"
DATE: 7 Dec 2003

Hi Ken,
I've just had a look at the compatibility issues of my Highlighter package and Lucene 1.2.
It looks like the following Lucene methods are not present in this version: 
  BooleanQuery.getClauses();
  PhraseQuery.getTerms()
  TermQuery.getTerm() and 
  PriorityQueue.insert()
However, if you can find a way to get the terms out of your query object using 1.2 apis you
can 
call the "TextHighlighter"class to do the highlighting work. You will need to uncomment the
code that provides an
alternative to using the new PriorityQueue.insert().

Hope this helps
Mark Harwood
