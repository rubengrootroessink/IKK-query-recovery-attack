SUBJECT: Fix for "advanced tokenizers and highlighter" problem
DATE: 21 Jun 2004

I think this version of the highlighter should provide a fix: http://www.inperspective.com/lucene/hilite2beta.zip
Before I update the version of the highlighter in the sandbox I'd appreciate feedback from
those troubled 
with the issues to do with overlapping tokens in token streams (Erik, Dave, Bruce?)

I added my own test analyzer to the Junit test that introduces synonyms into the token stream
at the same
position as the trigger token and the new code works OK for me with that analyzer.

The fix means I needed to change the Formatter interface - this now takes a "TokenGroup" object
instead 
of a token because that can be used to represent a single token OR a sequence of overlapping
tokens.
I dont think most people have needed to create custom Formatter implementations so I dont
think this
redefined interface should break too much existing code (if any).

Cheers
Mark
