SUBJECT: Tool for analyzing analyzers
DATE: 27 May 2004

I've knocked together this tool which automatically discovers Analyzers on the classpath and
provides a GUI to allow you to try out different Analyzers and see their effects:

http://www.inperspective.com/lucene/Viewer.zip
This needs JDK1.4 and you'll need to define  the classpath to include Lucene and any of your
custom analyzers.

Paste in some example text, take your pick of analyzer and hit the "Analyze" button to see
the results.

Cheers
Mark
