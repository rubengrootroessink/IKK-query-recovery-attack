SUBJECT: re: Highlight package
DATE: 6 Apr 2004

Just got back from holiday to find that one of the ISPs I use shutdown my site with the highlighter
code and a number of people have 
complained about the broken "highlighter" link from the Lucene site.

I have temporarily put the missing highlighter code up here:

http://www.inperspective.com/lucene/highlighter.zip

I am now implementing the changes I outlined here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=lucene-user&m=108073924109682&w=2
I hope to release a new version of this package very shortly  and will update the "contributions"
WIKI page with the new link when this is released.

Cheers
Mark
