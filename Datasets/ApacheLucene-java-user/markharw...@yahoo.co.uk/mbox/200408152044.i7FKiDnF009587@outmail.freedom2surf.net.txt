>>I ask because in your example i should calculate the size of the initial text in any
case.

No calculation required - just use a really big number, (eg Integer.MAX_VALUE). This  doesn't
 allocate any extra resources.

Your "highlightAll" method sounds like it might be a useful addition. This "how do I get all
fragments?" question comes up reasonably often.

Thanks
Mark
