SUBJECT: pyLucene and indexes
DATE: 24 Feb 2007

Have anyone on this forum successfully created indexes using pyLucene 
and then read it using the Java API . I realize this ought to be 
theoretically possible, but i don't have a lot of time left in my 
current project to chase down bugs . It would be very helpful to know if 
someone has succeeded with this on Lucene 2.0 .

Thanks,
Raghavan
