There's no need to sort the words here.
You just have to ensure that the lucene query built is the same for the 
requests that you consider as equivalent.
I mean that if a request 'word1 word2' gives results different than 
'word2 word1', the problem is in your query parser or in the way you 
give the requests to it.
I keep on saying that with the lucene query parser, the requests 'word1 
and word2' & the request 'word2 and word1' are different because of the 
'required' flag.
