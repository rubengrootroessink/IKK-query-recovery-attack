SUBJECT: Re: Problems indexing with keywords
DATE: 25 Mar 2004

Hi,
when you index your field as a keyword, it's not indexed and thus the 
analyzer is not used for this field during the indexation.
But, if you make a search using the query parser with the 
StandardAnalyzer, it will be used for the parsing.
So, I suppose that in your query 'fieldname:Rev*', the 'R' is lowercased 
by the analyzer. And, as in your index you have the term 
'field:Rev_.12...', your requests don't return anything.

I hope this helps,
Franck Brisbart
