You're right. Using document fields during a search wasn't a good idea.
In fact, I would like to avoid using document fields at all. Because, it 
takes too much time. If a search returns 10000 results, I need to 
analyse all of them to get my extra info (nb of artist per type). And 
even if I have only 10 results to display, my search is very slow.
It'll be great to treat my 'type' field the same way as the 'freq' is 
used. I think this will be much faster.
How can I store the content of this field in a lucene file (such as 
<segment>.frq) to use it during my search ??

thx,
Franck
