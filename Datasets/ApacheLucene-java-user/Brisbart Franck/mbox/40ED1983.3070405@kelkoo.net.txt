I don't it is interpreted as the same request. As you should know the 
terms of a boolean query have a 'required' flag.
As to me, your request 'winston and churchill' is interpreted as 
'winston (not required)' and 'churchill (required)'
But your request 'churchill and winston' is interpreted as 'churchill 
(not required)' and 'winston (required)'

I think you'd rather search for 'and winston and churchill' (which 
should be the same than 'and churchill and winston') to have the both 
terms required
