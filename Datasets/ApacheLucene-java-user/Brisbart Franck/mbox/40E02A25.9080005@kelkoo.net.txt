SUBJECT: Re: how to get all terms as search results (or "*" equivalent)
DATE: 28 Jun 2004

When you use wildcards like that, the parser builds 1 query for each 
term matching the wildcarded term. With this approach, it should have 
created n queries (ie n boolean clauses) where n is number of terms.
The number of clauses for a BooleanQuery is limited to 1024 by default.
You can change this value to a higher one, but it's not very great.

For my own use, I created a 'AllQuery' which return all the non-deleted 
documents with a score of 1
This is also very useful to search queries like 'field1:not word' (the 
documents which doesn't contain 'word')
I needed this class only for debugging purpose so I didn't work a lot on 
it and it'll be better to write it on your own to have something clean.
