Checkout for "http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/j-lucene/"
Though this page does not list a comparison between SAX and Digester, it
convinced me enough to use Digester

Subject: XML parsing using Lucene in Java


Dear Fellow Lucene Developers:

I am a java/jsp developer and have started learning lucene for the
purpose of creating a search engine for some books that I have in xml
format.  The XML document is actually quite large, and would like to
provide as accurate results as possible to the user searching through
these books.  My question is, which xml parser do you recommend using,
SAX or Digester?  Is there a difference?  Does one parser provide better
results than the other?  What about performance issues?

Any help that you can provide is greatly appreciated.  I look forward to
hearing from you soon.

Take care.
Sincerely;
Fayyaz
