Ah! There are so many ways to do this as there are so many questions
unanswered in your mail.

What kind of load balancer are you going to install?
Will you be replicating the complete lucene index on both the servers?
Do you plan to use the MultiSearcher/ParellelMultiSearcher?
Do these servers share a common domain name eg. server1.mydomain.com &
server2.mydomain.com?
How and where do you store the user search history (is it in the cookies
itself?)

Anyhow, simply put, if 
1. your servers share a common domin name with different subdomain
2. you store user info in the cookies &
3. both servers will render results directly to the end user
You could solve your problem easily by using a domain based cookie
rather than a server based cookie.

Ie. Instead of setting the cookie access for a server (eg.
server1.mydomain.com), set it for the domain (eg. .mydomain.com, don't
forget the "dot" before the domain name).

between two load balanaced lucene search servers..


Hi Everyone,

We are planning on scaling our current web server by adding a machine
with similar specification. Both machine will be running lucene
searches. What we plan to do is add a load balancer in front of these
servers. Our requirement is to be able to share user info (user search
history, etc.), cookies etc between these two servers. What is the best
way to load balance two or more lucene search server and share session
and cookie information between these servers?

Our current server has 8 GB of RAM and size of the index is around 8GB
(contains around 3M+ records) as well. Any more info about current
server environment will be provided upon request.

Thank you all.

Kumar
