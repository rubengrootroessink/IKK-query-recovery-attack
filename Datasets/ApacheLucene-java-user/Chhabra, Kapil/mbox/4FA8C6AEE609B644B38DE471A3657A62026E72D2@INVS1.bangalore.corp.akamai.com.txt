Hi Shakti,

> I am using Searching is taking a lot of time.
What do you mean by a lot of time? How much time is it taking? 
There are a lot of factors that affect the search speed.

> The size of the folder where I am keeping the index files is 160 MB
containing 3277 documents.
That's not too much. If you are doing things right, search should not
take much time.

> How can I improve the performance of searching?
Go through this:

Hope this helps!

Best Regards,

Hi all,

I am using Searching is taking a lot of time.

The size of the folder where I am keeping the index files is 160 MB
containing 3277 documents.

 

I am using... 

query = parser.parse("ANY");

hits = searcher.search(query);

 

How can I improve the performance of searching?

 

Regards

Shakti Sareen
