public final int id(int n)

    Returns the id for the nth document in this set. Note that ids may
change when the index changes, so you cannot rely on the id to be
stable.

I need to use getTermFreqVector on a subset of docs that belong to the
hits for a query. I understand I need to pass the docNumber as an
argument in this case. How do I access that.

For ex .

doc = hits.doc(0);
TermFreqVector vector = reader.getTermFreqVector(docId, "field");


How do I get docId?
