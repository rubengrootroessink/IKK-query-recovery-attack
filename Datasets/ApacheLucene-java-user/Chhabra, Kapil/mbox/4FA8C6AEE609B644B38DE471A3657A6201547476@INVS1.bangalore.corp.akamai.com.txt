What is the structure of your index?
If you havnt already, then add a new field to your index that stores the
contractId. For all other fields, set the "store" flag to false while
indexing.

You can now safely retrieve the value of this contractId field based on
your search results.

Hi all,

   Can I get just a list of document Ids given a search criteria ? To
elaborate here is my situation:

I store 20000 contracts in the file system index each with some
parameterName and Value. Given a search criterion -
(paramValue='draft'). I
need to get just an ArrayList of Strings containing contract Ids. I dont
need the lucene documents, just the Ids.

Can this be done ?

-thanks
