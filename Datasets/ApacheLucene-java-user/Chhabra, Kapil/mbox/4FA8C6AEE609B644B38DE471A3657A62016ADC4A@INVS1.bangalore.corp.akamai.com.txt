Hi,
Yes there are ways and workarounds to remove duplicates based on one
field. But, you should not need this if you don't index duplicates at
the first place. Just put a call to "delete" from index right before you
add the document to in.

Best Regards,

Hello
i would like to implement a suggest implementation (like google suggest)
using lucene. i actually tried using lucene and it was successfull but i
was stuck in some point which is returning a list of results to the user
that have no duplicates. my question is: is there any way i can remove
duplicates with that r returned from the search in the hits or i should
manage it manually ??


thanks in advance


Yours 

Heba
