I don't think that there is any other way out apart from re-indexing in
all-small or all-caps case(through an Analyzer or externally), and then
searching in the same case as you used while indexing.
Even if you find a way by which you can run case insensitive searches, I
am sure it'll add to the complexity at the search time.
QueryFilter is used to filter down the search results and I doubt if
it'll solve your problem.

Hi all, my lucene index is prepared for search, but I forgot to change
all the english word to lower case. When I search, I have to type the
same case as in lucene index. I found that QueryFilter may solve the
problem, but it seems that it's used for filter query, not the lucene
index. How do I ignore the case in lucene index?
