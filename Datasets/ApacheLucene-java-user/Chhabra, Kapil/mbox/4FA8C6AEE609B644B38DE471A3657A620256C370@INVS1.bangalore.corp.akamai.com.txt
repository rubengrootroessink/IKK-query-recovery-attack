SUBJECT: RE: neither IndexWriter nor IndexReader would delete documents
DATE: 19 Nov 2007

Hi,
Checkout for the following lines in the documentation of IndexReader:

* "An IndexReader can be opened on a directory for which an IndexWriter
is opened already, but it cannot be used to delete documents from the
index then. "
* "Once a document is deleted it will not appear in TermDocs or
TermPostitions enumerations. Attempts to read its field with the
document(int)  method will result in an error. The presence of this
document may still be reflected in the
docFreq(org.apache.lucene.index.Term) statistic, though this will be
corrected eventually as the index is further modified."

Hope this helps.

Regards,
kapilChhabra

Subject: neither IndexWriter nor IndexReader would delete documents


Hallo *;

I went through some examples of the Lucene in Action book to find that
the API has changed and then applied the corrections with the help of
this forum.
One runtime problem however remains. I cannot delete any documents.
I store documents like this:

IndexWriter iw = new IndexWriter(
	new File(Constants.INDEX_FILENAME), new StandardAnalyzer());
Document document = new Document(); ...
document.add(new Field("doc", doc, Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.NO));
iw.addDocument(document); iw.optimize(); iw.close(); 

Which works fine. But deleting them like this:

Directory fsDir = FSDirectory.getDirectory(new File(
	Constants.INDEX_FILENAME));
IndexReader ir = IndexReader.open(fsDir); ir.deleteDocuments(new
Term("uid", uid)); ir.close();

Has absolutely no effect. I also tried delete on the IndexWriter - no
effect.
Please help! I don't know where to investigate any further!

Thx Eric
