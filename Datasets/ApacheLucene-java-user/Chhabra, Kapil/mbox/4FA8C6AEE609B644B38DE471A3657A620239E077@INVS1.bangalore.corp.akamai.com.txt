If its only about the search, you could have "section" as just another field in your index.
You could simply search on work as "well" as "section".

Otherwise, if you are looking at aggregating category hits, then look at http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200605.mbox/%3c200605221252.k4MCqCuf017313@pigeon.ciao.com%3e

Subject: Lucene search question

Hello all, 

I don't know if this is a somehow naive question, but here we go:

Does Lucene support index by sections? Like having a text document with three sections divided
by XML tags indexed in a way we could do a search by work and section. Does Lucene itself
support this kind of indexing or should it be used with other engines like Cocoon?

Thanks in advance for your time,
