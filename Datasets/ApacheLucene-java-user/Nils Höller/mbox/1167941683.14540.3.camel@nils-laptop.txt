SUBJECT: getting the maximum Hits doc
DATE: 4 Jan 2007

Hi,

this is a short beginner question:

I am searching for something in my program
Hits hits = MySearcher.search(queryStr, searchRes.indexPath); 

Now I only want the Document with the highest score.

Is there a better way, then iterating through all hits?
The Hits objects seems to be not sorted.

Thanks for your help

Nils
