SUBJECT: multiple clients?
DATE: 16 Jun 2002

Hi

I have a web application deployed in a cluster of resin servers. Since
Lucene works on a file system, do I need to mount a central drive on the
machines with resin?

Is there a way I can install Lucene in a central PC, and all clients from
resin call a remote method (eg RMI) to perform a search?

Any feedback would be appreciated.

Regards
Keith
