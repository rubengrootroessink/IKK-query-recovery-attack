I think it's very close. There are a couple of outstanding issues:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&sorter/order=DESC&sorter/field=priority&resolution=-1&pid=12310110&fixfor=12312531

We're working hard to get those resolved and 2.3 out of the door very soon.
