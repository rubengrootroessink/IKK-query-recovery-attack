The behavior you want was last sighted in Java Lucene four releases ago
(v1.4.3).

See Doug Cutting's response to a similar request:

<http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-dev/200602.mbox/%3C43FC80B3.5090606@apache.org%3E>

In short, although the behavior you want might eventually be restored in
future releases through diligence on your part, it would almost
certainly have to be expressed using a different syntax.
