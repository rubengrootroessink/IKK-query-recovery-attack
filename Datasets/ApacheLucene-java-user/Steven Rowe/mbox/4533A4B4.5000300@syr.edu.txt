To achieve high recall, can't you just stem terms both when indexing and
when querying?

The only reasons I can think of not to do so are to support both
high-precision and high-recall queries with the same index, or to give
greater weight to exact-match documents than to stemmed-match documents
within a single query.  If either of these is the case, you could
maintain two fields (one stemmed and one non-stemmed) or two indexes,
and choose which field/index to use (reason #1) or combine the two in a
single query (reason #2).

Actually, now that I think about it more, two indexes for reason #2
(i.e., stemmed match as fallback if exact match fails) would be tricky,
due to issues with fusion of search results -- better to use two fields
in a single index for this case.
