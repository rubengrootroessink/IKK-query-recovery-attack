Hi,

I don't know how to access the CA certificate for the web server at
javacc.dev.java.net - my browser automatically does this for me.

Here's an alternate route - I found another javacc-4.0.zip at another
location, and the file I downloaded from there yesterday matched exactly
the version I got from javacc.dev.java.net:

http://atlas.ucpel.tche.br/~dubois/compiladores/javacc-4.0.zip

Good luck,
Steve
