The trunk (a.k.a. "HEAD") is quite stable and usable (with *both* 1.4
and 1.5 JVMs) as it is right now.  You can download a nightly trunk
build (roughly corresponding to the "2.1-dev" javadocs you see on the
website) here:

<http://people.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/nightly/>

The next release will be 2.1.0, unless bugfixes are applied to the 2.0.0
release, and then released as 2.0.1, but this now looks pretty unlikely
-- see the (long-unacted-on) 2.0.1 release proposal on the java-dev
mailing list here:

<http://www.nabble.com/2.0.1-release-----was-Re%3A-Web-search-demo-does-not-work-tf2007758.html>.

In a recent (and long-running) discussion about moving the minimum
supported JVM version from 1.4 to 1.5, it was proposed that the 2.1
release be the point at which Lucene makes this switch.  The most recent
proposal on the subject by Doug Cutting, the Lucene FCG (founder and
chief guru), however, is that Java Lucene would switch to supporting
Java 1.5 features when a GCJ release supports those features, so the
Lucene 2.1 release may not be the target for switching to Java 1.5; see:
