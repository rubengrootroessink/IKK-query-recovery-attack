Hi Divya,

The Lucene library itself provides no support for "backup".

You might be interested in the Solr project[1], which extends Lucene,
and which automates index replication.  From the Solr Introduction /
Features page[2]:

  Replication
    *  Efficient distribution of index parts that have changed via rsync
transport
    * Pull strategy allows for easy addition of searchers
    * Configurable distribution interval allows tradeoff between
timeliness and cache utilization
