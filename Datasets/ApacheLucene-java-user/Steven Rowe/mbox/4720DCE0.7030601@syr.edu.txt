Your code uses an obsolete static version of QueryParser.parse().  That
method was deprecated in Lucene Java release 1.9.0, and was then removed
in release 2.0.0.

You should instead instantiate a QueryParser instance, supplying the
field name and analyzer to the constructor, and then call the
parse(String query) instance method.

Here is the 2.2.0 javadoc for QueryParser:
