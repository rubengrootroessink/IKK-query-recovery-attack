 Thanks

You could make an aggregate field that contains all of the terms from
fields F1..Fm, and then search exclusively against it, requiring each
term to appear.

The alternative, in which you automate spelling out all of the
combinations, won't scale to a large field set or to a large term set.
But if you can guarantee that both are small (cardinality <= 3, maybe?),
then it might be feasible.
