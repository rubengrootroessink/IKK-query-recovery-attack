Conceptually (caveat: untested), you could:

1. Extend Filter[1] (call it DejaVuFilter) to hold a BitSet per
IndexReader.  The BitSet would hold one bit per doc[2], each initialized
to true.

2. Unset a DejaVuFilter instance's bit for each of your top N docs by
walking the TopDocs returned by Searcher.search(Query,Filter,int)[3].
Initially, you could pass in null for the Filter, and then for all
following calls, an instance of DejaVuFilter.

3. Repeat step #2 as many times as necessary.
