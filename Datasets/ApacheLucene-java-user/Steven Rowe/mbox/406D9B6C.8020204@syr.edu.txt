Phil,

If you *really* want exact matching against documents, you could put the
document content into a keyword field (that is, one field per doc, with
no tokenization), then search with your query as a single term, rather
than tokenized into separate terms.  This way, you're guaranteed a match
only if the match is complete and exact.

Of course, if you don't *really* mean exact matching (e.g., if you want
to allow multiple spaces between words, or for newlines to substitute
for spaces, etc.), then you'll have to find a different solution.
