I don't think you need to register - I am not registered and I can
download from there.

My guess is that Mahdi Rahimi's browser doesn't know how to speak the
HTTPS protocol.

Here's an invocation of wget (I have version 1.10.2) that works for me
to get the .zip archive (all on one line):

wget --no-check-certificate
https://javacc.dev.java.net/files/documents/17/26777/javacc-4.0.zip

Or if you want the .tar.gz archive:

wget --no-check-certificate
https://javacc.dev.java.net/files/documents/17/26776/javacc-4.0.tar.gz
