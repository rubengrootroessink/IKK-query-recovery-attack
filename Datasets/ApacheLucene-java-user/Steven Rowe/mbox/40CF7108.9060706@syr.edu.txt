Kevin,

I think that this sort of thing should be built on top of the 
functionality provided by the binary fields proposal, or at least made 
to work with it:

<URL:http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29370>

This would take care of the blob-vs.-text aspect of your proposal.

It's a bad idea to use the zero-parameter version of String.getBytes() 
(for example, what if you want to share an index between two platforms 
with different DEFAULT system char encodings?).  Fortunately, there's a 
better alternative: for the suprisingly low price of 
"String.getBytes(String charsetName)", platform independence can be 
yours today.
