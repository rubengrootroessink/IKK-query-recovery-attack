Section 4.6 of GospodnetiÄ‡ & Hatcher's excellent _Lucene_in_Action_[1]
describes a SynonymAnalyzer class, intended for use at indexing time
(AFACT, however, their approach does not address multi-word synonyms).
Although a query-time analyzer is not directly discussed, they do say
(on p. 134):

   The awkwardly named PhrasePrefixQuery (see section 5.2)
   is one option to consider, perhaps created through an
   overridden QueryParser.getFieldQuery method; this is a
   possible option to explore if you wish to implement
   synonym injection at query time.
