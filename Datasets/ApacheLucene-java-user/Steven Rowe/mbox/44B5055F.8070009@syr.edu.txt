Hi Sudarshan,

When your question is Java usage related, you will almost certainly get 
better responses by asking just on the Java User list.  Oddly enough, 
hitting all of the mailing lists for the project at once with the same 
question is likely to *reduce* your chances of getting polite/on-topic 
responses.

To index PDF files, you need to first extract their content, and Lucene 
does not do this for you.  Here is the Lucene FAQ entry on the topic:

<http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/LuceneFAQ#head-c45f8b25d786f4e384936fa93ce1137a23b7e422>

Chapter 7 of the excellent book Lucene in Action 
<http://lucenebook.com/> also covers this topic.

Once you have extracted the text for a document, you'll want to store a 
key for the document in a separate field in your Lucene index.  Then 
when you have hits from a search, you'll be able to use the DB key to 
retrieve the PDF blob from Oracle, then maybe save the it to a temp file 
and start Adobe Reader to display the doc(s).  Or something like that.
