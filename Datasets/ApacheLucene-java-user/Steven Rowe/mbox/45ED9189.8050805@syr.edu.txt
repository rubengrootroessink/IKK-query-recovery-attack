Your query is behaving as it should - since the "content" field in both
docs contains "mybook", they both match.

Although you say you want to avoid duplication in the index, I think you
already know what to do (you wrote "I want to get search results of all
docs where field1's value is 'mybook'") - index "field1" to make it
directly queryable.  If the information really needs to be distinct to
query properly, then make it so.

And if the index gets too large, you can try removing the duplication
from the "content" field, and include the other fields in your queries.
