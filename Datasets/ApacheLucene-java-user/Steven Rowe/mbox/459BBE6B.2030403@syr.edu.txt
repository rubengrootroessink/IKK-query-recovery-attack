I'm having trouble visualizing both what your documents and your queries
look like.  Can you please provide more concrete information?
Sometimes, actual code helps.

For example, how do actors, movies and genres relate to your documents?
 Do you have some external source(s) of information (i.e. external to
your Lucene index) that relate actors to movies?  And movies to genres?

If actors, movies and genres are supposed to be a metaphor for what
you're "really" representing, then you'll have to extend your metaphor a
little bit to make sense (for "me" anyway) of what you're trying to "do".

Steve
