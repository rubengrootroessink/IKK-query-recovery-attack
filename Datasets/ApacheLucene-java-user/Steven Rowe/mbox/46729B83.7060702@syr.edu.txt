What follows assumes that the "+(...)" wraps the user input, and is your
attempt to work around the exclusively-negative-query problem.

You can directly use MatchAllDocsQuery[1], or you can use Yonik Seeley's
fix to allow this kind of thing in QueryParser syntax[2] (the "*:*"
construct, which inserts a MatchAllDocsQuery for you), first available
in release 2.1 -- something like "*:* -x:y" should do the trick for you.

Did the *:* construct ever make it into the docs?  I see the patch for
LUCENE-723 doesn't contain any doc changes.  This should be mentioned in
the QP syntax documentation[3], shouldn't it?  And I think Daniel Noll
is right, this looks like an FAQ.
