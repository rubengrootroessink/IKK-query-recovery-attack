Following is quoted from: Krovetz, R. & Croft, W. B. (1992) Lexical
Ambiguity and Information Retrieval. ACM Transactions on Information
Systems, 10(2): 115-141.

    Many retrieval systems represent documents and queries
    by the words they contain, and base the comparison on
    the number of words they have in common. The more
    words the query and document have in common, the
    higher the document is ranked; this is referred to as
    a "coordination match."  Performance is improved by
    weighting query and document words using frequency
    information from the collection and individual
    document texts [27].
