You could:

1. Make your Lucene Document be a set of three sentences (before, 
searchable, after), which you store, but write a custom Analyzer which 
only returns tokens for the "searchable" central sentence.

2. Store the full document contents outside of Lucene, and make your 
Lucene Document be a single sentence, the tokens from which you will 
index, but also include offset and length Fields for the previous and 
next sentences with the Document, corresponding to the windows from the 
full document that you want to display with the hit.  This one will 
likely work better with the Highlighter package.
