See my response to a similar question here:
<http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200510.mbox/%3c435D44FA.6050702@syr.edu%3e>

In short, an indexing-side workaround was once applied and then 
retracted to the code base, but a query-side fix is also required, and 
has yet to be applied.
