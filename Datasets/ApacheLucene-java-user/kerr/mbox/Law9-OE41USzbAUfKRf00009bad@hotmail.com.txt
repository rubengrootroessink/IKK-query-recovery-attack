SUBJECT: Try to use Lucene for database
DATE: 14 May 2003

hi all,
recently, I try to use lucene as a full text search engine for defined fields, mostly are
blob type, in database. A table, like "create table indexfields( tablename varchar(20),  keyname
 varchar(100), field  varchar(20));"  to define any field I want to index, then look each
field as a file. Then it works. But can't incremental update, because the changing of data
in database don't have a last-modified sign. So I think it's useless. Anyone have better way.
Thanks.
