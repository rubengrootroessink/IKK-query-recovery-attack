DATE: 20 Sep 2005

Hi,
I am a newbie to lucene but I guess the IOException will occur only in 
windows as window os doesn't close the files properly.  It shud work 
fine in Linux.
I had a similar problem when recreating the same index. The approach I 
took was to delete all documents and start adding new ones, instead of 
overwriting the index.
