SUBJECT: Managing MultiReader in multi-treaded application
DATE: 7 Feb 2010

Hi,


I'm trying run a scenario in which I have one index writer and several
readers. I use the MultiReader for searching on several indexes.
The application is multi-threaded so the MultiReader is accessed from
several threads sequentialy.


In some stage during the run I get AlreadyClosedException: this IndexReader
is closed


I wanted an advise about best practices running such a scenario.

Should I use the IncRef and the DecRef for managing the MultiReader
references?

I would be grateful if I could get some advice on this.

Thanks,

Dmitri
