SUBJECT: multiple keyword fields vs. multiple-token field
DATE: 28 Nov 2006

I have documents that can be referred to by multiple identifiers (and I want
to store the identifiers separate from the main indexed content).  I'm
wondering if I should put each identifier in it's own keyword field, or have
one tokenized field with all of the identifiers in it.  What I'm talking
about is something like this:

"Identifier" is a keyword field
Add field Identifier="ABCD"
Add field Identifier="WXYZ"

Or

Identifiers is a tokenized, indexed, unstored field
Add field Identifiers="ABCD WXYZ"

It would seem that either would work, but I was wondering if there was a
"standard" way or if anybody had thoughts on relative advantages or
disadvantages (or is it half of one/six dozen of the other and I should just
pick one and go with it).

Michael.
