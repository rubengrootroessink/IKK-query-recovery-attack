Hi,

as follow-up:

google found the post for me:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200112.mbox/%3c002f01c17b49$75b50070$1573a8c0@marc%3e

The sources are attached.

As for one question I received: I have no idea what licence the code is intended to have.

I guess it is kind of free since it was posted on the mailing list. But that's nothing you

want to depend on..

The post originates in 2001, but maybe it's worth to contact the author (Marc Kramis). His

mail is included in the post.

Cheers
   Tobias
