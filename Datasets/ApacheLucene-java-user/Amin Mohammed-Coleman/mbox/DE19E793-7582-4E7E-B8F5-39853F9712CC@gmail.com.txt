Somewhat embarrassingly I can't seem to reproduce the problem anymore!  I've tried to reproduce
it for the last hour now and no luck.  Sorry about that. If it happens again then I'll post
back to the list.

Thanks for your time.

i simulated a user calling the add method 10 times and then in a separate method call invoked
commit.   The thing I noticed when i turned the verbose setting for the IndexWriter was:
