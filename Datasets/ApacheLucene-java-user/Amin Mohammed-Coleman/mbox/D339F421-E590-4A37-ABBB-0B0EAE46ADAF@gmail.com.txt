SUBJECT: Wildcard Case Sensitivity
DATE: 20 Jan 2011

Hi

Apologies up front if this question has been asked before.

I have a document which contains a field that stores an untokenized value such as TEST_TYPE.
 The analyser used is StandardAnalyzer and I pass the same analyzer into the query.  I perform
the following query : fieldName:TEST_*, however this does not return any results.  Is this
the expected behaviour?  Can I use capital letters in my wildcard query or do i need to do
some processing before passing it to the query parser? 


Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Amin
