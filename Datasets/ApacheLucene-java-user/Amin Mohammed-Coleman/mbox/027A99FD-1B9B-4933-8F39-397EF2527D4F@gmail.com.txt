Hi

I'll explain my use case more and then explain the out come of my implementation:

I have lucene documents that look like this:


Field name           Field Value
dataId                     TYX-CC-124
category                CATEGORY A


What I would like to do is for a given collection of dataIds I'd like to get it's corresponding
category.  The collection of ids that will be passed into my method will vary.  Also the id
prefix (TYX-CC) will be different for different groups invoking my method.  For example I
may have ids that look like below:

TX-CC-124
AVC-FF-124

and so on.

So I tried sorting the list of ids before creating the range query based on the numeric part
of the id. This did not work as the number of ids returned from the query was greater than
the input ids.  

You mentioned padding the number part of the ids but will that work in the case of the following:

aa-01
bb-01

If pass in aa-01 as the lower range, the query will return the result for bb-01 as well (unless
I have mis understood the usage of the range query).   

In order to get things moving i decided to create a boolean query and essentially batch the
queries to avoid hitting too many clause exception.   So for each 1000 ids I create a boolean
query with the ids being passed in.   This may not be the best approach but I can't seem to
get my head around how the range query can be used considering the numeric part of the id
is essentially not unique.  


Thanks
Amin
