SUBJECT: Re: Faceted Search using Lucene
DATE: 24 Feb 2009

Hi
I have been able to get the code working for my scenario, however I have a
question and I was wondering if I could get some help.  I have a list of
IndexSearchers which are used in a MultiSearcher class.  I use the
indexsearchers to get each indexreader and put them into a MultiIndexReader.

IndexReader[] readers = new IndexReader[searchables.length];

for (int i =0 ; i < searchables.length;i++) {

IndexSearcher indexSearcher = (IndexSearcher)searchables[i];

readers[i] = indexSearcher.getIndexReader();

    IndexReader newReader = readers[i].reopen();

if (newReader != readers[i]) {

readers[i].close();

}

readers[i] = newReader;



}

 multiReader = new MultiReader(readers);

OpenBitSetFacetHitCounter facetHitCounter = new OpenBitSetFacetHitCounter();

IndexSearcher indexSearcher = new IndexSearcher(multiReader);


I then use the indexseacher to do the facet stuff.  I end the code with
closing the multireader.  This is causing problems in another method where I
do some other search as the indexreaders are closed.  Is it ok to not close
the multiindexreader or should I do some additional checks in the other
method to see if the indexreader is closed?



Cheers


P.S. Hope that made sense...!
