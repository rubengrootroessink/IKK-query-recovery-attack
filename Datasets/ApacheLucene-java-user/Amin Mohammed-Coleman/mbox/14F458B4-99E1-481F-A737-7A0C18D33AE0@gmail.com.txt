SUBJECT: Indexing and Searching Web Application
DATE: 19 Jan 2009

Hi

I have recently worked on developing an application which allows you  
to upload a file (which is indexed so you can search later).  I have  
numerous tests to show that you can index and search documents (in  
some instances within the same test), however when I perform the  
operation in the site:

1) Upload File and Index
2) Search

I don't get any hits.  When I restart the application then if I make  
another search I can find the results.  It seems as though indexes  
aren't being committed when I do the initial upload.  This is  
strange.  I explicitly call commit in my code when I upload the file.   
Has anyone experienced this before?

Any help would be appreciated.

Kind Regards

Amin
