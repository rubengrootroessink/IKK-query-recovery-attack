HI Erick
Thanks for your reply, glad to see I'm not the only person
working/developing on a Sunday!  I'm not sure how the FieldSortedHitQueue
works and how it can be applied to the search method exposed by
MultiSearcher.  Would it be possible to clarify abit more or even point to
some reference documentation?

Cheers
Amin
