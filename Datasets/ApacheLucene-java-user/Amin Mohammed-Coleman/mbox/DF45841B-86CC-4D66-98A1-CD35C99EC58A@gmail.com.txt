Hi Erick

Thanks for your reply.

I have used luke to inspect the document and I am some what confused.   
For example when I view the index using the overview tab of Luke I get  
the following:

1	body	test
1	id	1234
1	name	rtfDocumentToIndex.rtf
1	path	rtfDocumentToIndex.rtf
1	summary	This is a
1	type	RTF_INDEXER
1	body	rtf


However when I view the document in the Document tab I get the full  
text that was extracted from the rft document (field:body) which is:

This is a test rtf document that will be indexed.

I am using the StandardAnaylzer therefore I wouldnt expect the words  
document, indexed, Amin Mohammed-Coleman to be removed.

I have referenced the Lucene In Action book and I can't see what I may  
be doing wrong.  I would be happy to provide a testcase should it be  
required.  When adding the body field to the document I am doing:

	Document document = new Document();
			Field field = new Field(FieldNameEnum.BODY.getDescription(),  
bodyText.trim(), Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.ANALYZED);
			document.add(field);
		


When I run the search code the string "test" is the only word that  
returns a result (TopDocs), whereas the others do not (e.g. "amin",  
"document", "indexed").

Thanks again for your help and advice.


Cheers
Amin
