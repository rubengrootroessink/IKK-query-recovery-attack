SUBJECT: Re: Indexing and Searching Web Application
DATE: 19 Jan 2009

I make a call to my search class which looks like this:


public Summary[] search(SearchRequest searchRequest) {
		List<Summary> summaryList = new ArrayList<Summary>();
		StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch("searchStopWatch");
		stopWatch.start();
		MultiSearcher multiSearcher = null;
		try {
			multiSearcher = new MultiSearcher(searchers.toArray(new  
IndexSearcher[] {}));
			QueryParser queryParser = new  
MultiFieldQueryParser(FieldNameEnum.fieldNameDescriptions(), analyzer);
			Query query = queryParser.parse(searchRequest.getSearchTerm());
			
			//TODO: Sort and Filters
			
			TopDocs topDocs = multiSearcher.search(query, 100);
			ScoreDoc[] scoreDocs = topDocs.scoreDocs;
			LOGGER.debug("total number of hits for [" + query.toString() + " ]  
= " +topDocs.totalHits);
			
			for (ScoreDoc scoreDoc : scoreDocs) {
				final Document doc = multiSearcher.doc(scoreDoc.doc);
				float score = scoreDoc.score;
				final BaseDocument baseDocument = new BaseDocument(doc, score);
				Summary documentSummary = new DocumentSummaryImpl(baseDocument);
				summaryList.add(documentSummary);
			}
			
		} catch (Exception e) {
			throw new IllegalStateException(e);
		}
		stopWatch.stop();
		
		LOGGER.debug("total time taken for seach: " +  
stopWatch.getTotalTimeMillis() + " ms");
		return summaryList.toArray(new Summary[] {});
	}

Do I need to do this explicitly?


Cheers
Amin
