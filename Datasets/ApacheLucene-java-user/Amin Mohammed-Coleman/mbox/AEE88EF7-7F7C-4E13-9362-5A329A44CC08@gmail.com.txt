Hi

Apologies for re sending this email but I was just wondering if any one might be able to advise
on the below. I'm not sure if I've provided enough info. 

Again any help would be appreciated.

for indexing.  The 2 methods primarily used is add and commit. So the user can send requests
for documents to be added to the index and then can call commit.  I did a test where i simulated
a user calling the add method 10 times and then in a separate method call invoked commit.
  The thing I noticed when i turned the verbose setting for the IndexWriter was:

I get no exception.  So I was wondering what is the best setting for the mergeFactor, and
should i be experiencing this exception after requesting a commit after adding 10 documents
to the index?
