SUBJECT: Pagination with MultiSearcher
DATE: 15 Mar 2009

Hi

I'm looking at trying to implement pagination for my search project.  
I've been google-ing for a solution. So far no luck. I've seen  
implementations of HitCollector which looks promising, however my  
search method has to completely change.

For example I'm currently using the following:

search ( query, filter,int, sort)

If I use a HitCollector there isn't a search to apply  
query,hitcollector,sort and filter, unless I'm supposed to apply sort  
and filter in the hit collector.

I would be grateul if anyone could advise me what approach to take.

One a side note I just want to thank you all for helping me with many  
of my issues. I'm hoping this is my last question!  Thanks for your  
patience!


Cheers

Amin
