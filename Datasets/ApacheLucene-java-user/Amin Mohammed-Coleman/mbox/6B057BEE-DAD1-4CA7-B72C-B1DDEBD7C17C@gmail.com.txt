Hi Erick

Thanks for your response.  I used the Lucene in Action 1st edition as a reference for batch
indexing. I've just got my copy of the 2nd edition which mentions that there is no point in
using RAM directory.  Not saying I don't trust you :).

I'll update my code to use the normal fs directory for batch.


Thanks
Amin
