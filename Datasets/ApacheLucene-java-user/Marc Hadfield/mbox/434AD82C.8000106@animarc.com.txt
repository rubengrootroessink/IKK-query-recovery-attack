Hi Doug, thanks for your reply,

I actually mention your option in my email:

ie Field_B = full text interlaced with "types" following each full text 
token with positionIncrement=0

However, as far as I understand, the standard TermQuery won't let me 
check if "Johnson" and "__name__" occur at the **same** position.  
Perhaps, as I ask above, a SpanQuery will allow multiple terms with a 
distance of zero (0) , that is they were indexed with 
positionIncrement=0 and SpanQuery can handle 0 distance terms?
