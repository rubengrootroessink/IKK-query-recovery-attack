hello -

a fuzzy query related question:

has there been any other implementations of "fuzzy" queries other than 
edit-distance?  and/or modifications of edit-distance to less penalize 
common alternate spellings? - i.e. "couldn't" vs. "couldnt" -- here the 
apostrophe would get a smaller penalty than character mismatch.

i'm thinking specifically of the algorithms in the SecondString open 
source package:
http://secondstring.sourceforge.net/

what do you think the difficulty would be to wrap an alternate algorithm 
that provides a:
float score(String1, String2)
function?
