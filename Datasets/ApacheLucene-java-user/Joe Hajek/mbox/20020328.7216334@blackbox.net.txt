Hi,

thats interesting. if you do a Field.Text(String name, Reader value) it should be indexed
but not stored. strange i had no problems, but i didnt use a stringreader, just file readers.

try to do create your customized field, passing a string that is not stored. i dont remember
the documentation exactly, but this should be possible passing the right parameters to the
field constructor.

regards joe
