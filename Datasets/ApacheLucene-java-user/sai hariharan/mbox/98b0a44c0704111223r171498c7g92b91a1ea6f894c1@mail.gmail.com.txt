SUBJECT: Term frequency
DATE: 11 Apr 2007

Hi,
I've just started using Lucene. Can anybody assist me in calculating
the term frequencies of the terms(words) that occur in a document(*.txt),
when a particular doc is submitted.

Say when i submit sample.txt , i should first analyze the document
with a standard anlyzer, then the term frequencies should be calculated
for each and every term in that document.

Thanks in advance
