Overview
--------

Over 90 percent of all microprocessors are now used for real-time and
embedded applications, and the behavior of many of these applications
is constrained by the physical world. Higher-level programming
languages and middleware are needed to robustly and productively
design, implement, compose, integrate, validate, and enforce
real-time constraints along with conventional functional requirements
and reusable components. It is essential that the production of
real-time embedded systems can take advantage of languages, tools,
and methods that enable higher software productivity. The Java
programming language has become an attractive choice because of its
safety, productivity, its relatively low maintenance costs, and the
availability of well trained developers.

Although it features good software engineering characteristics,
standard Java is unsuitable for developing real-time embedded
systems, mainly due to under-specification of thread scheduling and
the presence of garbage collection. These problems are addressed by
the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ). The intent of this
specification is the development of real-time applications by
providing several additions such as extending the Java memory model
and providing stronger semantics in thread scheduling.

Interest in real-time Java in both the research community and
industry has recently increased significantly, because of its
challenges and its potential impact on the development of embedded
and real-time applications. The goal of the proposed workshop is to
gather researchers working on real-time and embedded Java to identify
the challenging problems that still need to be solved in order to
assure the success of real-time Java as a technology, and to report
results and experiences gained by researchers.

The following two topics are of special interest:

    * Multiprocessor and distributed real-time Java
    * Verification and validation of real-time Java programs

Nowadays, real-time systems demand more functionality than in
previous years. Consequently the execution platforms are often
multiprocessors or distributed systems. Although the Real-Time
Specification for Java has addressed some multiprocessor issues,
other issues are still outstanding. Furthermore, defining the
appropriate RTSJ abstractions for distributed real-time programming
is still an open topic.

Real-time programs are often components of safety-critical systems. 
Such applications requires thorough validation through testing and 
analysis. In this context there is much research within the areas of 
model checking, abstract interpretation, and other analysis techniques 
that apply to real-time Java in general and in particular the specialised 
Safety Critical Java (SCJ) profile.

Submission Requirements
-----------------------

Participants are expected to submit a paper of at most 10 pages (ACM
Conference Format, i.e., two-columns, 10 point font - see formatting
instructions at http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). 
Accepted papers will be published in the ACM International Conference
Proceedings Series via the ACM Digital Library and have to be presented by
one author at the JTRES.  Papers should be submitted through Easychair.

Papers describing open source projects shall include a description
how to obtain the source and how to run the experiments in the
appendix. The source version for the published paper will be hosted
at the JTRES web site.

Accepted papers will be invited for submission to a special issue of the
Journal on Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience.
