SUBJECT: appendable filed problem
DATE: 29 Oct 2005

Hello,

here is the problem.

I have to index a text contained in some section tags (xml format) like
this:

<section>
.... text ...
</section>

<section>
.... text ...
</section>

<section>
.... text ...
</section>

I want to put all the text contained in the various section in a same field
named "section".
I read that field are appendable (pag 33 of Lucene in Action), so it's easy
just add each extracted text to the same index field "section".
What it happens is not the expected result, as it's said in Lucene in
Action, that is, Lucene doesn't internally appends all the texts together
and index them in a single Field named "section". Or better, it does a
mixture: if I use Luke to see the index, i saw a number of single fields
called "section" each one with the corresponding text.
If i try to retrieve the section field with a simple query, it only returns
me the first text contained in the first "section" field, instead of all the
texts, as if they were indexed in the same field "section".

Instead, if I try to remove the field "section" it removes correctly all
these section fields, as if there was only a single section field.

Where am I wrong?
