SUBJECT: Re: Add unique id to a doc
DATE: 21 Jul 2005

I think maxDoc doesn't sole my problem at all.
Correct me if I am wrong: suppose I have 5 docs in my index, and I
wanto to add one new doc to the index. if I use the maxDoc as the new
unique id for that document I obtain 5 (the first free position,
considering it starts from 0). Now suppose I delete a doc what happen?
there is a reordering of the docs inside the index? I don't know, I am
asking you that. couse if there is a reorder at the next doc to add,
if i call maxdoc this doc receive 5 again and it's not correct. for
that you said db way is safer?
thx
