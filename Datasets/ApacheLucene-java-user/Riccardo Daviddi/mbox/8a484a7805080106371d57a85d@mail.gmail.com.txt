SUBJECT: how to get the snippet?
DATE: 1 Aug 2005

Hy all,

which is the way to get a snippet of a query?
Does Lucene offer some explicit methods?
If is not so, it's possible to know the position of the matched
keyword in the query into the field of the doc, so that I can take
some words before and after the keyword to create the snippet?
Or there is a smarter way to get the snippet?

thx in advance!
