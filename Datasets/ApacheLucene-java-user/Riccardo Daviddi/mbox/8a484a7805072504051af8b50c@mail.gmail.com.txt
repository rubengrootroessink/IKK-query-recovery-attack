SUBJECT: filtering on searching or after through hits?
DATE: 25 Jul 2005

Hi all,
I have to filter my searching in two ways:
1) by score, I want that only docs with score higher than a threshold
are returned.
2) by num of docs, I want that only, for example, the first 20 docs
are returned.

It's better do it with a queryfilter or search for all and after look
through the hits with some conditions?
