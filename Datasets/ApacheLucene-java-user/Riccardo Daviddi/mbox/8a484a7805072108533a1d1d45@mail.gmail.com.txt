SUBJECT: Add unique id to a doc
DATE: 21 Jul 2005

Hi all,

it's possible to set an unique id (as keyword field) to a doc by
looking in the index? I mean, it's possible to look in the index and
know what is the last id (which is a keyword field) and then decide
for the new id to associate to the new indexed doc? Or it's better
store the doc in a db and get so a unique id (the key of the row in
the db) and use it as the unique id for the keyword field in the
index?
