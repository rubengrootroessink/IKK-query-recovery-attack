Thanks for all the advice on this. I did as Doug suggested, and the
indexing completed in around 13 hours, without using an excessive
amount of disk space.

I do have another problem: running multi-user tests - four "users"
all firing off queries one after the other - I hit this exception
at the start of one run:

   caught a class java.io.IOException
   with message: Timed out waiting for
   Lock@E:\Lucene_Index\Index0001\commit.lock

Can anyone explain what's happening here - why does it need a lock
in order to READ the index? Is there something I should be doing different?

Thanks,

Roger
