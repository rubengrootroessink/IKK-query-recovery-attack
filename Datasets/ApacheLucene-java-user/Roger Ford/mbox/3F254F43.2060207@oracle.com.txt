It's not the time I'm worried about, so much as the disk consumption.
It's just failed optimizing 3 million documents with "No space left on
device". That's 100GB it's used!

Given that on my previous 16GB partition it managed 1.5 million rows
before failing, it looks like disk space requirements grow exponentially
with number of documents indexed.  Can anyone comment whether this
should be true?

Believe it or not, this 10 million documents was meant to be a single
partition of a much larger dataset. I'm not sure I'm at liberty to
discuss in detail the data I'm indexing - but it's a massive
geneological database.

I think I'm going to have to limit the set to 2.5 million, and run
my tests on that instead.
