when I do a query.toString(<my default field>), it prints exactly my query.

example: title:FE.MENU*  gives  title:FE.MENU* FE.MENU*  when I search in
the default field and the field 'title'.

the HostFilter I wrote (that tokenizes again HOST tokens) works wonderfully.

PS: thanks Erik

What does query.toString("<default field>") return? This generally has 

a lot of clues on what happened in QueryParser.
