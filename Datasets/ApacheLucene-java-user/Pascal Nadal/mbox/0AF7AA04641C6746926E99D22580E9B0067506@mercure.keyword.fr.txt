SUBJECT: Wildcard search and HOST tokens
DATE: 12 Nov 2003

My lucene indexes contain fields with values like this  www.xxx.yyy.zzz
which are treated as HOST tokens.
My problem is the following : search results never contain documents with
such fields when doing a wildcard query or a fuzzy query. Only searches on
full field values work.
 
example queries: www*  www.* www.xxx* www?xxx?yyy www.yyy.y~ or just yyy
 
I'm using Lucene 1.2 and the StandardAnalyzer. It seems that the '.' is the
problem.
 
Is it a bug ?
 
I wrote a HostFilter class which tokenizes again HOST tokens and it seems to
work fine (full field values or wildcard queries)
