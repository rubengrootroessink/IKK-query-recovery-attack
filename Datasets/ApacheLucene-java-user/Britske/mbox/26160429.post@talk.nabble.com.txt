SUBJECT: merging Parallel indexes (can indexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize be used?)
DATE: 3 Nov 2009


Given two parallel indexes one with slowly changing fields and one with
fields which are updated regularly. 
Is it possible to periodically merge these to form a single index?  (thereby
representing a frozen snapshot in time) 

For example: Can indexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize handle this, or was it
(only) designed for merging shards?
If not, is there another option (3rd party or not) to use, or would I have
to resort to low-level hacking? 

Thanks, 
Geert-Jan
