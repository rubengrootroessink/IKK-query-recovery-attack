SUBJECT: Re: merging Parallel indexes (can indexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize be  used?)
DATE: 4 Nov 2009


Yeah passing in ParallelReader should work. I'll try that thanks!

Probably still going to look into this low-level stuff though. Also because
some indexes I use (Index B in my example) are pretty costly to index at the
moment. At the same time the indexing client has a lot of knowledge about
the documents it's indexing: basically with a little extra coding it could
know very efficiently the inverted indexes of all indexed fields for the
docs it's processing. 

Thus basically it very effciently know the contents of .frq. It just needs
to get it in the correct format.   This would save tremendous amounts of
indexing time. (I'm forgetting .tii .tis for the moment but these should be
relatively easy/ efficient to figure out as well from this date if I'm
correct.) 

I figure Flexible Indexing would give a far better interface for me to plug
this in right? 

Anyway, thanks for the tip. And yes there will be dragons I'm sure ;-) 

Best, 
Geert-Jan
