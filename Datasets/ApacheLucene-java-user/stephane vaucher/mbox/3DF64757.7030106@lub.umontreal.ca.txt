SUBJECT: Accentuated characters
DATE: 10 Dec 2002

Hello everyone,

I wish to implement a TokenFilter that will remove accentuated 
characters so for example 'Ã©' will become 'e'. As I would rather not 
reinvent the wheel, I've tried to find something on the web and on the 
mailing lists. I saw a mention of a contrib that could do this (see 
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user%40jakarta.apache.org/msg02146.html), 
but I don't see anything applicable.

Has anyone done this yet, if so I would much appreciate some pointers 
(or code), otherwise, I'll be happy to contribute whatever I produce 
(but it might be very simple since I'll only need to deal with french).

Cheers,
Stephane
