DATE: 12 Dec 2002

Actually, I'm just looking to remove accentuated chars from java chars 
(so Unicode), only for the search (original doc should stay the same as 
I display), I'll just implement a TokenFilter to do this. It should be 
relatively simple. Just wanted to know if it had already been done 
(perhaps in a generic way).
