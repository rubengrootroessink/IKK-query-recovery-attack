Isn't this extremely ineffecient to do the euclidean distance twice?
Perhaps not a huge deal if a small search result set.  I at times have
13,000 results that match my search terms of an index with 1.2 million docs.

Can't you do some simple radian math first to ensure it's way out of bounds,
then do the euclidian distance for the subset within bounds?  I'm currently
only doing the distance calc once (post hit collector). I don't have any
performance numbers with the double vs single distance calc.

I'm still working out the sort by radius myself.
