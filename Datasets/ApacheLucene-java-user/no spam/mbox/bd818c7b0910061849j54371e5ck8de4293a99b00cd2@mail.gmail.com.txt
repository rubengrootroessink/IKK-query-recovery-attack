Have you investigated using Terracotta / Compass?  We need real-time updates
across the index using multiple web servers.  I recently got this up and
running and we're going to be doing some performance testing.  It's very
easy, essentially you just replace your FSDirectoryProvider with a
TerracottaDirectoryProvider that wraps the compass TerracottaDirectory.
