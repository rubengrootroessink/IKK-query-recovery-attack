SUBJECT: all records within distance -- small index
DATE: 27 Feb 2007

I have a very small index of 500 docs with an index size of < 100k on disk
so far.  I want to whip through the docs and get only the ones within a
lat/lon within radius.  I realize this isn't how lucene wants to do things
(normally query search first) but how can I do this in an efficient manner?
