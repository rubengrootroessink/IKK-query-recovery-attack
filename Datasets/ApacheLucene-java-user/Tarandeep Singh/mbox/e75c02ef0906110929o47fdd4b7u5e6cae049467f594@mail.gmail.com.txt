Hi Amin,

I am also working on similar implementation. But right now I am working on
building Lucene Index in parallel using Hadoop.

How are you building your Lucene index (or indexes) ? Have you tried Hadoop?
If yes, we can share some design issues.

Also, for serving Lucene indexes over cluster, you might be interested in
Katta project-
katta.sourceforge.net
