SUBJECT: Query:Adding all docs at once or creating smaller indexes and merge
DATE: 4 Jun 2009

Hi,

>From efficiency point of view, what will be more efficient-

Creating a single big index (big enough for one machine) by adding all
documents in it at once

or

Creating smaller indexes and then merge them to make one bigger index?

And if there is a performance penalty, then any rough estimate how much?

Thanks,
Tarandeep
