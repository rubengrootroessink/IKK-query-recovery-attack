You mean the index package in Hadoop's contrib folder?
So far what I have understood is Katta is geared more towards Index shards
management and serving. Katta is not bothered how you created your index
shards. Although it provides tools to create index using Hadoop.

Not sure of that but it also depends on your needs. Best would be to index a
subset of your documents and see if it meets yoru requirements, else either
modify the code or write your own code. I am creating my own map reduce jobs
to index documents.
