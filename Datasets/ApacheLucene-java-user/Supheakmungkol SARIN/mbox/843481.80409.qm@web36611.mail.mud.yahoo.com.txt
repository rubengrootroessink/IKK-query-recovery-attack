SUBJECT: Integrated File parser available?
DATE: 18 Jan 2007

Dear all,

I'd like to know whether there exists any integrated JAVA API that we can use to parse most
of today's popular file formats? Currently I have been using one API for one file format and
it's not so convenient.

Thank in advance for your response.

Best regards,

S.S.
