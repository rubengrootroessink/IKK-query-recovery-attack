SUBJECT: Document clustering with Lucene
DATE: 15 May 2008

Dear all,

I'd like to do document clustering using full-text with Lucene. In other words, I would like
to group similar documents in their respective groups. I searched the mailing list and found
that there are two ways around. The first method is to represent the one document as query
and search the collection.  The other way would be to construct the vector of terms of each
of the documents and use the cosine distance function to compute the similarity. I found these
methods here:

- http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg04916.html). 

I would like to know whether there are better way? or any built-in functions to do clustering
in the recent release version of Lucene?

Thank you.

Kind regards,

Supheakmungkol
