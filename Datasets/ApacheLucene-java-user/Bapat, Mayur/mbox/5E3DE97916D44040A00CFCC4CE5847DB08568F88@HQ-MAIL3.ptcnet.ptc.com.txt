SUBJECT: Scoped Search and Facets generation using Lucene
DATE: 14 Nov 2008

Hi,

Does Lucene support Scoped Searches? My intention is to index an XML
String and search for a matching element/attribute value from that XML
by specifying scope(path).
Also is there any direct support for Facets building in Lucene? 

Regards,
Mayur
