SUBJECT: Equal distribution over a field
DATE: 16 Oct 2008


I am using Lucene to search for products in an online-shop with several
shops, brands etc.

Is it possible to sort documents with the same score, in a way that a field
(e.g. the brand field) is equally distributed. Otherwise, the products are
sorted by the appearance of the brands in the database and brands at the end
of the database are at the end of the pagination.

I want to avoid a random order of products...
