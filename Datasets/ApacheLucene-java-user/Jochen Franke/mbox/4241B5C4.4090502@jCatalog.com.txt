SUBJECT: Problem with memory utilisation during Lucene search
DATE: 23 Mar 2005

Hello all,

our web application is currectly executing queries on a Lucene index 
with 6 Mio. records. The memory used by the virtual machine increases up 
to 80MB when a search executed. With eight parallel searches we hit the 
400MB mark.
Because we had some "out of memory" exceptions in the applications
in the last days with 1200MB memory assigned to the virtual machine
my questions are:

1. Is such an extensive memory utilisation normal which an index of this
size or is it an uncommon behaviour? Has anybody made similar experiences?
2. Are there possibilities to restrict or reduce the memory consumption
of Lucene?
3. Does Lucene provide a mechanism to limit the number of concurrent 
searches or must I implement my own wrapper around the search calls
to Lucene?

Thanks
	Jochen
