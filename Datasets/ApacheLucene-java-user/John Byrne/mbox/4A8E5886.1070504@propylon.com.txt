Hi Valery,

I'm inclined to disagree with the idea that a token should not be split 
again downstream. I think that is actually a much easier way to handle 
it. I would have the tokenizer return the longest match, and then split 
it in a token filter. In fact I have dones this before and it has worked 
fine for me.

I think you will have to maintain some state within the token filter 
either way - think about how you'd do that in each case:
-To split longer tokens, you will just have to split the token into a 
list of sub-tokens, then temporarily store these, and return them on 
subsequent calls to the filter. When the list is empty, you get another 
token from the tokenizer.

-To join up shorter tokens, you would have to basically do what he 
original tokenizer did - try to match sequences of characters to patterns.

The second way sounds harder to me, and it's the job of the original 
tokenizer anyway. Do the simplest thing that could possibly work!

Regards,
-John
