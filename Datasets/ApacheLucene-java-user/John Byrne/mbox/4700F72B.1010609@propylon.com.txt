Hi,

Has anyone written an analyzer that preserves puncuation and synmbols 
("Â£", "$", "%" etc.) as tokens?

That way we could distinguish between searching for "100" and "100%" or 
"$100".

Does anyone know of a reason why that wouldn't work? I notice that even 
Google doesn't support that. But I can't think why.

Regards,
John B.
