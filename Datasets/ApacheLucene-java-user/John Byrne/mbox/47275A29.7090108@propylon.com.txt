You can do this by storing the text in an un-tokenized field. This is an 
option when you create the field. use "Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED" as the 
option when you create the field. Then individual terms or phrases will 
not match that field. You will still be able to match it with the exact 
text, a wildcard query, or a range query.

So in your case, if the field contained "foo bar dot" you would not get 
a hit for "foo bar dot alu", but you would for "foo bar dot",  "foo*", 
"f*" or even "*".

Hope that helps!

Regards,
John.
