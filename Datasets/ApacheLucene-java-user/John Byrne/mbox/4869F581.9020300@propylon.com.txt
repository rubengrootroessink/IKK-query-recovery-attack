The QueryParser syntax does not support what you're trying to do. 
However, it is possible to do with the API. If you can construct your 
Query programatically, you can use the SpanQuery API to do what you need.

Proximity searching is achieved using the SpanNearQuery; the constructor 
of this object takes an array of generic SpanQuerys - so you can nest 
SpanQuerys within other SpanQuerys.
