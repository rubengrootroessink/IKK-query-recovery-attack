SUBJECT: case insensitivity

Hi,

I know that case-insensitive searching is normally done by creating an 
all-lower-case version of the documents, and turning the search terms 
into lower case whenever this field is searched, but this approach has 
it's disadvantages.

Let's say, for example, you want to find "Dell" (with a capital "D"), 
near "computers" (with or without capitals, ie. in any case). The 
problem is that you would need to use a SpanQuery to find terms near 
each other; but if the case-sensitivity required is different for each 
term, then they will be in different fields, making the use of 
SpanQuerys inpossible.

There might be ways to work around this, but my question is: will 
case-insensitvity ever be added to Lucene as per-Term option? If not, 
can anyone tell me where I should start looking in order to make this 
change myself?

Thanks!

-JB
