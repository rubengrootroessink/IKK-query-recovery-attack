Hi,

"suspect that [an] is still ignored as a stop word for some reason"

Yes, "an" is still a stop word in English of course! (eg. 'an apple')

Your custom analyzer should work; are you making sure to do both your 
indexing *and* your searching with the new analyzer?

I think making a list of Irish stop words could be tricky, since "an" 
sometimes means "the", but sometimes forms part of a verb (eg. "an 
bhfuil...?")

The safest bet is probably not to bother removing stop words. These days 
it doesn't really affect performance much,storage space is generally not 
much of an issue, and it makes phrase searching more accurate if you 
keep them.
