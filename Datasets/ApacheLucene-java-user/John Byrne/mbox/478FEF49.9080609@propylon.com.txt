SUBJECT: Highlighting marked up documents
DATE: 18 Jan 2008

Hi,

Has anyone found a way to use search term highlighting in a marked up 
document, such as HTML or .DOC? My problem is, the lucene highlighter 
works on plain text, the limitation being that you have to use the text 
you indexed for highlighitng, so your tags are gone by then. Although 
it's possible to use regluar expressions to highlight words in HTML or 
word-processor documents, it would mean effectively copying the 
functionality of lucene, including span queries etc.

I know there are products out there to do this; ISYS is one example. If 
you do a proximity search for 'cats' and 'dogs' within 3 spaces of each 
other, it will only highlight them where they occur within 3 spaces of 
each other; not elsewhere. The trick part is, it does this in a 
Microsoft Word document!

Does anyone know how?

Many thanks!
-John B.
