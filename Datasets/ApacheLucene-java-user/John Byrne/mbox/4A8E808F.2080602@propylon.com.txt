Nope, never heard of him! But with a great name like that I'm sure he'll 
go a long way :)

If I understand you correctly, that's pretty much what I meant. By 
having the first tokenizer pass larger tokens, and splitting them in the 
filter, you never have to look upstream while storing state. You only 
look upstream for a new token after you are finished splitting the last 
one and sending the parts downstream.
