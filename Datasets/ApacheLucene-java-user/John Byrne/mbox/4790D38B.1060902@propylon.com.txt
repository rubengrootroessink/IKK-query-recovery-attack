SUBJECT: Re: Highlighting with wildcards?
DATE: 18 Jan 2008

I think the way to do this is to run the 'rewrite()' method on the 
wilcard query; this turns it into a boolean collection of term queries, 
with a term for each match for the wildcard. That way, you're just 
highlighting a normal term query. I think that would also work for fuzzy 
queries. Hope that helps.
