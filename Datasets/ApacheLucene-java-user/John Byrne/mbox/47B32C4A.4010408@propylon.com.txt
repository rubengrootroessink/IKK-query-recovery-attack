SUBJECT: Re: design: merging resultset from RDBMS with lucene search results
DATE: 13 Feb 2008

Hi,

You might consider avoiding this problem altogether, by simply adding 
the meta data to your Lucene index. Lucene can handle untokenized 
fields, which is ideal for meta data. It might not be as quick as the 
RDB, but you could perhaps optimize by only searching in the RDB when 
you only need to search meta data, and using Lucene when you need both.

Regards,
JB
