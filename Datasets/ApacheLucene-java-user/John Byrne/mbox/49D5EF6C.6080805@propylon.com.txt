SUBJECT: HeapedScorerDoc using all my memory
DATE: 3 Apr 2009

Hi, I'm having a problem where the JVM runs out of memory while indexing 
a large number of files. An analysis of the heapdump shows that most of 
the memory was taken up with 
"org/apache/lucene/util/ScorerDocQueue$HeapedScorerDoc".

I can't find any leaks in my code so far, and I was wondering, are there 
any known problems with this class that could leak memory?

I'm using version 2.3.1.

Thanks!

-John
