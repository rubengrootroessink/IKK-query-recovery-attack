Hi,

This came up before, a while ago: 
http://www.nabble.com/searching-for-C%2B%2B-to18093942.html#a18093942

I don't think there is an easier way than modifying the standard 
analyzer. As I suggested in that earlier thread, I would make the 
analyzer recognize token patterns that consist of words with prefixed or 
postfixed symbols[1] Then you will receive tokens like "c++" or 
"~/.file" in your token filter. You can then choose to pass them as 
single tokens, or split them down further into two or more tokens.

[1] If you decide to try matching words with symbols in the middle, be 
aware that the StandardAnalyzer already handles some examples of this, 
such as e-mail addresses, so you may make something redundant.
