SUBJECT: Lucene used
DATE: 1 May 2002

Hi All

I just started to use the free Java IDE from eclipse, www.eclipse.org. I've
noticed that the M5 version uses Lucene as the search engine for the help
system. It's just indexex my help plugin with over 500M of html and pdf
documents placed in a zip, in under 5 min ! !

Since all eclipse is open source, this is a must for all people looking a
using Lucene, since this shows an excellent implementation of Lucene into a
great application.

Mark
