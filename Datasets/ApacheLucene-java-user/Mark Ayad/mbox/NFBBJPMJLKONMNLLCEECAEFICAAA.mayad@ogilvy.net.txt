Hi,

I've been testing the demo files (note that the java docs need updating)

So far the indexing on test files works ok.

Moving to HTML files:

I used the following command:

java -classpath %classpath% org.apache.lucene.IndexHTML -create .

adding ./powered.html
adding ./resources.html
Optimizing index...
1022 total milliseconds

..so far so good,

Now perform a search using command:

java -classpath %classpath% org.apache.lucene.SearchFiles

Query: Lucene
Searching for: lucene
2 total matching documents
0. null
1. null
Query:

OK so 2 total matching documents have been found, but why is 
the document path null ?

Finally a note for future ideas:

would it be possible to obtain the original postion of the found 
word in the file ?

Best regards to All

Mark
