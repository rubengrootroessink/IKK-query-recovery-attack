I'm not sure how useful this reply is, but hey ;)

<aol>me too!</aol>

I do a vaguely similar thing;  I have to strip accents from characters 
such as e-acute out of both my input data and my incoming search queries 
to put them into a standard form.  I do this with a custom TokenFilter 
subclass.  I have an analyzer that includes this filter along with some 
of the standard ones (LowercaseFilter, etc).  I run the same analyzer on 
indexing and searching, which has been discussed in other posts.

My point is that I'm happy with this approach and I'd recommend you do a 
similar thing, at least as a first attempt.

Cheers,
Peter Pimley
