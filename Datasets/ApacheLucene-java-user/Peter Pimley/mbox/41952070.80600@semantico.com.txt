SUBJECT: Re: QueryParser: "[stopword] AND something" throws Exception
DATE: 12 Nov 2004

Thanks for pointing that out, and sorry for reporting a duplicate bug.

I went here: http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.cgi and the lucene 
link about halfway down the page links to 1.4-final.  I didn't find my 
way to the page that announces 1.4.2.  I'll install 1.4.2 on Monday 
morning, which will let me remove my untidy workaround. :)

Cheers,
Peter
