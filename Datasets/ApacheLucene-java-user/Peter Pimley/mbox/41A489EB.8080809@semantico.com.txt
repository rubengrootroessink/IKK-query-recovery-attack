I'm no expert on this, but I would guess that adding more processors 
would not increase the speed of *individual* queries, but it would 
greatly improve total throughput.  If you kept adding processors you'd 
probably get to the state where something other than CPU was your 
limiting factor (e.g. memory/disk bandwidth).

... but that's just a guess. ;)
