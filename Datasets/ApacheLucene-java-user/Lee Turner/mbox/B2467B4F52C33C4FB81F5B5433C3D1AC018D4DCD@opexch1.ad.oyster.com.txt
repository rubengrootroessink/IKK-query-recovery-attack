SUBJECT: Strategies for updating indexes.
DATE: 5 Apr 2005

Hi

 

I was wondering whether anyone has any experience of multithreaded
updates to indexes.  I the web app I am working on there are additions,
updates and deletes that need to happen to the index throughout the
runtime of the application.  Also, the application is run in a cluster
with each app server having its own index.  This means that periodically
each app server is going to have to go through a re-indexing process to
make sure that its index has all the changes from the other app servers
in it.  This process can take a few seconds so if another update to the
index occurs at this time it will need to be queued in some way to make
sure it happens after the re-indexing.

 

I was just wondering if anyone had any pointers for doing this kind of
thing.  Any help would be gratefully appreciated.

 

Many thanks

Lee
