SUBJECT: Re: Is there a way to limit the size of an index?
DATE: 9 Jan 2010


Well, this rule seems not working...

I tried to create an index of 90k documents, with different merge factors.
Somehow, the files size in the final index were 1MB, or 8MB - nothing in the
middle. Am I missing something? Is the best way to really control the files
size is to implement a custom Directory?
