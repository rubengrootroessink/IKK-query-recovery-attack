SUBJECT: Re: Is there a way to limit the size of an index?
DATE: 10 Jan 2010


I'm storing and reading the documents using Compass, not Lucene directly. I
didn't touch those parameters, so I guess the default values are being used
(I do see cfs files in the index).

How the ramBufferSizeMB parameter affect the files size? What value should I
use in order to have 6MB files?
