SUBJECT: Is there a way to limit the size of an index?
DATE: 7 Jan 2010


Hi all,

According to the FAQ, "An even more complex and optimal solution: 
Write a version of FSDirectory that, when a file exceeds 2GB, creates a
subdirectory and represents the file as a series of files."

Is that solution implemented already? If not, can you guide me please how
can I achieve that? Is this solution requires changes in the Reader as well?

Thanks.
