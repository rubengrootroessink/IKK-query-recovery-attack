SUBJECT: Querying for a catagory
DATE: 16 Feb 2009


Hi,

I have a number of documents that each relate to a client. I would like to
use an index and queries to answer two question:
- Find relevant documents
- Find relevant clients

The first one is straight forward.
For the second one, I am wondering. Should I iterate over the hits and
compute the most relevant clients. Or is there a clever build-in way of
answering the question? 

Anyone that can help me crack the nut?

Best,

Michael
