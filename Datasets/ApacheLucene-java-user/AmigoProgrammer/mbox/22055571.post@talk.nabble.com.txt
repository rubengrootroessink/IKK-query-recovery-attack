A relevant client is one that is related to one or more documents found by a
search. 

I would store client as a keyword with a document and I would like the query
to return clients with the sum of relevant documents score. A client with
many low scoring documents could be as relevant as a client with few high
scoring documents. Basically I am looking for a 'group by'-like
functionality.

Best,

Michael
