SUBJECT: Re: Open source search social evening in London - 18th Nov
DATE: 16 Nov 2009

Hi all,

Just a reminder that we're meeting up this Wednesday at the location below.

It just occurred to me that we haven't put anything about ourselves in
the invite... René is a consultant specialising in Lucene, Solr, and
linguistics (René please correct me if I'm misrepresenting you
horribly) and I'm a general-purpose engineer currently working on
Empora, a shopping app that uses content-based image retrieval (CBIR)
on top the open source technology stack (take a look by the way, I'd
love some feedback).

I know it's nearly Christmas and everyone is busy but it'd be good to
see you there if you can make it.

All the best,

Rich (and René)
