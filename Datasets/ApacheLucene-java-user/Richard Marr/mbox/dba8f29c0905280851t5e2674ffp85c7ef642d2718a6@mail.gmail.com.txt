SUBJECT: London Open Source Search meetup - Mon 15th June
DATE: 28 May 2009

Hi all,

I'm organising another open source search social evening (OSSSE?) in
London on Monday the 15th of June, this time with the able assistance
of Ren√© Kriegler.

The plan is to get together and chat about search technology, from
Lucene to Solr, Hadoop, Mahout, Ferret and the like. We are planning
on making this a regular event, bringing together people from across
the field to discuss ideas and ask questions over a quiet drink.

Please come along if you can.

Rich
