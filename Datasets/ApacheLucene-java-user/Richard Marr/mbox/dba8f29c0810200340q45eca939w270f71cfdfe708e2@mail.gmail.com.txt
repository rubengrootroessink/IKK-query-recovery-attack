Ah, okay.

Thanks for the advice Ard. I'll use that list in future.

Anybody who is annoyed by my hiring notice is quite welcome to get in
touch with me and I'll buy them a beer or something if and when they
come through London. Oh dear, spamming _and_ bribery in one day. My
moral fibre is looking decidedly patchy  :o)

Back on-topic:

Is there a resource (wiki page or similar) that details common causes
of Lucene index corruption? I'm having issues merging indexes using
indexWriter.addIndexes().

All the best,

Rich
