SUBJECT: London search technology group on Meetup
DATE: 16 Dec 2009

Hi all,

Following on from the various social events Ren√© Kriegler and I have
organised in London, I've now created a group on Meetup.com so that
people can subscribe to event notifications.

If you think you might be interested in coming along some time then
just sign up and you'll get a notification by email when there's an
event happening.

Cheers,

Rich
