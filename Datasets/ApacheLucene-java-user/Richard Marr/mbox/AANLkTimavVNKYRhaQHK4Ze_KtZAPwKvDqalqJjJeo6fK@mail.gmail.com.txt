SUBJECT: London open source search meet-up
DATE: 15 Jul 2010

Hi all,

Apologies for the cross-post.

We are organising another open source search social evening in London on
Wednesday the 28 July.

As usual the plan is to get together and chat about search technology,
from Lucene to Solr, Hadoop, Mahout, Xapian and the like - bringing
together people from across the field to discuss ideas and ask questions
over a quiet drink.

For directions to this meetup and for the Meetup.com group see:

Please RSVP directly or via Meetup if you can make it!
