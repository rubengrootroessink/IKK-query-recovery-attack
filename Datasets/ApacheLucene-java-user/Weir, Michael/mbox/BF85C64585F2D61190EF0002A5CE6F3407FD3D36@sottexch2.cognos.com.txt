SUBJECT: verifying index integrity
DATE: 6 Apr 2004

When the server we're developing comes up, its Lucene indexes are sometimes
locked, especially during development, when it crashes fairly frequently.  I
assume that it is possible to corrupt an index by crashing at just the right
time.

I notice that there's a method IndexReader.unlock().  Does this method
ensure that the index has not been corrupted?  If not, is there a way of
asking Lucene either to fix up an index or tell you that the index should be
rebuilt?

Thanks for any help.
