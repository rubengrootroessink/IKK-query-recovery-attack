Thanks to everyone for their help.
I think I will try using symmetric encryption.

Two new questions:
1. Is there code available that implements a new type of filesystem
directory?
2. Does anyone have any suggestions or warnings?  I.e. if Lucene opens
all the files in a directory and then randomly accesses them, I might
have memory problems with large indexes.

Thanks for any help.

I think it's possible to make a field encrypted by an symmetric
encryption algorithms just the same as the compressed field and
algorithms such like DES can be used with little performance loss.

If the ability to block reverse engineering is critical, you should use
PKI and would result more and more performance loss than those symmectic
methods.
