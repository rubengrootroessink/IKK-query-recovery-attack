SUBJECT: Encrypted indexes
DATE: 13 Oct 2004

We need to have index files that can't be reverse engineered, etc. An
obvious approach would be to write a 'FSEncryptedDirectory' class, but
sounds like a performance killer.

Does anyone have experience in making an index secure?

Thanks for any help,
Michael Weir
