SUBJECT: Question about Lucene and index browsing
DATE: 3 Jan 2005

Hi ALL,

We have just started using Lucene to index Digital Library information.
I was wondering whether there is any feature in Lucene that could be used 
to "browse the
indexed fields" (in practice be able to browse the indexes) for a database.

If there is, could you please provide links to it ?
If there is not, do you have any plan to include that feature ?

Thanks a lot in advance for your help.

I look forward to hearing from you,


Mariella
