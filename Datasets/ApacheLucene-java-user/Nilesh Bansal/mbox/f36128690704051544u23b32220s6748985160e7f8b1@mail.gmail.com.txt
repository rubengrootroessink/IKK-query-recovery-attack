Approximate string matching is an active research field. There are
many systems that implement different algorithms to do such
computation efficiently. The one I know of is SPIDER (not open source,
academic project)
http://queens.db.toronto.edu/project/spider/
Look at the web demo that searches strings approximately (there are
7-8 algorithms implemented that you can choose from):
