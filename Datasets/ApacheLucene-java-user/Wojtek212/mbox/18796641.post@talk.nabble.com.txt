Hi Mike,
You were right I had 2 IndexWriters. I've checked again and it turned out I
had 2 IndexManagers loaded by  2 different classloaders, so even if stored
it in static Map, it didn't help.

Anyway thanks for help. But I have last question. Is it correct if I use
IndexSearcher during wrking IndexWriter? Or should these operations be
synchronized?
