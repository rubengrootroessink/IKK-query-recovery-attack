The strange thing is that when I use only FSDirectory with
SimpleFSLockFactory I don't see any exception (or I couldn't reproduce the
problem). FSDirectory with NativeFSLockFactory doesn't work as well as my
implementation of Directory and Lock (based on java.nio).

Hmmm, I don't see the reason of such behaviour...
