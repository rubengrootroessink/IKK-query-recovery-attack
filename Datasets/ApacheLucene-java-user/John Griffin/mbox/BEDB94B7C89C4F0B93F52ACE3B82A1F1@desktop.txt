Starz,

How about your code so we can see what you are doing? We're flying blind
here.

Subject: Index different files in different folders in lucene


Hi all,
I am new to lucene , is it possible to Index different files in different
folders in lucene

for examples , i have two folderes a and b , each contain several files.

in lucene args i wrote :  c:\a\ , c:\b\   but it does index only the first
files in folder A  and it doesnt index any files in folder b.  
is there any way to do that or i must put all files in one folder which is
not nice way to do as i have different types of files and need them to be
seperated.
thanks in advance
