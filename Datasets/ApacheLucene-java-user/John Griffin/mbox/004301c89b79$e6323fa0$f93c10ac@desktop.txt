Prashant,

 

In addition to the other suggestions, take a look at Hibernate Search at http://www.hibernate.org/410.html.

It is specifically designed for full text search in DBs.

Hi,

             We are planning to provide search functionality in the a web base application.
Can we use Lucene for it to search data from database like oracle and MS-Sql?

 

 

Thanks and Regards
