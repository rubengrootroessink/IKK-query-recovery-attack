Xh,

We need to see a little more code her. Are you reopening the reader for each
query? If so are you closing it each time? 

We need more information.

Subject: failed to open an indexer after about 20 queries

Hi,
The indexer can't be opened after about 20 queries in linux system, but it
is fine if the index is in windows  system. The indexer is the same in both
systems.
          reader = IndexReader.open(indexName);    //failed after about 20
queries
          searcher = new IndexSearcher(reader);  
 
The reader and search have been closed after each query. Is there any
special configuration for the index in linux system? 
Appreicate your help very much.
BR,
Shawn
