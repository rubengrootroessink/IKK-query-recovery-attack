Guys (and Gals),

 

A question on index deletions, what exactly happens to the Lucene document
numbers in an index when a document is deleted? Let's say I have a 5 doc
index.

 

Document #                  Doc

0                                  doc1                             

1                                  doc2

2                                  doc3

3                                  doc4

4                                  doc5

 

If doc 2 is deleted, is this what I'm left with?

 

Document #                  Doc

0                                  doc1                             

1                                  doc2

2                                  doc4

3                                  doc5

 

This is my assumption. If not, what DOES happen?

 

TIA

 

John G.
