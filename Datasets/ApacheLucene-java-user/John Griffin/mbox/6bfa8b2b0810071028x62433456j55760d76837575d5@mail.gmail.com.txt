SUBJECT: Only last field indexed
DATE: 7 Oct 2008

Guys,

I'm adding multiple fields with the same name to a document as Store.YES,
Indexed.TOKENIZED and it seems that only the last field entered is indexed.
I read about this somewhere her but now I can't find it, naturally. Is there
a work around? does someone have a pointer to this discussion? Can someone
help?

Thanks in advance.

John G.
