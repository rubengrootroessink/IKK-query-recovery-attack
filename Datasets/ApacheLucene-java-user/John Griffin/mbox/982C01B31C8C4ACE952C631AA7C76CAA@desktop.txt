Dana,

RMI. We use it exclusively and we are able to cluster for fail-over. The
clustering complicates things quite a bit so you may not need or want it.

Subject: Searching an Index on Another Machine


Hello,

I have two machines on the same network, but I want to use one machine to
search an index located on the file system of the other machine.

Any ideas on how to achieve this?

Thanks
Dana
