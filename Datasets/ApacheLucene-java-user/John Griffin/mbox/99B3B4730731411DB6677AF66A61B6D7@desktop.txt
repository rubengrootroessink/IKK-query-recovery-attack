Matthew,

I not totally sure what you are asking but if it's 'where do I call the
explain method from?' it looks like you want to call it from the
IndexSearcher class. Look at the API docs for Searcher (the IndexSearcher's
superclass).

John G.

P.S.
If that's not it, look for explain in the API docs by clicking on Index at
the top of the docs. They're all there.

Subject: Term Frequency for more complex terms

I have a quick question, could someone point me towards where in the API 
I'll have to investigate in order to figure out the term frequencies of 
more complex terms?

For example I want to know the tf of "kit ligand" treated as a phrase.  
I see that luke has access to this information in its explain method, 
but the api call is currently eluding me.

Thanks,

Matt
