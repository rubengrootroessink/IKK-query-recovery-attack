Miz,

The StandardAnalyzer recognizes email addresses as is. That is, it pays
attention to the '@' symbol. Just store an email address in a field and
search them normally.

This assumes you are going to store the different emails in separate fields.
There is an alternative strategy if you need it. Create a string consisting
of all the emails separated by whitespace. Make sure the field is tokenized
and then you only have to search one field for any of the emails.

Your call.

Subject: Store/Index Email Address in Lucene


Hi there,
I want to index email address in such a way that i can do WildCard, Phrase
and Simple search on those items.

for each document i will have email addresses string just like in the case
of CC and TO in mails.
for eg "abc@abc.com; dcd@cbd.com; john hopkings; anything@anything.com"

Now what is the best way to store them so that i can do various type of
search on them.

Do i need the split the email address first and further split the single
email address as well and store them in multiple fields?

What is the best way to deal such case?

Your help is highly anticipated

Thank You
miztaken
