Don't forget old, venerable RMI. We use it for multiple remote indexes and
it works well.

Subject: remote stored index

Hi guys,

I want to use lucene for my new application and I have to store my 
lucene index on another server than my client is running on. What is the 
best way to use the index? Only found RAMDirectory and FSDirectory in 
lucene package.

I read something about "download, manipulate and upload index" but I 
don't think that this is a good solution. Also read about an index server.
