Subject: Lucene Indexing DB records?

Guess I don't quite understand why there are so few posts about Lucene
indexing DB records. Searched Markmail, but most of the Lucene+DB posts have
to do with lucene index management.

The only thing I found so far is the following, if you have a minute or two:

ml

Any comment on this? Efficiency? No need to maintain any intermediate data?

Thanks much,
-Peng
