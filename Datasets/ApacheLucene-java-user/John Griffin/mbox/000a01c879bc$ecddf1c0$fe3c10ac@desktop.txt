Ravinder,

If you want something from an index it has to be IN the index. So, store a
summary field in each document and make sure that field is part of the
query.

Subject: How do i get a text summary 

Hi All,

 

Is there a way to get a text summary of an indexed document to display
along with the search result?

Please let me know the technical changes.

 

Thanks,

Ravinder
