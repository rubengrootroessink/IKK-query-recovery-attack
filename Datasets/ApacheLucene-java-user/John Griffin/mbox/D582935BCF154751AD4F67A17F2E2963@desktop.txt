Use IndexWriter.setRAMBufferSizeMB(double mb) and you won't have to
sacrifice anything. It defaults to 16.0 MB so depending on the size of your
index you may want to make it larger. Do some testing at various values to
see where the sweet spot is.

I'd like to shorten the time it takes to optimize my index and am willing to
sacrifice search and indexing performance.  Which parameters (e.g. merge
factor) should I change? Thank you.
