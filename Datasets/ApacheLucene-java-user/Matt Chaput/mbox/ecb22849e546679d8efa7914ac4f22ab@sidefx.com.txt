Is there a simple, efficient way to compute similarity of documents 
indexed with Lucene?

My first, naive idea is to use the entire contents of one document as a 
query to the second document, and use the score as a similarity 
measurement. But I think I'm probably way off base with that.

Can any IR pros set me straight? Thanks very much.

Matt
