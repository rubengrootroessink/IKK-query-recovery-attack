SUBJECT: question about HitCollector
DATE: 29 Mar 2007


Hello

The collect(int doc, int score) method. in this method, which id the
argument doc refers to? the original id in the index or the id of search
result (the position of document in the search result)

I ask this, because I implement a HitCollector and collect the IDs in a
BitSet and it was very strange when I move between documents I saw that it
shows all the document regardless of given query!!!

thanks regards
