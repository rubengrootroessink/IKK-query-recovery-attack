SUBJECT: How to get TermFreq only in some query results
DATE: 27 Jul 2006

Hi everyone,

I am just developing an application using Lucene, and I know how to get the
Term Freq via the IndexReader for the whole corpus. But I wonder if I can
get the term freq statistics just inside the query results, like I want the
hot words in just recent two weeks added into Lucene indices, and how?

Thank you very much, any opinions would be apprecieated!
