SUBJECT: Re: Integrating Lucene with hibernate3
DATE: 13 Dec 2005

Hi,
Hibernate 3.1 has (rudimentary) builtin support for Lucene, via
Annotations. See here
http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/annotations/reference/en/html/lucene.html

I haven't tested it extensively but it worked quite well in my basic
testing. Though  couldn't find much documentation. But the source is
very readable, and enough documentation for a start, if you know
Lucene.

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/hibernate/HibernateExt/metadata/src/java/org/hibernate/lucene/event/LuceneEventListener.java

Cheers

Benjamin
