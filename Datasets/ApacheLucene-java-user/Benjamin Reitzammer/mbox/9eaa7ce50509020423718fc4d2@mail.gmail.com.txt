SUBJECT: [ANN] Roosster personal search engine 0.5 released
DATE: 2 Sep 2005

Hi,
I just released the first really usable version of roosster, a
cross-platform open source personal search engine which uses Lucene to
power it's full-text search.

Read the full announcement at
http://roosster.org/dev/news/release05.html and check it out.
Or take a look at the screenshots, to get a feeling
http://roosster.org/dev/about/screenshots.html

I'd appreciate any feedback!

Cheers

Benjamin
