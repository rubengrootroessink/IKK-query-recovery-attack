SUBJECT: Re: How to rebuild index
DATE: 21 Jan 2011

HI

You were using a system for two years and it used an index created using
lucene with the StandardAnalyzer. So, There must be an index creation code
with your system.

 Anyway,Since you have the book “*Lucene in action*” you can find how to
create an index by reading chapter 2 (Indexing). Please refer that section
and you will have a better understanding. It also contains the API details.

 Thank you,

 Best Regards,

Lahiru
