SUBJECT: How to see results of an analyzer
DATE: 22 Dec 2010

Dear All,

How can I see (or print) the result of a lucene analyzer.

I believe the analyzing happens when the *writer.addDocument* or *
writer.updateDocument* methods are called.
Can anyone suggest me a method to see the analyzing process as it happens.

If it is not possible in real time, how can i see the analyzed text ?

Thank you,

Best Regards,
Lahiru.
