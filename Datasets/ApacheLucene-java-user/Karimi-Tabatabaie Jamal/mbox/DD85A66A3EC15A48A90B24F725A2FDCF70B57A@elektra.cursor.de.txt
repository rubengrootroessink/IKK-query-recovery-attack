SUBJECT: AW: QueryParser explicit and implicit search operator
DATE: 19 Feb 2007

Hello Erik,

You are right for a little complex query. I tested  the following queries 

serach at lucenebool.com with query "Query" 155 results
serach at lucenebool.com with query "Lucene" 270 results
serach at lucenebool.com with query "Query AND Lucene" 109 results
serach at lucenebool.com with query "Query Lucene" 109 results
serach at lucenebool.com with query "Query OR Lucene" 316 results

and came to the guess that it seems to be fixed for a query like "X OR Y"! How else would
you explain the 316 search results, when the results for each single queries "Lucene" and
"Query" is lesser than 316?

Jamal

Where do you see the problem solved at lucenebook.com?   The "Query  
parsed to:" for this query <http://www.lucenebook.com/search? 
query=aaaaa+AND+bbbbb+OR+ccccc+AND+ddddd> is

	Query parsed to: +aaaaa bbbbb +ccccc +ddddd

The OR caused the "bbbbb" term to not be required, yet all other  
terms are required.

	Erik
