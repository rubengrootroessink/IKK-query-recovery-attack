SUBJECT: Performance issue
DATE: 2 Feb 2009

Hi All, 

We face serious performance issues when users do 2 letter search e.g ho,
jo, pa ma, um ar, ma fi etc. time taken between 10 - 15 secs. 
Below is our implementation details:
 
1. Search performs on 7 fields.
2. PrefixQuery implementation on all fields
3. AND search. 
4. Our indexer size is 300 MB. 
5. We show only 100 top documents only on the basis of score. 
6. We user StandardAnalyzer & StandardTokenizer for indexing &
searching. 
7. Lucene 2.4
8. JDK1 .6

Please suggest me how can we improve the performance. 

Regards,
Sourabh Mittal
