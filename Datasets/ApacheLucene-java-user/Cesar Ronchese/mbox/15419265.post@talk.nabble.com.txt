SUBJECT: Re: Indexing accented characters, then searching by any form
DATE: 11 Feb 2008


Ops!
Found a situation here Karl: 
If the content is stored without accents, everything is OK.
But, as my content is stored with accents, and I noticed the ISOFilter just
removes the accent from the search terms, it is not returning to my Hits
collection.

Any idea how to fix it?
