SUBJECT: Compiled Term Hightlighter
DATE: 9 Feb 2008


Hello guys.

I'm not a java developer, so I'm getting stuck on compiling the Term
Highlighter of source files acquired from the Lucene Sandbox. I got some
errors, well, I guess I'm not using the correct command line (it was javac
c:\dir\*.java, something like that).

Can someone post me the compiled version of this, OR even a compilable
package (with the correct command line to compile)?

Just another doubt, is the Term Highligther not really able to highlights
fuzzy terms (~)? As far I tested, I could not find any way to do that.

Thanks!
Cesar
