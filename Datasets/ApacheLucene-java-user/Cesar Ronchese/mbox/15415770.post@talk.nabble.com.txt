Hey, Erick. You inferred right.

I analized your code and it looks like a common Indexing and Searching code.
Are you sure you pasted the correct code? :P

Anyways, is the concept about doubling storing data, one content with
accents and other without? If yes, I did it earlier, but once I search in
the non-accent content and show accent content, the HitHighlighter will now
work properly.
