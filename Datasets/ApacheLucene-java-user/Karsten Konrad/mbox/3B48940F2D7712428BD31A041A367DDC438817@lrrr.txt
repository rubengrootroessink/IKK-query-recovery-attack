Sorry, I have no idea about how to use a probabilistic approach with 
Lucene, but if anyone does so, I would like to know, too. 

I am currently puzzled by a related question: I would like to know
if there are any approaches to get a confidence value for relevance 
rather than a ranking. I.e., it would be nice to have a ranking 
weight whose value has some kind of semantics such that we could 
compare results from different queries. Can probabilistic approches 
do anything like this? 

Any help appreciated,

Karsten

Betreff: Probabilistic Model in Lucene - possible?


Hello group,

from the very inspiring conversations with Karsten I know that Lucene is based on a Vector
Space Model. I am just wondering if it would be possible to turn this into a probabilistic
Model approach. Of course I do know that I cannot change the underlying indexing and searching
principles. However it would be possible to change the index term weight to eigther 1.0 (relevant)
or 0.0 (non-relevant). For the similarity I would need to implement another similarity algorithm.

I would highly appreciate it if the experts here (especially Karsten or
Chong) look at my idea and tell me if this would be possible. If yes, how much effort would
need to go into that? I am sure there are many other issues which I have not considered...

Kind Regards,
Ralf
