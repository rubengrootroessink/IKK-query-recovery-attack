DATE: 17 Nov 2003


Hi,

it actually is quite nice and it can be used in production for such things as have been discussed
lately in this group. 

If you want to play it safe: The iterator breaks at dots after numbers (e.g. 15. March), the
precision
of the algorithm can be increased if you never break after a number.

The implementation is fast.

Regards,

Karsten

Mit freundlichen Grüßen aus Saarbrücken

There is already an implementation in the Java API for sentence boundary detection. The BreakIterator
in the java.text package has this to say about sentence splitting:

"Sentence boundary analysis allows selection with correct interpretation of periods within
numbers and abbreviations, and trailing punctuation marks such as quotation marks and parentheses."
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/BreakIterator.html

The whole i18n Java API is based on the ICU framework from IBM: http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/index.html
It supports many languages.

I personally do not have any experience with the BreakIterator in Java. Has anyone used it
in any production environment? I'd be very interested to learn more about it's efficiency.

Regards,
Phil
