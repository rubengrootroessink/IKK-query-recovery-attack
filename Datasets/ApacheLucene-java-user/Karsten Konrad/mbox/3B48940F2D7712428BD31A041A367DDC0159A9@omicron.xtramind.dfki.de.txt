Hi,

without any sophisticated linguistic techniques (German word 
decomposition is not a simple topic), there are some other options 
as well:

(1) Use of an analyzer that stores each word both in the normal
direction and backwards at the same token position. Ie., the word
ausweis will be indexed both as 'ausweis' and 'siewsua'. Then, for 
every word you find in a query (without bolean operations) that
has a * at the beginning, simply reverse the word and add the *
to the end. Thus, *ausweis will find, for instance, siewsualanosrep;
that is personalausweis backwards. However, highlighting could be
trickier than usual. Another drawback: the number of tokens in the 
index doubles.

(2) Use a term enumerator. The WildcardTermEnum gives a good
example of how you can iterate over all terms of an index
and find matching terms for any kind of similarity operation.
Thus, you could take your search word and return every word
where the search word occurs in. On a larger index with lots of 
tokens, this operation could be expensive with a naive
implementation, but worth a try. 

Regards,

Karsten

Günter,

As far I am informed, you can not search with bothside wildcards like
*ausweis*.
You can search for ausweis*. However I think, you won't get the results you
are searching for, because your words have a leftside term.
If you have words like
 Ausweisinhaber
Ausweiskontrolle
you can search with ausweis*

Arsineh
