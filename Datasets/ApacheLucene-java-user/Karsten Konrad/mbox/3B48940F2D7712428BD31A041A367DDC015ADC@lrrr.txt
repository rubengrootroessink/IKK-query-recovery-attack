Hi,

what are these several other important ones?

While Lucene does not give an explicit vector space
representation - you can not efficiently access the vector 
of one document - the index' basic representation is
a reduction of each document to its terms and 
frequencies, hence a mapping into a vector space and hence
a vector space model. The relative term weights (TF/IDF) warp the
space and the vectors, but all of Lucene's search operations 
nevertheless are  operations on a vector space model 
(ok, maybe phrase  search is a bit different as it 
requires an extension by position information).

E.g., searching a term means finding all vectors  that have 
a certain common dimension and ranking means weighting these 
relatively to their angle in vector space.

does it matter? vector space is only one of several important ones.

Really? And what model is used/implemented by Lucene?
