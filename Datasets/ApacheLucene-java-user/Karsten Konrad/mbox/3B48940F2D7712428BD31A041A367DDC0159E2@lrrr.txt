Hi,

field contents indexed with Field.text are stored 
verbatim in the index - thus, you can get back the 
original text when you access it using stingValue(). 

This has nothing to do with how the text is 
indexed, i.e., how it is tokenized and stored into
the index. You probably have a token "workers" and 
one "howto", both pointing to this text (that's why 
it is called an inverted index, the words point to
the text). Your analyzer does this tokenization
for you.

If you search using the query parser, you
can only do this on indexed fields, e.g.,
those indexed with Field.text or Field.UnStored. 
If you store a text as a keyword,
you must construct a TermQuery and search
with it. Thus, you would actually get a
term ("title", "Workers HowTo").

Regards,

Karsten

Well, but if I browse my index I see all the terms stored in the 
original form. I use this code:

doc.add(Field.Text("title","Workers HowTo");
...
// Build and execute Query, so that only the above document is found
Document d = hits.doc(0);
Field field = d.get("title");
System.out.println(field.name() + "," + field.stringValue());

This outputs "title,Workers HowTo" - the untokenized, unanalyzed form.

So, what's wrong here?

cheers,

Ulrich
