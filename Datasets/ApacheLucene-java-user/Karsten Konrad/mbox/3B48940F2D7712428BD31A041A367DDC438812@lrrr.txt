SUBJECT: AW: AW: Real Boolean Model in Lucene?
DATE: 1 Dec 2003


Hello Ralf,

>>
According to your description, Lucene basically maps the boolean query into the vector space
and measures the cosine similarity towards other documents in the vector space. If I understood
you correctly you mean if a document is found by Lucene based on a boolean query it is relevant
(boolean true). If it is not returned, if was boolean false. The score sits on top of it and
can be used for ranking. If I would like to use true boolean model I would therefore just
need to ignore the score of the Hits document. Did I understand correctly?
>>

Yes, I think that this is indeed pretty close to some theoretical foundation: The Boolean
Model 
explains which documents fit to a query, while some appropriate (Lucene is good!) similarity

function in vector space yields the ranking.

Now hell would be the place for me where I would have to prove that Lucene's ranking is 
exactly equivalent to some transformation of vector space and then using the *cosine* for
the 
ranking. Can't be really, as Lucene sometimes returns results > 1.0 and only some ruthless
normalisation keeps it within 0.0 to 1.0. In other words, there still are some rough corners
in Lucene where a good theorist could find some work.

Could  we leave this topic aside until some suicid.. err, I mean enthusiastic fellow
tries to work out a really good theory?

Regards,

Karsten

Hi Karsten,

I want to thank you for your qualified answer as well as your answer from the 14th of November,
where you agreed with me that Lucene is basically a VSM implementation. Sometimes it is difficult
to make the link between the clear theory and its implementation.

According to your description, Lucene basically maps the boolean query into the vector space
and measures the cosine similarity towards other documents in the vector space. If I understood
you correctly you mean if a document is found by Lucene based on a boolean query it is relevant
(boolean true). If it is not returned, if was boolean false. The score sits on top of it and
can be used for ranking. If I would like to use true boolean model I would therefore just
need to ignore the score of the Hits document. Did I understand correctly?

I aggree that nobody really want to do that. My question intended to find out more about the
implemented theory within Lucene.

Cheers,
Ralph
