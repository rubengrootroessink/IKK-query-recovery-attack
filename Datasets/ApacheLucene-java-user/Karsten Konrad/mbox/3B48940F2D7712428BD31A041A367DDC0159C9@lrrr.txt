Hi,

please have a look at the FuzzyTermEnum class in Lucene.
There is an impressive implementation of Levenshtein distance 
there that you can use; simply set the fuzzy distance higher 
than 0.5 (0.75 seems to work fine) and modify the 
termCompare method such that the last term produced is always
the one which you consider the best, i.e., which has the smallest
edit distance but the highest idf. 

You can greatly speed up the computation by making sure in your
termCompare method that you only compare terms by Levenshtein that
have at least a common prefix of a few characters, say 3 or 4. 
Thus, it will repair "notebok" into "notebook", but not "nitebook" 
into "notebook". Most spelling errors seem to appear at the end of 
a word, so the restriction is not unreasonable. 

I use a similar method for auto-expanding dubious terms on large 
indexes (> 1Gig), and the performance is still quite good.

Regards,

Karsten

Thanks, for the answer.

I was searching for a solution not based on a dictionary, but on the list of
terms (with relative frequency) contained in the Lucene index.

In this way (I think) I can obtain more significant results,
I can use this method on multiple languages (without relative dictionary and
without know which laguage is used in the query string)
and especially on out-of-dictionary terms (i.e.: in a e-commerce site you
can find "Nikon coolpix" that are not in a dictionary).

I was searching for some algorithm that can calculate the similarity
coefficient between two terms and multiplying it
to the frequency in the indexed documents can obtain a score.

Do you think that this is a wrong way?

Regards,
Dario
