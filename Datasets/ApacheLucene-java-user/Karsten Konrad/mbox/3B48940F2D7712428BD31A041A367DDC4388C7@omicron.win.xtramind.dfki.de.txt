DATE: 11 Apr 2004


Hi (danger: shameless advertising below),

our partner, Brox It Solutions, is using our - XtraMind Technologies GmbH - clustering for
implementing meta-search clustering of search results ala Vivisimo. Check out:

http://www.anyfinder.de/

The clustering is done on the snipplets coming from search engines, but the original version
that we still use in our own products is based on modified Lucene indexes as these can efficiently
handle lots of information on texts and terms. Our clustering engine does not only cluster
search results, but also performs trend recognition for competitive intelligence and similar
tasks, but not too many people require such specialized features.

Brox' price models for this engine may be interesting for those who find other products too
expensive; it also works with all existing search engines, not only Lucene.

I got all excited reading the subject line "clustering results" but this isn't 
really clustering is it?  This is more sorting.  Does anyone know of any work 
within Lucene (or another indexer) to do actual subject clustering (i.e. like 
Vivisimo @ http://vivisimo.com/ or Kartoo @ http://www.kartoo.com/)?  It would 
be pretty awesome if Lucene had such ability, I know there aren't a whole lot 
of clustering options, and the commercial products are very expensive.  
Anyhow, just curious.

A brief definition of clustering: automatically organizing search or database 
query results into meaningful hierarchical folders ... transforming long lists 
of search results into categorized information without any clumsy pre- processing of the source
documents.

I'm not sure how it would be done...?  Based off of top Term Frequencies for a 
document?
