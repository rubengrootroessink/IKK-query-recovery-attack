I have done negative boosts, it does work; you must construct your
query terms accordingly. I found the results somewhat unintuitive -
the mixture of negative and postive boosts (mainly 1.0), TF/IDF 
and document length normalization will very often make documents 
more relevant that you did not expect to be.

Betreff: Negative boosting?


I've often found the use of query-based boosting to be very beneficial.  This is particularly
so when it's easy to identify the term that I want to stand out as a primary selector.  

However, I've come across quite a few other cases where it would be easier (and more logical)
to apply a negative boost - to de-emphasize the match when the term is present.  

Is it possible to apply a negative boost (It doesn't seem to work), and if not, would it break
anything signficant if that were added?

Regards,

Terry
