I don't think that one can be in much better hands 
here :)

Anyway, for mid-size to larger projects around 
the use of any search engines in Germany I can recommend 
Brox IT-Solutions (http://www.brox.de/). They use
a nice flexible framework where you can apply Lucene
plus other optional search engines (I think, they 
have now some 10 engines to choose from with many tools
like summarization that work with all these engines). 

With the help of this framework, integrating Lucene
into an existing setup, enhancing or replacing other 
search engines can be done without programming ones 
leg off.

I know them because they use my clustering algorithm
when doing meta-searches. See

http://searchdemo.brox.de/

(search for Lucene - the clustering is geared towards German
though!)

Regards,
