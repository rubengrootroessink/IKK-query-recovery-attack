SUBJECT: AW: Lucene internal document number?
DATE: 6 Aug 2004


Hi,

>>

a have a short question it's regarding lucene internal document numbers: 
can you give me an idea where they are written into the index and how 
they are generated?
>>

I am not 100% sure about the technical design, only
from my experience with Lucene:

The numbers depend on when the document was indexed. 
The "older" the document, the smaller the number. All 
documents are numbered from 0 to n-1 where n is the 
number of documents the current reader sees. There
are never any "gaps" in this numbering.

There is, to my knowledge, no explicit point where
these numbers are written in the index. Think of
positions in a list - they are not part of the
list itself. You have to take into account that
these numbers may change for documents after 
any deletions in the index.

Regards,

Karsten

Betreff: Lucene internal document number?


hi there,
i looked around through the source but i dont get it. i also read the 
faq and i know that numbers are incremental for each index and start by 
0 and change when optimizing and so one...

i looked at the doc writers in lucene, but i dont get the point where 
numbers are given and written (i assume by using writeVInt() or 
something like that).

it would be very kind if anyone can tell me what line in which file i 
had to look for.

thanks in andvance and kind regards from berlin, germany.
