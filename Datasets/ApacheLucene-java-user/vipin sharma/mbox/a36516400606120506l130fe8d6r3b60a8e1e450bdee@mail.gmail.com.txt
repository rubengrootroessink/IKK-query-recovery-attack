SUBJECT: Getting count on distinct values of a field.
DATE: 12 Jun 2006

Hi,
i am having problem in getting the count on distict values of a field. The
reason for getting this value is that, each of all documents in index
belongs to one predefined class and i want to get the number of documents
belonging to each class.

Regards..
