SUBJECT: Re: Cache BitSet or doc number?
DATE: 26 Oct 2007

Check out the HashDocSet from Solr, this is the best way to cache small 
sets of search results.  In general, the Solr BitSet/DocSet classes are 
more efficient than using the standard java.util.BitSet.  You can use 
these independent of the rest of Solr (though I recommend checking out 
Solr if you want to do complex caching).
