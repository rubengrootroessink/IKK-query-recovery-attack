Check out Andrew McCallum's paper:

http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/papers/acm-queue-ie.pdf

It mentions this very problem.  There are
also some more technical presentations around.

He was part of the Whiz-Bang team that took
on the problem.  The fact that the company's
out of business is a testament to how hard
this problem is in general.
