Here's a site with some pointers to the literature
and some systems out there to do summarization:

http://www.summarization.com/

This is actually whole-document or even
multiple-document summarization.

Snippet production's a rather different problem,
which needs to be sensitive to the query.
What to show isn't so easy when there are many
instances of the query terms in the document
and very limited space.

We haven't written any kind of text summarization
package for LingPipe.  Kea works at a keyphrase
level, not a doc summary level, though they reference
a paper on using it for summarization:

http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/HICSS_35/HICSSpapers/PDFdocuments/DDUAC04.pdf

Both LingPipe and Kea are able to find significant
phrases, which is useful for query refinement or
summarizing sets of search results, but not so
useful for individual documents.  It can be a huge
help to add part-of-speech information to these
kinds of approaches.
