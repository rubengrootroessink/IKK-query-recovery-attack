These will vary by corpus, but the best you can do now
for English on the web is Google's corpus.  Here's
their blog entry describing it:

http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html

It's collected over 1,024,908,267,229 words,
with 13,588,391 distinct words that appeared
at least 200 times.  It also includes n-grams
up to order 5.  (It's on 6 compressed DVDs!)

Hats off to Alex Franz and Thorsten Brants
for releasing this (they're two computational
linguistics researchers at Google).

Here's where to get it:
