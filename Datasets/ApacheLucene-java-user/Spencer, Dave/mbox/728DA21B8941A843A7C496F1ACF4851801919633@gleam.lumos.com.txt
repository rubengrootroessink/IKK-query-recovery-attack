I/O buffering would certainly be handled by the OS but in theory the
application
can do its own buffering -and in a sense RAMDirectory is an extreme
example of this.
Having an app w/ an adjustable buffer pool gives you more options for
tuning.

The index is only a gig, but of course, optimizing will increase that
size
substantially.  At the rate our index grows, it would be better to  keep
it
in a disk array.

I assume that I/O buffering would be handled by the underlying OS
wouldn't
it?

One idea - have you tried searching with a RAMDirectory instead of an
FSDirectory?
If you index fits into memory then this could be a win.
Some notes & code here:

http://www.tropo.com/techno/java/lucene/rammer.html

Note: I know some people have huge indexes that "can't" fit
into RAM...but I'm sure I've read that Google uses solid state ("ram")
disks
in their search farm. Can't find the article however that says this.
Might have been an interview w/ E. Schmidt.

Also: does Lucene have any buffer control in the API?
In theory shouldn't IndexSearcher, or FSDirectory, have control
over buffering of disk blocks?

Just a question for the group.  Is anyone using or have benchmarked a
pooled
IndexSearcher setup?  (Especially the Jakarta Commons POOL
implementations)
I am looking to increase the concurrent search performance because quite
a
few of our users use DateFiltering which dramatically increases search
times.

Is it worth the effort?

Thankyou in advance.
