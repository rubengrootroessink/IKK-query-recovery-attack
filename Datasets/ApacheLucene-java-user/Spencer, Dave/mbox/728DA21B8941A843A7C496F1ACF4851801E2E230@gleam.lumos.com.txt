OK, sorry for the noise then.
If I can reproduce I'll be more precise.

Dave,

My recent testing suggests that when the field is not tokenized, it is
not
split as you suggest.  When I search the "path" field using
"path:1102/A*" I
get precisely what I am looking for (though I discovered the lowercase
mechanism isn't applied to this field and the query is case-sensitive -
not
the uppercase 'A' above.)

Regards,

Terry

Funny, I have more or less the same question I've been meaning to post.
I think the answer is going to be that the analyzer applies to all parts
of
a query, even to untokenized fields, which to me seems wrong.

So I think if you have a query like

body:foo uri:"/alpha/beta"

With 'body' being tokenized and 'uri' not tokenized, I think that
the analyzer applies to "/alpha/beta" and breaks it into "alpha beta"
which is not desired...

Rob,

I presume that means that you used backslashes (in the url) rather than
forward slashes (in the path).  I had planned to test that as a
workaround
and it's good to know that you've already tested that successfully.

But why is this necessary?  Why doesn't the escape ('\') allow the use
of a
backslash?

Regards,

Terry
