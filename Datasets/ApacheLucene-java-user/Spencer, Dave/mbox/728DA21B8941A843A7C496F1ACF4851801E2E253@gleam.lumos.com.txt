My understanding is that "escaping may not work (as Terry and I believe)
however
 a workaround for most 'reasonable' cases is to use WhitespaceAnalyzer
when
parsing a query".

Well, pardon me for breathing, Otis.

I didn't make the connection (partly 'cause you changed the subject
line).
But anyway, I don't understand your rather oblique answer - does
escaping
work or not?  Are you saying that, in order for it to work (the way the
docs
say it does), I need to insert this module in the chain? Or what?
