SUBJECT: Is just "-foo" a valid query?
DATE: 11 Sep 2002


How do I find all the docs without single term e.g. "what docs do not
mention the word 'foo'".

The query "+foo" returns all docs w/ foo, and one would think that a
search on "-foo" would do the
job, however I get zero docs back when searching like this. 
I'm using 1.2. 
Is there something wrong w/ the query execution?
