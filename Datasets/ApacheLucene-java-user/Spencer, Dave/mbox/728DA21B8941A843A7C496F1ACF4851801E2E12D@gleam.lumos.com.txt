This fragment (from a JSP page..) should dump the
fields for an index in alphabetical order - this
is not precisely what you're asking however -this is all
the fields used in an *index*, not a document, but
anyway maybe this helps:


IndexReader r = IndexReader.open( indexName);
TermEnum te = r.terms();
Set s = new TreeSet();
while ( te.next())
{
	Term t = te.term();
	s.add( t.field());
}
te.close();
r.close();

o.println( "These are all the fields in the index and they can be
searched on...<p>");
Iterator it = s.iterator();
while ( it.hasNext())
{
	o.println( it.next() + "<br>");
}

Subject: How to get all field names


Hi,

I was wondering if there is a possibility to get a list of all field
names
that have ever been used to index a document? This way I could filter
out
some special fields, like identity and such, and do a search over the
remaining. That would give me total freedom to choose any document
structure
and have all fields searched. Is this possible? Or do anyone of you have
a
better way achieving that?

Regards
Christoph
