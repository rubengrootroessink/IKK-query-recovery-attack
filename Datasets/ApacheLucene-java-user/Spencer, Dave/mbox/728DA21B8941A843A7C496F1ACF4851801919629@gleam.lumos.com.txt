Interesting - you say "no" it's not possible - but then how does the
'near' query work i.e. when you do search with a query like:

     "search engine"~10

which asks for the docs with 'search' and 'engine' within 10 words of
each other?

I thought the implication of having such queries is that Lucene stores
all the positions
in the doc of each word.

I guess one place to start looking would be PhraseQuery & the slop
factor..and then
SloppyPhraseScorer...
