SUBJECT: test case - RE: Slash Problem
DATE: 26 Nov 2002


I'm sure there's something that I'm missing here.
Let's say we have an index of a web site with 2 fields,
"body", and "url".
Body is formed via Field.Text(...,Reader) and the url field by 
Field.Keyword(), thus the URL is not tokenized but is searchable.

I use StandardAnalyzer and I want to find
the Document with a matching URL, and I want
to use QueryParser to parse the users queries.

I'm using v1.2.

It seems that, if I'm correct, one design problem is that the Analyzer 
does not have a reference to an index, so it doesn't know
if a field has been tokenized. It probably should not tokenize
queries against an untokenized field. AFAIAK the queries against
untokenized fields are always tokenized and there is no way to tell
the QueryParser to not tokenize a field.

I have attached a test program that shows the behavior and
sample output.
The "From:" lines are user queries.
The "To:" lines are the result of calling QueryParser and then
Query.toString().

The 3rd and 4th From/To lines below are the key ones.
The goal is to enter a query like url:http://wwww.tropo.com/
or url:"http://www.tropo.com/" and not tokenize the
'http://www.tropo.com/'.
I tried backslashes too to no avail (url:http\://www.tropo.com/)

Dave,

My recent testing suggests that when the field is not tokenized, it is
not
split as you suggest.  When I search the "path" field using
"path:1102/A*" I
get precisely what I am looking for (though I discovered the lowercase
mechanism isn't applied to this field and the query is case-sensitive -
not
the uppercase 'A' above.)

Regards,

Terry

Funny, I have more or less the same question I've been meaning to post.
I think the answer is going to be that the analyzer applies to all parts
of
a query, even to untokenized fields, which to me seems wrong.

So I think if you have a query like

body:foo uri:"/alpha/beta"

With 'body' being tokenized and 'uri' not tokenized, I think that
the analyzer applies to "/alpha/beta" and breaks it into "alpha beta"
which is not desired...

Rob,

I presume that means that you used backslashes (in the url) rather than
forward slashes (in the path).  I had planned to test that as a
workaround
and it's good to know that you've already tested that successfully.

But why is this necessary?  Why doesn't the escape ('\') allow the use
of a
backslash?

Regards,

Terry
