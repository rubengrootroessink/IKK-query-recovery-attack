Hi Revati,
If I am not wrong you must be using hibernate intercepter to get the evens on value objects.
You will get all lifecycle event in the class so you should handle lucene index addition/updation/deletion
there. 

But I had faced locking problem with hibernate as multiple writers get opened for lucene.
So better have a seprate background indexing app.
Hey TEAM, please correct me if I am wrong.

thanks
Amol
