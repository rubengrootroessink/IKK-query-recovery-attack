SUBJECT: closing searcher
DATE: 16 Mar 2006

Hi,
I am using lucene in a j2ee based webapplication. I have created a one instance of reader
and searcher object and trying to use that for all searches from different users without recreating/refreshing
reader & searcher objects.

Is this fine?
I am asking this because I am reading 
http://www.javaranch.com/newsletter/200404/Lucene.html

where it's writtne that for every search, after getting documents, close searcher object.

I am getting IOEXception bad file descriptor.


Please give me some directions.

thanks
Amol
