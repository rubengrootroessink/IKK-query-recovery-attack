Hi everybody,
I am using lucene in almost every web application I am working on. It's simply a great software.
I have developed an advanced search with Lucene 1.4. Now I am looking for developing a fuzzy
search i.e get one search string from the user and search across all fields of member documents.


I can think of two options :
- form a OR query using given search string for all fields
- add one more field ( say keyword ) to the member document with all information of the user.

- Are there any other options ?
- Which will be a better option for the system which has arround one million documents each
having 20 fields and performance is a major concern?

thanks
Amol
