Hi,

My simple search application is returning hits ordered by the default
relevance. But, I noticed that when for example searched for "what", the
first hit has considerably lesser occurrences of the term "what" than
those that follow. When I viewed the explanation for each document, all
the values made sense except the fieldNorm which is comparatively very
high for the topmost hit. 

Can someone please explain how the fieldNorm factor is calculated?

Thanks so much.
Seeta
