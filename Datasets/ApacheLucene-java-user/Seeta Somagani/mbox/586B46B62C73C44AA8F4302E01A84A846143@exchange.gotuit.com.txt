I figured that out. I was opening up a different, but similar, index.
That was made evident when I printed out the document.
Thanks so much,

When you indexed the fields you can't get back, did you use
Field.Store.YES?
I've been confused by the fact that Luke can "reconstruct" fields that
aren't stored, but are indexed....

If that isn't the problem, perhaps you could post some code
snippets.....

Best
