> I have an index in which dates are represented as ranges of two

> dates as a negative one  There are three possible types of ranges.
> These are listed below with example dates:

> *	BC - BC (-2000 - -1000)
> *	BC - AD (-1000 - 1000)
> *	AD - AD (1000 - 1200)

> What I want is to have a textbox in which the user enters a year (eg
> 1990) and all records for which that date falls within the record's
> date range are returned.

> What would be the query syntax for this?
