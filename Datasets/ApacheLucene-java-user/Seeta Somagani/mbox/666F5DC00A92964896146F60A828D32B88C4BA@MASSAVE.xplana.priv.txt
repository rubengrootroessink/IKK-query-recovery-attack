Yeah, I'm too lazy to write the code again in C++. Was just trying to
see if compiling to native code works. Thanks

Native code....
There is a C++ port called CLucene, if that suits you more than coffee
beans...

Hi all,

Has anyone tried to compile their Lucene applications into native code?
Mine works fine in a VM but the call to search() on IndexSearcher is
crashing the application, after I compile it into native code. There is
apparently no problem in instantiating an IndexSearcher though. I tried
this on both Linux and Windows and am getting the same problem.
Thnx
Seeta
