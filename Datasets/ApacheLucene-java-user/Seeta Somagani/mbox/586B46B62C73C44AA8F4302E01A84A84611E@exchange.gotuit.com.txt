SUBJECT: Null field values
DATE: 30 Jun 2006

Hi,

 

I indexed some XML files using Lucene. When I open up the index using
Luke, I can see that all the fields are stored correctly in the index.
But, when I try to grab the fields from the hits, after searching, some
of the values are being returned as null. Any suggestions about what
might be going wrong?

 

Thanks,

Seeta
