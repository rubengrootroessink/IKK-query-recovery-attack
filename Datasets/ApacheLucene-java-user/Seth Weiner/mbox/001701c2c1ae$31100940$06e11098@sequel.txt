Thanks for the pointer!  Might I ask what the motivation for the
refactoring was?

On a separate note I just took a look at the service in the sandbox.  It
doesn't appear to support addition of documents to the index.  Shouldn't
be hard to add, just seems like a strange ommision.  Also, wouldn't it
be more efficient for the service to maintain a pool of IndexSearchers
rather than creating a new one for each search?  Or is there a problem
with holding one or more index searchers open on an index?  To
add/remove a document to the index, would all of the IndexSearchers need
to be closed, or is this safe to do?

The simple app I'm trying to write allows for the searching of an index
through a turbine webapp interface as well as the ability to upload a
document through the webapp to be added to the index.  If the document
exists in the index it's deleted and then the new version is added.  If
anyone's already done this feel free to share;)  And while you're in a
charitable mood, my next step is to take the Lucene service and make it
an XMLRPC webservice.  Thoughts and suggestions on that idea are greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Seth

Yep. Look in Lucene Sandbox. Interesting you should ask, though, 
because after about a year of using the LuceneSearchService, I've 
recently refactored it out into a subsystem of its own...:-)
