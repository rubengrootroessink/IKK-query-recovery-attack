You should test your Analyzer to confirm what tokens are being produced. You
can do this by using a helper class, to save time there is one written in
the Lucene in Action book called AnalyzerUtils, you should be able to get it
out of the download of sourcecode from the book here:
http://www.lucenebook.com/LuceneInAction.zip

It's very easy to use. You give it an analyzer and some text and out will
pop the tokens.

You can also use Luke:
http://www.getopt.org/luke/ - To diagnose your index. Very useful tool. You
can see what terms you have stored against what document.
