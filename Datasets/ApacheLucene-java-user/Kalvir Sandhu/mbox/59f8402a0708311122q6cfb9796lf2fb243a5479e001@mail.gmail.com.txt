Thanks for the reply - i have tried boosting but not like you stated. I have
tried to boost the Alias field so that it would score as high as a match on
the name field. But it didn't increase enough. like :

name:(John Smith) alias:(John Smith)^10

I think it has something to do with the fact that there is a lot of terms
stored in that document for alias, therefore weighting lower.
