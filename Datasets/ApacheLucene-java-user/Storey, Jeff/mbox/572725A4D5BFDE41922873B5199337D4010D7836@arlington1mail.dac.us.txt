I stand corrected -- I am NOT getting partial matches, I was extracting
partial matches from the text programmatically and thought that's what
was being returned.

On another topic, regarding Boolean queries and wildcard queries, I have
two questions:

It seems like when I enter the query "ball AND basket" it returns
different results than "ball and basket." Is there a way to make the
Boolean operators case insensitive?

As for wildcard searches, one of the things I attempt to do is pick out
the words that caused a particular file to be returned. However, when I
search for the term "yellow~" I might get something like "bellow." Is
there a way to list what Lucene found in the document that made it
relevant?

Thanks for all the help.

Jeff

Indeed, the only way this can happen as far as I know Lucene is by using
a
stemmer during indexing, the standard analyzer won't result in such
behaviour.
