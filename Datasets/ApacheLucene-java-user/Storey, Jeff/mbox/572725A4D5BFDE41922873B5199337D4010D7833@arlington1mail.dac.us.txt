For proprietary reasons, I cannot post code samples, but I can give you
more details as to what I am doing. I am basically trying to search a
directory of text files.

Step 1: Create an IndexWriter for the directory being searched.

Step 2: For each text file, create a new Document object and add the
document title and content as fields to this Lucene document. Add these
documents to the IndexWriter.

Step 3: Create a QueryParser and parse a user entered query.

Step 4: Create an IndexSearcher to search the directory created by the
IndexWriter.

Step 5: Use the search method of the IndexSearcher to search the parsed
query created in Step 3.

That's it. Is this the proper way to be doing searching?

Thanks.
Jeff

Indeed, the only way this can happen as far as I know Lucene is by using
a
stemmer during indexing, the standard analyzer won't result in such
behaviour.
