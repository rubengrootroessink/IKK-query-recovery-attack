SUBJECT: Partial Word Matches
DATE: 11 Nov 2006

Hi. I'm using Lucene to do some searching (using the Searcher object and
passing it a ParsedQuery). I search for a word such as "long" and it is
returning partial matches, such as "belong" and "along." Is there a way
to turn off this behavior and only match whole words?

 

Thank you,

Jeff
