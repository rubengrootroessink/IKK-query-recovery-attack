SUBJECT: Re: How to make a case insensitive search using a FuzzyQuery?
DATE: 6 Jul 2007

Hi Daniel,

   I dont lowercase the field at index time, because I have to show the
results in the same way as it was found.

   For instance:

     Some fields indexed:

      PP-Trip SubAlcance Seq Negativa
      PP-Trip SubAlcance Seq Positiva
      PS-Trip SubAlcance Seq Negativa
      PS-Trip SubAlcance Seq Positiva

    If I search for "PP-TRIP SUBALCANCE SEQ NEG", I want that the result
showed are:
       PP-Trip SubAlcance Seq Negativa
       PS-Trip SubAlcance Seq Negativa

    Not:
       pp-trip subalcance seq negativa
       ps-trip subalcance seq negativa

  A possible solution is store in a document object two fields: the original
and the lowercased. I use the last one to make the query, and the other one
to show the results. It works, but it doesnt smell good!

  Thanks for your help!

Eloi
