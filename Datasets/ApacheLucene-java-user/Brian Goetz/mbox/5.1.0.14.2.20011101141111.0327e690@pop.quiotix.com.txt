In the WebMacro project, we've actually gone further than that -- no bug 
report is taken seriously without a JUnit test case that demonstrates 
it.  This has been very successful for us, and along the way, we've built a 
nice little suite of tests.  JUnit test cases are really easy to write, but 
so far, the only one in the Lucene repo is the one for the query parser.

I'd like to see the existing test programs converted into JUnit test cases 
-- I'm willing to do this if someone will tell me how they work and what 
they're supposed to output and how to invoke them.
