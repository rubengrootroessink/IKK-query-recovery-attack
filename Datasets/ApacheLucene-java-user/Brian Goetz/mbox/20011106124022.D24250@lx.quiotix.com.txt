Actually, this is not quite correct.  

It throws a ParseException if it encounters a valid sequence of tokens
but which do not match the parsing rules.  For example, I'll bet 
  foo AND AND bar
would throw a ParseException, even though this is a sequence of valid
tokens.  

It throws a TokenMgrError when it cannot even assemble a sequence of
characters into a token.  This shouldn't happen; post the offending
query and I'll see if it can be fixed.
