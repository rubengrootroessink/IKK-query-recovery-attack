Would it be acceptable to overload fuzzy here?  Since you can't have 
a fuzzy phrase query, using tilde here woulnd't be ambiguous, but it
could be confusing.  

Of the options, having tilde as a modifier on phrases, plus a binary
NEAR infix operator for "a NEAR b", sounds like the best we've come up with
so far.
