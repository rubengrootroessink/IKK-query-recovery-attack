SUBJECT: Term boosting
DATE: 21 Sep 2002


I've got a searching problem which I know lots of other people have run 
across too.  We've got documents which have keywords (which we extract and 
put into a 'keywords' field) and also have body text (which we put in a 
'body' field.)

Lets say we search for "text retrieval".  We want to find documents that 
have "text retrieval" in the body OR in the keywords, but we want to weight 
hits on the keywords more heavily.  I can't boost the tokens in the index 
base, so I have to do that through the query.

If I convert a query for phrase Q into this:
   body:Q OR keywords:Q^n
does that do what I want?

How should I select the boost factor N?  Are there negative consequences to 
this strategy?  Am I better off doing two queries and merging the results 
myself?
