This is fine, except ~ was grabbed by whoever did the fuzzy stuff.  

> NEAR(Mickey Minnie Goofy, 5)

Pretty programmery.

> Or use chaining of an infix operator:
>   Mickey NEAR Minnie NEAR Goofy

works just like AND, but might tempt people to try 
  "foo bar" NEAR  "baz"

Or how about attaching the slop to the NEAR

foo NEAR=5 bar
