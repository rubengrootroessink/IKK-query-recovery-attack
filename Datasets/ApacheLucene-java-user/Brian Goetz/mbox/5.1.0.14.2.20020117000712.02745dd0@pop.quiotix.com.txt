Except that's not how Phrase queries work.  Phrase queries are composed of 
Terms, and the slop factor tells how close the terms have to be to each 
other.  So right now, there's no way to search for phrase near 
phrase.  However, you can search for three words in close proximity, by 
creating a Phrase query with a slop of > 1.
