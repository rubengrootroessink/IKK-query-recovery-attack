Hi Yonik,

Thanks for your response. I'll feel great if you can explain this in more
detail as i am not sure that whether i have understood this correctly or
not. Or if you can direct me to some resource that will also be very good
for me.

What my goal is to understand the caching strategy.  How well this work for
repetitive queries. Is there any room available to improve this.

Thanks and Regards,
Shailendra
