SUBJECT: How to generate TermFreqVector from an existing index
DATE: 6 Nov 2007

Hi All,

I have an index without does not have the termFreqVector stored in it. I do
not want to recreate the index as it is a big index and took a lot of time
while creation. Is their a other way for generating the termFreqVector with
the available info for all the documents.

Any help will be appreciated,

Regards,
Shaile
