Hi All,

Thanks for your reply. I would like to mention here is that the companyId is
a multivalued field. I tried paul's suggestions also but doesn't seem much
gain. Still the searcher.doc() method is taking almost the same amount of
time.

As i understand the FieldCache, it will load fields for all the documents.
But in our case we want to load fields only for the matched documents.

Here is the code snippet after using the BitSet:


               *public Map getIds() {
                    MapFieldSelector selector = new MapFieldSelector(new
String[] {COMPANY_ID, ID});
                    for(int i=bitSet.nextSetBit(0); i>=0; i=
bitSet.nextSetBit(i+1)) {
                        try {
                            doc = searcher.doc(i, selector);
                            mappedCompanies = doc.getValues(COMPANY_ID);
                        } catch (CorruptIndexException e) {
                        } catch (IOException e) {
                        }
                    }
                    return results;
                }
*
Any suggestions for further optimizing the code.

Thanks and Regards,
