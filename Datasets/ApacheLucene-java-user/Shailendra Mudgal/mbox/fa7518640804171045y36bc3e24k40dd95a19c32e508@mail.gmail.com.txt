SUBJECT: Document ids collected from HitCollector.collect and used in FieldCache..
DATE: 17 Apr 2008

Hi All,

I have a small confusion regarding the document ids which we collect using
HitCollector.collect() method. Here is the description of the confusion :

First i created a FieldCache of type <docID, <list of companyIDs>> using a
query which collects all the articles which are only a month old. I am
storing them into a map.

So now my cache has same document id 's associated with their field value
ready in the memory.

Now suppose for a search which has duration less then a month, i get a list
of docIds using hit collector. Can i map these document ids to the map,
which i created earlier. And use those field values???


Any help will be appreciated ....

Regards,
Shailendra
