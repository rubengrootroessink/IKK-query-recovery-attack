As i mentioned in my previous mail that the companyId is a multivalued
field, so caching it will consume a lot of memory. And this way we'll have
to keep the document vs field mapping also in the memory.

The index size is around 20G and the available Memory is 4G so, keeping the
entire index into the memory  is not possible.   But as i mentioned earlier
that it is using only 1 G out of 4 G, so is their a way to specify the
lucene to cache more documents , say use 2G for caching the index ??

I'll appreciate more suggestions on the same problem.
