SUBJECT: Cover density ranking?
DATE: 23 Mar 2004

Since there have been a few discussions recently of overriding various
aspects of Lucene's ranking formula, I got to wondering how difficult it
might be to implement something more different from the base tf/idf
ranking system that Lucene has built in.

How difficult would it be to implement something like Cover Density
ranking for Lucene?  Has anyone tried it?  

Cover density is described at http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/558750.html ,
and is supposed to be particularly good for short queries of the type
that you get in many web applications.
