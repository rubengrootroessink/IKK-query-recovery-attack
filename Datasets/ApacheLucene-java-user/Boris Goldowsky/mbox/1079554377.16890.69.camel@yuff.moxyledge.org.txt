Is there any way to build a query where the occurrence of a particular
Term (in a Keyword field) causes the rank of the document to be
decreased?  I have various types of documents, and some of them are less
interesting than others, so I want them to be pushed towards the bottom
of the results ranking.  However, I do not want to eliminate them
entirely, so I can't use a boolean not.

Using negative weights would seem logical here, but apparently has no
effect on rankings - negative weights appear to be treated as zeros.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Boris
