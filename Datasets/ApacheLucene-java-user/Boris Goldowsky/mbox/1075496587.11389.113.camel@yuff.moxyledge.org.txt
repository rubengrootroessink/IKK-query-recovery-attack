SUBJECT: Re: Paid support for Lucene - SUMMARY
DATE: 30 Jan 2004

Thanks to all who responded to my question - I'll get in touch directly
if my client decides to go with a Lucene-based solution and purchase
support for it.

Meanwhile, for the archives, here's a summary of the people and
organizations who offered on this list to support Lucene:

Brox IT-Solutions        http://www.brox.de/
Scott Ganyo              <scott@ganyo.com>
Otis Gospodnetic         <otis_gospodnetic@yahoo.com>     
eHatcher Solutions       <erik@ehatchersolutions.com>
JBoss Group              http://jboss.org/
SuperLink Software, Inc. http://www.superlinksoftware.com/

For the support organizations out there, you may want to consider
getting yourselves listed on http://jakarta.apache.org/site/vendors.html
as well.

Thanks,
Boris
