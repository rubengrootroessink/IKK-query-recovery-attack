By my intuition, what Lucene is doing here is the correct behavior.  Say
for a moment your field was author, and you index multiple authors by
having multiple occurrences of a Field named author.  So you might have:
author: John Smith
author: Mary Jones

now the query 
  author:smith author:jones 
should return this document, but the query 
  author:"john jones"
should not.  It would be unfortunate if this were "fixed" to return the
document with the phrasal query, since the two words in different fields
do not in fact occur as a phrase.

If you have "the quick brown fox..." as in your example, your indexing
code should combine them all into a single field before adding them to
the Document.

Just my humble opinion, of course...

Boris
