SUBJECT: how to select top categories.
DATE: 25 Jan 2006

I have ~5 million documents that are in categories and subcategories. Let us
say that my query is for search terms in one top-level category and it
returns a large amount of documents and I want to list the top 5
sub-categories by highest count total. I know I can't go one by one counting
through the results because it is too slow.

I really don't care about the counts, I just want the sub-categories with
the most documents in them.

Options that I was thinking about:
1) Do queries for each sub-category using the results of the first initial
query and use the hits count to select the sub-categories to display, but I
might have thousands of sub-categories and it would be too slow..

2) Just select some sub-categories for each top-level category to always
show, but this is bad because that sub-category might not have items found
in it after the initial query.

3) Give-Up, but this is bad also..

Thanks for your help.
