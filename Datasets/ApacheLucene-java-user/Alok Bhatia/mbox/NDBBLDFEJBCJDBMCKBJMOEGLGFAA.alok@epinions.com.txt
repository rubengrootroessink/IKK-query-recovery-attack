SUBJECT: Can't find file luceneweb.war
DATE: 18 Jul 2002

Hi All,

I just started playing with Lucene and was at the web site
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/demo3.html

Under the title 'Deploying the Demos', they talk about 'Located in your
distribution directory you should see a war file called luceneweb.war'.

However, I can't seem to find this file in my lucene directory.

The only reason I can think of is that the above demo link says it is for
Tomcat 4.0.1 but I am using Tomcat 4.0.4.  Has anyone else seen this
problem?  Where can I find this war file.

Thanks in advance for your help.
Alok
