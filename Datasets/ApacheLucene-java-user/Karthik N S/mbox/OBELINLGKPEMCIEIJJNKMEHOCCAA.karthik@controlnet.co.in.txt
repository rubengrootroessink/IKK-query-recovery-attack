Hi  Guys

Apologies...........

I have Indexed documents sucessfully and they would be

Document 1 contains   =  ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA
Document 2 contains   =  ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA BATTERY ACCESSORIES
Document 3 contains   =  ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA 0PTICS
Document 4 contains  =   ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA ACCESSORIES
Document 5 contains  =   ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA CABEL ACCESSORIES
Document 6 contains  =   ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA OPTICS CABEL
ACCESSORIES

cases].


Thx in advance
