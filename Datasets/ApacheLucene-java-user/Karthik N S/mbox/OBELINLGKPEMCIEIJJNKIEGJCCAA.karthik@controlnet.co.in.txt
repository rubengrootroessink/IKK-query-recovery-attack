Hi

Guys

Apologies..........



The new Feature of lucene 'span query' really is interesting

But need expert suggestions on achieveing the same.

I have 3 documents

Document 1 contains   =  ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA
Document 2 contains   =  ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA 0PTICS
Document 3 contains  =   ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA ACCESSIORIES



search word = " DIGITAL CAMERA "

Returned hits  = 1st doc   ONLY [ 2 and 3rd document should not be in the
hit ]

SpanQuery /PharseQuery  ????



How would one achieve this ??? Please




WITH WARM REGARDS
HAVE A NICE DAY
