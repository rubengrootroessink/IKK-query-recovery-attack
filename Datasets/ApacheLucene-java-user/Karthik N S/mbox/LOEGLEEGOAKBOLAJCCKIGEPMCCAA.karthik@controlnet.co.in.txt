Hi Guys


Apologies..........

I am Still Confused.. ;(


Let me make it more simple Question


   On using Search from a  Index without any SearchWord,  I would like to
count  the total number of Documents present in it.

   [ I Only have the Field Types 'Field.Keyword' which stores the Unique
filename ]

   Will IndexReader.termDocs(term) give me the Count for the same.
   If so How To use it....... Please

  Thx in advance.
Karthik

IndexReader.numDocs() will give the number of docs in an index.

Lucene has no direct support for unique fields. After merging, if the
same unique field value occurs in both source indexes, the merged
index will contain two documents with that value.
In case one wants to merge into unique field values, the non unique
values in one of the source indexes need to be deleted before merging.

See IndexReader.termDocs(term) on how to get the document numbers
for (unique) terms via a TermDocs, and IndexReader.delete(docNum)
for deleting docs.

Paul.
