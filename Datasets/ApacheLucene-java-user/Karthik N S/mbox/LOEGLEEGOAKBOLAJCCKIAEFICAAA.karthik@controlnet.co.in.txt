DATE: 27 May 2004


Hi
Lucene developers

Is it possible to do Search and retrieve relevant information on the Indexed
Document
within in specific range settings which may be  similar to an

Query in SQL  =  select  *  from BOOKSHELF where  book1  between 100 and 200

ex:-

       "search_word"  ,   Book between  100   AND   200

[ Note:- where Book uniquefield  hit info which is already Indexed ]


Sombody Please Help me   :(


with regards
Karthik
