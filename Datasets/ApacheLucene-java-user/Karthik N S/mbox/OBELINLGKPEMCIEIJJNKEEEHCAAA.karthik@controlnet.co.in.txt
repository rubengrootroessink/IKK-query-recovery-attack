Hi Erik


What exactly do u mean by this

 I am bit Confused u mean to say Replace

   hits.doc(i)

    by

  hits.score(i)



Also

Since the portal we ar building for is a eCommerce one, We have to return
SearchWord across

  ( >7 ) x 1000 x  15000  documents , Get most of the Relevant His (Where
ever Score is between 0.5 to 1.0 )

  and then Sort the adjecent Fields 'Vendors' and 'Price' in ASC Order


 In such a case We cannot use RangeQuery.... without priorly knowing what
exactly the Consumer want's


 Is it not possible to have a Generalized Filter in further versions of API
, to Inject some minor factors prior to

 getting the Hits returned.


Thx in advance
Karthik

If your searches are taking 440 seconds, you have something more
fundamentally wrong.  You are either doing some large
wildcard/range/fuzzy expansions or you're accessing every document from
all your hits.  Is the searcher.search() method taking that long?  I
bet not.  Or rather is it the iteration over the Hits that is killing
the "search" time, which is what I suspect?

We've emphasized numerous times that calling hits.doc(i) is a resource
hit.  Don't do it for documents you aren't going to show.  To filter by
score, use hits.score(i) first.

Please narrow your code down to a clean, succinct example that you can
post.  It is difficult to help you without details of your code (but
let me emphasize again - it needs to be clean and succinct so it is
quick for us to get a handle on).

Ah, so you are accessing every document to get this field information.
It is incorrect that you cannot filter prior to getting hits.  You have
a couple of options in filtering by a field value - use a QueryFilter
or simply AND a RangeQuery to the original query.
