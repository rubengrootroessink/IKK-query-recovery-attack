Hi Guys

 Apologies.......


  I ditto as u said but the SpanNearQuery is

  returning me all the 3 documents containing  for rollover of  words

 'DIGITAL CAMERAS' instead of returning me the 1st doc, Or none by changing
the slop factor

Any more ideas Please do .......... B(

with regards
karthik

If depends what the type of leaf_category is. If you made it Keyword as
I suggested then it won't be tokenized. i.e. there's one token 'DIGITAL
CAMERA' instead of the two tokens you normally get, 'digital' and
'camera'.

If you change the field type to Text you should be able to use a
SpanNearQuery to do your search.
