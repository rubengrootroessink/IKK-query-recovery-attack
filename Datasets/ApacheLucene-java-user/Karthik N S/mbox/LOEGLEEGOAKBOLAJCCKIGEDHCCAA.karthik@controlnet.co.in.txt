SUBJECT: IndexHTML parser + Constructer
DATE: 1 Oct 2004



Hi


Apologies .........

    Can Somebody Please tell me or  how to include  a constructer  within
'org.apache.lucene.demo.html.HtmlParser.java' ,
    So that using the Constructer read the String argument,Strips the HTML
Tags and returns the String with out Tags.
    Currently 'org.apache.lucene.demo.html.HtmlParser.java' method accepts
fullpath of the file and then reads
    the Content to Strip Tags......




Thx in Advance
Karthik

Please try again with the code from CVS, Christoph Goller committed a fix
for this problem (at least I think it was this problem) 1-3 weeks ago.
