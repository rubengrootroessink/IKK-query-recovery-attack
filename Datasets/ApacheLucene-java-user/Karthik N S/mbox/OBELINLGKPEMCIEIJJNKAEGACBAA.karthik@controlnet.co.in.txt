Hi ,

It might seem elementary to most of you.
I am trying to build a search tool for internal use using lucene.
I have used the following
 for
 .pdf   -->  PDFBOx
 .html -->  demo file of lucene(HTMLDocument)
 .xls   -->  poi

The indexing seems to work without throwing up any errors.
But,when i try to search i end up getting with zero hits always.
I have tried to use the same string that i see (System.out.print(Document))
but in vain.
Can somebody let me know where and what could be wrong.
Regards,
Chetan
