Hi
  Erik , Doug , Otis


Apologies........


I have  2 Questions for the Lucene Authors


1) Is a there a PHP version of Lucene Implemantation avaliable , If so Where
?

2) Is the Lucene  'Indexed  file format'  an Universal  type ,  If so  can
it be searched  by  other  Lucene implementations

 [ Such as  Indexing is done by Java version of Lucene and Search on the
IndexFile format is done by  Plucene ]


   A simple Equivalent Example is the RDBMS Typos , where in  INSERT done on
a specific Table by VB based  Application
   can be SEARCHED  upon by a JDBC  based Query ........ [when the Metatdata
of the table is already known]



Thx in Advance....






      WITH WARM REGARDS
      HAVE A NICE DAY
      [ N.S.KARTHIK]
