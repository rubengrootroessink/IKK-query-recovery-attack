I have updated the Highlighter code in CVS to support tokenizers that
generate overlapping tokens.

The Junit test rig has a new example test that uses a "SynonymTokenizer"
which generates multiple tokens
in the same position for the same input token eg (the token "football" is
expanded into tokens "soccer","footie" and "football").
The Formatter interface had to be changed to take a new "TokenGroup" object
instead of a single token but
I doubt any code changes in clients are required because most people use the
default Formatter implementation and haven't
created their own  implementations.

Cheers
Mark
