Hi
  Erik

Apologies..........


  We create a ArrayList Object and Load all the Hit Values into them and
return
  the same for Display purpose on a Servlet. On the servlet we track the
server side created ArrayList
  for Required number of dispalys.

 [ At any time we have to have all the hit values loaded into the arryList
,cannot compromise for the same ]


  We Obsorved that the doc.get("") was not continous for an hit of 4000 and
was coming
  in batches,


 So any new API features will definetly helps us.


With regards
Karthik

Are you really showing *all* results at one time?  Or just the first
several?  Iterating over all hits and retrieving each Document is often
unwise and generally unnecessary if only the first 20 or so are shown
at first.

I don't know of a simpler way to get all the "path" values in your
example.  Perhaps a HitCollector is more to your liking?  Though it
probably would not speed anything up for you.
