that part you have to do yourself.  It is easy, just create a new
Document, create an appropriate Field, give it a name and the string
value you got with textmining.org library, then add the Field to your
Document, and then add the Document to the index with IndexWriter.

Look at one of the articles about Lucene to get started.  I wrote one
called something like Introduction to Text Indexing with Lucene.  You
probably want to read that one to get going.
