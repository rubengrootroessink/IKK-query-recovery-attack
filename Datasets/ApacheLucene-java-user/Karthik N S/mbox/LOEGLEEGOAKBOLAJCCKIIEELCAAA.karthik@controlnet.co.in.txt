Hey
Lucene-Developers

I was broswing thru CVS  and found the SRC for  "IndexWriter2.java  written
by Ivaylo Zlatev on feb 2002,

My concern is, Does this piece of code  really work ,

if so  state an example [ present Lucene-final 1.3 version ]
           or
Is it  discarded from the [ present Lucene-final 1.3 version ]


The Tecnique of using RAMDirectory, my Query has really become faster access
,
So hence plan to use it  during Indexing process also.
