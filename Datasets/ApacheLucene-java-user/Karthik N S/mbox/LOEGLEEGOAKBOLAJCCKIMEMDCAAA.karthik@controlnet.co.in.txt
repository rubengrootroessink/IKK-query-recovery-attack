 Hello

 Mr  Wolf-Dietrich Materna

 Apologies on delay reply.

 I would like to have more of u' Help in this matter,
 Let me Explain the Setup I am Using in here...

1) I have "X" number of Unique Folders Which have around 50,000 Unique named
HTML Files.
2) The Indexing Field factor for each File in each folder is done on basis
of

  A)Name of File,
  B)Last modified Date
  C)Content of the file
  D)Folder in which the File is avaliable.


 At the end of the Week, Every Unique Indivigual Folder is Indexed
Indivigually in seperate folder.
 And at the end of Month These Unique Indexed Folders are  Merged  into one
file.


  So in any case If Iwant to Update the Existing Merged Folder,I have to
first delete from the Merged index
  on the basis of  Field type ( D as mentioned above) factor which is the
Unique Folder name,

  So u mean to say if I Delete from merged Index on the basis of  D, and
researching  of the Merged Index for the same
,the hits should return me 0 hits.


  Please advise me in this regard if I am not correct....



Thx in advance

Wolf-Dietrich is my first name, so leave out Mr. or use
my family name (which is uncommon here).

Yes, but there is no reason to do this in this case.
You search for documents using their file name (including their full path!).
You get a result (some kind of list). Please read Java-Docs about Hits
class.
hits.id(0) returns the (internal) ID of the first hit in your result.
This is the document that you want to remove (using
indexReader.delete(...).).
There are no more documents in your result "hits" unless your key is not
unique.
hits.length() returns 0 or 1.
