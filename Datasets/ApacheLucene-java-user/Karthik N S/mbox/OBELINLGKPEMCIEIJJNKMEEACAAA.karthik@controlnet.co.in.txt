Hi Guys

Apologies..........


So u say I have to Build a Filter to Collect all the Scores between the 2
Ranges [ 0.2f to 1.0f]


so the API for the same would be

 Hits hit = search(Query query, Filter filtertoGetScore)


 But while writing the Filter  Score again depends on Hits  ====> Score =
hits.score(x);



 How To solve this Or Am I in Wrong Process........


Any Simple Src for the same will be greatly appreciated.  :)

Thx in advance

Unfortunately there isn't a clean way to stop a HitCollector - it will
simply collect all hits.

Also, scores are _not_ normalized when passed to a HitCollector, so you
may get scores > 1.0.  Hits, however, does normalize and you're
guaranteed that scores will be <= 1.0.  Hits are in descending score
order, so you may just want to use Hits and filter based on the score
provided by hits.score(i).
