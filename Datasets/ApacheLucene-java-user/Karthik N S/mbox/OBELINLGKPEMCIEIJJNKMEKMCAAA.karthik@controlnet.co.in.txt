Hi Guys

Apologies........

Does Lucene have a  Synonym  Functonality as Google.

If u search Google  using  '~shoes',  It returns  hits  based on the
Synonym's

[ I know there is a Synonym Wordnet  based Lucene Package in the sandbox

http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contributions/WordN
et/   ]

Can this be achieved in Lucene ,If so How ???



Thx in Advance
Karthik






















WITH WARM REGARDS
HAVE A NICE DAY
