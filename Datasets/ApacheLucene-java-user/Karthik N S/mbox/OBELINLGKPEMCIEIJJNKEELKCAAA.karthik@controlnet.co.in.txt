Hi

   I think u need to add One more piece of code at the end of

   Path setting

   JAVA _HOME = /home/JDK..

   and finally

   export TOMCAT_HOME CLASSPATH ANT_HOME PATH

   Once u have done this Type echo $CLASSPATH to check if the jar files are
avaliable for compilation / Interpretation


 >>an I also know if tomcat version 3.2.4 is sufficient for Lucene to run?

  Any Relavent Tomcat that works with Jdk1.4.2 is suffucient for Lucene to
Execute...

Hi all,

This is jac here, and I am currently in urgent need to install Lucene on a
unix machine. However, I am not sure where to set the paths coz I am
unfamiliar with Unix & am a newbie to Java as well.

I have installed Lucene on the Windows version and it works but I cant
understand why unix can't..

The following paths are what I have entered:
Can someone please check for me?

-  PATH=.:$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin
- TOMCAT_HOME=/home/jac/jakarta-tomcat-3.2.4
- ANT_HOME=/home/jac/apache-ant-1.6.2
- CLASSPATH=$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/luc/WEB-INF/lib/lucene-1.4.3.jar:
$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/luc/WEB-INF/lib/lucene-demos-1.4.3

Can I also know if tomcat version 3.2.4 is sufficient for Lucene to run?

Thanks in advance!

Regards,
jac
