SUBJECT: LUCENE IS NOT ANY OTHER DB
DATE: 15 Apr 2005



Hi guys....

Apologies..............

It really pains to after a hards day's work that Lucene is turning to be
similar to any other DB product.

The form is full of Db similar requirements on Lucene to perform.

If one requires supports similar to DB ,then can use Any of the free
avaliable DB's  PSQL/MYSQL/MSACCESS/...

Please do not expect Lucene to perform DB based queries.

Lucene is a DATA SEARCH ENGINE and not a DB Product by functionality.



I hope Users of Lucene will understand this in simple explanation.

WITH WARM REGARDS
HAVE A NICE DAY
