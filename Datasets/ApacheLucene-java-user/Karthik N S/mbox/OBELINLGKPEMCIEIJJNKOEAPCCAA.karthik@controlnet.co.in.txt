Hi

   I have One Jsp [Query.jsp] which constructs Query something like below

  +CLOTHS +(+"SHOES SOCKS") +(PANTS SHIRTS) -COTTON AND itemPrice:[00000010
TO 00000020]


>>That'd odd. You haven't defined another BooleanQuery class have you?

  So for the itemPrice Range I use the BooleanQuery

>>Also is the Lucene JAR a stock one or one you made yourself?

Karthik

That'd odd. You haven't defined another BooleanQuery class have you?

Also is the Lucene JAR a stock one or one you made yourself?
