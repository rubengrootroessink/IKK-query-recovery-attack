Hi

Erik

  Apologies.......

  What I ment to Say was,  a word such as "New Year"  (Quotes means  "\"" )
  on  QueryParser.parse(word, "contents", analyzer) should return me hits
for the full word,
  but it did not.

 So when I  did a quick run on Analyzer process and
 found that it was splitting the Word

  "New Year"  =  [New]  [Year]


 Am I doing some thing wrong in here....




Thx in advance.....
Karthik

This is what analyzers do.  I don't know of any analyzer that deals
with quotes in the way you're requesting, by keeping the contents
together as a complete token.  You'll have to write your own variant
that does this.

QueryParser, however, uses quotes to denote a phrase query, and will
query for the words together.  Perhaps this is sufficient for your
needs?
