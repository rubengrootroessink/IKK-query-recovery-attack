Hi Erik


Apologies..............

I got Confused with the last mail.

>> Iterate over Hits.  returns large hit values and Iteration on Hits for
scores consumes time ,

so How Do I Limit my Search Between [ X.xf to Y.yf ] prior getting the Hits.

Note:- The search is being done on Field Type 'Text' ,consists of 'Contents'
from various Html documents


Please Advise me
Karthik

My message is being misinterpreted.  I said "filter" as a verb, not a
noun.  :)  In other words, I was not intending to mean write a Filter -
a Filter would not be able to filter on score.

Again, you cannot write a Filter (capital 'F') to deal with score.

Please re-read what I said below...

Iterate over Hits... when you encounter scores below your desired
range, stop iterating.  Why is this simple procedure not good enough
for what you are trying to achieve?
