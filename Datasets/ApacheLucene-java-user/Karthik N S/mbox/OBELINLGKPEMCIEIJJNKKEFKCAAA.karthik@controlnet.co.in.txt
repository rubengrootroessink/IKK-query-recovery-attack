Hi there

Apologies.........



       If u are using the IndexHTML from the demo.jar package which is
abvaliable from Lucene1.4.3.zip

 Then u bettter look at the File Extensions of u'r file's,they may be
filtered out of the indexing process

 due to this code present in IndexHTML.java
 >
 > } else if (file.getPath().endsWith(".html") || // index .html files
 >	       file.getPath().endsWith(".htm") || // index .htm files
 >	       file.getPath().endsWith(".txt")) { // index .txt files
 >


It the Extensions u have is within the 'endsWith' options then u have
sucessfully indexed the 6000 Documents of u's

Try to use the Luke Monitering S/f avaliable from the Jakartha Lucene Web
site and check for the same

[Hint Try to use the SearchFiles.class from the Lucene1.4.3.zip to search
onthe documents u have indexed sucessfuly]


with regards
Karthik

Hello,

I have been trying to index around 6000 documents using IndexHTML from
1.4.3 and at the end of indexing in my index directory I only have 3 files.
segments
deletable and
_5en.cfs

Can someone tell me what is going on and where are the actual index
files? How can I resolve this issue?
Thanks.
