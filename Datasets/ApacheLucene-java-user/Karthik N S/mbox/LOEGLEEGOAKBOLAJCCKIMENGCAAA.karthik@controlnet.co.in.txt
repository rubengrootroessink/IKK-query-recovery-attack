SUBJECT: When will Lucene 1.4
DATE: 29 Jun 2004


Hey
Dev -Guys

First Apologies for the Question  [ Intentionally did not wanted to  disrupt
the proceesings]


1) When will LUCENE1.4 - final  be released

2) Will it contain lot's of featured Examples  (lucene1.3-final does not
have many of features based examples)

3) Will the Furture releases be synchronized with releases of J2DK (since
every new version of J2SDK is released 6 months)

[ The major Concern for our Organization, since we plan to move our Code
from lucene1.3 final to 1.4 final ]


Thx in advance.....
