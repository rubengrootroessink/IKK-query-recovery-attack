Hi

Apologies.....

With my Experience of Lucene since 2004,I can say that u need to update the
Index Once in a day (rather then doing it for every upload),But if u'r
requirement say's u have to make the Doc avaliable on the run then u may do
so.....

with regards
Karthik

Subject: No.of Files in Directory


Hi All

In my webapp i have people uploading their documents. My server is
windows/tomcat. I am thinking there will be a limit on the no of files in a
directory. Typically apllication users will load 3-5 page word docs.

1. How does one design the system such that there will not be any problem as
the users keep uploading their files, even if a million files are reached.
2. Is there a sample application that does this.
3. Should I have lucene update index after each upload or should I do it
like once a day.

Thanks
Bib
