DATE: 8 Jul 2004


Hey

Dev Guys

Apologies....


 Can Some body Explain me

  Why  for an I/P word "TA1111" to  the StopAnalyzer.java  returns  [ta]
instead of [ta1111]

  "TA1111"  ==> [ta]   instead of  [ta1111]

  "$125.96  === [125.95] instead of [$125.95]

  Is it something wrong I have been missing.


 with regards
Karthik

Hey

Dev Guys

Apologies ....

I have a Quick Problem...

  The no of Hits on set of Documents  indexed using 1.3-final  is not same
on  1.4-final  version
  [ The only modification done to the src is , I have upgraded my
CustomAnalyzer  on basis of StopAnalyzer avaliable in 1.4 ]
  Does doing this effect the performance.


  Some body please explain.


with regards
Karthik

Hi!

I'm using Lucene 1.3 final currently, all things were working fine.
But, after i'm upgraded from Lucene 1.3 final to 1.4rc3 (simply overwrite
the lucene-1.4-final.jar to lucene-1.4-rc3.jar and re-compile it)
We can re-compile it successfuly. but when will try to index the document.
It give the error as below:
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.create(FSDirectory.java:146)
        at org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.<init>(FSDirectory.java:126)
        at
org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.getDirectory(FSDirectory.java:102)
        at
org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.getDirectory(FSDirectory.java:83)
        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:173)
Which wrong? Pls help.

Thanks.
