DATE: 8 Aug 2005

Hi

Luceners

Apologies.....

As I have already replied,Using Analysis I have tried on all Analyzers
(including Standard Analyzer)
But not able to achive the required COMPLETS WORD Split.

My I/p String would be a lengthy one as below

String sKey = "\"" + "Dough Cutting" + "\"" +  "  " +  "Otis Gospodnetic"  +
"   " +
              "\"" + "Erik Hatcher" + "\""  + "  " +	"Authors of " + "\"" +
"Lucene In Action" + "\"";

The required split of complete words should return

   1) "Dough Cutting"
   2) Otis Gospodnetic
   3) "Erik Hatcher"
   4) Authors of
   5) "Lucene In Action"

Plz Note :- Words with "\"" are complete split words....

I am shure some Analyzer code inside Lucene is handling this task.


som how can one achive this task..

with regards
Karthik

The StandardAnalyzer should work just fine with it, It will break the
search string to 5 search terms.

Hi Luceners

Apologies.....

I  have along Search String as given below...



SearchWord =  "\"" + "Dough Cutting" + "\"" +  "  " +  "Otis
Gospodnetic"  +  "   " + "\"" + "Erik Hatcher" + "\""  + "  " +
                           "Authors of " + "\"" + "Lucene In Action"
+"\"";

And prior to searching the Index ,I need the Words to be Split.

SearchWord   =

   1)   "\"" + "Dough Cutting" + "\""
   2)   "Otis Gospodnetic"
   3)  "\"" + "Erik Hatcher" + "\""
   4)  "Authors of "
   5) "\"" +"Lucene In Action" +"\""

I am shure some Analyzer within Lucene is performin the task.
So some body please Tell me Howto

[ I already used Analysis/Paralysis code to check ,but no help ]




WITH WARM REGARDS
HAVE A NICE DAY
