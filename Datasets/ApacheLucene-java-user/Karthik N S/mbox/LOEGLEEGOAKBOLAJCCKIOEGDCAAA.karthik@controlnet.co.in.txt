================== End Searching ============


The o/p says a hit of 67 in total  [ I have sniped out most of them for view
case ] , the search word is present in field "Contents"
where the content part of html file is indexed.

If u see the Field  " File Name" it's Unique and is  indexed/ Viewed /  as
per Windows O/s Explore case.

My Question now is, If I want to Use Range Query  to  get search hits
between
fileName "B10181_P702"  and   "B10181_P355" only Instead of all the 67 hits
,

How Do I do it [Please state with clear Example or send me an attachement
for the same ,
  I overrided  the getRange() Query  method as per u'r last mail ,but still
not able to achive the Results  ].




with regards
Karthik

A range query will provide a range of indexed values, and
I thought you needed to add the record number as an indexed field
in each record.

However, you seem to use the 200 and 400 here as the order number
for each record in the result of the query on the Contents field.
Is that correct?
When so, in which order do you expect the results of your query?

Kind regards,
Ype
