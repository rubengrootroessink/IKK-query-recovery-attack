Hi
     Guys

Apologies..........


I was Curious to Know the Difference between ParallelMultiSearcher  and
MultiSearcher ,

1) Is the working internal functionality of these  are  same or different .

2) In terms of time domain do these differ when searching same no of  fields
/ words .

3)What are the features used on each of  API.


Thx in advance


      WITH WARM REGARDS
      HAVE A NICE DAY
