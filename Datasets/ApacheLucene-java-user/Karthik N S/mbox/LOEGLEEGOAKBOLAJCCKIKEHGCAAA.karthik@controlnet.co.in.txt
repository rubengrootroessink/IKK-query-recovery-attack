DATE: 3 Jun 2004

Hey

   Ype the Query  of range

   +button +shirt +filename:[b10181_p100 TO b10181_p200]

  did not work for me but on other way around

  +(button OR shirt) +filename:[b10181_p100 TO b10181_p200]

  resulted to me in 2 hits with either one term  "button / shirt "  in each
page,but not both of them

 I found from the Html file that both words are present  in more then 2
files,

 Are there any other possibilities  for getting both words.


with regards
Karthik

You can also try this:

+button +shirt +filename:[b10181_p100 TO b10181_p200]

I never got to completely understand the way the query parser deals with
AND and OR, so I prefer to avoid them.
