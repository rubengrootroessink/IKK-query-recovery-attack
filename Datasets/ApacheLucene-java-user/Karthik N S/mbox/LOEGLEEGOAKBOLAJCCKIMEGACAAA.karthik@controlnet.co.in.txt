DATE: 28 May 2004


Hey Erik

  Apologies again

 [ You probably do not want to use Field.Text for a filename.  Use
Field.Keyword instead. ]

1)  When changing the Field type from Text to Keyword, I do not get the hits
at all
     [Since most of parameters avaliable to this  Field  are of String type
... file[i].getName() ]

2) On successfull Indexing  the search   hits retun me  400  numbers on
various html files
     presence of the SearchWord in content Field.


3) If I have to limit the hits between file name (file[100].getName()   and
file[200].getName() )
    on the Field  type  "filename" for the SearchedWord.


I did the way YPE  advised in his last mail but still no improvement in
sitution.


I need to get  hit samples  in between the  2 files  [ 100 files  between ]
 and not the max no of hits.

Please  advise me
How do I proceed....



4)
  I Installed luke [ via Java webstart ]  from
http://www.getopt.org/luke/webstart.html
  but since my Index files are built on a custom made Analyzer [ not the set
of standard analyzer avaliable from drop box] ,
 Will it search the index  for the same.



with regards
Karthik

You probably do not want to use Field.Text for a filename.  Use
Field.Keyword instead.

Now use Luke (Google for _luke lucene_) to browse your index, and check
that you are getting what you think.  You can do ad-hoc queries there
also.

If you want the first 200 - 400, start your Hits walking at index 200,
and proceed through 400.

Is there some field you want to key off to do the range?  Or do you
just want the 200th - 400th hits from the search, which is an entirely
different question than about ranges.

Please send (succinct) code examples in the future to really keep this
discussion concrete and clear.
