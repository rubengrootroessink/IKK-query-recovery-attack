Hi

Guys


Apologies..........


The Task for me is to build the Index folder using Lucene &  a simple
Build.xml  for ANT

The Problem ...... Same 'Build .xml'  should be used for differnet O/s...
[ Win / Linux ]

The glitch is  respective jar files such as Lucene-1.4 .jar & other jar
files are not in same dir for the O/s.
Also the  I/p , O/p Indexer path for source/target may also vary.


Please Somebody Help me..... :(



with regards
Karthik




      WITH WARM REGARDS
      HAVE A NICE DAY
