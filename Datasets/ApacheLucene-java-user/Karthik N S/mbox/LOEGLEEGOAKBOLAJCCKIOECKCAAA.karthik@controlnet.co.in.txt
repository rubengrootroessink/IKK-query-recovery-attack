Hey
    Have a look at the  "org.apache.lucene.demo.html.Test.java" in Lucene
1.3 final
   u can strip out the Title or summary from the HTML Page and add it to
relative Index field.

I don't understand that.
You get the document object which does not contain the documents field
contents. It just provides access to this data.
It's up to you which fields you access.
And remember that you don't have to store fields at all, if you don't need
to retrieve them (e.g. because the original documents are somewhere else).
