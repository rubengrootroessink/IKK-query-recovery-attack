Hi Guys

Is there a way around for which the query parser would  have something like
this

   (+digital +camera +optics) -(All other Default variables)

But a run time Once cannot determine the default values.

I am stuck in between for this cause ........  :(D

You cannot get just the 3rd document.
If you set default operator to AND in queryparser, then you will the 3rd
and the 6th document.

your query must look like:

+digital +camera +optics

 Best,
