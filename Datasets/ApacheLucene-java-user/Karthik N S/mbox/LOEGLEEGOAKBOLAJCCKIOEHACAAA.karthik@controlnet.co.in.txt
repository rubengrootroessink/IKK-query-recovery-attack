SUBJECT: Range Query Sombody HELP please
DATE: 2 Jun 2004


Hey Ype/Erick

Thx in advance in helping me for the Range of Queries.
Finally I was able to trace the wrong process within my code and closed
them.

I still have 3 small Questions.

1)While creating the Range Query Is it possible for Lucene to do somthing
similar..

     +(button AND shirt) +filename:[b10181_p100 TO b10181_p200]

     [Do you think this will work]  It's not on returning hits , but it does
return hits with either one of them  "Shirt" or "button" Only.

2)When the indexer start indexing does it do according to alphabetic order
or is it some other way...

3)The Field Type  "Keyword"  is not accepting name of Files as it indexes
   [ Try indexing filenames and then do a search on them ,the hits will
return u 0 defnitly,  lucene1.3-final version ]

     doc.add(Field.Text("filename",file.getName()))
          < --------------------  Will return Hits

    doc.add(Field.Keyword("filename",file.getName()))
<--------------------  Will Not return Hits


 why???



with regards
Karthik

Just make sure the file name is indexed as you show it,
ie. the underscore should be in the indexed term.
The best way to do that is to index the filename as keyword.
Check the output of the analyzer, or use luke to see what is in the index
for the filename field.

Could you try this:

+button +filename:[b10181_p355 TO b10181_p702]

?
If this does not work, please narrow your problem down to a java test
program
of 10-20 lines, and post the code.

Ype
