SUBJECT: BOOLEAN OPERATOR HOWTO
DATE: 18 Jul 2005



Hi

Lucene

Apologies......................

I have 2 Questions.

1) The Search Criteria  src  requires to automatically fill   "  "  between
Search words with a Boolean Operator   "  AND ".


2) The Search Criteria  src  requires to automatically recognise the
existing  Boolean Query  ' AND , + '  present and append the same
     with  out any manupulations.

Ex : -
Search Word  =

'Lucene in Action Erik hatcher and  Otis  + Gospodnetic '   =   lucene AND
action AND Eric  AND hatcher AND otis + gospodnetic .


How to Achieve this , Is there any mechanism built into Lucene to handle
such situations.



Thx in Advance.


WITH WARM REGARDS
HAVE A NICE DAY
