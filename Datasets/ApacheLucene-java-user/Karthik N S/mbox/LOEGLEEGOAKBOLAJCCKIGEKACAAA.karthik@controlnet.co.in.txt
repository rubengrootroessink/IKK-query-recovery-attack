Hey Guys



Sombody please tell me why the  "[pad]" is been displayed between words  on
searching the indexed file


   Content : Digital Cameras[pad][Digital Cameras][pad][EZ Dual Cam USB
Digital Video/Still Camera][pad... Cam USB Digital


   How do I  correct this problem

  [Note: -   I am using the Highlighter package from the Sandbox for
highlighting the required word from an html  ]

Hey
Lucene-Developers

I was broswing thru CVS  and found the SRC for  "IndexWriter2.java  written
by Ivaylo Zlatev on feb 2002,

My concern is, Does this piece of code  really work ,

if so  state an example [ present Lucene-final 1.3 version ]
           or
Is it  discarded from the [ present Lucene-final 1.3 version ]


The Tecnique of using RAMDirectory, my Query has really become faster access
,
So hence plan to use it  during Indexing process also.
