Hi Guys

  Finally with lot's experimentation, I came to know that

    A word  such as  'new'  already present in  Analyzer, 

    will  not return  any hits [ Even when enclosed with Quotes "\""]

    such as  "New Year"....


   That's really Intresting....    :(


Thx
Karthik

Whether this is a "bug" or not is really for your users to determine :) 
  But it is absolutely the expected behavior.  QueryParser analyzes the 
expression too.  Even if you somehow changed QueryParser, if you never 
indexed the word "new" then you certainly cannot expect to search on it 
and find it.
