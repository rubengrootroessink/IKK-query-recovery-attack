Hi guys

Apologies.............



I am still in delima on How to use the HitCollector for returning  Hits hits
between scores  0.2f to 1.0f ,

There is not a simple example for the same, yet lot's of talk on usage for
the same on the form.

Please somebody spare a bit of code (u'r intelligence) on this form.





Thx in advance
Karthik

























      WITH WARM REGARDS
      HAVE A NICE DAY
