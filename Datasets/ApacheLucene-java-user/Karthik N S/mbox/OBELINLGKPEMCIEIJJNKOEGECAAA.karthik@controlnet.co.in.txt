Hi Guys

Apologies.........


a)Since the MRG [1,2,3 ] numbers are dynamic [ 1000 subindexes = 1 mergerindex ].

b)Hence during indexing Time, Cannot identify to whichever MERGEINDEX does the Index is inserted.

c)Also during House Keeping process,the latest Index replaces the previous ones for the same
MERGERINDEX.



  Any other solutions Please.


with regards
Karthik

As obvious as it may seem, you could always store the index ID in which 
you are indexing the document in the document itself and have that 
fetched with the search results, or is there something stopping you from 
doing that.
