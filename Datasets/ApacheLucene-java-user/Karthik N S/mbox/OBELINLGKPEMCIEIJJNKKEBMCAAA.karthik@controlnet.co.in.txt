Hi
Erik



Apologies...........


This mean's that Issues w.r.t 1.4.2 and 1.4.1 are fixed in 1.4.3 as of
presently,

1) So u say  We can retrospectively move our under Developemental Code from
to 1.4.3 from 1.4.1 safetly ?.

2) Do we need to Reindex All Of Our Code done via 1.4.1  or continue with
replacement of 1.4.3.jar alone ?.

3) Can we also Have some Announcement on the Form from time to time  when
ever the new and final Versions are released ?.



Thx in advance.
Karthik

Actually Lucene 1.4.3 is now available and I recommend you use it
instead, through the official Jakarta binary downloads.  We're still
tidying up some loose ends on it before officially announcing it, but
you can find it here:

	http://www.apache.org/dist/jakarta/lucene/binaries/

We did not release 1.4.1 or 1.4.2 properly, so those binaries are not
available there currently.  Whether we retroactively put them there is
still undecided.
