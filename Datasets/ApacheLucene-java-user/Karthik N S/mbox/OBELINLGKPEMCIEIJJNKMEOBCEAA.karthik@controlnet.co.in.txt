Hi Luceners

Apologies.....

I  have along Search String as given below...



SearchWord =  "\"" + "Dough Cutting" + "\"" +  "  " +  "Otis Gospodnetic"  +
"   " + "\"" + "Erik Hatcher" + "\""  + "  " +
                           "Authors of " + "\"" + "Lucene In Action" +"\"";

And prior to searching the Index ,I need the Words to be Split.

SearchWord   =

   1)   "\"" + "Dough Cutting" + "\""
   2)   "Otis Gospodnetic"
   3)  "\"" + "Erik Hatcher" + "\""
   4)  "Authors of "

HAVE A NICE DAY
