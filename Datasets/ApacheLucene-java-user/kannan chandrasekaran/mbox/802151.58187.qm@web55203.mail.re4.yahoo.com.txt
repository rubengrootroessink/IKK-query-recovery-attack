DATE: 28 May 2010

I am just trying out a few experiments to calculate similarity between terms based on their
co-occurences in the dataset...  Basically I am trying to build contextual vectors  and calculate
similarity using a similarity measure ( say cosine similarity)..... 

I dont think this is an XY problem . The vectors I am trying to build are not the same as
the TermVectors option ((term,freq) pairs per document) in the lucene ( if thats what u meant)


Thanks
Kannan

OK, let's back up a level. WHY are you building these
vectors? Where I'm going with this is I wonder if this
is an XY problem, see:
