SUBJECT: How to get the number of unique terms in the inverted index
DATE: 27 May 2010

Hi All,

I was wondering  if there is a way to retrieve the number of unique terms in the lucene (
version 2.4.0) ... I am aware of the terms() && terms(Term) method that returns an
enumeration (TermEnum) but that involves iterating through the terms and couting them.  I
looking for something similar to numdocs() in the IndexReader class.  

Please help.

Thanks
Kannan
