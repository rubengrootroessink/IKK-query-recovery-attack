<grin> Yes we have got one or two parsers floating around somewhere or other
;)

Unfortunately, I'm unlikely to be able to tap into these before next version
of the product I'm working on (can't say too much because of the nda etc),
and so for now I'm having to make do with a basic text search. I'll give the
whitespace analyzer a try and see if I get any better results.

Thanks,
Iain

Ummm..... nevermind that last question... I just realized where you 
work!  :)

So, my recommendation would be to tap into some parser for the COBOL 
language that you have handy and have it feed your Analyzer 
appropriately.  Or, use something very very simple like the 
WhitespaceAnalyzer as a first try.
