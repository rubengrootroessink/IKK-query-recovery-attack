SUBJECT: Problem in building Lucene
DATE: 13 Sep 2007

I have to change lucene code for some reason.

I changed the source code of the lucene and ran the ant command on build.xml.

it created a jar file in build directory then i added the jar file to
my project in eclipse .

I am facing a bizarre problem now. Changes i have made in source code
are not reflected in new jar file..

Any help in this regards..please

Thanks
Sandeep
