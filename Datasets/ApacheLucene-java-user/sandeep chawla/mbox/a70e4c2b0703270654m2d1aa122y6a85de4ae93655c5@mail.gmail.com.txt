SUBJECT: Re: Synonyms and Aliases query
DATE: 27 Mar 2007

in a synonym Engine...

suppose  synonyms of word x is syn(x)...

then if  y = syn(x) then  x = syn(y)  doesn't hold true always  .....(
you might not get any synonyms of y..it depends on the data of synonym
engine)

so your synonym engine might be providing alias of bob as  robert,
rob, bobby... so when you search for bob, you are getting results
which contain robert,rob,bobby etc ( I am assuming that you are using
the synonymanalyzer for parsing the queries not for building the index
because if u r using synonymanalyzer for building the index, it
reduces the performance by a great degree)


When u r searching for robert and your synonym engine doesn't provide
any synonyms for roberts as bob, bobby ...you will not get the desired
result  so you need to rewrite your engine so that it satisfies the
above condition
