SUBJECT: reg-ex based stop word removal
DATE: 22 Aug 2007

Hi  ,

I am working on a search application . This application requires me to
implement a stop filter
using a stop word list. I have implemented a stop filter using lucene's API.

I want to take my application one step further.

I want to remove all the words which match a particular regular expression.

For Ex- if my  expression is a?d. I should be able to remove words
like  "and", "ad" ,"abd",
"acd"  etc etc.

I would appreciate any help/suggestions in this matter

thanks
sandeep
