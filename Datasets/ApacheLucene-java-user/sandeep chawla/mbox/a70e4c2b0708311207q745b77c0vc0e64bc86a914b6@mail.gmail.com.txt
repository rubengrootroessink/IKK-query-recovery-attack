Which analyzer are you using in your query parser ?

can you share the one line of code in which you construct a QueryParser Object.

As you might be  parsing  a  query string made of different fields, I
suggest you use a

PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper  which lets you do unique analysis for different fields.
