If you are talking about Aramorph for Java 
(http://www.nongnu.org/aramorph/english/index.html), you are on the 
wrong track. Aramorph is a *morphological* analyzer that takes into 
account the structure of the arabic language, which is totally different 
from farsi.

The difference between arabic and farsi is the same as the one between 
icelandic and turkish : they "just" share the same alphabet excepted "a 
few" diacritics :-)

Cheers,

p.b.
