You may assign a type to the tokens, and then you may filter them 
according to their type *but* the index forgets this info since it 
stores *terms* (field/value pairs).

Compare :
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Token.html
and
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/Term.html

Notice however that the terms have also their relative position (the 
Token's positionIncrement, default = 1) stored in the index ; this 
allows proximity searches.

So... how to do ?

1) use a dedicated field "chem" where only chemical content is allowed 
(filter out every token whose type is different from "chem")
2) manipulate your termText : "chem_H2" ; the same for your queries
3) play with the query rather than with the index content : filter out 
what is not chemical

There may be other solutions...

Cheers,

p.b.
