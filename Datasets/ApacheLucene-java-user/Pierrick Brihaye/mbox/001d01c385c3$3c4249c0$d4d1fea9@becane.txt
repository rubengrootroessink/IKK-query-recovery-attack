Yes... but you'll have to wait :-)

And also on this point. The 2 CLI programs are rather "demonstration"
programs than real test cases that could demonstrate the current pending
issues.

Yes... at least in the source files that are based on my own work.

As I said, it is based on Tim's Buckwalter work : original Perl program as
well as those precious dictionary files.

:-/ How can we do, so ? Shall I split the packages in two parts ? No
problems for the "Lucene bindings". But there could be one for the aramorph
package (java port of the original work), which is based on work originally
ruled by the GPL...

Cheers,
