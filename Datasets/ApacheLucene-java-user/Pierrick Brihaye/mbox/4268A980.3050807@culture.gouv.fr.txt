Well... 100 to 103 are offsets provided by the reader (an are thus 
usually offsets in the source file). These offsets may help you to make 
some computations but they are lost when the token is indexed.

a compound. How can I do that?

Dirty solution : use wildcard queries (chem_H20-*).

Smart solution :

consider that you have "words", i.e. chem_H2O followed by chem_CH2 
(strange enough ;-)... and make some phrase queries or 
MultiPhraseQueries. See :

http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/TestPhraseQuery.java?rev=150740&view=markup
http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/TestMultiPhraseQuery.java?rev=150733&view=markup

Setting the phrase slop may help you.

You may also want to play with the position of the tokens to 
allow/prevent hits from your PhraseQuery. Give your Tokens a relevant 
positionIncrement. See : 
http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/TestPositionIncrement.java?rev=150585&view=markup
