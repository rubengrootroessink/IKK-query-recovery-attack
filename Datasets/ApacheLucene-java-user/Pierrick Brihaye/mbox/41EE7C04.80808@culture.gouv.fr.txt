Interesting.

Do you plan to add expansion on other Wordnet relationships ? Hypernyms 
and hyponyms would be a good start point for thesaurus-like search, 
wouldn't it ?

However, I'm afraid that this kind of feature would require refactoring, 
probably based on WordNet-dedicated libraries. JWNL 
(http://jwordnet.sourceforge.net/) may be a good candidate for this.

Thank you for your work.

Cheers,
