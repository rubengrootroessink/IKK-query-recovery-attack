Aramorph for Java, which is an arabic Analyzer that provides a Lucene
interface, feeds the token type
(http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Token.html#type())
with a (possible) POS label. See
http://www.nongnu.org/aramorph/english/lucene.html.

This token type may (and actually is) be used to filter "empty" words.

Cheers,

p.b.
