Well... the ideal case would be (easy) customization :-), form an 
external text (XML ?) file. Depending of the kind of relationship, the 
boost factor could be adjusted when the query is expanded. The same on 
relationships' depths.

For example a "father" hypernym could have a boost factor of 0.8, a 
"grand-father" a boost factor of 0.4, a "grand-grand-father" a boost 
factor of 0.2. Well, I wonder whether a logarithmic scale makes a better 
sense than a linear scale, but this should/would be customizable...

One thing you can also easily get from this library are Wordnet's 
"exceptions", often irregular plurals (mouse/mice, addendum/addenda...). 
A very basic yet efficient kind of stemming which should be expanded 
with the same boost factor than the original term.

Well, there are many other relationships in WordNet. Take a look at :
