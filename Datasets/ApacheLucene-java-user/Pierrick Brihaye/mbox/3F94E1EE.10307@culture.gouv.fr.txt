I think so :-) Well... my arabic analyzer is based on this functionnality.

The basic idea is to have several tokens at the same position (i.e. 
setPositionIncrement(0)) which are different possible stems for the same 
word.

Correct !

I've made a dirty patch for the QueryParser which is able to handle 
tokens with positionIncrement equal to 0 or 1 (see bug #23307). It still 
needs some work, but it fits my needs :-)

Who knows ? I may be interesting  to keep track of the *presence* of 
"empty words", e.g. "[the] sky [is] blue", "[the] sky [is] [really] 
blue", "[the] sky [is] [that] [really] blue". The traditionnal reduction 
to "sky blue" is maybe over-simplistic for some cases...

Well, just an idea.

Cheers,
