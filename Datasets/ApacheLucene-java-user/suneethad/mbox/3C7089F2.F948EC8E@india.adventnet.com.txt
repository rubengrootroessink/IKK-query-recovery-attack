Hi,
        I've got a very strange problem.I've indexed my database based
on certain fields .But the search on one particular field has failed coz
It contains a  ":"  .I'm using a Boolean query to retrieve the results.
        Can somebody help me out please............

Thanks in Advance,
Suneetha
