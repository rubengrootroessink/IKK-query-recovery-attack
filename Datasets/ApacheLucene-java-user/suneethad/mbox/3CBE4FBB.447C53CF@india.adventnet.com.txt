DATE: 18 Apr 2002

Hi,
        I'm currently indexing allowing  multiple access , I find that a
write.lock file has got created.
I know this is to prevent  multiple writers, but now how do I
continue.??I  do not want to reindex as I work on a very large database
and it takes a real long time How do I remove this lock file ??

Thanx 4 ur help,
Suneetha.
