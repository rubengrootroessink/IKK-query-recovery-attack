SUBJECT: Newbie questions re: scoring
DATE: 4 May 2006

Hi,

I am new to Lucene and this mailing list, so my apologies if these
questions have already been answered.

1)  I create an index with one document with a searchable field of "All
dogs are brown."  If I search on that index with a query of "All dogs
are brown." I do not get a hit with score 1.0, but something low like
0.38.  I tried looking at the scoring algorithm and can't make heads or
tails of it.  Can anybody explain it to me in simple terms?

2)  I have an index of documents, then run a search against it.  I run
through the list of hits, building a Vector of documents whose score is
above a certain threshold.  If I run the program with a threshold of
say, 0.15, I'll get a Vector of documents with scores >= 0.15 (as
expected).  If I set the threshold higher (0.30, for example) and rerun
the program, I see some of the same documents that I thought would have
been trimmed off with the higher threshold.  With a threshold of 0.15
they would score 0.17, and with a threshold of 0.30 they are scoring
something like 0.33.  Can anybody explain this?  My trimming is coming
post-index-searching, so this is pretty confusing.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Andrew Lee
