SUBJECT: Lucene code injection?
DATE: 24 May 2007

Hi,

I indexed emails. And now i want to restrict the search functionality for
users so they only can search for emails to/from him.

i know the email address of the user so my plan is to do it in the following
way:
The user enters some search parameters, they are combined in a query.
This is a mix of TermQueries and WildcardQueries combined with 
BooleanQueries.

This query i will combine with a TermQuery which include only hits with 
the email
address of the user. (parameter-query) AND (emailaddress-query)

Is this good practice?
And is this save?
Or can a user do some kind of code injection to get other emails?
