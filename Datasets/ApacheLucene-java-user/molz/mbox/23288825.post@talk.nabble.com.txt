Hi Micheal,

Thanks for trying out Kamikaze for starters. So I guess there are a few
issues here

1. getDocSetInstance(int min, max, count,DocSetFactory.FOCUS) assumes that
count < max. I guess thats an API check we should add anyways to improve
usability. That is not to say that it will not work if count > max but we
have not done the due diligence on that one.

2. The way you are inserting the elements is not quite right. The addDoc
method assumes you insert the elements in a sorted fashion. Calling
doc.addDoc(rand.nextInt(maxDoc) does not quite ensure you are loading the
docSet in a sorted fashion. This is specially useful in BitSet and P4D set
cases as P4D encodes only delta values between conscutive integers.

3. I would recommend using FOCUS.OPTIMAL for best performance/space
tradeoff, albeit SPACE should work too, if you find any issues with that let
us know, we will be glad to fix it.

4. Finally, I believe you want to just get a plain vanilla docSet from one
of the OR/AND sets. This would be cool to do, however the idea with Boolean
Sets are that they are never really materialized, they are iterated over on
the fly. I believe we could do an enhancement to construct the docSet on the
fly while iterating the Boolean DocSet but as of now there is no established
way of doing that.

Hope I covered all your concerns. I rewrote and run your test case like this

public class KamikazeTest extends TestCase
{
    public void testGrowingP4()
    {
        DocSet doc =
            DocSetFactory.getDocSetInstance(0, 35000000, 200000,
DocSetFactory.FOCUS.SPACE);
        Random rand = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
       // int maxDoc = 3500000;
        //doc.addDoc(0);
        
        int i = 0;
        try
        {
            while(i < 500000)
            {
                int nextDoc = i;
                doc.addDoc(nextDoc);
                i+=rand.nextInt(50);
            }              
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return;
        }
        assertTrue(true);
       
    }
    
   
}
