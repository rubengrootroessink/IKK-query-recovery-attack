SUBJECT: MoreLikeThis from a field with a specific value
DATE: 15 Jul 2008


Hi there... 

im trying to get MoreLikeThis documents from my lucene index given a
sentence... just one line of text lets say... but i also want to get the
returned results only where a field has a specific value.... 

so for example if i have my index and it contains a categoryId and
content... i would like to get results where content is like blah blah blah
and categoryId = 1 or 2.. etc... 

my more like this like method is returning something like this:
content:blah content:blah content:blah +categoryId:2

but when this is run, its returning EVERYTHING from this category....

when i leave out the +categoryId: , i am getting related results depending
on the content. 

can anyone help inform me as to why its returning everything?
