Does anyone have examples of using Carrot2? I've been looking into it
lately and am not finding good documentation.

Have you looked into using Carrot2 (it is on sourceforge...)

Hi,

For final finish up on work for my project. We intend to do search
clustering. Now I have already read that there is no clear cut way of
doing that in lucene.

Wondering, if anyone has tackled this problem with time constraint as
one issue.

With turn around time of 3 sec clustering 5000 search results by
different criterion seems like a touch nut

regards

Supreet
