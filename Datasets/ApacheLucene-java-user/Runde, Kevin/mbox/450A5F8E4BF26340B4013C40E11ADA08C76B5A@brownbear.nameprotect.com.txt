Hi All,

How does Lucene handle multi term queries? Does it use short circuiting?
So if a user entered:
(a OR b) AND c
But my program knew testing for "c" is cheaper than testing for "(a OR
b)" and I rewrote the query as:
c AND (a OR b)
Would the query run faster?

Sorry if this has already be answered, but for some reason the Archive
search is not working for me today.

Thanks,
Kevin
