Also there is a book called "Lucene in Action" that was released
recently. It is a great introduction to Lucene and has sections
dedicated to indexing different text document types (txt, html, pdf,
doc, rtf). FYI I am in no way related to the book or the authors so this
is a real recommendation. It will help you quickly learn what Lucene is
and can do. It has lots of pointers to other projects that use Lucene or
expand upon it's functionality.

Thanks,
Kevin

Lucene indexes text documents, so you will need to convert your PDF to a
text document.  PDFBox (http://www.pdfbox.org/) can do that, PDFBox
provides a summary of the document, which is just the first x number of
characters.  If you wanted a smarter summary you would need to create
that
yourself.

There are tutorials available on the website, and I would recommend
the "Lucene in Action" book.  There is a learning curve for lucene, but
it
sounds like your requirements are pretty basic so it shouldn't be that
hard.
