Hello,

I recently came across this email in the Lucene user list and am
interested in this article. I tried to access it from the link you
provided, but couldn't find any link to access it. Do you still have an
electronic copy?

Thanks,
Kevin Runde

I know of one I used for my Thesis. The REF is:
Fuhr, N. 2001, "Models in information retrieval", , pp. 21-50.

http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=567294

I may have a electronic version. If you need it give me an email address
as 
this service doesn't allow attachments.

Hope this helps,

Malcolm Clark
