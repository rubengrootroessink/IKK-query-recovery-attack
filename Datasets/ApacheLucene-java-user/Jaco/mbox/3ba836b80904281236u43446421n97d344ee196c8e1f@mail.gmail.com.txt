SUBJECT: Re: Getting matched words for PhraseQuery or SpanNearQuery
DATE: 28 Apr 2009

Hi Mark,

Thanks for that - after wading through some source code in the highlighter
package and reading more docs I managed to get out the info I needed by
getting the start and end token position of each span found and subsequently
getting the words back out of the TokenStream that I initially created.

Thanks again, bye,

Jaco.
