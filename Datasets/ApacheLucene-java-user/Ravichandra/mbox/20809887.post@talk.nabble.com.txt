SUBJECT: Re: Problem with special charecters
DATE: 3 Dec 2008


Hi 

I tried that approach, I did used escaping using the "\", and the query has
the special charecter, but i got no results that time. 

What I found out was when I use Standard Analyzer on "ABC+S", the terms
generated are "ABC" and "S" and '+' is getting lost. 
When I used whitespaceAnalyzer or keywordAnalyzer (or use standardanalyzer
but don't analyze this field), it is working, but it is case sensitive. 

Can anybody suggest me how to use Whitespaceanalyzer/keywordanalyzer along
with lowecase filter 
or 
how to make Standardanalyzer not to generate tokens based on these special
chrecters. 

Thanks
