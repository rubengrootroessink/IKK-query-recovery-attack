no luck.
ryan@posh:~$ ls -l /array/home/nestor/data2/flat/index/_cf9.fnm
ls: /array/home/nestor/data2/flat/index/_cf9.fnm: No such file or directory


I'm backing up the broken index now and will try:

1. run optimize and hope for the best
2. LUCENE-1020

and then hope for the best.

The index takes ~week to build so even having something with a block of 
stuff missing is better then zero (or gulp, our last backup)

thanks
ryan
