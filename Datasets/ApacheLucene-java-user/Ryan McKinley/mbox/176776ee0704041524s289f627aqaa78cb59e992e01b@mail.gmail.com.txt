SUBJECT: distinct term values?
DATE: 4 Apr 2007

Is there an efficient way to know how many distinct terms there are
for a given field name?

I know I can walk through a TermEnum and put them into a hash, but it
would be useful to know beforehand if you are going to get 4 distinct
values or 40,000

I don't need to know what the terms are, just how many.

name:A
name:A
name:B

I want a function like:
  getDistinctTermValues( "name" ) -> 2

Thanks
ryan
