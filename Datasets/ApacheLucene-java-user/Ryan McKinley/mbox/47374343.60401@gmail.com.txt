I just used the CheckIndex tool to try to salvage a corrupt index 
(http://www.nabble.com/restoring-a-corrupt-index--tf4783866.html)

Its a great tool thanks!

I'm wondering about adding support for this tool in the solr admin 
interface, but have a few questions about how it works before I see if 
that is a good idea or not.

Would it be safe to run this tool while searching the index?
Would it be safe to run during an update?

thanks
ryan
