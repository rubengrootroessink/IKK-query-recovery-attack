SUBJECT: restoring a corrupt index?
DATE: 10 Nov 2007

Using solr, we have been running an indexing process for a while and 
when I checked on it today, it spits out an error:

java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: 
/path/to/index/_cf9.fnm (No such file or directory)
	at org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore.getSearcher(SolrCore.java:584)
	at org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore.getSearcher(SolrCore.java:475)

Looking through the archives, it looks like we are up a creek.

Any thoughts on what could have caused this?  The log files contains 
some 'too many open files' errors, I can't tell if that corresponds with 
when the index went bad though.

the startup script includes:
  ulimit -n 100000
which seems generous, no?

it is a 22GB index, ls -l | wc shows 180K files (oh my)

So my questions:

1. Anything I can do to use this index while I rebuild another? (takes a 
long time!)

2. Does the ulimit number explain how the index got corrupted?  If so, 
it seems like a problem.


thanks
ryan
