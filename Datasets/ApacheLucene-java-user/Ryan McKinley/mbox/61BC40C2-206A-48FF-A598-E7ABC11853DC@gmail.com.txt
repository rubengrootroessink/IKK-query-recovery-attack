DATE: 16 Jan 2009

The PMC is pleased to announce that Patrick O'Leary has been voted to  
be a a Lucene-Java Contrib committer.

Patrick has contributed a great foundation for integrating spatial  
search with lucene.  I look forward to future development in this area.

Patrick - traditionally we ask you to send out an introduction to the  
community; its nice for folks to get a sense for who everyone is.   
Also check that your new svn karma works by adding yourself to the  
list of contrib committers.

Welcome Patrick!
