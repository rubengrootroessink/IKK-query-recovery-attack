(I am not familiar enough with the segment internals, so I may be way  
off base...)

Perhaps each segment has its own r-tree.  For each query, the r-tree  
would only be used to say if something could be in the results, it  
does not contribute to the score, so I don't think interleaving would  
be any different then how it currently works (without knowing how it  
currently works)  Potentially, the node depth could influence the  
score, but lets ignore that for now :)
