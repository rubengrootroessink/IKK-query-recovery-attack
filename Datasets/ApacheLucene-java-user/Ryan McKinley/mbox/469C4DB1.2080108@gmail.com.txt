out of the box, solr supports query filters.  check:
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CommonQueryParameters#head-6522ef80f22d0e50d2f12ec487758577506d6002

If you have custom queries you need to make and using the standard 
interface is not sufficient, it is relatively easy to write a custom 
request handler.  Assuming you are used to working with lucene, writing 
a custom handler should be straight forward.
