Thanks for the reply. Good guess I think.

DB (Index) is basically a collection of encyclopedia documents. Queries are
also a collection of documents but of various domains. My task is to find
out for each "query document" top 100 matching encyclopedia contents.

I tried by using only the title of (5-8 words) the query documents instead
of full text of the document. But that is also taking 0.5-1 sec for each
query. That's mean it will also take nearly 6 and half days to run
0.72Mqueries (and expectedly the precision will suffer).

Thanks,
Somnath
