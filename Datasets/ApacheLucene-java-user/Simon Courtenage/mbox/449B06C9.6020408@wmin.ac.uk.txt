You might also check out an old paper by Kruger, Giles, Lawrence et al. on
a search engine called Deadliner (see here at 
http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/papers/CIKM-2000-deadliner.pdf).
Deadliner crawled for Calls for Papers for conferences, using Support 
Vector Machines trained to
recognise relevant pages, and then applying sets of regular expressions 
to extract information
from the CFP pages.  Lawrence is now with Google, I believe.

Hope this helps,

Simon
