SUBJECT: Re: HTML text extraction
DATE: 21 Jun 2006

I also use htmlparser, which is rather good.  I've had to customize it, 
though, to parse strings containing
html source rather than accept urls of resources to fetch etc.  Also it 
crashes on meta tags that don't have
name attributes (something I discovered only a couple of days ago).
