SUBJECT: Unexpected end in indexing HTML file
DATE: 20 Jan 2004

Hi all,

Have a question concerning indexing of HTML files.

One of the files I'm trying to index have a <input type="image" ...> tag
that also contain a call to a javascript with a string argument that is
about 1300 characters long. At this point Lucene seems to stop indexing the
remaining part the current document, but do index the other files in the
same directory.

How do I workaround this?
