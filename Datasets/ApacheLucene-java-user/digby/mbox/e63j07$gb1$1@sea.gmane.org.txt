SUBJECT: Re: searching in more than fields on document
DATE: 6 Jun 2006

I was wondering this exact question, but MultiFieldQueryParser still 
requires you to specify the field names. In my application I don't know 
the field names (they're automatically generated from beans using 
BeanUtils.getProperties()), so I've resorted to concatenating all the 
fields into a single "content" field which I then search on (I also have 
the individual fields added too).

Would this be the correct approach for what I'm trying to do, or is 
there another "AllFieldsQueryParser" I could use?

TIA
