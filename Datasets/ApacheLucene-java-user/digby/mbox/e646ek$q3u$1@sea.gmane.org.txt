SUBJECT: Re: searching in more than fields on document
DATE: 6 Jun 2006

All sorted now. Of course, if I can loop through the properties of a 
bean to add them as fields to the document, then I can certainly do the 
same at query time to build the MultiFieldQueryParser. All done and 
working great.

Thanks for all your comments.
