DATE: 6 Jun 2006

Does everyone recommend getting this book? I'm just starting out with 
Lucene and like to have a book beside me as well as the web / this 
mailing list, but the book looks quite old now, has a 1-2 month delivery 
wait time here in the UK and is quite expensive. Is it worth waiting for 
a new edition perhaps?

Thanks,

Digby
