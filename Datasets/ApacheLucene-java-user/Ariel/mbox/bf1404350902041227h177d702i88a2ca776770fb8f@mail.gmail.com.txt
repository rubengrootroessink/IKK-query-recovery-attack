SUBJECT: How to index correctly taking in account the synonyms using Wordnet	???
DATE: 4 Feb 2009

Hi every body:

I am using wordnet to index my document taking in account the synonyms
with wordnet.
After I indexed the whole documents collections I made a query with
the word "snort" but documents that contain the word bird are
retrieved, I don't understand this because snort and bird are not
synonyms then Why are the documents that contain "bird" retrieved ???

Could help me to solve that problem ???

How do you index your documents using wordnet ???

Thanks in advance.
Regards
Ariel
