SUBJECT: How to get documents similar to other document ?
DATE: 11 Sep 2007

Hi every body:

My question is if there is an api function of lucene to obtain similar
documents to other document comparing the term frequence vector of a field
???
I supposed a lot of people have asked this before but I haven't found the
answer neither with google nor api lucene.
This could be a very useful functionality of the lucene api. I am using
lucene version 1.9
I hope you can help me.
Greetings.
Ariel
