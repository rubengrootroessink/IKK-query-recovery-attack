SUBJECT: How to search documents taking in account the dates ???
DATE: 19 Nov 2008

Hi everybody:

I need to make search with lucene 2.3.2, taking in account the dates,
previously when I build the index I create a date field where I stored the
year in which the document was created, at the search moment I would like to
retrieve documents that have been created before a Year or after a Year, for
example documents before 2002 year o after 2003 year.
It is possible to do that with lucene ???
Regards
Ariel
