SUBJECT: Re: Why is lucene so slow indexing in nfs file system ?
DATE: 10 Jan 2008

In a distributed enviroment the application should make an exhaustive use of
the network and there is not another way to access to the documents in a
remote repository but accessing in nfs file system.
One thing I must clarify: I index the documents in memory, I use
RAMDirectory to do that, then when the RAMDirectory reach the limit(I have
put about 10 Mb) then I serialize to disk(nfs) the index to merge it with
the central index(the central index is in nfs file system), is that correct?
I hope you can help me.
I have take in consideration the suggestions you have make me before, I
going to do some things to test it.
