SUBJECT: What is the percent of size of lucene's index ?
DATE: 23 Jul 2008

I need to know what is the percent of size of lucene's index respect the
information I'm going to index, I have read some articles that say if a I
index 120 Gb of information the index will grow until 40 Gb, that means the
percent is 30 %, Could somebody tell me how can be proved that ?
Is there any official document of apache lucene where says that ?
I hope somebody can help me.
Thanks.
Ariel
