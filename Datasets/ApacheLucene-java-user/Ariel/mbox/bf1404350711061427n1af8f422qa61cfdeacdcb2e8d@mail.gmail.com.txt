SUBJECT: How to build your custom termfreq vector an add it to the field ?
DATE: 6 Nov 2007

Hi:
I want to build a custom termfreq vector an add it to the field to store it
to the index.
I want to use lucene for research, I'm thinking to make some experimentation
so I need to store a term vector in a field in the index not based in the
frecuency of the term in the document instead of I want to use another
measure to get ranking improvements.
How can I do that. Is that posible with lucene ?
I will appreciate your help.
Greetings
