SUBJECT: Big problem with solr in an official server.
DATE: 19 Apr 2010

Hi everybody:

I have a big problem with solr in a server with the memory size it is using,
I would want to know how to configure it to use a limited memory size, I am
setting up Solr with "java -jar start.jar" command in an ubuntu server, the
process start.jar is using 7Gb of  memory in the server and it is affecting
considerably the performance of the server.
Could you help me please ???
Thanks in advance.
Regards
Ariel
