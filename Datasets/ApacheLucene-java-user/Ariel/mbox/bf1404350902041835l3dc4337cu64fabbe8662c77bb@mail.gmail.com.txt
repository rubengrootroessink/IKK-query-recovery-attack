SUBJECT: Re: How to index correctly taking in account the synonyms using	Wordnet ???
DATE: 5 Feb 2009

How can I see the senses of a word with wordnet ??? And How could I select
the most populars ???
Is there a way to make queries ignoring the synonyms I have added to the
index ???

I hope you can help me.

Regards
Ariel
