SUBJECT: Identifying Analyzers used in Microsoft's Lookout Lucene index for emails
DATE: 18 May 2006

For those who don't know Lookout is now a Microsoft
product based on a .net lucene port which indexes all
your Outlook mails.
(http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/download.html)

Lookout does a good job of integrating with Outlook
and periodically indexing the content but I'd like to
put a better search app on top using my own Java app.
I can open their index just fine using the latest java
Lucene release and (using Jacob) pop up matching
emails in Outlook.
To get things rolling further I need to work out what
analyzers they used to create the index. Has anyone
else already worked out what they use?


Cheers,
Mark
