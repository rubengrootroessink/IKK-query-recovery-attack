DATE: 6 Apr 2006

The XMLQueryParser in the contrib section also handles
Spans (as well as a few other Lucene queries/filters
not represented by the standard QueryParser).

Here's an example of a complex query from the JUnit
test ....

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SpanOr fieldName="contents">
 <SpanNear slop="8" inOrder="false" >		
  <SpanOr>
   <SpanTerm>killed</SpanTerm>
   <SpanTerm>died</SpanTerm>
   <SpanTerm>dead</SpanTerm>
  </SpanOr>
 <SpanOr>
 <!-- a less verbose way of declaring ORed
SpanTerms-->
  <SpanOrTerms>miner miners</SpanOrTerms>
  <SpanNear slop="6" inOrder="false">		
   <SpanTerm>mine</SpanTerm>					  
<SpanOrTerms>worker workers</SpanOrTerms>
  </SpanNear>
 </SpanOr>
 </SpanNear>	
  <SpanFirst end="10">
   <SpanOrTerms>fire burn</SpanOrTerms>
  </SpanFirst> 
</SpanOr>
