As of last week, yes. I changed the SpanQueries to
implement this method and then refactored the
Highlighter package's QueryTermExtractor to make use
of this (it radically simplified the code in there).
This change to rely on extractTerms also means that
the highlighter now works properly with classes like
FilteredQuery.


Cheers,
Mark
