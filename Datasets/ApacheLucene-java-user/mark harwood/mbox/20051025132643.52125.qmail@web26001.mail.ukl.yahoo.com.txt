It comes down to your choice of analyzer.

Don't forget your "all" field is broken down into
discreet terms by your choice of analyzer.

Most often, you will want to use the same analyzer at
query-time with the query parser to make sure the
user's input matches the stored document terms.
If you get it wrong (say using an analyzer that
doesn't lower-case) you'll find nothing:
  Kylie != kylie

If you aren't using a query parser and manually
constructing FuzzyQuery objects programmatically the
same logic applies (psueodocode): 
  new FuzzyQuery(new Term("Kylie")) != "kylie"

Hope this helps.
