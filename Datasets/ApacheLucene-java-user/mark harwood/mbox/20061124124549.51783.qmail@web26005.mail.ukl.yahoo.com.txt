Look in the latest SVN version - there is some new code for "Lazy field loading" i.e. not incurring
the hit for retrieving *all* fields if you only want to retrieve a subset from a document.
Not used it myself yet but it may be applicable.

If you *really* want all matching docs too then I wouldn't use Hits - I think it retains a
limited set of doc ids and will rerun your query whenever you page your way through it's limited
cache in order to get the next batch. Look at the HitCollector API instead.

To be honest though building an app which returns an unlimited volume
of PDF contents sounds like a good candidate for OutOfMemory exceptions
- are the results streamed in any way? Any buffering of the entire result could be a killer.

Cheers
Mark

I have just read in the API doc that going through the Hits returned is 
not really adviceable. However, I am not developing the final 
application, but a middleware that accesses Lucene, so I would not want 
to take the decision to cut the number of docs returned, but let the 
application do that. Is there any way to bypass this limitation?

Thanks!
