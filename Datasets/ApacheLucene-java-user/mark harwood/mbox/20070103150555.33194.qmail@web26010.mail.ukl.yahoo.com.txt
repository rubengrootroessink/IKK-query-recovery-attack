While we're talking movies etc - did anyone else have a stab at the Netflix prize using Lucene?
 ( http://www.netflixprize.com/  )

I did get onto the leaderboard (briefly) using a Lucene-based solution which involved loading
all 100 million movie reviews into a single RAMDirectory for fast processing/analysis. I found
the user/movie rating matrix could be represented in a very compact form by (ab)using Lucene
position info for rating values.
