Lucene 2454 includes an example of matching logic that  respects the structure 
in XML documents (see (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2454 )
The example class TestNestedDocumentQuery queries xhtml marked up with hResume 
syntax.

We don't have XQuery syntax support in a parser now (and may never) but you may 
find the "NestedDocumentQuery" class useful in moving Lucene away from "flat" 
documents to representing richer structures like XML.

Hello,

I'm a newbie to Lucene and before starting playing with it I would like to know 
whether it fits to my application.

I have a collection of XML documented demarcated with respect to a stable XML 
schema (WSDL definitions).

I wonder whether Lucene:

(1) provides full-text search over content of XML elements ?

(2) provides substring search over values of attributes of XML elements ?

(3) scores relevance of matching XML documents ?

(4) allows to identify (in matching document) XML elements with matched query 
terms and than navigate to parental/children nodes in XML ?structure ?

(5) provides a way to give more weight to some XML element types during 
relevance scoring ?


Best regards,
Maciej Gawinecki
