Subject: Get the preceding and following terms

Hello,

I'm trying to create a suggestion tool based on Lucene. From a term in 
the index, i'd like to know the terms that often precede and follow
 this 
term in the indexed documents (NOT according to the alphabetical
 order).

I know that Lucene stores the term positions but I don't know how to
 use 
this piece of information.

Thanks,

Fabrice
