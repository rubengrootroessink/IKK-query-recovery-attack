Yes, it is basically *all* the normal SQL
functionality but with the added option to mix in
scores from lucene queries to the criteria.

>From the example code:

select top 10 count(*) as numAds,pricePounds  from ads
where pricePounds <500 and lucene_query('table',id)>0
group by pricePounds order by numAds desc

This returns the top 10 most common prices for a table
(as in kitchen table, not SQL table). The database has
classified ad descriptions and prices so there's not
much meaningful to group on. A "category" column 
would be a better example for grouping but there isn't
one in the example data.


Cheers,
Mark
