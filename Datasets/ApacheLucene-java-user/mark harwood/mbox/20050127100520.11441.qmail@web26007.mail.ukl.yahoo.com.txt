When the highlighter.getBestFragments returns nothing
this is because there was no match found for query
terms in the TokenStream supplied.
This is nearly always because of Analyzer issues.
Check the post-analysis tokens produced for the query
and the tokens produced in the TokenStream passed to
the highlighter. The highlighter simply looks for
matches in the two sources of terms and uses the token
offsets to select the best sections of the supplied
text.

Cheers
Mark
