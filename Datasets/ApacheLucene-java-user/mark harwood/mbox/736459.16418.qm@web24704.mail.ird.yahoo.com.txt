Spring is pretty useful for managing and sharing resources - see what looks like a related
example here: http://croarkin.blogspot.com/2008/05/injecting-spring-bean-into-servlet.html

Thanks Minduagas,

So in Tomcat, is there a way to store a variable outside an individual Servlet in the ServletContext?
The API shows ServletContext.setAttribute and ServeletContext.getAttribtue. Would that be
a way to make an object application-bound?

Hi,

Servlets are stateless and they must extend
javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet, therefore I'm afraid the idea of
manager class is probably unrealistic.

The stuff you want to achieve normally works by either placing objects
into the HTTP session (user-bound) or attaching them to your
application context (application-bound).

Mindaugas
