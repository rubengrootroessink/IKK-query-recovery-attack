If it is only a performance benchmark you need (as opposed to ongoing synching) then it would
probably make life easier to read the original XML files from the file system (or first export
them from MarkLogic to the file system if they were created in MarkLogic).

From there it is a matter of iterating through all files and using Java's DOM or SAX apis
to read the file content and create appropriate Lucene documents programattically.
The example Java application that comes with Lucene shows how to traverse the file system.
Make sure you review the indexing/searching performance tips on the Lucene WIKI.
One of the SOLR-literate people may jump in at this point with a word or two on how this can
be mostly configured (rather than coded) using SOLR.

As ever, would be interested in your results.

Hello Mr. Harwood,
I am aware about in-built search capabilities but I like to get some performance benchmark.
One way I can do is the retrieve the content and index but I was looking for some optimal
approach incase someone already have similar situation.

That's probably more a question about MarkLogic APIs than it is about Lucene.
What APIs does MarkLogic provide for getting at the content e.g does it provide a JSR-170
standard interface ( http://www.slideshare.net/uncled/introduction-to-jcr )

I presume you have already ruled out the in-built MarkLogic search capabilities for some reason?

Hello Lucene users,
We have all our xml documents stored in a content management system from MarkLogic. Is there
any best approach to index these documents via lucene?
