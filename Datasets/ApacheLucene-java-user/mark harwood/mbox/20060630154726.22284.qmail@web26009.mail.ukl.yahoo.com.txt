SUBJECT: Any existing query types that support equivalent of  "-not interested" ?
DATE: 30 Jun 2006

As an example - I want to search for the word "interested" without finding docs that have "not"
immediately preceding it.

I couldn't see anything in SpanQuerys that would help and you can't construct phrase queries
like "-not interested".

If something doesn't exist I'll probably look into writing a new Query class of some sort
to support this using the position info in the index but I thought I'd check here for ideas
first.

Cheers
Mark
