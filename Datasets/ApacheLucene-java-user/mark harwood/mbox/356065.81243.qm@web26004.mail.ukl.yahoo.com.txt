Not sure I understand the problem fully to be honest.

>>however it doesn't give the effective keyword in query string.
Are you saying it doesn't add the highlight markup in the appropriate place? If so,can you
provide a Junit example?

>>I  want to find that "lorem" is the matched part of the query.
Do you mean that you want to get programmatic access to the portions of the match rather than
a highlighted string?
If so, you could provide a custom Formatter implementation to the Highlighter API which is
presented with the matching tokens along with their score and position.

Cheers,
Mark
