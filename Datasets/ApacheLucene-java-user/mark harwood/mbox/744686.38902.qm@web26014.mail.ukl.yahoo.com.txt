Interesting question. Does zero-padding make primary key lookups faster or slower in lucene?

From my tests it would seem that non-padded keys are quicker to lookup than zero-padded ones
(tested doing random access on indexes of varying sizes up to 5m unique keys).
However I imagine there could come a point where zero padding might perform better because
the number of binary chops required to find records in non-padded keys would be inefficient
due to the lexicographic sort order. I'm sure there's a theoretical way of proving/disproving
this notion but it might be quicker to just run up a test rig for the scale of index you need
and benchmarking.

Cheers
Mark

Hello,

When storing fields to serve as id's - is it better to use
NumberTools.longToString(id) or just store the id as a field?
I have noticed when using NumberTools to store number as a string, this
makes range queries easier, however - you end up storing a long string.
Considering millions of ids, would it be faster to store them just as a
string representing this number. (would take less space, since you
 store 1,2
instead of 00000000001, etc.)
Best Regards,
-C.B.
