Again, if you could be precise about what factors will influence the ranking that would help.
Field names, what is wrong with existing ranking order and some of the thinking about your
proposed re-rank logic would be useful context.

In Lucene you have the options for individual query-clause boosts, index-time document boosts,
field-specific boosts on parsers, index-time length normalisation options, query result sorting,
IndexSearcher "Similarity" settings and custom scorers to name a  few. We can't recommend
which approach is most suited unless you can say more about what problem you're trying to
address.

Cheers
Mark
