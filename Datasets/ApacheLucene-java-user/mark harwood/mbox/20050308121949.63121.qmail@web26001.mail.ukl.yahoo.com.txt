Not sure I get what the requirement is yet:

>>Here's my requirement, ..I need to perform a simple 
>>"Top 10 most frequent occurring <field>" from a
search.

Does this mean:
1)Top 10 fieldnames present in each of your matching
documents? 
2)Top 10 most frequent terms found in a choice of
field?
3)Top 10 fields that contained the search term(s)?

Cheers
Mark
