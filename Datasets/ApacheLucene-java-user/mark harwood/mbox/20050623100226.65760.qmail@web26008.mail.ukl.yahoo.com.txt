Hi Johan,
To avoid selecting fragments see here:

Be aware though that the highlighter is really
designed to decorate plain-text by adding highlight
tags - if your text already includes any HTML mark-up
it becomes hard to correctly add highlighter mark-up
into the text in a way which guarantees a legal
document. To work reliably the highlighter would need
to understand the structure of the existing tags eg to
understand that the "height" attribute in an image tag
should not be marked up if the user searched for
"height". You may also have to concern yourself with
handling badly marked-up content (ie most web pages)
where tags are not always closed. This level of
functionality is beyond the scope of the highlighter.
If you want to preserve existing mark-up someone made
reference to a custom solution for handling this here:

Cheers,
Mark
