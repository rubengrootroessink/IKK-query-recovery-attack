Are you sure that
1) Your tokenStream emits terms identical to those
produced by the query - a difference in choice of
analyzer will emit tokens which dont correspond for
the same text eg "dog"!="Dog"
2) Your "body" string represents the same text of the
field in the exact document which matched.

I'm not sure where you're getting "body" or
"tokenStream" from but as long as the above 2
conditions are true all should be well.

Cheers
Mark
