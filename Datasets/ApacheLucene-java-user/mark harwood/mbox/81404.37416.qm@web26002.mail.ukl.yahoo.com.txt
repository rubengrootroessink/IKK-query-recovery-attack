Please take the time to read my response here:

I had a work colleague come up with exactly the same problem this week and the solution is
the same.

Just tested my index with a standard Lucene FuzzyQuery for "Paul~" - this gives "Phul", "Saul",
and "Paulo" before ANY "Paul" records due to IDF issues.
Using FuzzyLikeThisQuery puts all the "Paul" records ahead of the variants.

Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't have any performance problems
yet, but I do have serious problems with the relevance of the results
with fuzzy queries.
