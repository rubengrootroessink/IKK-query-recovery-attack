Typically this doesn't matter because "group fields"
tend to be things other than free-text eg
* Articles totalled by Year/Month 
* Products totalled by category code 
* Emails totalled by sender

If a group field's values aren't a standardized set of
values it wouldn't make sense to group on them eg
using a free-text field for colour would likely
produce group totals for "gray" and "grey". If the
colour field was a standardized list of codes,
typically entered by users from drop-down lists the
group totals would be  more sensible. Dates, email
accounts and category codes are all examples of
sensible group fields because there is no potential
for synonyms in the values (unlike the gray/grey
free-text issue).

In the simplified code I posted earlier I had removed
references to a useful "GroupKeyFactory" interface.
This allows a pluggable choice of implementation to
adjust TermEnum field values for grouping purposes eg
to take a yyyyMMdd date and turn it into a yyyyMM
group key if you want totals by year/month instead of
year/month/day

Cheers
Mark
