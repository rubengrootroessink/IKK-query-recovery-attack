That's probably more a question about MarkLogic APIs than it is about Lucene.
What APIs does MarkLogic provide for getting at the content e.g does it provide a JSR-170
standard interface ( http://www.slideshare.net/uncled/introduction-to-jcr )

I presume you have already ruled out the in-built MarkLogic search capabilities for some reason?

Hello Lucene users,
We have all our xml documents stored in a content management system from MarkLogic. Is there
any best approach to index these documents via lucene?
