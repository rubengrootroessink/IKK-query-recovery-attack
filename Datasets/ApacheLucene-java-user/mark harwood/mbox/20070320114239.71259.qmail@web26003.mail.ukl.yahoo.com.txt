Yes, but it's likely to involve more code on your part. TermPositions is class you want to
look at. See the PhraseQuery implementation for examples of how to use this.

>> One more doubt is "Preformace for getting search length by using searcher.search(...)
is same as using reader.docFreq(..)??;

It will be slower - but then again calling docFreq is not a solution in your case anyway
Incidentally, one more obscure solution which would allow you to use docFreq is to use an
Ngram Analyzer to build your index out of not just single words but pairs of words. Not sure
what your end-goal is and therefore if there is any real value in adopting this approach.

The old adage of avoiding "premature optimization" applies. If the searcher-based code I provided
is fast enough (cache the searcher) then avoid yourself the coding effort of using TermPositions
API or the index overhead/complexity of using NGram analyzers. 


Cheers

Hi Mark,
         Thanks for your reply.
          Could i get this match length (docFreq) without using
searcher.search(..) ?

          One more doubt is "Preformace for getting search length by using
searcher.search(...) is same as using reader.docFreq(..)??;
