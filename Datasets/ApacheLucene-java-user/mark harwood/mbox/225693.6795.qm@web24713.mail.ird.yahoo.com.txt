>>No, this simply means that you will be able to use the xml-query-parser instead of
the regular one

Not sure exactly what you have in mind for an editor, Andrzej but there is an opportunity
to do something smart here for little effort. 
The XMLQueryParser comes with a DTD which means you can have an editor that auto-completes/suggests
legal query syntax. Any schema-driven editing widget for XML could be used e.g. http://www.felixgolubov.com/XMLEditor/
or http://gendiapo.sourceforge.net/dev/

If none of these are any good another startpoint may be to use DTDdoc to parse the schema.
The DTD includes a lot of help-text comments which are used by the DTDdoc to generate HTML
documentation so using this tool gives you schema *and* help text.


Cheers
Mark
