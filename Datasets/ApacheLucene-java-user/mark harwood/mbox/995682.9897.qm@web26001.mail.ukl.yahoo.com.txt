MoreLikeThis essentially shortlists a large list of terms (found in example text or an existing
doc) and uses them in a query.
To see what terms have been shortlisted try calling query.rewrite(reader) and then call toString()
or extractTerms.

If this reveals no terms try using a debugger which should help you step through MLT's shortlisting
logic and reveal the issue (e.g. can't find TermVector or all terms are greater than chosen
doc frequency setting).

Hi,

I enabled the TermVector for  required fields using following piece of code,
Field titleField = new Field("title", title, Field.Store.NO,
Field.Index.TOKENIZED, TermVector.YES);
and then re-indexed it. But again it shows no result. 
I checked the stored documents and they TermVector exists and si correct but
morelikethis return no result for a given document id.

What am I missing?
