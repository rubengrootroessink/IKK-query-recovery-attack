SUBJECT: Re: Lucene vs SQL database
DATE: 30 Sep 2005

See the code here for an example:

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-434

This demonstrates:
* embedding and running Lucene queries directly in
Derby or HSQLDB databases 
* alternatively, using an RDBMS-provided result set
(from potentially any database) to filter an
externally run Lucene query. This, I think, is what
you are more probably interested in for your security
filter. Take a look at the
HsqlDbLuceneQuery.doRDBMSFilteredQuery() method.

Cheers,
Mark
