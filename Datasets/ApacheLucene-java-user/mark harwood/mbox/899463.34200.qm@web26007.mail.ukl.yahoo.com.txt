>>I have no clue how large the impact could be 

I did do some benchmarking of a scoring scheme based on local idf vs one with visibility of
a global idf.
Using randomized allocation of documents to shards and sufficient volumes of content in each
index, the local idf policy produced identical top results to the global idf policy for the
vast majority of searches.

Cheers
Mark

AFAIK the score would suffer from splitting up the index as tf/idf  
then only represent a part of the index, i.e. two identical docments  
in two indices would end up with different scores as the index meta  
data is different. I have no clue how large the impact could be nor if  
there are good and bad ways to split an index.

One solution I can think of is to share complete index over all nodes  
but restrict the results from each node to a subset of the index using  
a filter. This should produce the right score but will probably be a  
bit slower than splitting the index.

Perhaps it would be possible to split the index for searching but use  
an alternative source for scoring.
