Somewhat historic reasons.
It used to be IndexWriter was the only place you could define this setting 
(making it an index-time decision burnt into the index).
The IndexReader option is a relatively newer addition that adds the flexibility 
to decide about memory usage whenever you open the index (giving you the luxury 
of not having to decide on a sensible interval setting up front)

Cheers

Hi,

Is someone able to explain the purpose of both these properties. By reading
the documentation I don't understand the benefit of setting the
termIndexInterval on the IndexWriter.

Thanks

Anuj
