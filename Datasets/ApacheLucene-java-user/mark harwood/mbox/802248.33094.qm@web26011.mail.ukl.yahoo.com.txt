It would be useful to have more details about the query input and the expected highlights you
want.

So given your 'zone-indeling' example document and the index-time tokenisation you described,
which of the following queries would you expect to match and what would you want highlighted
in each case?
1) zone
2) zone-indeling
3) "zone indeling"
4) zone-somethingElse


My assumption here is that you are using the standard Lucene Query parser and that query 3
will therefore be a phrase query. 

Cheers
Mark

Hi Mark,

Your solution would be correct if the synonym would be a true 2-way
synonym. Unfortunately this is not the case. My analyzer takes care of
decomposition of specific Dutch words (where a "-" is used to create
compound words). For example: 'zone-indeling' would create synonyms for
'zone'-> 'zone-indeling' and 'indeling'->'zone-indeling'.
When analyzing 'zone' it will therefore not point back to
'zone-indeling' (this information is simply not available). Putting all
the results from the indexing process into a file or lucene document
(thus creating a 'lookup' index) would probably make the lookup process
rather slow, or make application startup too long (due to HashMap
generation).

Maybe you can do something with offsets?

Thanks,
Matthijs
