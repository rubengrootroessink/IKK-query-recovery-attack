See IndexReader.setTermInfosIndexDivisor() for a way to help reduce memory usage without needing
to re-index.

If you have indexed fields with omitNorms off (the default) you will be paying a 1 byte per
field per document memory cost and may need to look at re-indexing

Cheers

Hi!

Is there any way to reduce memory footprint doing a search over a very large
index (20G). I've getting OOMs with 512m heap!

cheers
