Take a look at "FuzzyLikeThisQuery" in
contrib\queries.

I use it for name searches on large indexes. 
Unlike FuzzyQuery it:
a) limits the number of query terms produced
b) provides better ranking (disables idf factor which
otherwise boosts rare misspellings)

The cost of running a query is strongly related to the
quantity of terms in the query.
FuzzyQuery only limits the number of terms by quality
(which means you can unexpectedly produce a large
quantity of terms and therefore have a slow query).
FuzzyLikeThis is more explicit - it limits the
*quantity* of terms used (and automatically shortlists
to the best quality terms using the same edit-distance
metric as FuzzyQuery for ranking quality). 


Cheers,
Mark
