You are asking for a new iterator each time around the loop - you'll just be printing the first
field forever.....

Hi Shai,
 The code I pasted is not working.. sorry abt that..
 The code which is working is ..

 Collection c = ir.getFieldNames(IndexReader.FieldOption.ALL);
 int i = 0;
 while (c.iterator().hasNext()) {
    out.print(c.iterator().next(););
    i++;
 }

This hangs my machine for minutes minutes on my dual core to optuput
the result.
I am doing sth wrong.
"I mean I do not know where the field names are stored.. " in the enum
and how to get them.
Perhaps its a trivial thing for a person who has used indexReader to
list all the fields in the index.
