>> Is this possible?

Not currently, the highlighter works with a list of words (or words AND phrases using the
new span support) and highlights those.
To do anything else would require the higlighter to faithfully re-implement much of the logic
in all of the different query types (fuzzy, wildcard, regex etc etc) which is much more challenging/difficult
to maintain.

Ok, one final question:

If i query for "*ll*", the query is expanded to ("hallo" or "alle" or ...), so the
Highligter will highlight the words "hallo" or "alle". But how can i highlight only
the original query, so only the "ll"? Is this possible?

Thanks a lot
Mirko

You need to call rewrite on the query to expand it then give that version to the highlighter
- see the package javadocs.

Ok, i gave it a try, but i ran into this TooManyClauses Exception. I see that
3ildcard queries are expanded before they are processed, and I see that i can
set the clauses count to Integer.MAXVALUE, and queries can consume a lot of memory, 
but one final thing is still open: does a wildcard query work together with 
the Lucene Highlighter? I tried it, but I only got an empty result. Without 
wildcards, the highlighter works pretty smooth!

Mirko

Of course you can construct your own BooleanQuery
programmatically.

It's relatively easy, just try it.
