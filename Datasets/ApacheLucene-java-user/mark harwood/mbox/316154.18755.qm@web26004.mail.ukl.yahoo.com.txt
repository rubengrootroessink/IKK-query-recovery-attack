As of Lucene 2.1 you can make optimal use of RAM by monitoring IndexWriter.ramSizeInBytes()
and calling IndexWriter.flush() when memory is tight.

This avoids the issue of trying to estimate a value for maxBufferedDocs which you think can
fit into RAM.

Cheers
Mark

I think you can try

MergeFactor =1000
MaxMergeDocs=2147483647
MaxBufferedDocs=1000
