It is not currently possible to create an index without term position information.

Support for such a feature was mentioned as part of some long term objectives for more flexible
indexing - http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/FlexibleIndexing

Some debate here:
http://www.archivum.info/java-dev@lucene.apache.org/2006-06/msg00024.html

This is not a trivial change so I wouldn't make any plans on it arriving soon. As storage
gets cheaper and cheaper I suspect the cost/benefit ratios of having the position info vs
removing support get more strongly stacked in favour of keeping the position info.

Does nobody know or is my concern unclear?

Thanks again
