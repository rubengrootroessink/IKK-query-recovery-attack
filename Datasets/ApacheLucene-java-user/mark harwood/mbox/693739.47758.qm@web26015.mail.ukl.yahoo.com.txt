There are 2 considerations when caching filter results:

1) What was the criteria used to produce the results?
2) What version of the index were these results taken from?

CachingWrapperFilter takes care of 2) by using WeakHashMap keyed on IndexReader.

The filter you pass to CachingWrapperFilter must play it's part in taking care of 1) by implementing
hashcode/equals.

You can then maintain an LRU hashmap of CachingWrapperFilters to keep only the most popular
filters.

Incidentally, contrib's XMLQueryParser handles all this for you with a simple "CachedFilter"
tag:

<FilteredQuery>
    <Query>
        <UserQuery>"Brittany Spears"</UserQuery>
    </Query>    
    <Filter>
        <CachedFilter>
            <RangeFilter fieldName="date" lowerTerm="19970409" upperTerm="19970412"/>
        </CachedFilter>
    </Filter>    
</FilteredQuery>

What do you means by 'Most caches are held in WeakHashMap...' is this
caching provided by CachingWrappingFilter or do we have to implement it
ourselves? I assume the former.

We will share results of our testing as soon as we have any - not sure
 how
generalizable they will be.

You have been super helpful! Very grateful! Thanks!
