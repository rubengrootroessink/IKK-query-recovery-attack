The Term object's constructor in your example does not
parse the "20060304 TO 20060304" string. A term is
supposed to represent a single term exactly as it
appears in your search index, not a query to be
parsed.

TermsFilter is intended to allow you to construct a
filter from an arbitrary collection of terms.
Sounds like you actually want to define a range of
terms so see RangeFilter instead.
