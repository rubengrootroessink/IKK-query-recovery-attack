The solution I outlined could be adapted to work
across multiple indexes - you'd just have to aggregate
the totals.

If going from all category terms to matching doc ids
is slow you could do it the other way going from
matching doc ids to terms.

You can feasibly do this by :
a) IndexReader.document(hitDocId).get("category")
or
b)
IndexReader.getTermFreqVector(hitDocId,"category").getTerms()

Unfortunately a) reads ALL fields for a doc off the
disk and is probably very slow. b) would be quicker
but would require you to index with TermFreqVector
support.
I'm not sure if b) would be faster than the term to
docids approach I originally suggested - you'd have to
try it and see how it performs on your data.

Cheers,
Mark
