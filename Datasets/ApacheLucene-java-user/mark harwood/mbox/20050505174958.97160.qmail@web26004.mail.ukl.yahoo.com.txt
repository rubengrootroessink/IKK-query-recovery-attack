As much as you have shown of the example output is
roughly what I would expect - using the default
simpleFragmenter you get roughly 100 character sized
fragments and you have shown 3 fragments sized 97, 100
and 105 chars long separated by "...".

> Of course the result is far more than this.

So are you saying you had even more fragments in the
"getBestFragments" return string separated by your
choice of "..." separator?

I also notice the text contains no markup - have you
removed that from the example? 

Cheers
Mark
