SUBJECT: RE: Range queries
DATE: 9 May 2006

Typically the 3 most important things to remember when
using numerical range queries are:

1) Use a filter instead.
2) Use a filter instead.
3) Use a filter instead.

Seriously, number rangeQueries are normally a bad idea
because:

a) they can produce "too many term" errors (your
current problem)
b) they influence results ranking in ways which are
undesirable (do we typically care how rare one number
in the range is versus another? - Lucene does when
scoring RangeQueries)
c) they are slower than filters

See here for examples of filter-based alternatives -
