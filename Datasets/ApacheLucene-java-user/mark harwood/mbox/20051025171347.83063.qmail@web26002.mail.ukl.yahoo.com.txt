An alternative idea is index-time fuzzification rather
than query-time. This is documented in one of the case
studies in LIA - the principle is you don't
index/search for whole words but use an NGram Analyzer
to break them up at index time:

Kylie becomes multiple words:
[ k]
[ ky]
[ kyl]
[ky]
[kyl]
[kyli]
[yl]
[yli]
[ylie]
[ kylie ]

Obviously you use the same analyzer to process
queries.
Lucene will automatically look after relevancy of
partial matches for you but your indexes are bigger
and your queries will generate many more Boolean
clauses.
