Hi Chris,

Have a look at the "TermsFilter" in contrib/queries.
The code would look something like this:

    TermsFilter filter=new TermsFilter()
//    for( all 5 id terms....
      filter.addTerm(new Term("id", id[i]));
  
   hits=searcher.search(moreLikeThisQuery, filter);


Cheers
Mark

Subject: how best to limit search result to a subset of document ids?


hello--

i'm trying to figure out the best way to limit a query to a small subset if a lucene index's
documents, and i'm a bit of a novice and a bit stumped...

my scenario is:

1) search the index for a term (very boring normal case)
2) take the top 5 results from that search result set 
3) next, do a MoreLikeThis query where ONLY those 5 documents are valid to search against
(BTW, the MLT query is based on a separately supplied doc which needs to be compared)

hoping this scenario makes some sense...

should i put together a boolean query with the 5 doc ids, a la:

"id:282707 OR id:389447"

or should i try to set up a QueryFilter with a list of document ids? and any pointers as to
what the syntax should be to add doc ids to a QueryFilter?

also, is it possible that Lucene in Action (which i have) is a bit out of date in this area
now?

any thoughts would be greatly appreciated...


best--
