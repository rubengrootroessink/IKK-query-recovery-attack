SUBJECT: Re: Highlighting span for Phrase Queries
DATE: 10 Nov 2006

There have been a couple of alternative Highlighter contributions recently, I can't recall
which claim to support "proper" highlighting of phrases but you might want to give them a
try.


http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-644

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-663


Ultimately "proper" highlighting is very hard to achieve if you both want to select a summary
of the doc's "best bits" and also support queries which can be arbitrarily complex nestings
of boolean queries which can also contain Spans/phrases covering large sections of the document.
Some compromises are inevitable under these extreme circumstances and I don't think there
is one implementation that is capable of catering for this.

Let us know how you get on.

Cheers
Mark

Subject: Highlighting span for Phrase Queries

Hi there,

I have a question on using the Highlighter.

I'm using Lucene in a web application that allows you to search the 
catalogue of a library. The idea is to highlight, in the results, the 
terms entered by the user. I'm using a Highlighter with a NullFragmenter 
because I want the whole field highlighted (for each field the user 
searched in).

The catalogue is indexed with a StandardAnalyzer on each field. 
Highlighting a field from a result I do like this  :

            QueryScorer scorer = new QueryScorer ( theQuery, 
searcher.getIndexReader ( ) , fieldName ) ;
            Highlighter highlighter = new Highlighter ( new 
SimpleHTMLFormatter ( "<span style=\"border-style:solid;\">" , "</span>" ) 
, scorer ) ;
            highlighter. setTextFragmenter ( new NullFragmenter ( ) ) ;

        highlightedFieldContent = highlighter. getBestFragment ( analyzer 
, fieldName , originalFieldContent ) ; 

This works all very well, except for phrase queries. The spans of the 
phrase queries as such are not highlighted and instead, each of the terms 
that is in the phrase query, gets highlighted. I guess this is because the 
indexed fields have been tokenized, and what-not, by the StandardAnalyzer.

Does anyone have a good example about how to implement a highlighting 
function that works well with phrase queries, too ?

thank you very much.
