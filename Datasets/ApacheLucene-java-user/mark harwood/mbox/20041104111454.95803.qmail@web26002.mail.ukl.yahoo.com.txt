>>Shouldn't the tpv variable be used in this method?

Well spotted. The code works fine (just needs
tidying!) It delegates to another method that gets the
TPV object again. I've changed it to avoid this extra
lookup and will post another version up on my site
tonight. 
The interface and functionality of  the
"getAnyTokenStream" method  will not change as a
result.

Cheers
Mark
