The answer is because addIndexes() currently always does an optimize post-merge. If I recall
correctly optimize() will create a complete copy of the existing index during the optimize
process then delete the old one so this shouldn't be done too often.

Out of interest, why are you using a RAMDirectory here? An IndexWriter uses one internally
of size IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs so you get the benefits of buffering automatically
when writing to a File-based directory.
