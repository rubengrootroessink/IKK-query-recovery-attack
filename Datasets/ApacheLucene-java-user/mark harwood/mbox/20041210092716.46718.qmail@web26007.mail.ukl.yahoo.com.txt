Hi Steve,
Possibly the easiest way to handle this is to tag the
documents with a field listing the permitted
roles/groups (not the individual users). 
I would be tempted to keep the information that
associates users to groups outside of the Lucene index
eg in a relational DB. 
This way you do not need to worry about updating the
Lucene index everytime a new user is added or is
granted membership to a group. 

When you search, simply use a QueryFilter which lists
the current user's roles e.g. groups:(admin,
projectManager) - this will restrict the search
results to only those docs associated with the user's
roles.

Cheers
Mark
