So many questions......

>>Which one will be better

As in.....
* Faster to implement?
* Faster to search?
* Faster to update?
* Cheaper in licenses?
* More robust?
* Easier to maintain?
* Easier to backup?

Are results sorted by :
* quality (e.g. when using fuzzy text matching)?
* distance?
* price?

Do you need summaries with facets?

Subject: How to use Lucene to suppot quick search on huge databases where the primary content
is of non textual format ?


The requirement is to perform a Quick search on a DB table that has more than
a million real estate property records where the primary search criteria is
state/city, state/county or zip code. How can I use lucene effectively in
this case ? Which one will be better a plain sql search on the DB table or a
lucene search with some sort of a index constructed (not sure how to go
about this) ?
Please Advice.
