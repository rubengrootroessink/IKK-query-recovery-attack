See the QuerySpansExtractor I linked to here:
http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35518

This uses SpanTermQuery for individual TermQuerys. As
for all of the other query types eg fuzzy, prefix,
range etc these are always rewritten to TermQuerys
anyway (using Query.rewrite(reader)) so passing
re-written queries to the highlighter solves all these
issues. That has always been the advice in using the
existing term-based highlighter. This would also be
required when calling any new span-based highlighter.
