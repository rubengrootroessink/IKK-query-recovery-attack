Someone should probably confirm that though.

I suppose you are referring to the class Hits? It should only be an  
extra cost if you iterate a lot of documents priot to index 450000,  
as that will force it to replace the query now and then.

It is a pretty simple peice of code. Go right ahead and take a look  
at it:

apache/lucene/search/Hits.java>
