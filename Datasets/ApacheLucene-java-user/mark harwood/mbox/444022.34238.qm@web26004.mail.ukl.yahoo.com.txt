SUBJECT: Re: How many documents in the biggest Lucene index to date?
DATE: 26 Jan 2007

I'm aware of a single index with the following characteristics:

Single index  size = 33.2GB
Documents: 263 million
Searchable fields = 7 
Query Response times: <1 second for a single term search
Anything from 5-20 seconds for more complex searches (e.g fuzzy matching on multiple fields)

This is an extreme example and we normally use a distributed architecture with multiple indexes/servers
to deal with data on this scale (as Andrzej also suggests in his mail).

Cheers,
Mark

I'm working on a regular basis with indexes containing several million 
documents. Somewhere around 10 mln documents, depending on the hardware 
and the type of queries, you will need to consider splitting the index 
into parts distributed over several machines - but below that size you 
should be able to get sub-second responses to typical queries.
