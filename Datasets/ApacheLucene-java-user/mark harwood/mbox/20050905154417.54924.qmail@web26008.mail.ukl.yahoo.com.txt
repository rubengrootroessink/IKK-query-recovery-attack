SUBJECT: Re: TermVectorOffsetInfo class?
DATE: 5 Sep 2005

It's in the latest version of Lucene in SVN.

If you don't want to work with the latest version of
Lucene simply remove TokenSources.java - it's an
optional class for use with the highlighter and
provides a way of retrieving already-parsed document
tokens from the index. Instead, you can simply run an
Analyzer on the document text to get a list of tokens
for the highlighter.

Cheers
Mark
