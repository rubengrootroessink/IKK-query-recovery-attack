Guessing your problem here too but see http://www.htxs.nl/docs/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/demo/IndexHTML.html

It shows an approach to incremental indexing which updates an index with only the changed
files in a folder.

hi,
 thanks for your response. I think you hanven't got what my question
 is? I
will explain with an example. I have a folder which contains  the
 indexed
files. so, suppose if i want to add one more indexed data into it,
 without
deleting the whole folder and performing  the indexing for all the
 files
again. I want it to do only that one file and add the index in the
 index
folder.
