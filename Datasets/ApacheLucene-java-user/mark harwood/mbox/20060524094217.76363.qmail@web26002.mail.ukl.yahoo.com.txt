Marc,
If you're looking to expose the full lucene search
functionality to clients other than Java you will need
a query syntax which goes beyond the built in
QueryParser syntax e.g. adds support for defining
filters, span queries etc in a Java-independent way.

If so, the XMLQueryParser in the contrib section
provides this capability and may be of interest.
It defines an extensible syntax for expressing all
lucene query and filter objects in XML and so is well
suited to exposing in a web service.

Cheers,
Mark
