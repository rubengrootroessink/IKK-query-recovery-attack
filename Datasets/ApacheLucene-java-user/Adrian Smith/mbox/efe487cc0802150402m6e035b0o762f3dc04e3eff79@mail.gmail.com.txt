Hi,

I have a similar sitaution. I also considered using $. But for the sake of
not running into (potential) problems with Tokenisers, I just defined a
string in a config file which for sure is never going to occur in a document
and will never be searched for, e.g.

dfgjkjrkruigduhfkdgjrugr

Cheers, Adrian
