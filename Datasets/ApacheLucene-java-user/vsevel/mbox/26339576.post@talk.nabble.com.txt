SUBJECT: listing all fields used in any documents
DATE: 13 Nov 2009


Hi,

I am indexing log4j/logback/JUL logging events. my documents includes
regular fields (eg: logger, message, date, ...) and custom fields that
applications choose to use (eg: MDC).
I would like to do full text searches on those fields just as I do on
regular fields, I just need to know about them...

Is there a way of listing all fields that are used in any of the documents?

Thanks,
vince
