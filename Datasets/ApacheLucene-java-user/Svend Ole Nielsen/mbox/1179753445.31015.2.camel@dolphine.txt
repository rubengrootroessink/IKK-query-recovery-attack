SUBJECT: Upgrade 2.0 -> 2.1
DATE: 21 May 2007

Hi
I have tried to upgrade from 2.0 -> 2.1 to overcome some NFS-issues. It
compiles just fine, but when I run the application and try to add a
document if throws an exception stating NoSuchMethod. This happens when
I try to add an object of type Field to a newly created empty Document.

I have erased all dependencies in my project aswell on the server. So it
should be as clean as a whistle, but no luck. I'm running it on a Bea
8.1 SP6 with the old 1.4 Java

Anyone knows where to look ??

Best regards,
Svend Ole
