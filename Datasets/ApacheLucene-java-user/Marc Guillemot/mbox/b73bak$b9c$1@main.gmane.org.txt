SUBJECT: Searcher pool
DATE: 10 Apr 2003

Hi,

I would like to use a searcher pool or something like that to avoid opening
and closing an IndexSearcher for each query. I've read with interest the
mail:
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org/msg01358.html

but I think such a wrapper is hasardous as long
Searcher.search(org.apache.lucene.search.Query) is final and not documented
as facility calling an other method:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Searcher.
html#search(org.apache.lucene.search.Query)

Has someone here some experience using such a pool?

Marc.
