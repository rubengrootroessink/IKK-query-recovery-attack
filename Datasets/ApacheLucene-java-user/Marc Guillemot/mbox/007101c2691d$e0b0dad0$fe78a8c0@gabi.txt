Hi,

I've performed some tests with Lucene for german indexation/search but I
don't get the results I expected:

- Umlaut:
search for:
    - "GeschÃ¤ft" -> x results
    - "Geschaeft" -> no result
Is there an option in the standard german classes to make the 2 searches
above equivalent?

- Composed words:
"betreuung" is not found in a doc containing "Kundenbetreuung"

Any suggestions?

Marc.
