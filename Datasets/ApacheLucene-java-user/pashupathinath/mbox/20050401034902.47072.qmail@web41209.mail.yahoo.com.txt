SUBJECT: Re: using different analyzer for searching
DATE: 1 Apr 2005

hi erik,
   i'm creating a blogger application, where the users
can create blogs, upload pictures and post comments
etc etc.
   i'm storing all the information using mysql
database. i'm indexing the database contents and
searching on this index.i'm using lucene to implement
this feature.
   i give the user options to search based on
BlogTitle, Blogdesc,blogcategory. my main purpose of
search is ..whenever a user enters any query related
to blogtitle or blogdesc or blogcategory, it should
return all the matching documents for that search
string. 
   the real problem i'm facing is ..whenever the user
enters some part of the mainstring, the search returns
 zero because i was using a whitespaceanalyser, which
needs the complete string. i should look into using
wildcardquery which i think will solve my problem to
some extent. 
   i should do even more analysis as suggested by you
before i should come to a decision of which analyser i
should be using to solve this. what about writing a
custom analyzer to solve this ??? how can i go abt the
logic of implementing this in a custom analyzer..
where this returns all the documents that has even a
part of  the search string. 
   any insight into this would be very helpful
especially in terms of performance wise.

thanks,
