SUBJECT: Updating Index.
DATE: 8 Apr 2005

hi,
  i've created an index for database records. the
problem is whenever i'm trying to update the database,
i mean adding or deleting records from the database i
want the index to be updated too.
   right now, i am adding new documents to the
existing index whenever i add new records to the
database. 
   the main problem is how do i traverse through the
existing index so that i wont add duplicate records in
the index. i can use my primary key to check for
duplicate records in the index. 
   how can i traverse through the values stored in the
index and make sure that the new records are not
duplicated ? once i encounter the duplicate primary
key, i should be able to delete all the various fields
values associated with that primary key.
   

thanks,
pashupathinath.k
