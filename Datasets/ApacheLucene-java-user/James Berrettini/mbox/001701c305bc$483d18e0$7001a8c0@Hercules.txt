SUBJECT: how to tell what field(s) contain hits
DATE: 18 Apr 2003

I've got a collection of documents which include an index field representing
attached documents. I can search over these just fine, but when retrieving
hits, I don't have any way of knowing whether the hit occurred in the main
document or the attachment. Is there any way of determining which field a
hit occurs in? (I don't store the full text in the index, and I'm trying to
avoid that if possible).
