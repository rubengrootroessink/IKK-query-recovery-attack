many relevent hits on various pages for the searches keywords, that site is only shown once
in the results listing with a link to the most relevent hit on that site. What I do not want
is to have one site dominate a search results page.

Actually why don't you use another index for the search results. For 
example you make a search and get all the results, then index those 
documents to a RAMIndex with the matching term. Then retrieve all 
documents in the RamIndex based on hits for the search terms once.  In 
other terms you will filter the documents based on maximum term 
similarity. Is it make sense for you?
