SUBJECT: How to use search index while indexing
DATE: 1 Feb 2010

Hi,

I want to search an index and at the same time continue to my indexing. 
ParallelReader doesn't solve my problem.
It is obvious that I am not searching multiple indexes at the same time. 
How can I build a document based lock, more over
I don't want to open and close and index every time while writing. 
Merging new index with the old one seems really time
consuming and also I want to search the new index.

Is it possible? Please give hints...
