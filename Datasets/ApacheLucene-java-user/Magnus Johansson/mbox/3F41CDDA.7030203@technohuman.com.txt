Hi Peter

If the original document is available. You could extract keywords from 
the document
at query time. That is when someone asks for documents similar to 
document a. You
re-analyze document a and in combination with statistics from the Lucene 
index you extract
keywords from document a that can then be used as a query for findining 
similar documents.

I've got some sample code if anyone is interested.
