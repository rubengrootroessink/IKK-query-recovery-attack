I read somewhere that it used a hidden markov model.

It checks each page and gives each link a click probability.
It also gives a probability that the user will enter a new
address instead of clicking a link.

We then, by using a hidden markov model, calculate the
probability that the user will be at a particular page
after an infinite time using random browsing according
to the probabilies found.

This probability is then used as a basis for ranking
results.
