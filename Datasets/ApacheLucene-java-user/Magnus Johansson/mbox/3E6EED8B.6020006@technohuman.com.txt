Well, the problem arise when a user enters a query with a compound word
and the compound word itself is not indexed, only one of its parts.

For example the index contains a document with the following word:
fotboll (football).

Let's say the users searches for fotbollsmatch (football game). The word
is split into fotboll and match and the phrase "fotboll match" is 
searched for.
The user finds no matching document.

Comparing this to english the user would have found a document, however 
scored
slightly lower than a document containing both the words football and game.

I agree with you that this might not be a problem. The user could be 
instructed
to reformulate his query. However the behaviour for an english index and 
a swedish
index would be different.
