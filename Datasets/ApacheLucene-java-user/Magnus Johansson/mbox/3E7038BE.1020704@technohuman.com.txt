Yes but the word fotbollsmatch was never indexed in this example. Only 
the word fotboll.
I want a query for fotbollsmatch to match a document containing the word 
fotboll.

I think I'll accept how it works now. It is perhaps unlikely that the 
user would query the index
using a compound word and expecting documents containing only one of its 
parts in result.
The more I think about it the more difficult it becomes to come up with 
a realistic example
of why the behaviour would need to be changed.
