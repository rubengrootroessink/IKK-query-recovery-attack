Hi Peter,

I guess you are right.

I've implemented this for a index with ten millions of really small
documents that all are stored in the index. The documents are never more 
than a thousand
words so re-indexing is quick enough. However it is probably not 
advisable to do
this with bigger documents or documents that need additional parsing.
