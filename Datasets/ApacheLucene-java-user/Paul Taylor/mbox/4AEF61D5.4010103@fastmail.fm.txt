SUBJECT: How do you map a query for fieldx to fieldy
DATE: 2 Nov 2009

For backwards compatabiity I have to change queries for the track field 
to the recording field. I did this by overriding  QueryParser.newQuery() 
as follows

protected Query newTermQuery(Term term) {
        if ( term.field() == "track" ) {
            return super.newTermQuery(new Term("recording"term.text()));
        }
        else {
            return super.newTermQuery(term);
        }
    }

this seemed to work, but then I realised it didnt work for phrasequeries 
so I have to override QueryParser.newPhraseQuery() but now thinking will 
fail for wilcard queries ectera. Is there just one method I can override 
to deal with this.
