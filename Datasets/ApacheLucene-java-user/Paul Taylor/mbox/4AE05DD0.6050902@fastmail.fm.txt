Thanks Glen

I have already written all the code for sending queries to the database, 
deciding what fields I want to use ectera, so I wouldn't want to redo 
that to use another tool especially when you offer only a command line 
interface not an api. But I
would be interested in how you use multithreading to best advantage for 
this , would you care to share the basics ?
