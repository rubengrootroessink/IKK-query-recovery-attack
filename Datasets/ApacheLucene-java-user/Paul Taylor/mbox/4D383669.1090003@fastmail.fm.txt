DATE: 20 Jan 2011

Trying to extend MappingCharFilter so that it only changes a token if 
the length of the token matches the length of singleMatch in 
NormalizeCharMap  (currently the singleMatch just has to be found in the 
token I want ut to match the whole token). Can this be done it sounds 
simple enough but I cannot make any headway understanding the 
MappingCharFilter source code

thanks Paul
