Yes correct, but I have looked and the list of optimizations before. 
What was clear from profiling was that it wasnt the searching part that 
was slow (a query run on the same index with only a few matching docs 
ran super fast) the slowness only occurs when there are loads of 
matching docs, and spends most of its time in scorer that is why I was 
trying to remove the poor matches.
