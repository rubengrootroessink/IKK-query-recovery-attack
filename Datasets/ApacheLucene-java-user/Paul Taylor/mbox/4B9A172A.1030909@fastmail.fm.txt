SUBJECT: Dealing with special cases in analyser
DATE: 12 Mar 2010

Hi, I'm using a custom analyser based on standardanalyser with good 
results to search artists (i.e rolling stones/beatles) but it fails to 
match some weird artists names such as '!!!', this is not suprising 
because the analyser ignores punctuation which is what I want it to 
normally. I just wonder the best way to deal with these special cases.

My first idea was to use a version of CharFilter 
(PatternReplaceCharFilter) to replace certain patterns such as '!!!' to 
'ApostropheApostropheApostophe' so they would remain intact , but I'm 
worried about the overhead of doing this, is there something else I 
should be  doing.

thanks Paul
