Hmm , I don't really agree with deprecating Version.LUCENE_CURRENT ( 
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2080)

I'm sure in many projects, especially ones that are not yet released 
developers would expect to pick up the latest features when they 
download the latest version of Lucene without having to update the value 
of the Version constant (its just make devlopment a bit more tiresome) 
and would realize that code should be rebuilt and  indexes should be 
built with same version as searching indexes. I mean whenever you update 
the version of a library should really test your code, after all Lucene 
3.0.0 changed some things in 2.9.2 unwittingly, hence the need for 3.0.1.
