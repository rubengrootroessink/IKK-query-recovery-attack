SUBJECT: Use of SimpleStringInterner in non Lucene App
DATE: 15 Sep 2010

Im currently using String.intern() in my app purely to reduce the memory 
usage, this has worked well except the memory required for intern() go 
into perm rather than heap, setting perm on different platforms is on 
trivial so Im looking for a solution that works on Heap. (Now before you 
say tune your applications please understand that my app is memory bound 
based on how many files are loaded into it , which can be anything from 
10 to 100,000, in the long term I am going to move to a database soln to 
solve this issue, but in the short term I need intern() for heap memory)

Does SimpleStringInterner use heap, would it be sensible to use it for a 
non lucene stuff, and what do the tableSize and maxChainLength 
parameters mean. ?

thanks Paul
