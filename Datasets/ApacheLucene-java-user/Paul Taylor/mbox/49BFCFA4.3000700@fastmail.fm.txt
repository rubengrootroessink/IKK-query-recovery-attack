SUBJECT: What is the best way to modify a Document object
DATE: 17 Mar 2009

I am using lucene to index rows in a spreadsheet , each row is a 
Document, and the document indexes 10  fields from the row plus the row 
number used to relate thethe Document to the row number
So when someone modifies one of the 10 fields I am interested in a row I 
have to update the document with the new data

writer = new IndexWriter(directory, analyzer);
Document document = createDocument(row);
writer.updateDocument(new Term(ROW_NUMBER, "" + row), document);
writer.optimize();
writer.close();

Because I can't retrieve the existing Document for a row from a writer I 
recreate the document when one of the values has changed, but this means 
I have to go off and get all the values again even though I am only 
changing one. is there a better way to do this, I thought
that I could retrive the document using an IndexReader and then modify 
it using removeField(),AddField() but there is extra overhead in doing 
in having to create a reader to get the document - so which would be best.

thanks Paul
