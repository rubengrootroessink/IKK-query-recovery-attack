SUBJECT: Can you create a RAM index from a file index
DATE: 24 Mar 2009

Hi

Ive built some file based indexes based on data in a database, and it 
took quite some time.
I am interested in trying to use RAM based indexes instead of file based 
indexes to compare search performance but its going to take some time to 
rebuild the index from the original database, isnt it possible to 
rebuild the index from the file based index ?
How big is a RAM index compared to File based index, I assumming its 
slightly smaller because no files are created ?

thanks Paul
