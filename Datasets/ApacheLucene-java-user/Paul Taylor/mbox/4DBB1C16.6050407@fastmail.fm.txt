Please see previous post, in summary mistake on my part.

to javac - by default, though, only line number and source file information is generated.
 If you want local variable information too, you could download the source and make your own
debug-enabled jar(s), right?:

Hmm maybe that is enough, Im not sure. I'm profiling with 
YourkitProfiler and it doesnt show anything within the lucene classes so 
I assumed this meant they didnt contain the neccessary debugging info 
but I would have thought that -g is all I need

thanks Paul
