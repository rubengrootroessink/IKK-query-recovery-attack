SUBJECT: Blocking on IndexSearcher search
DATE: 25 Aug 2010

Hi

My multithreaded code was always creating a new IndexSearcher for every 
search, but I changed over to the recommendation of creating just one 
index  searcher and keeping it between searches. Now I find if I have 
multiple threads trying to search they
block on the search method(), only one can search at any time, is this 
expected behaviour ?
