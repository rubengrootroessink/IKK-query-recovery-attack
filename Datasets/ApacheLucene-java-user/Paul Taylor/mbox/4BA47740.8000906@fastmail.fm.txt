SUBJECT: Trying to simplify MappingCharFilter to match whole field
DATE: 20 Mar 2010

I'm trying to create a CharFilter which works like MappingCharFilter but 
only changes the matchString if the match String matches the whole field 
rather than a portion in the field (this is to handle some exceptions 
wiyout effecting other data). Trouble is the code in MappingCharFilter 
is devoid of comments and I cant figure out what I need to change, any 
ideas ?
