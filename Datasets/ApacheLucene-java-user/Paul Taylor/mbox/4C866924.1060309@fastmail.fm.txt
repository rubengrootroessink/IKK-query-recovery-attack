Went to try NIO and then realised it no better for Windows, in fact the 
SUN bug seems is saying that multiple file channels work better than 
sharing one, so perhaps that it what is happening when I had mutliple  
IndexReaders and so performance was actually better on Windows in that 
circumstance. As customers could be using 32bit or 64bit I fear that 
MMapped is not a very robust solution
, oh well have to live with fit or now I suppose
