I'm obviously misunderstanding I thought that Halfwidth  was an encoding 
to allow storing the most common Chinese characters in a single byte, 
therefore the charcters would be read as different characters if you 
assumed they were using the HalfWidth Encoding rather than Latin 
Encoding. But are you saying Halfwidth characters are actually valid 
Unicode characters with their own distinct unicode value   so can just  
use a CharFilter again to map these, please confirm.

Oh I see , so we convert one to the other, but only when matches

Yes we do , we allow full Lucene syntax if the 'Advanced Query' option 
is selected at http://musicbrainz.org/

Understood, so I think users will continue to use the Double Quotes 
Character in their searches
