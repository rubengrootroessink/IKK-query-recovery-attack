SUBJECT: NOT_ANALYSED_NO_NORMS should get max field length boost
DATE: 12 Jan 2010

Lucene in Action says you can possibly use NOT_ANALYSED_NO_NORMS when 
indexing fields that arent tokenized, but later says norms are used to 
boost fields with less /single term, so matches based on these single 
term fields would miss out on this boost. Is there a way to use 
NOT_ANALYSED_NO_NORMS on these fields will will mean they end up with 
the best boost (1.0 as default) , and then documents that are analysed 
with norms receive a negative boost (<1.0) if they contain more than one 
token.

I'm not using Document or Field boosting, so seems a bit silly for me to 
store all these norms just to say this field contains a single token and 
therefore should get an addtional boost.

Perhaps Im misundersanding this, and this would work as required.


thanks Paul
