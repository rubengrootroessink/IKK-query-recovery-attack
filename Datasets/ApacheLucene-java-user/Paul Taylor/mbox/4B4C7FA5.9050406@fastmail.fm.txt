But if it does match won't this affect the end score

i.e, consider Doc 1 has unalysed field containing fred and Doc 2 
analysed field contain tom sawyer
and this search unalysedfield:fred OR analysedfield:tom

If it had norms, Doc1 would come first , but without norms they would be 
joint first right ?
