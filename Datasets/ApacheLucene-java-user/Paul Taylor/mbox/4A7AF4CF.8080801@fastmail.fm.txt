Yes I think you are right, though dont understand it fully


        TokenStream ts = analyzer.tokenStream("content", new 
StringReader("R.E.S."));
        Token t;
        while ((t = ts.next()) != null) { System.out.println("R.E.S. 
parsed to :"+t); }


        ts = analyzer.tokenStream("content", new StringReader("R.E.S"));
        while ((t = ts.next()) != null) { System.out.println("R.E.S 
parsed to :"+t); }
        }

this code outputs

R.E.S. parsed to :(res,0,6,type=<ACRONYM>)
R.E.S parsed to :(r.e.s,0,5,type=<HOST>)

so from my perspective I cannot see
it thinks R.E.S is a HOST it should be an acronym, but also for the one 
that is an acronym I thought it end up as r.e.s not res
