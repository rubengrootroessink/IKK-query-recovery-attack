It was a long lunch, actually Im just creating an IndexSearcher directly 
on a file

i.e Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexDir + "/track_index");

I was struggling to see how to create an NIOFSDirectory until I realised 
I needed Lucene 2.9, which Ive done as follows

Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(IndexReader.open(new 
NIOFSDirectory(new File(indexDir + "/track_index"),null),true)));

Anyway the end result is query times have been reduced from 43 seconds 
to 23 seconds, so a pretty good result. (although I dont really 
understand why the RAMDirectory method didnt perform at least this well 
because it would have no file io contention)

thanks alot Paul
