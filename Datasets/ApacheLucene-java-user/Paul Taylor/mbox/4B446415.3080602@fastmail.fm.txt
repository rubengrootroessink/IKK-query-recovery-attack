Thanks, almost if I do this I can determine that a document exists  with 
a term with a particular value works

 TermDocs termDocs = ir.termDocs(new 
Term(ArtistIndexField.ARTIST_ID.getName(),"4302e264-1cf0-4d1f-aca7-2a6f89e34b36"));
 termDocs.next();
 assertEquals(1,termDocs.freq());

but this doesnt work

 TermDocs termDocs = ir.termDocs(new 
Term(ArtistIndexField.ARTIST_ID.getName()));
 termDocs.next();
 assertEquals(1,termDocs.freq());

which is what I really want, i.e that document has a term for this fieldname

(In any test there is only ever one document)
