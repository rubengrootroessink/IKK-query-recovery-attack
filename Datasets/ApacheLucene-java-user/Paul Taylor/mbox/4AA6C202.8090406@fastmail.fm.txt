Is there way to get complete start end matches to be first in the list

We use Lucene to search song albums titles typically one to ten words 
long. If the user enter something like 'foo bar' everything that 
contains foo bar is returned with max score , thats fine but it would be 
better if an exact match is right at the top. Also although an OR Search 
has been entered would be great if that it ranked matches where both 
words are together higher than when they are not , but still return 
results that only match one condirtion.

 Ideally giving results in this order

    * Foo Bar (exact match)
    * The Foo Bar Somethings (substring - exact match)
    * Bar Foo (all terms match)
    * Bar Baz and the Foo (substring - all terms match)
    * Foo (some terms match)
    * Foo Something (substring - some terms match)


Is there something I can do in Lucene, or some way I can modify the 
query (as entered by the user) to get results better aproaching this
