Hi Mike,

Its now occurred to me that the IndexWriter code might have decided that 
so many records needed modifying that it would be better to recreate the 
index from scratch  rather than modify it, so if an Indexreader accessed 
it at the time it would be empty. is there a way I can get the 
IndexReader to wait for the IndexWriter to complete.

Paul
