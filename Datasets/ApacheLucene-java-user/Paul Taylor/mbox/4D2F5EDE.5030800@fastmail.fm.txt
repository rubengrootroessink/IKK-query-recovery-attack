SUBJECT: Closing indexsearcher , making sur eit is in use
DATE: 13 Jan 2011

As recommended, I use just one Index Searcher on my multithreaded GUI 
app using a singleton pattern
If data is modified in the index I then close the reader and searcher, 
and they will be recreate on next call to getInstance() but Ive hit a 
problem whereby one thread was closing a searcher, another thread 
already the searcher open but when came to use it gave exception 'the 
IndexReader is closed'

I obviously dont want access to the searcher to be synchronized as it is 
designed to work multithreaded, so how should I close it safetly, i.e 
close if no current references to it.

Paul
