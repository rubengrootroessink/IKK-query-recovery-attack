SUBJECT: Filter before tokenize ?
DATE: 12 Sep 2009

Is it possible to filter before tokenize, or is that not a good idea.
I want to convert '&' to 'and' , so they are dealt with the same way, 
but the StandardTokenizer I am using removes the &, I could change the 
tokenizer but  because I'm not too clear on jflex syntax it would seem 
easier to just apply a CharFilter before tokenizing, but is that possible
