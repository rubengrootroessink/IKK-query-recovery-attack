That would work but its a heacyweight solution and you have I would have 
to  use a seperate instance of PatternReplaceCharFilter for every 
exception. What I want is quite straight forward give an exception of 
'!!!' it should match a field with text of '!!!!' but not 'Start!!!' or 
"!!!End', so it seems this is a simple version of MappingCharFilter
