SUBJECT: Downloading Lucene 2.9 from Maven
DATE: 11 May 2009

Hi

I'm working on an opensrc project that needs Lucene 2.9 and uses Maven, 
it would be great if Lucene 2.9 could be found automatically so that 
other developers can easily run and build the project.
First of all I changed the version field from 2.4 to 2.9 in my pom.xml 
but lucene couldn't find it, 2.9 isn't in the repo1 server, I then 
looked at the latest developer build on hudson and in the 
maven-metadata.xml file it has the version set to 2.4-SNAPSHOT so I 
changed the version to that instead , no luck.

So is there any way I can do it without manually downloading the jar and 
installing it, and whats the ETA for the actual release of 2.9

thanks Paul
