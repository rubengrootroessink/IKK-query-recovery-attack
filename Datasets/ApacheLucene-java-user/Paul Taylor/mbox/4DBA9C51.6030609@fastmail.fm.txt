SUBJECT: Lucene 3.0.3 with debug information
DATE: 29 Apr 2011

Is there a built debug version of lucene 3.0.3 so I can profile it 
properly to find what part of the search is taking the time.

Note:Ive already profiled by application and determined that it is the 
lucene/Search that is taking the time, I also had another attempt using 
luke but find it incredibly buggy and of little use.

thanks Paul
