OK thanks for all the info, as I said previously I worked round the 
problem so I dont need to do any coding, but the obvious followup 
question to above is:Why don't Phrase queries support wildcards, does it 
not just not make sense, or has it just not been done yet, as i said 
before there is nothing in the query syntax documentation to indicate it 
isnt supported.

thanks paul
