Thanks but that doesn't really address the issue.
A user send a lucene query, I then just use QueryParser.parse() to parse 
the query and perform the search, your solution  to manually create a 
query  isn't going to work, the query could contain  many different 
terms.

Actually what I ideally want I really want is for lucene to realise that 
when a particular field is being searched (in this case qdur) it should 
convert the values to allow the range to work properly, i.e by flagging 
a field as being numeric when you create the index.
