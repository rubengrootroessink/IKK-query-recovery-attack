SUBJECT: AW: Lucene 2.9 and 3.0: Optimized index is thrice as large as the not optimized index
DATE: 7 Jan 2010

Otis,

thanks for the answer. 

Unfortunatelly the index *directory* remains larger *after" the optimization.
In our case the otimization was/is completed successfully and, as you say,
there is only one segment in the directory.

Some other ideas?

Thanks,
Yuliya
