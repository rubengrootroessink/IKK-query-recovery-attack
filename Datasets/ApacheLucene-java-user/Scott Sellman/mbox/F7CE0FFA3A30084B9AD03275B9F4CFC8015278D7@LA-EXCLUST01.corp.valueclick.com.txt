SUBJECT: Improving Search Performance on Large Indexes
DATE: 24 May 2007

Hello, 

 

Currently we are attempting to optimize the search time against an index
that is 26 GB in size (~35 million docs) and I was wondering what
experiences others have had in similar attempts.  Simple searches
against the index are still fast even at 26GB, but the problem is our
application allows the user a lot of options in searching, which can
generate complicated queries.  Based on previous posts we decided to try
splitting our index into multiple indexes and use ParallelMultiSearcher.
When we split our single index into 6 separate ones we recorded a 25%
decrease in response time on minimal load.  We haven't done any stress
testing on it yet, has anyone noticed problems with increased load when
using ParallelMultiSearcher?  What about using machines with more
processors in combination with the ParallelMultiSearcher, does this
result in much response time improvement?  Or is the slow down primarily
with disk access?

 

Any recommendations are welcome. 

 

Thanks in advance, 

Scott
