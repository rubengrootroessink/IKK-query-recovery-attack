Yes, after I created a new MultiFieldQueryParser and calling the parse( String query) method
my search executed as expected.  

Thanks for your help!

I am using the parse(String query, String[] fields, BooleanClause.Occur[] flags, Analyzer
analyzer) method as opposed to parse(String[] queries, String[] fields, Analyzer analyzer).
 They seem to have the same result.

I am adding additional Query objects later on in my code.

Why do you explicitly specify these operators?

> q.add(keywordQuery, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST); 

You seem to wrap a query in another BooleanQuery. As long as keywordQuery 
is the only query that doesn't seem to make sense. Please try using the 
MultiFieldQueryParser's constructor, not the static method. I think that 
might fix your problem.
