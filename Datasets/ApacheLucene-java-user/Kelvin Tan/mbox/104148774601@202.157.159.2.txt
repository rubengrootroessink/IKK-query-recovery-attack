FYI, I chanced upon a Lucene module for OpenCMS.
http://www.opencms.com/opencms/opencms/service/modules.html

The dist includes a PDF parser. I have not tested it yet, the source 
is not available, and its not clear what the licensing is (OpenCMS is 
LGPL, but modules are not bound by that license).

Just thought people want to know about it, and how it may be yet 
another alternative for pdf parsing.

Regards,
Kelvin
