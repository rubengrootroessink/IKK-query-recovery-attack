Good point.

How about if the structure of the Document is known (as is usually the case), and a contract
be made that the first, say 3 fields, are always lazy-loaded. That way, the iteration through
all fields can be avoided.

Here's my requirement, and you may have a better idea of approaching it: I need to perform
a simple "Top 10 most frequent occurring <field>" from a search. Right now, the naive
implementation simply goes through all the hits, gets the respective field(s) and performs
the counting. The requirement is not so different from sorting. Sorting loads and caches all
the values for that term in the index, but that approach is probably not optimal in this case
because there are multiple fields, and they are variable length.

Ideally, I'd like to load only the fields I need from the Documents (for counting purposes).
When the user actually views that hit, then I can load the rest of the fields for display.

Any ideas?
