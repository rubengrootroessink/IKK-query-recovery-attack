I think the answer really really depends on the query input source, and 
user-savvy. 

If the source is a web-based form AND users only enter "basic" searches, then 
lucenequeryconstructor.js in sandbox does an adequate job of building complex 
queries from a simple form. Alternatively, just use javascript to modify the 
query before form submission.

In any event, many people seem to miss the second parse method in 
MultiFieldQueryParser:

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/queryParser/MultiFie
ldQueryParser.html#parse(java.lang.String, java.lang.String[], int[], 
org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer)

Still, the queries that can be constructed using MultiFieldQueryParser aren't 
complex, as compared to lucenequeryconstructor for instance.
