hmmmm...have read http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg00133.html

True (and it's great) that once an IndexReader is open, no actions on the IndexWriter affect
it. 

However, if an IndexReader is opened _after_ indexing begins, I suppose it'll throw an exception?
Doesn't it mean that when indexing is taking place, the search engine is effectively down...

I suppose then, that if I still want to have the search engine up whilst indexing (where indexing
takes a non-trivial amount of time), I'll have to index to a temporary location, then copy
the index files over? Alternatively, I guess it's possible to open an IndexReader _before_
commencement of indexing and provide this instance of IndexReader to clients who need to search?

I just realized that I've effectively rephrased my initial question (and post). Perhaps it's
the way I phrased my question (or that I'm missing something), but I don't seem to have gotten
my query across initially...

Regards,
Kelvin

  Once an IndexReader is open, no actions on an IndexWriter should affect it.
  Adding documents in another thread or process will not affect search results
  until a new IndexReader is opened.  Searching and indexing may proceed
  simultaneously.
