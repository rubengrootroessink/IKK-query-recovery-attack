That's pretty interesting because I've done something similar, but I
(vainly) try to build some intelligence into it.

First I run the text through a regex which filters out most of the words
which contain nonsense characters (^A-Za-z0-9_@).

Then I run it through a couple of tests, which try to guess if this is an
English word, like testing for 3 consonants in a row, and if there are 2
numbers which are not next to each other (can you think of any?!?!). Based
on these, I rank the documents. Finally, if the word is less than 5
characters, I run it through a wordlist.

The results are <emphasis>acceptable</emphasis>. The difficulty is that when
faced with large documents (>5MB), you end up with alot of nonsense terms,
actually exceeding Lucene's inbuilt limit of 10000 terms (to limit memory
usage). The result is that these documents are not indexed completely.

I'd be interested to see how you filter your documents...:)
