Sorry, I meant to ask if you're using String fields (field.stringValue()) or reader fields
(field.readerValue()). 

Can you elaborate on the post-processing you need to do? Have you thought about concatenating
the fields you require into a single non-indexed field (Field.UnIndexed) for simple retrieval?
It'll increase the size of your index, but should be faster to retrieve them all at one go.
