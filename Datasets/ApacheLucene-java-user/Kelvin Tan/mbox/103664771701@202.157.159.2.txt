SUBJECT: Re: Deleting fields from a Document
DATE: 7 Nov 2002

This brings me to a related discussion:  in-memory and index Field 
representations.

Does an in-memory Field guarantee access to its name and value? Say I 
retrieve a Field from a Document A, and add it to a new Document B. 
Before writing B to the index, I delete A. Would B still contain the 
Field? If so, does it work for both String-based and Reader-based 
values?

Regards,
Kelvin
