SUBJECT: Query validation in web app
DATE: 5 Mar 2004

Lucene reacts pretty badly to non-wellformed queries, not throwing a 
checked/unchecked Exception but throwing an Error. The error message is also 
unintelligible to a user (non-developer).

How are people checking/validating queries from a web-app?

I have some checked-in code in sandbox that does javascript validation, but I 
wonder if there's a smarter way to do query validation..
