SUBJECT: Indexing and Searching happening together
DATE: 31 Jan 2002

In the case where indexing takes a non-trivial amount of time, what is the expected behaviour
when a search is performed while indexing is still going on? 

Would it be a good solution to index in a temporary location, then copying the index files
over to the final location when done?

Thanks..
