I'm not too familiar with websearch's PDF parsing.

I use a nice API Etymon Pj http://www.etymon.com/pj/

It doesn't come with the ability to extract text, but it can be coded. I'll
leave you to do it because it's kinda fun, but I could provide it if anyone
wants it.

I've also implemented it so that the searches can be performed on a
page-by-page basis. That's pretty cool, i think.
