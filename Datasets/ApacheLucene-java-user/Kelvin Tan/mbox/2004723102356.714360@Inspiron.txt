If you don't have low-level access to the framework that can retrieve a batch 
list of accessible IDs, document-by-document checking of ACL will be _painful_.

I implemented ACL checking via Filters. Caching filters definitely helps, but 
may not be applicable in every situation. I stored the UUID of each document in 
the database as well as in Lucene. That way, by retrieving a list of accessible 
documents via SQL, I can create the necessary BitSet.
