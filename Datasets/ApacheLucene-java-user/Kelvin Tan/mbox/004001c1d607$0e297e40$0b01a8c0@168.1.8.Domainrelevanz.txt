DATE: 28 Mar 2002

The API provides the Filter mechanism for filtering out hits before they are
searched.

The alternative is to write your own classes to filter out documents
returned after searching.
If its not efficient to check on every single document, or the results are
not obtained in batch, then this method is probably better.

I currently run a query through my database to return a list of documents
which a particular user is allowed to access. The Filter method, thus makes
a good deal of sense for me, since I'm able to obtain the results in batch.

>From my interpretation of the FAQ, it seems that you're expected to write
your own code to perform post-search filtering and not use/subclass the
Filter class. Of course, this could be made slightly clearer...
