Even if each thread has its own reader, after it has obtained the reader,
another thread may have written to the index...

hmmmm...interesting. It's a good suggestion, and I'll need to think abit
more about it.

Sorry. I should've been more explicit. Indexing means the creation of
Document objects and adding fields to them, not adding them to the writer
yet.

I know. My approach wasn't working with batches at all. Each indexing thread
was just adding documents to a hashtable. The main thread would then iterate
through the hashtable and add them to the writer.

This seems like a silly question, but will keeping hold of Document objects
cause me to run into "Too many files open" problems? If each document object
has a Field.Text which contains a Reader, and the Reader isn't closed till
the document is indexed, would this be an issue? Is the memory consumed by
Document objects directly proportional to the size of the object the Reader
reads?

Thanks.

Regards,
Kelvin
