SUBJECT: RE: Lucene Turbine Service
DATE: 27 Jan 2003

Seth,

I had been meaning to do it for awhile, but inertia was overwhelming. 
Then I recently needed to be able to modify the configuration of the 
service at runtime, and Fulcrum didn't support that, so I just 
refactored my way out of it. :-)

Why had I been wanting to do it? well, on hindsight, I think it never 
was a good candidate for a turbine service in the first place. the 
way i see it, a good candidate requires

a) Lifecycle support
b) Configuration
c) Pluggable implementations

For LuceneSearchService, a) was minimal, b) yes but not a big factor 
and c) turned out to be impractical. I had hopes of creating a 
SearchService where one could plug-in various implementations (check 
out 
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org/msg01461.htm
l) but gave up in the end.

Let me see if I can cleanup the subsystem I've refactored out and 
check it in to Sandbox, then maybe we can discuss from there?
