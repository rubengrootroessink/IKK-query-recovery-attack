You might want to take a look at WebSearch http://www.i2a.com/websearch/. It
has an _ok_ system going with respect to PDFs. PDFGo supports viewing of PDF
but a guy I contacted there says there's no current support for text
extraction but that he's "planning to do it".

Definitely agreed on the PJ resources bit. Doesn't really scale well in
terms of PDF file size.

If you haven't already seen the post, I once did a cursory examination of
the options for extracting text from PDF files via Java and the limitations
of the approaches.

The Etymon lib is GPL'ed, so I guess that's a nice place to start. As far as
the libs I've seen so far, most of them are really concerned with the
display and manipulation of PDF pages. Since we're looking for something
less complex (i.e text extraction), maybe it's not so bad. I've spent abit
of time in this area before so feel free to email me offline about this. Not
sure how much help I can be though.
