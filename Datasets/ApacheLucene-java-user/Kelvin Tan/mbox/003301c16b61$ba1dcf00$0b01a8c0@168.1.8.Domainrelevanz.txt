SUBJECT: Recommended way of performing multi-field searches
DATE: 12 Nov 2001

This is a repost of a question posted to jGuru Lucene Forum. Didn't get a response there so
I'm trying my luck here...

What's the recommended way of performing multi-field searches? 

  a.. Programmatically adding a :[field] for each field to the query and parsing this query?

Thanks

Sincerely,
Kelvin Tan
