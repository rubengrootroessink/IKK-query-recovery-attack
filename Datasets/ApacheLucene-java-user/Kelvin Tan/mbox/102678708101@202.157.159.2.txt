hmmm...is this documented somewhere? I go through quite abit of trouble 
just to close Searchers (because Hits become invalid when the Searcher is 
closed). 

If the object has a close() method with public modifier, isn't it a common 
idiom that client code needs to invoke close() explicitly? If there's no 
real need to call close, maybe it can be changed to protected?
