SUBJECT: NPE in Hits.getMoreDocs
DATE: 15 Jan 2003

Weird error, only occurs when searching. Indexing is ok. 

Has anyone else encountered this?

java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.getMoreDocs(Hits.java:91)
	at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.<init>(Hits.java:81)
	at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:74)

Looking at the src, it really doesn't make very much sense, since the 
only object that could be null in line 91 is the searcher object. 
Still, maybe someone can make more out of it...

Regards,
Kelvin
