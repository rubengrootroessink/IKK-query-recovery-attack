I think I've addressed my little problem. What I did was extend QueryParser
and in that class, implement a method which constructs a Query based on the
appropriate fields (I tried taking a look at QueryParser.jj, but gave up
after awhile...:)

If anyone's interested, I'd be happy to donate the code.

Regards,
Kelvin
