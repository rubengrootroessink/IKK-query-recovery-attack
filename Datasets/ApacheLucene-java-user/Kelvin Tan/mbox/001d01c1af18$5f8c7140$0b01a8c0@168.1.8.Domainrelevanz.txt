Ype,

Thanks. :)

Got it using IndexReader.termDocs( Term('IDENTIFIER', someAllowedValue)) as you said...

I kinda got misled by the use of TermEnum in DateFilter...

  It works so you did it correctly.
  You can also use IndexReader.termDocs( Term('IDENTIFIER', someAllowedValue))
  and enumerate the resulting TermDocs. It will get you to the doc nr you need
  to set in the BitSet.

  Good luck,
