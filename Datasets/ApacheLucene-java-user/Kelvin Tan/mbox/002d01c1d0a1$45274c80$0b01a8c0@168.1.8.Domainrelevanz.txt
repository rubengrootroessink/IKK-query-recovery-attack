Otis,

I suppose that's possible.

Actually if you need to construct complex multi-field boolean queries via a
web-based form, my recommendation is to use client-side Javascript. I posted
one such script a while back (for the life of me I don't know why it slipped
my mind about it). The difficulty, IMHO, is not getting QueryParser to
construct the query, but making query construction by the end-user simple
enough and idiot-proof...:)

Regards,
Kelvin
