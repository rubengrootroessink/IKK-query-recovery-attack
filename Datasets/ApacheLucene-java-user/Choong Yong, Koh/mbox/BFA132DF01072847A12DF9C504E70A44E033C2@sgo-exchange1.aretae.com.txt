Hi,

	I came across LARM web crawler some time ago, and recently has
discovered Nutch from reading previous months' mailing list.

	The question I have is that it seems to me both the projects are
doing the same thing - enabling web crawling and indexing using Lucene,
but why two projects doing the same thing?  Also, there are a few
'versions' of LARM as far as I see, one in the SandBox and one in
larm.sourceforge.net, which one is the latest?

	Thanks.

Choong Yong, Koh
