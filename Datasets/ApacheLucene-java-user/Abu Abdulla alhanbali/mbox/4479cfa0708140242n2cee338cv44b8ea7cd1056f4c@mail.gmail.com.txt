Thanks for the help,

please provide the code to do that.

I tried with this one but it didn't work:

Query filterQuery = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(new String{query1, query2,
query3, query4, .... }, new String{field1, field2, field1, field2, ... },
new KeywordAnalyzer());

this results in:

field1:query1 OR field2:query2 OR
field1:query3 OR field2:query4 ... etc

and NOT:

(field1:query1 AND field2:query2) OR
(field1:query3 AND field2:query4) ... etc

please help.
