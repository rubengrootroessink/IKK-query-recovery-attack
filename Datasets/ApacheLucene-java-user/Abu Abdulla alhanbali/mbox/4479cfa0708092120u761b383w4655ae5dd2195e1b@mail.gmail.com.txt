SUBJECT: formalizing a query
DATE: 10 Aug 2007

Hi,

I need your help in formalizing this query:

(field1:query1 AND field2:query2) OR
(field1:query3 AND field2:query4) OR
(field1:query5 AND field2:query6) OR
(field1:query7 AND field2:query8) ... etc

Please give the code since I'm new to lucene
how we can use MultiFieldQueryParser or any parser to do the job

greatly appreciated
