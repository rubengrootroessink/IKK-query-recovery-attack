This problem was already mentioned on the developer list. The analyzer tries
to do some noun recognition. But it does a bad job ;)

For now you could check out the current lucene version from cvs and just
comment out the following line:

 uppercase = Character.isUpperCase( term.charAt( 0 ) );

Then just run ant to built the jar. This fixes the problem you described.

Regards
Christoph
