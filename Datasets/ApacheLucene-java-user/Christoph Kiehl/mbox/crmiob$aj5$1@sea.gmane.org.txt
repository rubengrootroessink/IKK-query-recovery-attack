SUBJECT: Use a date field for ranking
DATE: 7 Jan 2005

Hi,

we are currently implementing a search engine for a news site. Our goal 
is to have a search result that uses the publish date of the documents 
to boost the score of the documents.

I took a look at nutch to see how it implements pagerank and it seems 
like this is done at index time by setting a document boost.

This approach won't work for us because ranking by date is optional. We 
have to use something that boosts the scores at _search_ time.

My idea is to implement it like the sort functionality built into lucene 
and use the FieldCache.

Has anyone a better idea or an important downside of this approach?

Regards,
Christoph
