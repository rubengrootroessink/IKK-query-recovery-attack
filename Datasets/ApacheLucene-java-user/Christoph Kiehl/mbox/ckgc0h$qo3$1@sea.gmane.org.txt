Why would put everything into a single index? I found some benchmark 
results on the list (starting with your post from 06/08/04) from which I 
got the impression that the performance loss is very small if I choose 
to search in multiple indexes with MultiSearcher instead of using one 
big index.

How do you get from 1 index to N indices without adding the documents again?

Thanks,
Christoph
