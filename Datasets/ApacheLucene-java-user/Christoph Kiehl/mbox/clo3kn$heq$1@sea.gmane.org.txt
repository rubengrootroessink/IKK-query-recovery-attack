Hi,

I'm curious about your strategy to backup indexes based on FSDirectory. 
If I do a file based copy I suspect I will get corrupted data because of 
concurrent write access.
My current favorite is to create an empty index and use 
IndexWriter.addIndexes() to copy the current index state. But I'm not 
sure about the performance of this solution.

How do you make your backups?

Regards,
Christoph
