I should have been more specific. The IndexReader which gets opened by 
an IndexSearcher will never have any changes to commit. So there will 
never be a problem with locks. As soon as you use an IndexReader to 
modify your index (delete doc for example) you should not have another 
IndexReader or IndexWriter open or you will probably get problems with 
the locks.
