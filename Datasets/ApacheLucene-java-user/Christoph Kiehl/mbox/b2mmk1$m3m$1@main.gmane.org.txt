AFAIK the terms in your queries are by default concatenated by OR. This
means "cloning clone animal" == "cloning OR clone OR animal".

Hm, strange. I would expect "+(cloning clone) +animal" being translated to
"(cloning OR clone) AND animal". I just tried it here. The translation is
done as I expected. Perhaps you could try the last query ("(cloning OR
clone) AND animal") and compare the resultsize with the one from "+(cloning
clone) +animal" (even if both seem to be the same as "(cloning clone) AND
animal" ;)?
