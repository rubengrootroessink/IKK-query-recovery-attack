SUBJECT: How to get all field names
DATE: 12 Nov 2002

Hi,

I was wondering if there is a possibility to get a list of all field names
that have ever been used to index a document? This way I could filter out
some special fields, like identity and such, and do a search over the
remaining. That would give me total freedom to choose any document structure
and have all fields searched. Is this possible? Or do anyone of you have a
better way achieving that?

Regards
Christoph
