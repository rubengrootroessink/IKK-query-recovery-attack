You sould never use the hits for other use than retrieving a group of
results (usually a page of 10-20-30 docs).

You could see Apache Solr's implementation of faceted search.
I've use that code as a guide to group & count diferent facets (or
conditions, fields as you wanna call it), is pretty fast, and you have
endless optimization approaches.
