SUBJECT: Re: Deleting from Index by URL field: is it safe?
DATE: 29 Nov 2008

It works exactly as it does when you search of that term.

Review in your index creation, if you store it without analyzing it
(Index.UN_TOKENIZED), it will only match that document when you have an
exact URL.

It's possible that the URL is not unique enought in your domain, there is no
other unique identifier that you could use?

I suggest you create a test and try it on a RAMDirectory and see exactly
what happens and what you want!
