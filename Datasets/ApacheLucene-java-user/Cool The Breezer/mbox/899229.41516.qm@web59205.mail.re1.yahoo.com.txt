I tried closing but getting "index already closed" error.

IndexReader newReader =  reader.reopen();
			if (newReader != reader) {
//			    reader was reopened
			   reader.close(); 
			 }
			
			reader = newReader;

I think when old reader is assigned with new reader, somehow it is not successful. can you
think, these could be any problem?
