You could you phrase queries also like "Economic Meltdown" AND "Asian Countries". but these
phrases may be too distant from one another to be relevant for your searching purposes. 
To get better result wrt position(distance between phrases), you can use SpanNearQuery.

Let me know if you need more help.

regards,
RB
