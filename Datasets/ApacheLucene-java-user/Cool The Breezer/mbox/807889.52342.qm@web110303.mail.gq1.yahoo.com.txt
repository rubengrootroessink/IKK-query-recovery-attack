DATE: 10 Nov 2008

Could able to do that using range query

String end = "253373251260000";//i.e. 11/30/9999, assume that this is max end date

Term endTerm = new Term("timestamp",end);
RangeQuery rangeQuery = new RangeQuery(null,endTerm,true);
		
Sort sort = new Sort("timestamp",true);
Filter dupFilter = new DuplicateFilter("id");
Hits hits = searcher.search(rangeQuery,dupFilter,sort);
