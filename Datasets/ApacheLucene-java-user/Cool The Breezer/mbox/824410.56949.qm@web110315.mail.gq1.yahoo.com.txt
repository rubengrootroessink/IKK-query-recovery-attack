SUBJECT: IndexWriter creates multiple .cfs files
DATE: 8 Dec 2009

Hello Group,
                  I am continuously updating an index and at the same time searcher also searches
the index, which resulted in multiple .cfs files for each commit by IndexWriter. I am not
sure whether this is an expected behavior or I need to merge each time after IndexWriter commits.
In between the writer's commit, I reopen the IndexReader but still .cfs files keep on increasing.
I would like to have one .cfs file which can be reopened frequently by reader and at the same
time progressive commit by writer. Is it possible?
