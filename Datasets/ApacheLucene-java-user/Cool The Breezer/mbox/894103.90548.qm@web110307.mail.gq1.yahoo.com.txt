Thanks Mike for your timely suggestion. Somehow readers are not reopened properly.

IndexWriter takes care of merging the CFSs down, over time.  Have you
changed your mergeFactor?  It's odd to see 100s of CFSs.

Or maybe you're not closing the old reader on reopening a new one?
That would prevent deletion of the files.

I am not sure whether this is an expected behavior or I need to merge each time after IndexWriter
commits. In between the writer's commit, I reopen the IndexReader but still .cfs files keep
on increasing. I would like to have one .cfs file which can be reopened frequently by reader
and at the same time progressive commit by writer. Is it possible?
