In HotelDatabase project of lucene, Following code is written in performSearch method of SearchEngine
class.

Let queryString = "Located in the heart of paris"

Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
IndexSearcher is = new IndexSearcher("index");
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("content", analyzer);
Query query = parser.parse(queryString);
Hits hits = is.search(query);

To be specific what i want here
i) Removing stop words from query string and use stemming, so new query string should become
"Locate heart paris"
ii) How to get term frequency (tf) of each word in query?
iii) How to get Document Frequency(df) of each word in query?
iv) How to get Inverse Document Frequency (idf) of each word in query?


Can u please let me know some solution that give answer of all my four questions. Or can you
refer me to some sample code.  I have tried boolean query but unable to do this.
