SUBJECT: applying cosine similarity directly
DATE: 12 Sep 2009

Given that I have a field for which term vector was computed and stored, and
that field is the text of a document, I'd like to rank a subset of such
documents by similarity to a given held-out document, or query, directly
using the cosine measure.  How can that be done without going through
creating a usual query?
Cheers,
Alexy
