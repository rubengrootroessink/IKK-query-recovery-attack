DATE: 24 Oct 2010

A good suggestion. But I'm using Lucene 3.0.2 and the constructor for a StandardAnalyzer has
Version_30 as its highest value. Do you know when 3.1 is due?

Hi Martin,

StandardTokenizer and -Analyzer have been changed, as of future version 3.1 (the next release)
to support the Unicode segmentation rules in UAX#29.  My (untested) guess is that your hyphenated
word will be kept as a single token if you set the version to 3.1 or higher in the constructor.
