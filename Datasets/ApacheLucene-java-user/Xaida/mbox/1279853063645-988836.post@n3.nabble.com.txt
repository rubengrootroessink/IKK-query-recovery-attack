SUBJECT: Hot to get word importance in lucene index
DATE: 23 Jul 2010


Hi all!

hmmm, i need to get how important is the word in entire document collection
that is indexed in the lucene index. I need to extract some "representable
words", lets say concepts that are common and can be representable to whole
collection. Or collection "keywords". I did the fulltext indexing and the
only field i am using are text contents, because titles of the documents are
mostly not representable(numbers, codes etc....)

So, if i calculate tfidf, it gives me importance of single term with respect
to single document. But if that word is repeating in the documents, how can
i calculate its total importance within index?

All help appreciated!! Thank you!!!
