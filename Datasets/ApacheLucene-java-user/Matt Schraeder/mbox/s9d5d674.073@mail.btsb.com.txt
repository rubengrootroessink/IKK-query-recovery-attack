SUBJECT: Re: Speed of fuzzy searches
DATE: 3 Apr 2009

After doing some research I broke down and just updated my Zend
Framework.  I just installed it not long ago so I didn't think much of
it, but then I realized I'm running version 1.6.1 and that Zend is
currently on 1.7.8.  Upon upgrading the complex fuzzy search that was
taking 30 seconds now takes 0.067 seconds.  I have no idea what changed
in the past few months, and see no mention of performance issues on
their issue tracker  but all seems well now.  Figured I'd post here to
give others a heads up if they run into similar issues like I did.

I'm using the Zend_Search_Lucene implementation so I'm really not sure
how it handles the IndexReader.  At the top of the script I open the
index and do searches on it.  Unless Zend is doing something special
in
the background I'm assuming I'm using the IndexReader on a per-page
basis.  I haven't been able to find any information on this yet, but
from all the examples I've been reading none of them say to keep the
index in a session to improve speed.  I'll have to get on the zend
mailing lists to find out more about best practices.

I'll look at a longer prefix setting, as the reply above mentioned the
improving search speed article.  Currently my index has 104076 terms
in
it.
