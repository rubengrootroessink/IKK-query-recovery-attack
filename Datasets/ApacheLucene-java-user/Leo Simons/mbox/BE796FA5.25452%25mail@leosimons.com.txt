Oh no, please do direct this stuff at infra@; there's more people than just
me working on this. I might not be around :-D

In short, no. In long...

Not me, though I think there is some information hidden somewhere on
moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de. Basically the moin people cleaned up their parser a
whole lot.

I'm afraid not, sorry.

Well, it wouldn't have to be slowly. These pages in the end are all plain
text. One could write a script that looks for something like

  "^ +(=+) +(.*) +(=+)$"

And replace it with

  "$1 $2 $3"

Or something similar. I don't have time for that right now, but file a jira
issue, and it might happen sooner or later :-D


Cheers,
