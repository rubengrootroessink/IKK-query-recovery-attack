SUBJECT: Using single or multiple indices for searching different entity types
DATE: 8 May 2008


Hello,

Just to provide some backround information. We have 4 main entities that we
can search over in our product. These entities represent... 
* Client Information (Has 30+ fields storing client information so user can
search clientName:"Ian")
* Project Information (Has 20+ fields)
* Contact Information (Has 30+ fields)
* Document Information (Has 5 fields with one containing tokenized text of
word, txt, pdf, etc documents)

All this information is stored within the one index. All the documents have
a type and an id field to uniquely identify the entity instance. We allow
the user to choose what entity types to search over e.g. Just Client and
Project information or all information etc. We use the type field to specify
what entity type to restrict the search to. 

My question surrounds the best mechanism to index this information? Should I
be storing these entities in different indices? This would mean I might have
to preform four searches if searching over all information and maybe lose
search relevance ordering. The problem with using one index is that I have a
large amount of fields for each Lucene document that are not populated or
relevent when the document represents only one of my entities.

Thank you,
JP

Also, I am a Lucene.Net user. Is this still the best place for me to post my
questions?
