SUBJECT: SpanNearQuery with support for missing words
DATE: 8 Jul 2006

Hello folks !
 
I'm looking for a way to search for a phrase, where in
I shud get a hit even if some (N) words in the query
phrase is not matching or even not inorder, i.e. it
shud match maximum to the query string. I also need to
get the Spans for the hits for highlighting. 
 
SpanNearQuery is quite helpful with inorder set to
false and for getting the spans.  Is it possible to
modify SpanNearQuery, so that it wud return the spans
of the max match string ??

Query : quick brainy fox 
 
it should give me <quick brown fox>...
 
We can prolly (must) have a parameter for N, the
number of term mismatches allowed. It will surely be
helpful in search also... 
 
Any thoughts ?? 
 
Regards...
 
Jonny !
