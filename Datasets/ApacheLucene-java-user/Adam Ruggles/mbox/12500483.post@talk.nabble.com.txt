SUBJECT: How to boost a document based on a field in the document
DATE: 5 Sep 2007


I'm trying to find a query that would boost a document based on a field in
the document.

I have a simple index with title, description, date, ... I also have a field
called vote.  I want items that have been voted higher to be ranked as
higher in the search results.  Is there a query and or filter I could use to
accomplish this?
