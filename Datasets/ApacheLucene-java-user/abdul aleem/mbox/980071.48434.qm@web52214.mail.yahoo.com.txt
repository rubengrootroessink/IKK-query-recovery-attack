SUBJECT: Using Lucene to search log files
DATE: 11 Dec 2006

Hi All,

Im a Lucene newbie,


Requirement : 
==============
a) Build a log viewer tool, search log files for
keywords and time stamp

b)  files in production approx 200 logs per day and
each log file may range from 1MB - 5MB

Lucene 
========
We wanted to utilize Lucene's search capabilities
especially search all 200 log files content quickly

a) Search criteria:
    i) Timestamp search: Fetch contents between any
two timestamps 

   ii) Fetch log file contents for specified keyword 


Query 
========
    a ) Would greatly appreciate if some suggestions 
        whether Lucene will be appropriate tool for
the requirement ??


    b) I have tried to use SpanQuery however
struggling to fetch entire conents e.g. (between two
timestamps) 

    c) I had also looked at
LargeScaleDateRangeProcessing in the wiki, is that a
right approach for the requirement



  Any help / suggestion would be greatly appreciated,


  Many thanks in advance,
  Abdul
