Many thanks Erick,

Your points are valid, i was thinking entire Log file
as a lucene document, im wrong trying  to chop the log
file might be the way to go

my bad expressions , yes you got that right
timestamp must be added as a "FIELD" that is what i
meant

really appreciate your detailed reply,


regards,
Abdul
