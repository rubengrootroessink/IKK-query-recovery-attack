Hi.

First, thanks for the reply.

Why does SubversionUpdate require shutting down the IndexSearcher?  What

SubversionUpdate requires shutting down the IndexSearcher in our current
implementation because the old index files are deleted in the tag we're
switching to. Sorry, just realised that my last mail didn't state that we
don't in fact to an "svn up", but rather an "svn switch". Thus, when we try
to perform the update SubversionUpdate fails due to file lock issues when
trying to update (deleting the old lucene files) the lucene index directory
(The relevant code for the update action is quoted below).

You might want to switch instead to rsync.

I'm hoping I won't have to, firstly because I'm more familiar with
subversion, secondly because that would require me to configure rsync for
windows, and I'm still not sure if that will help anything with the file
lock issues we're trying to avoid.

A Lucene index is fundamentally write once, so, syncing changes over should

So I should be able to run the switch and then restart the IndexSearcher,
instead of turning off the IndexSearcher, run the switch, turn on the
IndexSearcher. I'd see how that would work with a linux box, having a bit
more trouble seeing how I will get it to work with a windows box (and my
live server is unfortunately a Windows 2003 box), Subversion keeps running
into file lock issues when I switch from one tag to the other if I try to
keep the search active. With Lucene 2.1 it even ran into file lock issues
after I'd disabled the search and was performing the switch. Now, when we're
using the Lucene 2.3.2 jar the lock issues has mostly gone (once in 3
months, instead of every switch/update).

Current code:

disableSearch(request); //Sets the SearchActive boolean to false
