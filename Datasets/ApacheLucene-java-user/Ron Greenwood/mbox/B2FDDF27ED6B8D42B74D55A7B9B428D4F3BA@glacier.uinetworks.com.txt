I am also interested in seeing how someone else has implemented this.
We are looking into using lucene for a knowledge base solution using
ejb's.

Thanks, Ron

Subject: EJB solution for Lucene


Hi,

I'm interested in a Lucene EJB solution with JDBC, possibly using
something 
like the SQLDirectory from Marc Kramis at 
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg00416.html
.  
How has such an EJB usage been implemented by other users?  What
happened to 
the performance when replacing file system storage with database
storage?
Anyone who has been down this road before please share a map of the
terrain.

Thanks.
Jeff
