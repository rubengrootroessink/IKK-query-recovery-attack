SUBJECT: Problems while indexing
DATE: 31 Oct 2007

Hello to you all!

I've programmed a portlet search solution by using lucene.
Now that our new Website is short before release the file volume 
increesed fast.

My lucene based index program works fine until the number of files 
incresed so much. Now it works for about 10 minutes and then gives me an 
error message. Sadly very short:

"caught a class java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
  with message: String index out of range: -1"

Has anyone worked with large Websites and Lucene before?

Solutions?

Error occures with lucene 2.2 and 2.0.

Greetings,
Jan
