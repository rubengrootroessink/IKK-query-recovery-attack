SUBJECT: using lucene to search in a 1 huge file. (aka "grep -n")
DATE: 5 Mar 2004

Hi guys,
   I am relatively new to Lucene. Can lucene be used to speed-up search 
for a string in one huge file( ~  TerraBytes ) based on its libe 
numbers.  Something like "grep -n <pattern> <filename>" where the 
indexing will be done only on one file and based on either 
line-numbers/blocks.
