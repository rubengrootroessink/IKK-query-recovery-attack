SUBJECT: Do deleted documents affect scores?
DATE: 11 Feb 2010

I want to focus my previous question.
Say we have two Lucene indexes: A and B.
Index A contains documents a and b.
Index B used to contain documents a, b and c,
But c was deleted.
All documents share some vocabulary.
If we search using terms common to documents b and c,
Can we get a different score for document b in index A and index B?
Note that both indexes are identical with regard to the non-deleted documents,
And only differ by the deleted document c.
Thanks,
Yuval
