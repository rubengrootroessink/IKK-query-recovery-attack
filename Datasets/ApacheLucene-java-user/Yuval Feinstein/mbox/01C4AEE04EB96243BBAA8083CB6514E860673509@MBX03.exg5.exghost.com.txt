Thanks for these directions, Ian.
We are running Lucene 2.9.1 on CentOs 5 64-bit machines.
We do use compound file format, and will look into replacing it with the simple files,
although I believe this will create too many files. 
We will also consider the rsync option.
Thanks again,

Since the update commands may run in different order on different
shards you might get different sets of segments because merges happen
to be triggered at different points in the different batches of
updates.  But you shouldn't have different numbers of deleted docs if
you have really been applying the same updates to all the shards.
Could some updates have been missed?  Or docs added then deleted or
something?  Maybe there are other variations between the shards and
that is causing the variation in query scores.

As an alternative approach you could have one master index per shard
that takes all the updates and then send that index out to the shard
servers.  If you don't use compound file format, and don't optimize,
the file changes are typically quite small with default or sensible
merge settings and can be distributed quickly using rsync.  You can
have more control by using MergePolicy and friends.

What version of lucene are you running?
