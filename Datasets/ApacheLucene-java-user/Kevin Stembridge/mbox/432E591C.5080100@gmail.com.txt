Hi Jeff and Doug,
I've just finished reading Chapter 1 of Lucene in Action (sample chapter 
from Manning) and I've ordered a copy. The sample chapter was pretty 
useful in giving me an idea of how Lucene will fit into my app and I 
think it'll do the trick nicely with a bit of elbow grease on my part.

Thanks very much for the advice.

Cheers,
Kevin
