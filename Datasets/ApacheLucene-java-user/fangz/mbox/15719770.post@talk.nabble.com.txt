I implemented HitCollector as you suggested. It improved the initial run
significantly. However it only showed slight improvement in the subsequent
runs. I don't know how to implement FieldSelector in my situation. My codes
look like this:

public void collect( int doc, float score ) {

    TermFreqVector vector = null;
    vector = searcher.getIndexReader().getTermFreqVector(doc, "field");
    ...

Thank you again!
