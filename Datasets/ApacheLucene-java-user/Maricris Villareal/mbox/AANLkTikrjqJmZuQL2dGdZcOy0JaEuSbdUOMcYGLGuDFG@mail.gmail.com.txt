SUBJECT: term vector - WITH_POSITIONS_OFFSETS vs YES in terms of search performance
DATE: 30 Nov 2010

Hi,

Could someone tell me the effect (if any) of having term vectors set to
WITH_POSITIONS_OFFSETS vs YES in terms of search performance?  I did some
testing and the results were inconclusive.  In one case,
WITH_POSITIONS_OFFSETS was searched faster than YES, in all others, it was
the reverse.  Is the performance effect only at indexing time?

Thanks.
