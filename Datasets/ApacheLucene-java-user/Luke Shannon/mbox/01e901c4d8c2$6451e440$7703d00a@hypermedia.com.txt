SUBJECT: PDF Indexing Error
DATE: 2 Dec 2004

Hello All;

Perhaps this should be on the PDFBox forum but I was curious if anyone has
seen this error parsing PDF documents using packages other than PDFBox.

/usr/tomcat/fb_hub/GM/Administration/Document/java/java_io.pdf
java.io.IOException: You do not have permission to extract text

The weird thing is it gave this error on a document I have indexed a million
times over the last 3 weeks.

Thanks,

Luke
