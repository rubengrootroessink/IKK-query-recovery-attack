This may not be a simple way, but you could just do a quick check on the
folder to see if there is more than one file containing the name segment.

Hello,



Lucene is great!  I just have a question.



Is there a simple way to check and see if an index is already optimized?
What happens if optimize is called on an already optimized index - does
the call basically do a noop?  Or is it still and expensive call?





Regards,



Michael
