SUBJECT: _4c.fnm missing
DATE: 16 Nov 2004

I received the error below when I was attempting to over whelm my system with incremental update
requests.

What is this file it is looking for? I checked the index. It contains:

_4c.del
_4d.cfs
deletable
segments

Where does _4c.fnm come from?

Here is the error:

Unable to create the create the writer and/or index new content /usr/tomcat/fb_hub/WEB-INF/index/_4c.fnm
(No such file or directory).

Thanks,

Luke
