Hi All;

I just want to make sure I have the right idea about boosting.

So if I boost a document (Document A) after I index it (lets say a score of
2.0) Lucene will now consider this document relativly more important than
other documents in the index with a boost factor less than 2.0. This boost
factor will also be applied to all the fields in the Document A. Therefore,
if I do a TermQuery on a field that all my documents share ("title"), in the
returned Hits (assuming Document A was among the return documents), Document
A will score higher than other documents with a lower boost factor because
the "title" field in A would have been boosted with all its other fields.
Correct?

Now if at indexing time I decided to boost a particular field, lets say
"address" in Document A (this is a field which all documents have) the boost
factor is only applied to the "address" field of Document A. Nothing else is
boosted by this operation. This means if a TermQuery on the "address" field
returns Document A along with a collection of other documents, Document A
will score higher than the others because of boosting. Correct?

Thanks,

Luke
