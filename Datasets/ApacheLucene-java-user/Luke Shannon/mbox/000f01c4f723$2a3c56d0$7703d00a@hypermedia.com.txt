One thing that will happen is the lock file will get left behind. This means
when you start back up and try to create another Reader you will get a file
lock error.

Our system is threaded and synchronized. Thus when a Reader is being created
I know it is the only one (the Writer comes after the reader has been
closed). Before creating it I check if the Index is locked. If it is, I
forcefully clear it. This prevents the above problem from happening.

What happens to the Index if the IndexReader crashes, after I have deleted
documents, and before I have called close. Are the deletes ignored? Is the
Index screwed up? Is the filesystem screwed up (if a document is deleted new
delete-files appear) so are the delete-files still there (and can these be
ignored the next time?). Can I restore the index to the previous state, just
by removing those delete-files?
