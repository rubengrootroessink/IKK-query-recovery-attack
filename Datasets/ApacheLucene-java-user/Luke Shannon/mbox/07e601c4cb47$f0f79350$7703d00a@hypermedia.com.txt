Hi Luke;

I implemented the logging like you said. At present I am speeding about 678
milliseconds creating a new IndexSearcher.

I am going to implement your scheme to resolve this but at a later point
since I don't think this is a huge time factor to be worried about at
present.

Thanks for all your help,

Luke
