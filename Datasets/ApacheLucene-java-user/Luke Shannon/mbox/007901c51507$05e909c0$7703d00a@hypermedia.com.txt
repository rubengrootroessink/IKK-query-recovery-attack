SUBJECT: Searches Contain Special Characters

Hi All;

How could I handle doing a wildcard search on the input *mario?

Basically I would be interested in finding all the Documents containing
<anything>*mario<anything>

Here is an example of such a Query generated:

+(type:138) +(name:**mario*)

How can I let Lucene know that the star closest to Mario on the left is to
be treated as a string, not a matching character?

Thanks,

Luke
