40 Million! Wow. Ok this is the kind of answer I was looking for. The site I
am working on indexes maybe 1000 at any given time. I think I am ok with a
single index.

Thanks.

I have an application that I run monthly that indexes 40 million documents
into 6 indexes, then uses a multisearcher.  The advantage for me is that I
can have multiple writers indexing 1/6 of that total data reducing the time
it takes to index by about 5X.

Don't worry, regardless of what I learn in this forum I am telling my
company to get me a copy of that bad boy when it comes out (which as far as
I am concerned can't be soon enough). I will pay for grama's myself.

I think I have reviewed the code you are referring to and have something
similar working in my own indexer (using the "uid"). All is well.

My stupid question for the day is why would you ever want multiple indexes
running if you can build one smart indexer that does everything as
efficiently as possible? Does the answer to this question move me to multi
threaded indexing territory?

Thanks,

Luke
