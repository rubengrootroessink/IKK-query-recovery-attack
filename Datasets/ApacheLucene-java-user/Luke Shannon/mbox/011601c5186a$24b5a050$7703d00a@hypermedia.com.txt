The API I'm working with combines a series of queries into one larger one
using a boolean query.

Queries on the same field get OR's into one big query. All remaining queries
are AND'd with this big one.

Working with in this system I have:

arg = (mario luigi bobby joe) //i do have control of how this list is
created

I pass this to the QueryParser:

Query query1 = QueryParser.parse(arg, "name", new StandardAnalyzer());
Query query2 = QueryParser.parse("stillhere", "olfaithfull", new
StandardAnalyzer());
BooleanQuery typeNegativeSearch = new BooleanQuery();
typeNegativeSearch.add(query1, false, true);
typeNegativeSearch.add(query2, true, false);

This is half the query.

It gets AND'd with the other half, to create what you see below:

+(type:181) +((-(name:tim name:harry name:bill) +olfaithfull:stillhere))

What I am having trouble with is getting the QueryParser to create
this: -name:(tim bill harry)

I feel like this is something simple, but for some reason I can't figure it
out.

Thanks,

Luke
