The schedule is determined by the users of the system. Basically when the
user(s) change the content (adding/deleting a folder or file, modify a
file's content) through a web based interface a re-index is required of the
content. This could happen 20 times in the span of a few seconds or once in
an hour.

I doubt I am overwhelming Lucene, I think the problem is in my code and how
I am managing the deleting and writing to the Index.

> what kind of incremental updates are you doing, because we update our
index every 15 minutes with 100 ~ 200 documents and we're writing to a 6 GB
memory resident index, the IndexWriter runs one instance at a time, so what
kind of increments are we talking about it takes a bit of doing to overwhelm
Lucene.
