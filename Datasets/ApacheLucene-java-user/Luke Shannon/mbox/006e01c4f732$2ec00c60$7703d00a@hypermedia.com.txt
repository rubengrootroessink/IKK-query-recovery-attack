I run the indexer in our CMS everytime a content change has occured. It is
an incremental update so only documents that generate a different UID than
the coresponding UID in the index get processed.

I don't like to periodically re-index everything because 1) you can't be
confident that your searches are as up to date as they could be, and 2)
you are wasting cycles either checking for documents that may or may not
need to be updated, or re-indexing documents that don't need updated.

Ideally, I think that you want an event driven system where the content
management system or the like indicates to your searcher engine when a
page/document gets updated. That way, you know that documents are as up
to date as possible in terms of searches, and you know that you aren't
doing unnecessary work.

If you are using a CMS, your best bet is to integrate Lucene with the
CMS's content update mechanism. That way, your index will always be
up-to-date.

Otherwise, I would say reindexing everything is easiest, provided it
doesn't take too long. If it's ~15 minutes or less, you could schedule a
processes to do it at a low activity period (2 AM or whenever) every day
and that would probably handle your needs.
