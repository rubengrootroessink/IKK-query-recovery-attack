SUBJECT: Re: Parsing The Query: Every document that doesn't have a field containing x (but still has the field)
DATE: 4 Feb 2005

Hello;

I think Chris's approach might be helpfull, but I can't seems to get it to
work.

So since I running out of time and I still need to figure out "starts with"
and "ends with" queries, I have implemented a hacky solution to getting all
documents with a kcfileupload field present that does not contain jpg:

query1 = QueryParser.parse("jpg", "kcfileupload", new StandardAnalyzer());
query2 = QueryParser.parse("stillhere", "olfaithfull", new
StandardAnalyzer());//each document contains this
BooleanQuery typeNegativeSearch = new BooleanQuery();
typeNegativeSearch.add(query1, false, true);
typeNegativeSearch.add(query2, true, false);

What gets returned are all the documents without a kcfileupload = jpg. This
includes documents that don't even have a kcfileupload.

When I go through the results before displaying I check to make sure there
is a "kcfileupload" field.

This is not a good solution, and I hope to replace it soon. If anyone has
ideas please let me know.

Luke

Another approach...

You can make a Filter that is the inverse of the output from another
filter, which means you can make a QueryFilter on the search, then wrap it
in your inverse Filter.

you can't execute a query on a filter without having a Query object, but
you can just apply the Filter directly to an IndexReader yourself, and get
back a BitSet containing the docIds of everydocument that does not contain
your term.

something like this should work...

   class NotFilter extends Filter {
      private Filter wraped;
      public NotFilter(Filter w) {
        wraped = w;
      }
      public BitSet bits(IndexReader r) {
        BitSet b = wraped.bits(r);
        b.flip(0,b.size());
        return b;
      }
   }
   ...
   BitSet results = (new NotFilter
                     (new QueryFilter
                      (new TermQuery(new Term("f","x"))))).bits(reader);
