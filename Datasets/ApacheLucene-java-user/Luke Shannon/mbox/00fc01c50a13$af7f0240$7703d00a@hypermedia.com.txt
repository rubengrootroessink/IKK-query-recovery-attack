The indexing process is totally synchronized in our system. Thus if an
Indexing thread starts up and the index exists, but is locked, I know this
to be the only indexing processing running so the lock must be from a
process that got stopped before it could finish.

So right before I begin writing to the index I have this check:

//if we have gotten to here that this is the only index running.
//the index should not be locked. if it is, the lock is "stale"
//and must be released before we can continue
        try {
            if (index.exists() && IndexReader.isLocked(indexFileLocation)) {
                Trace.ERROR("INDEX INFO: Had to clear a stale index lock");
                IndexReader.unlock(FSDirectory.getDirectory(index, false));
            }
        } catch (IOException e3) {
            Trace.ERROR("INDEX ERROR: Was unable to clear a stale index
lock: " + e3);
        }
