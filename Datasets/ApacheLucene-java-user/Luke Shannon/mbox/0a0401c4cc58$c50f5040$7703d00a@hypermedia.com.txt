SUBJECT: Index Locking Issues Resolved...I hope
DATE: 17 Nov 2004

Hello;

I think I have solved my locking issues. I just made it through the set of
test cases that previously resulted in Index Locking Errors. I just removed
the method from my code that checks for a Index lock and forcefully removes
it after 1 minute. Hopefully they never need to be put back in.

Here is what I changed:

I moved all my Indexer logic into a class called Index.java that implemented
Runnable. Index's start() called a method named go() which was static and
synchronized. go() kicks off all the logic to update the index (the reader,
writer and other members involved with incremental updates also static). I
put logging in place that logs when a thread has executed the method and
what the thread's name is.

Every time a client class changes the content it can create a thread
reference and pass it the runnable Index. The convention I have requested
for naming the thread is a toString() of the current date. Then they start
the thread.

How it worked:

A few users just tested the system, half added documents to the system while
another half deleted documents at the same time. No locking issues were seen
and the index was current with the changes made a short time after the last
operation (in my previous code this test resulted in a issue with index
locking).

I was able to go through the log file and find the start of the synchronized
go() method and the successful completion of the indexing operations for
every request made.

The only performance issue I noticed was if someone added a very large PDF
it took a while before the thread handling the request could finish. If this
is the first operation of many it means the operations following this large
file take that much longer. Luckily for me search results don't need to be
instant.

Things are looking much better. For now...

Thanks to all that helped me up till now.

Luke
