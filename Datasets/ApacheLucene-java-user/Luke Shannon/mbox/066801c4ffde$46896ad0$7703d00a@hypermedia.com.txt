SUBJECT: FOP Generated PDF and PDFBox
DATE: 21 Jan 2005

Hello;

Our CMS now allows users to create PDF documents (uses FOP) and than search
them.

I seem to be able to index these documents ok. But when I am generating the
results to display I get a Null Pointer Exception while trying to use a
variable that should contain the url keyword for one of these documents in
the index:

Document doc = hits.doc(i);
String path = doc.get("url");

Path contains null.

The interesting thing is this only happens with PDF that are generate with
FOP. Other PDFs are fine.

What I find weird is shouldn't the "url" field just contain the path of the
file?

Anyone else seen this before?

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Luke
