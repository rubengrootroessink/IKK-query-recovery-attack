Hi Luke;

I have tried to implement a system where the search method is aware whether
the index folder has been updated or not (so it only creates a new searcher
when required). However, due to the environment this process is running in
it turned out not to be a simple task. I need to move on to some out
standing document types I still need to handle. But before I do that...

When you said "performance boost" how substaintal might this be? For now
each time I finish with a Searcher I close it and set the reference to null.
The application this is running in monitors the levels of memory being
utilized. If utilization gets to high it requests the garbage collector to
run.

I am not totally sure I totally understand risks involved with the
FileHandlers issue you brought up, or what kind of burden I may be putting
on performance by not putting better logic around the creation of the
IndexSearcher. I hoping things will be ok as they are until I can dedicate
more time to the issue.

Are there specific errors or behavior I should look for if I start to run
out of FileHandlers?

Luke
