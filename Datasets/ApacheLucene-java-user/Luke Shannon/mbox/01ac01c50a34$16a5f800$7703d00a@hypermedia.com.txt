Hello,

Still working on the same query, here is the code I am currently working
with.

I am thinking this should bring up all the documents that have
olFaithFull=stillHere and kcfileupload!=jpg (so anything else)

query1 = QueryParser.parse("jpg", "kcfileupload", new StandardAnalyzer());
query2 = QueryParser.parse("stillHere", "olFaithFull", new
StandardAnalyzer());
BooleanQuery typeNegativeSearch = new BooleanQuery();
typeNegativeSearch.add(query1, false, true);
typeNegativeSearch.add(query2, true, false);

There toString() on the query is:

-kcfileupload:jpg +olFaithFull:stillhere

This looks right to me. Why the 0 results?

Thanks,

Luke
