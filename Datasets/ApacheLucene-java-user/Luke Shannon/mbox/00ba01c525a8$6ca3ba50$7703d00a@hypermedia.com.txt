SUBJECT: Boost/Scoring Question
DATE: 10 Mar 2005

Hello;

This may be a trivial questions, but it has me stuck.

I'm getting some really small scores:

8.799379E-4

I need to figure out why they are so small.

I think it is problem which can be resolved using boosting.

I'm not sure how to boost given the system I have. The fields I query
against are not known at the time I create the query, nor are they known
when I index.

Here is how I create a query (the names of the fields I query against are
returned from the ContentFields object):

private static Query parseKeywordsQuery(ArrayList queryData) throws
Exception {
        //get all the content fields
        TreeSet sFields = ContentFields.getInstance().getFields();
        String[] fields = (String[])sFields.toArray(new
String[ContentFields.getInstance().getFields().size()]);
        //get the argument
        String arg = (String) queryData.get(1);
        //create a query
        Query query = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(arg, fields, new
StandardAnalyzer());
        return query;
    }

Here is the query created for sub-brand:

TEXT:"sub brand" TEXT2:"sub brand" active:"sub brand" anouncement:"sub
brand" businessphone:"sub brand" cellphone:"sub brand" cname:"sub brand"
contents:"sub brand" definition:"sub brand" desc:"sub brand" email:"sub
brand" fax:"sub brand" help_image:"sub brand" homephone:"sub brand"
hotwords:"sub brand" id:"sub brand" jobtitle:"sub brand" kcfileupload:"sub
brand" kcpreviewupload:"sub brand" keywords:"sub brand" level:"sub brand"
level_association:"sub brand" mac_file:"sub brand" name:"sub brand"
note:"sub brand" pc_file:"sub brand" question:"sub brand" sort:"sub brand"
stylesheet:"sub brand" thumbnail:"sub brand" uncomp_ext:"sub brand"
urgent:"sub brand" weblink:"sub brand"

I get 22 results but they are all smaller than 0 by an exponent of 4.

Is there anything I can do to resolve this?

Luke
