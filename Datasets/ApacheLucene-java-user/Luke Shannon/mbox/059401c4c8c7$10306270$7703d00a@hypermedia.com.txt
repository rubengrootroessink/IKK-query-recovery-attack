DATE: 12 Nov 2004

Hi;

I am using the HTMLParser that comes with the latest version of Lucene (in
the demo).

Here is the import line:

import org.apache.lucene.demo.html.HTMLParser;

If you have lucene-demos-1.4-final.jar in your class path the system will
find the Parser Class.

I am happy with the results.

Let me know if you need anything else.
