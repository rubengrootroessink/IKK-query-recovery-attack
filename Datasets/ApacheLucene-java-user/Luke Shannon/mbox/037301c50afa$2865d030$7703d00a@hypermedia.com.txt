SUBJECT: Re: Parsing The Query: Every document that doesn't have a field containing x
DATE: 4 Feb 2005

Hi Chris;

So the result would contain all documents that don't have field f containing
x?

What I need to figure out how to do is return all documents that have a
field f, but does not contain x.

Thanks for your post.

Luke

Another approach...

You can make a Filter that is the inverse of the output from another
filter, which means you can make a QueryFilter on the search, then wrap it
in your inverse Filter.

you can't execute a query on a filter without having a Query object, but
you can just apply the Filter directly to an IndexReader yourself, and get
back a BitSet containing the docIds of everydocument that does not contain
your term.

something like this should work...

   class NotFilter extends Filter {
      private Filter wraped;
      public NotFilter(Filter w) {
        wraped = w;
      }
      public BitSet bits(IndexReader r) {
        BitSet b = wraped.bits(r);
        b.flip(0,b.size());
        return b;
      }
   }
   ...
   BitSet results = (new NotFilter
                     (new QueryFilter
                      (new TermQuery(new Term("f","x"))))).bits(reader);
