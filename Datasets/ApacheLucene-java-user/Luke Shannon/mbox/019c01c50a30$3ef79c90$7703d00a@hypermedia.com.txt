Ok.

I have added the following to every document:

doc.add(Field.UnIndexed("olFaithfull", "stillHere"));

The plan is a query that says: olFaithull = stillHere and kcfileupload!=jpg.

I have been experimenting with the MultiFieldQueryParser, this is not
working out for me. From a syntax how is this done? Does someone have an
example of a query similar to the one I am trying?

Thanks,

Luke
