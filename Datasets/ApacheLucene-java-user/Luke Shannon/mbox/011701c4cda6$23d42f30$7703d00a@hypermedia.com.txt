Thank you for the suggestion.

I ended up biting the bullet and re-working my indexing logic. Luckily the
system itself knows what the "current" version of a document is (otherwise
it won't know which one to display to the user) for any given folder.

I was able to get a static method I could call passing in a folder name. The
method returns the file name of the current version for that folder.

Each time I am doing an incremental update if I find that a document from a
folder hasn't changed I make sure it is the current version before moving
on. If it isn't I remove it from the index.

Than when I am creating a new index or adding files to an existing, for each
file, I have to check the file I am adding to ensure it is the current
version for the folder before adding it.

As you can imagine this slows down indexing (creating a new or updating an
existing) but it ensures content from an old version will never show up in a
query.
