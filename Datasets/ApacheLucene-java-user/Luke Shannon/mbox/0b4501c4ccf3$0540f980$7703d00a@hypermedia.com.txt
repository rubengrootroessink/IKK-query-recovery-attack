But to a user it is confusing because they have no idea every change they
make to a note spans a new file and now the are seeing a term they removed
from their note 2 weeks ago showing up in a query.

can somebody suggest a way I could easily scan the index folder ensuring

for folders were there is more than one default.xml file)? Or is this
