Hi;

I am using the PDFBox's getLuceneDocument method to parse my PDF documents. It returns good
results and was very easy to integrate into the project. However it is slow.

Does anyone know of a faster package? Someone mentioned snowtide on an earlier post. Anyone
have experience with this package?
