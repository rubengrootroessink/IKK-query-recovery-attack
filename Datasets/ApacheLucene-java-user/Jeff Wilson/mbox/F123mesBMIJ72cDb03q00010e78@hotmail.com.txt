SUBJECT: EJB solution for Lucene
DATE: 3 Jan 2002

Hi,

I'm interested in a Lucene EJB solution with JDBC, possibly using something 
like the SQLDirectory from Marc Kramis at 
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg00416.html.  
How has such an EJB usage been implemented by other users?  What happened to 
the performance when replacing file system storage with database storage?
Anyone who has been down this road before please share a map of the terrain.

Thanks.
Jeff
