"Google: A Behind-the-Scenes Look
Search is one of the most important applications used on the internet
and poses some of the most interesting challenges in computer science.
Providing high-quality search requires understanding across a wide
range of computer science disciplines. In this program, Jeff Dean of
Google describes some of these challenges, discusses applications
Google has developed, and highlights systems they've built, including
GFS, a large-scale distributed file system, and MapReduce, a library
for automatic parallelization and distribution of large-scale
computation. He also shares some interesting observations derived from
Google's web data."
