Hi all, I have an interesting problem...instead of going from a query
to a document collection, is it possible to come up with the best fit
query for a given document collection (results)? "Best fit" being a
query which maximizes the hit scores of the resulting document
collection.

How should I approach this? All suggestions appreciated.

Thanks
Shashi
