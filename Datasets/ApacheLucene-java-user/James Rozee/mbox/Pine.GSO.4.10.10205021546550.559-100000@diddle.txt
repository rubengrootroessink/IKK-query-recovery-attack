SUBJECT: 3 Times Isn't a Charm for me and Lucene
DATE: 2 May 2002

I've just recently recoded my entire website and search engine to use
Tomcat 4.0.3, Velocity, MySQL and Lucene 1.2-rc4.  I have been using MySQL
and servlets for a few years now.  However, I only recently started using
Lucene.  I've built a Lucene index from my document collection and now I
need to be able to search it from a servlet.

My first attempt to do this causes Tomcat to return a page that is empty.
Can anyone give me some advice on how to track down my problem?  My
hardware is an SS1000E with 5 SM81s and 1.2GB RAM.  Thanks.

James
