That's what I thought of as workaround for the first pages. But at
some point the user might want to see the last page of the results,
so eventually I will have to call

  TopDocs topDocs = indexSearcher.search(query, null, 300500, sort);

and still run into an error. Right now I'd present the user with an
error message like "The search returned too many results, please further
restrict your search" but a more generic solution would sound a lot
better ;)
