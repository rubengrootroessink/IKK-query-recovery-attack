SUBJECT: Is it possible to do a PhraseQuery using XML Query Parser?
DATE: 13 Jan 2010


Dear fellow Java developers:

Is it possible to do a PhraseQuery when using the XML Query Parser?  I
checked the documentation for the XML Query Parser, and it has tags for a
multitude of queries, with PhraseQuery absent from the list.  Is it possible
to do a PhraseQuery using the XMLQueryParser, and if not, is there a way to
implement this functionality?  Just wondering.

Thanks in advance to all who reply.

Sincerely;
Fayyaz
