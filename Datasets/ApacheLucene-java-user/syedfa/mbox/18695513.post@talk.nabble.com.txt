SUBJECT: Re: Creating an index from an XML file using Lucene in Java
DATE: 28 Jul 2008


Hi Karsten:

I have another follow-up question for you.  Once I create the index the way
you suggested, how would I modify my code to search it?


At present, I have the following code:

        Analyzer analyser = new StandardAnalyzer(); 
        Query parser=new QueryParser("LINES", analyser).parse(q); 
        long start=new Date().getTime(); 
        Hits hits=is.search(parser); 
        long end=new Date().getTime(); 
        QueryScorer scorer = new QueryScorer(parser); 

Which I am using in my search() method from my Searcher class.  This method
returns a List that holds javaBean objects which hold the results of each
hit.  The difference here is that I will be searching through another
element, whose attributes are slightly different, eg. if a hit is found in
the <SCENE-COMMENTARY> element, I won't be providing a reference to a
<SPEAKER>, but rather, just the Act, and the Scene.  I get the feeling that
based on the above code, that I would need to create another Query object to
hold the results found in the <SCENE-COMMENTARY> element.  Am I right, or is
there a way around this so that I could use the same Query object to
accomplish this?  Would I need to create a new JavaBean object to store
these results?  Finally, would I be able to display these results to the
user in order of strongest match, to least strongest?  At the moment my
results are created and presented to the user as follows:

for(int i=0; i<hits.length(); i++){ 
        Document doc=hits.doc(i); 
        String lns = doc.get("LINES"); 
        TokenStream lines = analyser.tokenStream("LINES", new
StringReader(lns)); 
        CachingTokenFilter filter = new CachingTokenFilter(lines); 
        String highlightedLines = highlighter.getBestFragment(filter, lns); 
        filter.reset(); 
        String highlight = high.getBestFragment(filter, lns); 
        SearchResult resultBean = new SearchResult(); 
        resultBean.setReference(hits.doc(i).get("REFERENCE")); 
        resultBean.setNarrator(hits.doc(i).get("SPEAKER")); 
        resultBean.setHitResult(highlight); 
        resultBean.setQuote(highlightedLines); 
        searchResult.add(resultBean); 
        System.out.println(resultBean.getReference()); 
        System.out.println(resultBean.getNarrator()); 
        System.out.println(resultBean.getHitResult()); 
        System.out.println(""); 
        System.out.println(resultBean.getQuote()); 

Thanks so much once again for your time and patience Karsten, I really do
appreciate it.

Take care.
Sincerely;
Fayyaz
