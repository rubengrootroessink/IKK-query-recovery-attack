SUBJECT: Lucene vs. LingPipe vs. GATE
DATE: 14 Mar 2009


Dear fellow Java/Lucene developers:

I have been working with lucene for the past year or so in developing search
applications, and just recently discovered another API for Java called
LingPipe.  I have never used LingPipe, and would like to know what is the
difference between the two, and if not, when should you use which tool? 
I've been to LingPipe's website, but it does not clarify how it
distinguishes itself from Lucene.  Is it also used for indexing and
searching documents like Lucene, or is it a tool that you would use
alongside Lucene to get better/different results?  What does it do, that
Lucene can't?  

I am also saying this because a new book just came called: Building Search
Applications: Lucene, LingPipe, and Gate

http://www.amazon.com/Building-Search-Applications-Lucene-LingPipe/dp/0615204252

I haven't been able to come up with much about GATE either.  Can anyone
explain more about LingPipe and Gate?

Thanks in advance.
