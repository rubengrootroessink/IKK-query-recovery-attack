SUBJECT: Re: Displaying and highlighting results from a Wild Card and Fuzzy search using Lucene in Java
DATE: 19 Jun 2008


Thanks so much for your responses, I have it figured out:

Query parser=new WildcardQuery(new Term("LINES", "the*"));
         parser=parser.rewrite(IndexReader.open(fsDir));

and I was able to get my results highlighted for both WildCard and Fuzzy
searches.

Thanks for the responses.
Sincerely;
Fayyaz
