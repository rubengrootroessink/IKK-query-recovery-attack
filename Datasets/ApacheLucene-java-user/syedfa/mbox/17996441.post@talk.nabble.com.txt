SUBJECT: Improving search performance with the results returned
DATE: 19 Jun 2008


Dear Fellow Java/Lucene developers:

I want to know if there is a way to improve the efficiency of doing a search
using lucene such that when a user does a search, and should there be
hundreds of hits, by paging the results for the user, provide only the best
20 hits first (like google).  If the user then goes to the second page,
Lucene would then conduct a search and return the next best 20 results, and
so on.  Is this possible using Lucene, and if so, how?  

Just wondering.

Thanks to all who respond.
Sincerely;
Fayyaz
