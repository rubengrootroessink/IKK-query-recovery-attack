SUBJECT: Basic question about indexing certain words
DATE: 27 Dec 2009


Dear fellow Java developers:

I have a very basic question about indexing text using Lucene.  I am
indexing a large amount of text, that includes names that contain certain
punctuation (eg. "Jane Doe-Smith", "Sa'eed", etc.)  Will the punctuation
throw off the indexer in any way, such that it breaks up the tokens when
they shouldn't be, or will the indexer simply treat the punctuation inside
the names as any other character, and the presence of the punctuation will
not in any way hinder a user's ability to search for that name?  Are there
any precautions that I should take to avoid any problems?  

I hope this question is clear and makes sense. 

Thanks in advance to all who reply.
