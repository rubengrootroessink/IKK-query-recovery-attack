Hello Andy,

I have actually stepped through the getting started docs on apache (with success!).  I am
fairly new to Java and find it difficult configuring Lucene to securely search my company's
intranet (including .htm, .jsp, .pdf, .doc, ...).  I'm just taking a shot in the dark here
hoping for a magical link that will step me through this process!  I searched the Web high
and low without success.  I did find in the faq's you will need a "parser"  or "extractor"
for each document you want to index.  Is there a source of contributed "parsers" available
on the Web?

Thank you for your time and consideration...
Ryan

If this isn't good enough, please let me know what I can do to make it
better.  Documenting Lucene is something I have an big interest in.
