SUBJECT: Re: Special characters prevent entity being indexed
DATE: 19 Nov 2008


Thanks for the quick answer!

I haven't specified the analyzer so it should be the StandardAnalyzer. I 
forgot to mention that I'm using Lucene via Hibernate seach where I can 
easily define the fields in the hibernate POJO-classes. But as far as I 
know this shouldn't change things that much because I can use the core 
Lucene.

And I've used Luke already and the indexed special characters are 
represented as "&#161;"(¡) and "&#191;" (¿) in the index.

But the analyzer should have nothing to do with the problem currently 
because the problem is that, those entities that start with "¿" don't get 
indexed at all. And some of those starting with "¡" get indexed and some 
don't. Currently 29 entities don't get indexed at all (8900 in total).

I don't need to be able to search those special characters. I just need 
those entities getting indexed. The other information in those entities is 
more important and it's the names (starting with those special characters) 
that seems to make those entities not getting indexed.

Could I fix this using some analyzer during indexing? Actually I tried 
using custom analyzer with "ISOLatin1AccentFilter()" but it didn't change 
anything. In hibernate search the analyzer is spesified in a property file 
or in the POJO-classes but I didn't seem to get it to work. The text went 
to the index exactly the same way (when I see it with Luke) like before 
and the same entities were still missing.

Good solution for me would be that those special character would get 
deleted alltogether from the index so maybe then they wouldn't cause any 
trouble. Like "¡Fantástico!- blaaba" would be perfectly okay looking like 
"Fantastico- blaaba".

Thanks again in advance,
pn
