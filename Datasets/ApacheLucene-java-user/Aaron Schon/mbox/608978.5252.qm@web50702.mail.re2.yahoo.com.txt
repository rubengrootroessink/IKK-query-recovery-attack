SUBJECT: Query about Query.ToString()
DATE: 17 Feb 2010

Hi all, I know that persisting a Lucene query by query ToString() method. Is there any way
of reconstructing the query from the string itself?
The usecase is that I will be storing a library of queries as strings and load the appropriate
query (from the string)Â based on some conditions.

Is this possible? Could you share a code snippet?

p.s. apologies for the double posting (I had asked this on Lucene general and was asked to
ask here instead)
