Hi , if I have a Lucene index (or Solr) that is installed in client premises. how would you
go about securing the index from being queries in unauthorized fashion. For example, from
malicious users or hackers, or for that matter "internal" users trying to reengineer the system
and use it for purposes other than the way licensed.

any suggestions?
