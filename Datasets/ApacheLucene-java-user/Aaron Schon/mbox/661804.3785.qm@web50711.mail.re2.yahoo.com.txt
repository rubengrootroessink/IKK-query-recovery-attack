Thanks to those who responded. I was wondering if taking a bag of words approach might work.
For example chunking the sentences to be analyzed and running a Lucene query against an index
storing sentiment polarity. Has anyone had success with this approach? I do not need a super
accurate system, something that is "reasonably" accurate.

Also, could you suggest good publicly available training datasets? I am aware of the Cornell
Movie Reviews dataset[1]

Thanks
AS

We've been working on Sentiment Analysis. We use GATE and Wordnet for the
lexical / semantic analysis and J Free Charts for the visualization. The
domain is reviews on retail banking and in general our accuracy is around
75% and recall around 25%

We tried out lingpipe as well which also gave good results.
