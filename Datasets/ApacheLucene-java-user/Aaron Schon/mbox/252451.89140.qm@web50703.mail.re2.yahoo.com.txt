SUBJECT: "People you might know" ( a la Facebook) - *slightly offtopic*

Hi all, Apologies if this question is off-topic, but I was wondering if there is a way of
leveraging Lucene (or other mechanism)Â to store the information about connections and recommend
People you might know as done in FB or LI.

The data is as follows:

john_smith@somedomain.com, jane_doe@otherdomain.com


john_smith@somedomain.com, frank_jones@someotherplace.com

and so on...

how would I go about recommending Jane Doe connecting to Frank Jones?. Hope you can help a
newbie by pointing where I should be looking?

Thanks in advance,
AS
