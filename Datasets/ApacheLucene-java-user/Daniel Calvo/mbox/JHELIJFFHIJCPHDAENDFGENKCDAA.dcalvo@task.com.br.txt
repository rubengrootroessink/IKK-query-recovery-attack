Hi,

That's why I've suggested changes in build.xml to look for .ant.properties files (posted in
the developers list) but after reading
acoliver and Erik replies I agreed with them. The best option would be having all properties
defined in build.xml and eliminate
build.properties. Each user would be responsible for the local configuration in a build.properties
file (javacc.home would be
defined there) and a sample build.properties would be provided to help this process.

> /work/lucene-1.2-rc3-src
> $ cat .ant.properties
> javacc.home=/work/javacc2.1/bin/lib
> $ ls  /work/javacc2.1/bin/lib/JavaCC.zip
> /work/javacc2.1/bin/lib/JavaCC.zip
> $ ant
> Buildfile: build.xml
