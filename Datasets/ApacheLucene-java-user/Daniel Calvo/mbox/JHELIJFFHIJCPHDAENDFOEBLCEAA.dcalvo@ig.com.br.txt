DATE: 22 Feb 2002

Hi,

A few days ago some people discussed query semantics in a thread with the subject "Lucene

As I understand, this is not a bug but a feature (someone please correct me if I'm wrong).
I suggest you to take a look at this
thread (in the archives). I think you'll find some answers that

Regards,

--Daniel
