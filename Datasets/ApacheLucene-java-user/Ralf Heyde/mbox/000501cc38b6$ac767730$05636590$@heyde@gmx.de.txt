Hi Dean,

can you describe your problem more in detail? 
Some time ago I used Lucene to Index 50-Millions of medium-sized-text
documents. But I didn't run into a problem having 1000th of open files.
Maybe you can explain, what are you trying to do?

Regards, Ralf

When I do a writer.open(), writer.add(), writer.close(), how many files can
I expect to be opened with Lucene.

I am running indexes on some very big data so we have 160000 writers open
and I hit the limit of 200000 on my machine so I increased it to the max of
1048576 files open, BUT that might not be enough???  I may have to lower my
cache of 160000 to be smaller so curious on how many files open per index.

Thanks,
Dean
