SUBJECT: RemoteSearchable Term Freq
DATE: 4 Nov 2006

I am  trying to figure out a way to get term frequencies from  
RemoteSearchables; My index is partitioned in to 3 sets on remote  
servers, the RemoteSearchable API
has docFreq* methods but no getTermFreq* methods.  So my question is;

1. Is there a class that I am over looking that would provide  me  
with term frequencies from remote indices?

Any alternatives?

Thanks
Amit
