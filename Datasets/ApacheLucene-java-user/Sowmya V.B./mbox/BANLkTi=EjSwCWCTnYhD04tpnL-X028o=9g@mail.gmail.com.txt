SUBJECT: Re: Boosting a document at query time, based on a field value/range
DATE: 15 Jun 2011

Hi

I am not getting the replies to my inbox ...hence the delay in responding.

>>I think you misunderstand Eric's answer, as his suggestion does exactly
what you ask for. Have you tried the "OR **field**:[20 TO 30]^10" method?

Well, my question is partly answered with this clarification. But, I am
still wondering how to do that programmatically.
the (20-30) range is not a fixed range. Its chosen by the user. It can as
well be (12-34) too. I am not able to figure out if there is any function in
the searcher classs, which will enable me give these specifications
...something like... a setboost(), which exists during index time.
