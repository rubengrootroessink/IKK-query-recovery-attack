Hi Xiong,

You're ranking idea sounds interesting ... are you looking into
something akin to the TrafficRank algorithm ? This is moving into the
realm of "Personalized search" or "Personalised search", something I'm
not aware of appearing on the Lucene mailing lists so far, but something
I'm quite interested in exploring.

http://www.earthskater.net/services/marketing/trafficrank-pagerank-webrank.asp

SortComparitorSource returns ScoreDocComparator which utilizes the
method below:

public int compare(ScoreDoc i, ScoreDoc j) {
if (lessthancriteria) return -1;
if (morethancriteria) return 1;
return 0;
}

Section 6.1 of 'Lucene in Action' will help you more here.

>>From ScoreDoc you can access ScoreDoc.doc, lucene document id and
ScoreDoc.score, the lucene score for document.

We regularly open a new IndexReader, and before this reader replaces the
production one, we determine f(D) for all documents so that for the user
there is almost no performance issue,i.e. f(D) is cached. I suspect you
can implement something similar.

Cheers,
Dan
