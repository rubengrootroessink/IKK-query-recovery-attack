Perhaps you can use a filter in the following way.

-Create a filter (via QueryFilter) that would contain all document that
do not have null values for the field
-flip the bits of the filter so that it now contains documents that have
null values for a field
-Use the filter in conjunction with subsequent queries.

This would also help with performance as filters are simply bitsets and
can cheaply be stored, generated once and used often.
