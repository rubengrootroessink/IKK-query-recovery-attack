SUBJECT: Re: How to customize scoring using user feedback?
DATE: 15 Mar 2007

Hi,

This can be achieved by implementing your own implementation of the
SortComparitorSource interface.

Section 6.1 of Lucene in Action will help you here.

We currently use this method to alter the ranking of documents depending
on the age of the document by multiplying the current score by a cached
function f(D) ~ age_of_document_D, so that final score = doc.score*f(D);

Regards,
Dan
