If you read your file as a stream, i.e. line-by-line without buffering it in
RAM, you shall have no problems with performance, as 60k lines is a piece of
cake :).

You can try using LineNumberReader:

Reader lnr = new LineNumberReader( new FileReader( new File(
'/path/to/your/file' ) ) )
String line
while( null != (line = lnr.readLine()) ){
// do stuff with line
}

30 min ago I wrote a script to read a file of 20k lines and sort its' lines
alphabetically, and it took like 1.5 sec.
