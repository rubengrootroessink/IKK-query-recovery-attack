I soved that using a single field in the document.

It's content is based on a simple convention. 
Say I have 2 docs with values BirthsMarriagesDeath_Deaths_Females and 
BirthsMarriagesDeath_Divorces.

Now when I need to get the total count for BirthsMarriagesDeath category, I
run "BirthsMarriagesDeath*" query. If I need look in a sub-category, I use
"BirthsMarriagesDeath_Deaths*"
