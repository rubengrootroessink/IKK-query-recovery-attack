SUBJECT: Lucene for chinese search
DATE: 17 Jun 2007

Hi,

I would like to know whether Standard Analyzer allows searching of chinese
words?

And in order to support chinese searching, is there any encoding needed in
order to develop the application?

I'm currently using Jetty as web server, jsp as application, and search
results will be saved in xml file and display it using xsl. So is there
encoding needed for any of the files (xml, xsl, etc...) as well as during
parsing of query?

thanks alot
