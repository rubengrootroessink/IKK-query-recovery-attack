I'm not clear whether this is a 'yes' or a 'no'. For application reasons I
would like to use a directory structure for indexes that mirrors the
collection structure of the site, so that there is a master index for the
whole site and subindexes in subdirectories for each virtual site (and so on
recursively while I am building subsubindexes for later consolidation).

I can't see any reason why Lucene should adopt a policy of preventing me
from doing this & of forcing me into something more complicated. Especially
when in reality this policy is merely a bug  & very easily fixable.
