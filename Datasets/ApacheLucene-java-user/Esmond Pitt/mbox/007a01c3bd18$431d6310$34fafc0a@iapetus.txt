SUBJECT: FSDIrectory.create doesn't tolerate subdirectories
DATE: 7 Dec 2003

When creating an index, FSDirectory assumes that the directory has no
subdirectories. If a non-empty subdirectory is present, FSDirectory.create
fails to delete it and throws an IOException. As the subdirectory is not a
Lucene index file (although in my case it is a Lucene sub-index), the method
actually has no business attempting to delete it at all. Can this behaviour
please be changed so that it doesn't attempt to delete subdirectories in an
index location at all?

Applies to 1.3RC3.
