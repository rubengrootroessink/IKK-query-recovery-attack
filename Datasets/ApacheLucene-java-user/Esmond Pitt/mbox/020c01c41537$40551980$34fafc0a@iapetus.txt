I have very strong Lucene experience, covering 1.2, 1.3, and the current
1.4-almost-an-RC, having built search engines for several web sites with it.

I'm located in Melbourne & not very able to change that, but if you don't
get other bites maybe we can talk about telecommuting & the occasional day
trip?
