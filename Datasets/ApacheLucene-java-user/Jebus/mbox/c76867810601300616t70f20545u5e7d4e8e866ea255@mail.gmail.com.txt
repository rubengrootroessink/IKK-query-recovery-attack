SUBJECT: searching specific documents
DATE: 30 Jan 2006

How do you search only certain documents. In the app I am writing
before I start searching with Lucene I know all the documents that I
want to search. For example I have documents A,B,C,X,Y,Z so before I
start the search I know that I only want to search docs C,X,Y due to
other non lucene criteria.
