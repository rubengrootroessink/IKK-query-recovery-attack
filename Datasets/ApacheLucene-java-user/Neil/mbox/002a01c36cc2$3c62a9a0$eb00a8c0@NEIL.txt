SUBJECT: doc number as integer
DATE: 27 Aug 2003

It seems that since the index document number value is a positive int, this
restricts the number of documents in an index to ( 2^31 - 1 ) =
2,147,483,647.

Do I misunderstand?

I mean, that's enough for me, but it seems a kind of surprising restriction,
considering long could be used instead for unimaginably large numbers of
documents.  Well, I grant I probably can't imagine 2 billion documents
either, but google can.

Just curious, sorry to bother anyone.
