Hello Lucene Users

i need a document term matrix to initialize a neural network, that i 
want to use to integrate user feedback in the retrieval process.

until now, i am using a slightly modified class of the IndexHTML example.

how can i create an index of all the terms in a collection without 
"term" and "Term" being indexed twice?

in the example, a standard analyzer is used, and in the documentation it 
sais :


Filters StandardTokenizer with StandardFilter, LowerCaseFilter and 
StopFilter.

So, why do i get double entries for terms in upper- and lower case writing?


Regards.

Thomas
