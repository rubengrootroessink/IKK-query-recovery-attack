SUBJECT: export term-dokument-matrix
DATE: 2 Dec 2003

Hello,


i am currently working on my thesis in information processing in the 
humanities.

i am developping an extension for lucene, that integrates the user´s 
query history into the retrieval process.

i want to implement a neural network, that adapts to the users 
information need.
first, the application performs a full-text search on a metadata corpus.

q1: how can i modify the format of lucenes output, for example, adding 
the ranking value.

the user then selects the apparently most interesting documents (by it 
dc metadata). this second user-input should be used to adapt the neural 
network weights.

q2: is it possible to
	a:  reuse / generate a lucene term-document-matrix and
	b:  initialize the synapses of a nn with that matrix
	c:  does lucene provide any interface at that level of the 			 
information extraction process



until now, i am not entirely decided which neural network api i should 
use. joone, at a first glance, seems to be quite user friendly but 
integrate it into one´s own applications doesn´t, so that a more 
"customizeable" solution is needed.


thank you for any hint!
