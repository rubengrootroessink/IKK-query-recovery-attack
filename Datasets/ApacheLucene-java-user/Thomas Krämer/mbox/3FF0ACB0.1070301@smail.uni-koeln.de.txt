SUBJECT: Search all instead of specified/default field
DATE: 29 Dec 2003

Hello all,

i am using lucene to index simple metadata records, that consist of fields such as creator,

description, identifier etc.

with the apache commons digester i can read each record into a lucene document and push each
tag as 
key-value pair, where the tag name (eg. creator) is the lucene field name and the text enclosed
by 
it the corresponding string value.

for a lot of purposes it is much more comfortable to have the possibility to search over all
fields.

does an alternative exist to performing as many queries as there are fields in the index
(all the same term but different fields)?

Regards

Thomas
