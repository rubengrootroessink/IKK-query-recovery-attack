Hello ,

now that the topic is clustering methods: has there been any effort in 
implementing Latent semantic indexing in Lucene? Google only indicates 
someone else asking this in february.
Is there an overview of the structure of the index of lucene despite of 
the javadoc or any other fast access to understanding what happens 
inside lucene?

regards

thomas
