Hi Bruce,

i am not familiar with intelectual property law, but it sounds somewhat 
strange to me, that it is possible to patent an abstract idea of hom 
extracting information from data.

i can understand, that it is forbidden to reuse/modify sourcecode of a 
given implementation of lsi, but why shouldn´t i build my own indexer, 
if able to do so?

btw, do you know the owner of the patent?


thanks a lot


thomas
