SUBJECT: Javadocs for lucene-1.9-rc1-dev
DATE: 17 May 2005

Seems like a simple question, but I could not find it in recent archives.

Are the javadocs for 1.9 available on-line anywhere?

Or, if not, where can I get the source of 1.9 in a single tarball so I can generate the javadocs
locally?

I got the lucene-1.9-rc1-dev.jar off the page for Luke, but it seems like this should rather
be made available on the lucene page.

Thanks!
