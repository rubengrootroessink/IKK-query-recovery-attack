SUBJECT: memory consumption on large indices
DATE: 14 Mar 2007

Do I have to keep something in mind to do searching on large indices?
I actually have an index with a size of 1.8gb. I have indexed 1.5 
million items from Amazon.
How much memory do I have to give to the jvm?
As a sidenote I have to tell you that I optimized the index so it's one 
segment file.
Do I need to have 1.8gb memory available for the jvm?

regards,
-Dennis
