SUBJECT: fastest way to gather simple terms that match documents?
DATE: 31 Mar 2010

Hi all,
    After I've run a query I need to know which terms matched each
result document (ie doc termfrequency>0).
the only way I know to do this is by calling explain on each document,
which the documentation claims to be
almost the equivalent of a new query for each call so I'm keen to
avoid that option if possible.
Is there a quick way to discover this information? All I need is a
list of terms (as simple strings would be fine),
I don't care how many were found or what position or anything else.
just which ones matched.

thoughts?

Thanks
Jason.
