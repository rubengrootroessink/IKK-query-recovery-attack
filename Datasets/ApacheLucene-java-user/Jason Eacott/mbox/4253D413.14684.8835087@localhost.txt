SUBJECT: lucene 1.4 + needs spaces problem
DATE: 6 Apr 2005

Hi,
	 I recently upgraded from lucene 1.3 final to 1.4 and discovered some things 
which no longer seem to work right.

I am using 
Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser( "terms", analyzer); 
parser.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND); 
query = parser.parse(TextParameters);

I then proceed to flesh out the query with a bunch of BooleanQuery's

all this works great with the older lucene but I get lots of error s in the trace because
I am 
also using the compoundindex (need to on a windoze box to prevent too many file handles 
issues)

anyway - 
if I run a query something like
properties@conf:false+properties@year:"2004"+properties@month:"February"+properties
@committee:"Council" 

it no longer works unless I ensure there are spaces around each +

eg this works

properties@conf:false + properties@year:"2004" + properties@month:"February" + 
properties@committee:"Council" 

can anyone tell me if this has been fixed somewhere or whether this was by design? (I 
cannot imagine that it is)

I know I have and set by default but this should still work I think.

thanks in Advance

Jason.
