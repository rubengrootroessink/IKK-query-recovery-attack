SUBJECT: Re: is it possible to make lucene searches match based on per doc field:termcount?
DATE: 6 Nov 2009

looks like it, thanks!
but if I index multiple copies of the same value, ie: myfield:a,a,b
and search with myfield:(a or b)
or perhaps myfield:(a or a or b)

will I be able to tell the difference? is this apparently duplicate data 
kept as part of the query? (I'd like to be able to do this too)

Cheers
Jason.
