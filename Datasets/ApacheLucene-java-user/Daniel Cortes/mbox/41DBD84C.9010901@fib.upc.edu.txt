SUBJECT: PDFBox deprecated methods
DATE: 5 Jan 2005

I've been use PDFBox in my indexation of a directory . I've download  
the last version of  PDFBox (0.6.7.a) and I've seen that the method that 
I use to extract
was a deprecated method. PDFTextStripper.getText().
stripper.getText(new PDDocument(cosDoc));
I know a lot of person use same me this method. What  are alternative 
options ?
