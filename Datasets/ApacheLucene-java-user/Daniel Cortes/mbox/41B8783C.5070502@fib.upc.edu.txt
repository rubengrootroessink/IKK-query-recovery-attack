DATE: 9 Dec 2004

I've the last version of LIMO.
It is running in a Tomcat and I can't add any Index and don't load the 
index that I create the index before from console (java 
org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles ...)
This is the reasson that I demand the structure of limo.properties 
because this file don't exist and this maner I can force to load the 
localitation of de Index File.
Thanks for your time.

Another question:
I think to do a multi search web of my personal site.
what do you think about I use PDFLibrary and textmining for search in 
files not plain text.

PD: true  true, my english it's so bad
