SUBJECT: types of formats who support Lucene?
DATE: 2 Dec 2004

Hi I''m newer in this mail list and what you can see my English is very 
terrible.
I 'm having a study to select the best technology  for a motor serching 
of an application web with a ratio of 1000 users/day.
I  read a little bit of Lucene what I don't know what file types support 
the search.
If you can reply my or say me a page that tells this I regret you.
Thanks of a "novatillo"
