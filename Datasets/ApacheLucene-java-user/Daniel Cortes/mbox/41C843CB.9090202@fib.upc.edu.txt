SUBJECT: Lucene working with a DB
DATE: 21 Dec 2004

I read a lot of messages that Lucene can index a DB because it use that 
INPUTSTREAM "type"
I don't understand how to do this. For example if I've a forum with 
Mysql  and a lot of files on my web, for every search I've to select the 
index that I want use in my search, true? But I don't know how to do 
that Lucene writes an index about the information of the DB of forum 
(for example  MySQL)
