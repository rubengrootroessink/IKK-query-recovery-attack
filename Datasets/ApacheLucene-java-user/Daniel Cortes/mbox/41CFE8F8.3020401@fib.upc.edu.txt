I want to know In the case that you use Lucene for index files how a 
general searcher, what fields (or keys) do you use to index.
For example, in my case are html,pdf,doc,ppt and txt and I'm thinked to 
use Field Autor, Field title, field url, field content, field 
modification date.
Something more? some recommendation?
thks
and Merry Xmas for all.
