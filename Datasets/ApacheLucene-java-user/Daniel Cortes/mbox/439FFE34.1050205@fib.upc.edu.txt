I have a simple question  I'm sure that have a simple response, but now 
I don't have any idea.

If I have something indexed and stored in the field TITLE ("Hello") and 
I search with Standard analyzer (Hello or hello or h*) in this field. 
Why don't obtain any hit?

PD: Excuseme if it's so obvious what now i'm don't have the solution. thks.
