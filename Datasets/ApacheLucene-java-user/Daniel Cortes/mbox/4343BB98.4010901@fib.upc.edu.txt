Hi, I want to know about your experience about indexs used by others 
machines.

I have a multiple index in a Machine, and I search in these indexes with 
a Multisearcher. Now I new to add another computer to the platform and I 
don't know well how can I do to have this multiple index accessible for 
the second computer. These indexes would can be writed by all the computers.

Excuse for my bad english. thks for any advice.
