SUBJECT: Number of documents
DATE: 20 Dec 2004

I've to show to my boss if Lucene is the best option for create a search 
engine of a new portal.
I want to now how many documents do you have in your index?
And how many bigger is your DB?
the types of formats who has to support the portal are html jsp txt doc 
pdf ppt

another question that I have is:
I'm playing with the files of the book Lucene in Action and I try to use 
the example of handling types.The folder data contains 5 files, and 
created index contain five
documents what the only one that contains any word in the index is the 
.html file
Everybody have the same result?
