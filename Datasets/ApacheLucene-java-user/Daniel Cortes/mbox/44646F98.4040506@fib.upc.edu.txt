Hi luceners, I want to know how many file descriptors you can have.
My lucene version is 1.4.3.
Now I have obtained a lot of Too many open files, I think that the 
problem is produced by another thing because I work only with to indexs 
and now it isn't big (10 MB).
For this reason I want to ask you how large is your index and  open file 
descriptors you have, and how many memory you are using.

We can be some stadistics about lucene users :D

Thks for any replies.
