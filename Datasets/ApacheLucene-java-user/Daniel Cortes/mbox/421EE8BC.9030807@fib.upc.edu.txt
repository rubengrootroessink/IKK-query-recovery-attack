Hi everybody,
I need to found some documentation about the algorithms that lucene use 
internally in the indexation and how it works with weights and 
frequencies of the terms.This information will be used to know tastes of 
my users and to relate users with the same interest and restlessness.:D
I read something about .frq files but I don't have any frq life in my index.
Thks.
