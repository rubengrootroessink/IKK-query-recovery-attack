DATE: 9 Jun 2005

I have 2 stop words list  (the platform works with two language at same 
time, and it's very normal that the people use in the search)and I've to 
create a new class that extends Analyzer true? I'm basing on Gerhard 
Schwarz's work for GermanAnalyzer.
How have I  to compile all the trunk/contrib/analysis  code in SVN if I 
want have a new lucene jar with all?
thks for all, and exucse for my silly questions  :D
