thks nader
I need a general search of documents, it's for this that I ask yours 
recomendations, because fields are only for info in the search. 
Tipically search on Google for example

search:casa

La casa roja
..había una vez una casa roja que tenia ....
htttp:\\go.to\casa    Modification date:25-12-04

for do this  what fields and options (keybord,text,unindex,unstored) do 
you should use?

thks
