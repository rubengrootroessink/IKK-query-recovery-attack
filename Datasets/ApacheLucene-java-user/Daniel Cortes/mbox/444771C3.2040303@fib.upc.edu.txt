Hi everybody,
I have a simple question for you. How do you do to obtain the most used 
words of  and Index?
In my case I want to obtain the 10 most used words in a group. I thinked 
in use a TreeSet with all words and their frequencies of hits (whit the 
restriction of GROUPID).
Someone have any idea? Thks for any reply.
