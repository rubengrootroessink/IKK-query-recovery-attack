SUBJECT: MySql and Lucene
DATE: 13 Jan 2005

I what to know your opinion about this:

I've a new portal, and Lucene is the serach engine. This portal is an 
integration of a lot of opensource software.
phpBB(MySql) is our election for the forum, and I have to do that 
searches with the search engine include search in the forum.
I think that I have 2 options:
-Every new post in the forum, it was been  indexed in the Mysql and 
Lucene Index ( storing fields that I want to show in the results for 
exemaple author, title date,...)
It means that I've almost a total copy of the MySQL in my Lucene Index.
- Or  Do the search with lucene and after do a SQL query in the 
servlett, but how I show the results.I can't show first the Lucene's 
results and after the phorum's results.
Any Idea?
thks
