I've return with my questions :)
I''ve indexed a lot of documents (.txt, .doc, .pdf , .java , .html , 
.htm ) and I use with modifications of examples at Lucene in action :D.
The schema of documents is:

path/name_document     Field.Keyword     (not toke,    stored,        
indexed)
title                                 Field.Text            (token,     
  stored,         indexed)
author                            Field.Keyword     (not token, 
stored,         indexed)
summary                        Field.Text             (token,      
stored,          indexed)
keys                               Field.Unstored     (token,      not 
stored,    indexed)
date                                Field.UnIndexed  (not 
token,stored,          not indexed)
body                              Field.Text             (token,      
 not stored,   indexed)

I want to show the results like this :

title or name file            Author
Sumary
path            date

what do you think about this?

My question are what I do when I show results if documents haven't a 
summary? I show the first lines of documents? Perhaps it is a silly 
question but until now I haven't a solution.

PD: About the past thread of "Lucene In action" book I've bought Lucene 
In Action by Amazon and total prize for me was 26.37$.
PD2: When my book arrive I let you rest of  my questions.
Thanks for all
