SUBJECT: when close searcher
DATE: 4 Aug 2005

I have a Multisearcher, when I have to close multisearcher 
(multisearcher.close()) and if I do this I have to close every 
IndexSearcher?
In what order I have to do this things?
My problem are because, I modify one index (my multisearcher are 
composed by 6 Index) I don't know if my process to "refresh" my 
multisearcher is appropriate.

Any advice using multisearcher was welcome.

If this is a silly question excuseme but I don't understand when I 've 
to close it.
thks for all.
