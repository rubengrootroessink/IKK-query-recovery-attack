SUBJECT: Re: Most used words
DATE: 21 Apr 2006

Thks for the reply, perhaps to use something like in Luke is the best 
option.
My idea to do is a TAGcloud (see the example in this page) for every 
group(field group with the id) and every portal (with the id).
The problem is that I think do reader.terms() is not the best option in 
my case, because I have a lot of groups and I want the tagcloud of an 
specific group (for example "luceners")
I thinked in do a search WHERE field GROUP is "luceners" and order my 
hits in ordered by Date. For this reason i can obtain something like 
"Racently we talk about .." and show words used in the last days in this 
groups.
What do you think?
