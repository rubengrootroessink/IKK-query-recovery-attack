SUBJECT: Deletion of words in articles of Wikipedia
DATE: 2 Sep 2009


Hi,

I'm new to this site. My question is:

Articles in wikipedia can be edited by everyone and may or may not be
accurate. If any contributor writes an article and then another contributor
deletes certain content in that article would indicate that the article is
controversial. 
I need to start off with this project where we can find the ranking of
controversial articles. Could anyone kindly help me how to start?

Thanks
