SUBJECT: Getting Start to LUCENE 2.2.0 - How to Indexing a Directory of Your WebSite.
DATE: 2 Jan 2008

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to use the Lucene 2.2.0 in my webpage, I would like to create a
simple websearch field/function in my site.

I'm intalled the example of Lucene, but, there is only a Search funcional
implemented as example, not the indexing files.

I would like to know how I can create a filter to create the lucene index
files

I need to indexing, for example, a directory of my website

I created a example to try to Index a directory wirh a simple TXT file
insite it :

...
       String indexDir =
"c:\\eclipse\\workspace\\JavaSource\\br\\com\\testeLucene"    (* there is a
test.txt file with some words insite it )*

       String dataDir =
"c:\\eclipse\\workspace\\JavaSource\\br\\com\\lucene\\indexedFiles"
...

    public static int index(File indexDir, File dataDir) throws IOException
{

        if (!dataDir.exists() || !dataDir.isDirectory()) {
            throw new IOException(dataDir + "It is NOT a Directory");
        }

        IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(indexDir, new
StandardAnalyzer(), true);
        writer.setUseCompoundFile(false);

        indexDirectory(writer, dataDir);

        int numIndexed = writer.docCount();
        writer.optimize();
        writer.close();

        return numIndexed;
    }

All right, the Lunece indexs files were created, but, following the Lucene
Search example, I could find the words that were inside the test.txt file

Is it work ? is it right ?

If someone can help me to starting the Lucene 2.2.0 I will really appreciate
it.

Tks so much.
