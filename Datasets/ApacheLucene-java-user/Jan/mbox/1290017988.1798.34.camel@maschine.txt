thats what i figured...i can't find out what i'm doing wrong though ;)

so the query is "experiment" (i know not really a phrase...but the
assignment requested precisely so). The program constructs the following
query

+(AbstractText:"experiment" ArticleTitle:"experiment")

which looks good to me. the results look like this:

Found 95 hits.
1. 19810 phrase occurs 3 times 
2. 587340 phrase occurs once 
...
80. 896889 phrase occurs 0 times 
...
95. 900325 phrase occurs once

so here is the document 896889
PMID
	896889
ArticleTitle
	Estrogen-induced sexual receptivity and localization of 3H-estradiol in
brains of female mice: effects of 5 alpha-reduced androgens, progestins
and cyproterone acetate.
AbstractText
	Sexual receptivity induced in ovariectomized CD-1 mice with chronic
daily administration of estradiol benzoate (E2 B) was blocked by
concurrent administration of the 5 alpha-reduced androgen,
dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Receptivity was restored in these females
with progesterone-, but not with dihydroprogesterone-priming 6 hr prior
to testing. Delaying the DHT injections until 12 hr after the E2 B
injections greatly reduced its inhibitory properties. Receptivity in E2
B-primed females was also blocked by concurrent treatment with
cyproterone acetate and 3 alpha-, but not 3 beta-adrostanediol.
Pretreatment with DHT, or 3 alpha- or 3 beta-androstanediol failed to
consistently affects 3H-estradiol accumulation in crude nuclear and
supernatant fractions from brain and pituitary

so apart from doing something wrong while indexing/analyzing (the text
above is from the xml, but i double checked...it is put in teh index
with these textfragments) or so, the token "experiment" does not even
occur. thats what baffles me.

thanks for the very quick reaction
