SUBJECT: Index Optimization Issue
DATE: 12 Mar 2008


I managed to optimize my index successfully. The problem that I'm having now
is when I check the index using Lucene Index Toolbox there are a few files
in the index itself is deletable. I understand that optimize method will
merge the index files but How come there is still deletable index files in
it? What I do now is delete it manually. Is there by any chance that I can
delete it automatically? Any code that I can refer to?
