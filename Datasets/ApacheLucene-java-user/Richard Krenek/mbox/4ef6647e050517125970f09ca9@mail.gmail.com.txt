I was wondering about Lucene and NFS. The issue is with locking
correct? In Lucene in Action it mentions.
... issues with lock files and NFS, choose a directory that doesn't
reside on an NFS volume. If you have the book, flip to page 62. Does
it mean, don't use NFS or just ensure you point your lock file
directory to a common non-NFS directory? I'd really like to use an NFS
filesystem since this is the only place I have space. Will I only have
issues when updating an index etc..

Thanks for any pointers.
