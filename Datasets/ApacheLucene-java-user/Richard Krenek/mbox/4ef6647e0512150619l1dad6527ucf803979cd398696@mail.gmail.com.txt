SUBJECT: How does Lucene compare to Dieselpoint?
DATE: 15 Dec 2005

Hello All,
   We've been using Lucene here and like it, but we've been asked to look
into another engine also (Dieselpoint). Has anyone used both Dieselpoint and
Lucene. Any comments. We have a lot of documents (50 million+) each document
contains many small fields (maybe 100s). Important features we care about
are refinements and faceted navigation. Any comments would be great.

Thanks
