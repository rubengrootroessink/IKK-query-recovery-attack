SUBJECT: Interaction of Tokenattributes and Tokenizer
DATE: 14 Aug 2010

Hi,

Can anyone explain to me how exactly the Tokenizers and tokenattributes
interact with each other?
Or perhaps point me to a link which has a the interaction/sequence diagram
for the same?

I want to extend the Token class to allow use of some more types of Token
Attributes.

Thanks
