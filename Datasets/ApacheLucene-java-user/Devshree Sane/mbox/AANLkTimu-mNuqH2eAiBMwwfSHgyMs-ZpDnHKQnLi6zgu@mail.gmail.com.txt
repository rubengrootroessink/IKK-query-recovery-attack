SUBJECT: Using FastVectorHighlighter for snippets
DATE: 21 Sep 2010

I am using the FastVectorHighlighter for retrieving snippets from the index.


I am a bit confused about the parameters that are passed to the
FastVectorHighlighter.getBestFragments() method. One parameter is a document
id and another is the maximum number of fragments. Does it mean that only
the maximum number of fragments will be retrieved from document with given
id (even if there are more fragments in the same document)?

Is there a way to get the maximum number of fragments over the whole
index(and not just 1 document)?
