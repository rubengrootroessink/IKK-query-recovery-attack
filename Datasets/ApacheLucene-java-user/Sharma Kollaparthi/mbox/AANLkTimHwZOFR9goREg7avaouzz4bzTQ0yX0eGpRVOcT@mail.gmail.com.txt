SUBJECT: Lucene , hits per document
DATE: 21 Jan 2011

Hi ,

       I have started to use Lucene for searching in HTML files. Is it
possible to get Hits per document, when we search for phrases like "Hello
World" and wild card searches like "te?t"?

 I managed to return the number of hits per document if there is only one
term using termfrequency vector.


Thanks,
Sharma
