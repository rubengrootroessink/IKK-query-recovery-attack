I have used the in-memory array approach and it  worked well.  I was able to
return sorted result sets of over a million records in 500 milli-seconds.

The one down side to this is that keeping the arrays in memory really
limits your ability to add content because the new content needs to make
it into the arrays.  This is not an impossible task but could be tricky.
