Great,

Thanks for the quick response, I am very interested in hearing
how lucene handles itself in the 15-20 million doc range.

I will be doing some testing this week with lucene and will report my
findings as
well.  I am also testing FAST and AltaVista and I will post some
comparison details.  I would be very happy to find that we did not need to
buy a commercial engine because Lucene could do the job.

Joel
