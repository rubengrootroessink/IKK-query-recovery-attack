SUBJECT: Options for sorting on an integer or date
DATE: 1 May 2002

At my company we trying to decide on a new search engine.
I am very impressed with what I see with Lucene and am thinking very
seriously
of not going with AltaVista, FAST etc...

One of things that is very important to us is sorting by an integer or by a
date, which Lucene currently cannot do.

So I am thinking about some options I might have here.  I would welcome
comments
from the lucene developers on the options below:

1)  We could wait for the sorting to be added to Lucene.  Is there an idea
of when this will be added?

2)  Have my company commission a project from the Lucene team to add this
functionality
soon.  Does the Lucene team do commissioned work?

3)  Add the sorting code with guidance from the Lucene team and from a
search engine expert
that works with our company.

4) Re-sort the results in the application that is using Lucene.  This is the
least attractive because our result-sets can be very
large and I think we will have performance problems.

Thanks,

Joel
