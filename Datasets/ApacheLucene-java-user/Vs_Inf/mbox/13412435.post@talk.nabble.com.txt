SUBJECT: Using not operator in query
DATE: 25 Oct 2007


Hi,
 We have a requirement to allow users of our search application to use "NOT"
operator on a single term.
For example, if the user enters "not customer", they are expecting the
search to return everything that is not "customer".

How can i achive this given Lucene limitation on NOT operator which
according to Lucene documentation:
 
The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example, the
following search will return no results:
NOT "jakarta apache"

Is there a work-around for this requirement?

Thanks for your help.
-Vasu
