SUBJECT: Oracle Text 10g... or NOT
DATE: 17 Oct 2006

Hi -

I'm currently looking into adding full text search capabilities to our
site.  While some threads in this list had the same basic question (RDBMS
full-text versus lucene), their configurations and conderns were different.
Here's my configuration

* RDBMS is Enteprise Oracle 10g
* RAC-enabled RDMBS
* Dual fiber chanel RAID-5 configuration
* 2-node cluster
* 8GB RAM/per node
* Dual 3.6GHz Intel CPU/per node
* 99% of the content to be indexed is stored in our RDBMS
* Largest table size today 3 Billion (with a B) records
* Average table size 3 Million records

The question is, then, should I use Oracle 10g's full text capabilities or
lucene?

Since we have the oracle enteprise license, cost is not an issue (oracle
text comes with it).    I was able to create a demo using lucene in less
than 1/2 day, and we're looking towards creating the same demo using oracle
10g's full text search capabilities

Some ppl in this list migrated from RDBMS to lucene because of:
* speed - lucene is faster
* RDBMS server off load (someone reported they offloaded 70% of db server
work)
* cost (they didn't have the enteprise oracle license)
* index size - lucene indexes are smaller
* while some people had question with interMedia, I didn't find much
information with the newer Oracle 10g's full text search capabilties

Any thoughts?  Thanks in advance.
