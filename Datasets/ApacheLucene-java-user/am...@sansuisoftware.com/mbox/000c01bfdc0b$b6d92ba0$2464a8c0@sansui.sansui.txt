SUBJECT: Deleting document from index
DATE: 22 Jun 2000

Hi,

I had searched the archive of this list for getting more info on "How to delete a document
from the lucene index".
But most of the postings talk about IndexReader.delete(docNum). When we tried to delete a
single document entry from the index , what we found is : the whole index got deleted. 

1) Can anyone help us on how we can handle this ?
2) When the search results will reflect that, the particular document which I had deleted
,is not there ?
Do I need to "optimize" the index for this ?
3) After adding few more documents to an existing index, what effect will it have on search
, if I don't optimize
the index immediately ? Will these new documents will be searchable before optimization ?

TIA & Regards,
-Amit
