Because I'm embedding the index inside another file...
So that file is self-contained, containing both the payload (which might
not be text) and the index...

But I figured out how to do it already... I just made RAMDirectory and
RAMFile Serializable and create my own build of lucene...

Could you be more specific about what you want that Lucene does not 
already provide?

FSDirectory is essentially a serialized RAMDirectory.  What do you 
mean by "unpack the file"?  There is nothing special needed to move 
an index from one machine to another, simply copy the entire 
directory and use your searching code to refer to its location.
