SUBJECT: merging indices
DATE: 16 Sep 2003

Hello - 

I have created 27 separate indices that hold a total of 15.8 million XML
documents.  My question is, would I be better served to have one large index
or multiple indices as I have?  Also does anyone have any sample code of how
I merge these indices?  I have seen the addIndexes(Directory[]) method and
am not quite sure how to implement it.

thanks, 
Tom
