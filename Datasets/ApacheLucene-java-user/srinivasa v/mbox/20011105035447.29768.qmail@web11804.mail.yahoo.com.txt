hi all,

When we search for perticular word(s) using the Query, we will get number of Hits. 

That is number of docs matching the given words.

But How to get the Frequency of a Perticular Word in each Docs individually ?

Say word "lucene" occurs 10 times in Doc1.

Please answer ASAP........

with regards

Srini
