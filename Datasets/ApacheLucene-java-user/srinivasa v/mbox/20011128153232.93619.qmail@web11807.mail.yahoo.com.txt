SUBJECT: Order of Package Compilation
DATE: 28 Nov 2001


Hi all,

I got the lucene source files, When I started to compile all
packages again in some order, it is giving some error saying 
some classnot found....the order in which I compiled is given below.

com\lucene\store\*.java
com\lucene\util\*.java
com\lucene\document\*.java
com\lucene\analysis\standard\*.java
com\lucene\analysis\*.java
com\lucene\index\*.java
com\lucene\search\*.java
com\lucene\queryParser\*.java

I hope the order may be wrong, if yes in what order i have to compile ?
Plese help me.

Thanks in Advance
Srini
