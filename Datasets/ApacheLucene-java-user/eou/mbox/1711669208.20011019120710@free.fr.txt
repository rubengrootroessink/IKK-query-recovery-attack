Hello

if you wanna indexing digit and letter mixed words just change LowerCaseTokinzer.java in com/lucene/analysis/
line 62:
      if (Character.isLetter(c)) { 
=>   if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(c)) { 
then the digit and letter mixed words, like "U2", "fifa98" will tokened and indexed as one
word.
I think it should be default for there too much words in the world now: like "fifa98", telphone
number etc.
