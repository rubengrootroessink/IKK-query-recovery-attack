Does anyone have any experience with examining Explanation objects in
a custom request handler?

I started this project using Solr on top of Lucene because I wanted
the flexibility it provided. The ability to have dynamic field names
so the user could configure what fields they wanted to index and how
they wanted them to be indexed (using field type configurations good
for titles or for person names or for years, etc.).

What I quickly found I could do without though was the HTTP overhead.
I implemented the EmbeddedSolr class found on the Solr wiki that let
me interact with the Solr engine directly. This is important since I'm
doing thousands of queries in a batch.

I need to find out about this custom request handler thing. If anyone
has any example code, it would be greatly appreciated.
