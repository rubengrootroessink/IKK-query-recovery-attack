SUBJECT: Is it possible to use a custom similarity class to cause extra terms in a field to lower score?
DATE: 17 May 2007

If I have two items in an index:
Terminator 2
Terminator 2: Judgment Day

And I score them against the query +title:(Terminator 2)
they come up with the same score (which makes sense, it just isn't
quite what I want)

Would there be some method or combination of methods in Similarity
that I could easily override to allow me to penalize the second item
because it had "unused terms"?
