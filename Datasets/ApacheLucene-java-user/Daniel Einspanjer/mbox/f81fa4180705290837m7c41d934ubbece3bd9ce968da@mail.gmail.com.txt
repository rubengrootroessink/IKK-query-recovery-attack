SUBJECT: Is it possible to do near terms without using phrase slop in query parser syntax?
DATE: 29 May 2007

I've got a field that is indexing people names.  The field is
multivalued and I'm using Solr with a positionIncrementGap of 100.

I've found that trying to specify a near query using something like:
actor_name_mv:"Foster, Jody"~2
matches "Foster, Jody" with a tf score of 1, but it matches "Jody
Foster" with a tf score of .577  The phraseFreq in the first case is 1
and the phraseFreq in the second is 1/3.

For this particular case, I would like the scores for these two cases
to be the same. Is that possible?
