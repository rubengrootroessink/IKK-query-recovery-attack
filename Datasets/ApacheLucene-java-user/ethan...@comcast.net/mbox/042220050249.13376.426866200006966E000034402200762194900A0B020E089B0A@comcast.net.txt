Thanks Pierrick.

Are you say that I should construct Token in analyzer like
new Token ("chem_H2O", 100, 103, "chem");

note that chem_ is added prefix to H2O, and 100 to 103 is length of H2O rather than chem_H2O?

I also have some further problem and not sure if can be solved by this approch.

I want to index H2O in a compound, say H2O-CH2. say I want a query to find out H2O in a compound.
How can I do that?

Thanks,
Ethan
