DATE: 16 Apr 2005

Hi, 

I am working on a program to index/search chemical element/compound. Say I write an analyzer
to filter out chemical terms, such as H2O. I noticed that I can specify a tocken's type. Can
I construct a token as 
new Token ("H2", start, end, "chem");

My questions is
How do I search all the tokens with "chem" type token, such as H2O, O2, etc? Any sample like
this? 

If this approach doesn't work, what's the best approach?

Thanks,
Ethan
