Hi,

I was looking through archive for the best practice of Lucene indexer
configuration deployed in the [WebSphere 5.1 on AIX ] cluster  and found
some good posts in March 2005 thread which left me looking for more info

The index:
a) file size is not expected to exceed 2GB so loading it into memory
[say web-aplication scope] using RAMDirectory is definitely feasible
b) add/update request expected every 2 sec at peak hour
C) the indexer is a multi threaded process currently deployed as a
WebSphere custom service, exposed as MBean, on single WAS 5.1 server

I'd like to know: 

1. What is the best approach for cluster deployment for the scenario
described above?

2. Did somebody use dynamic data replication feature of WAS 5.1 cluster
to cache in-memory index? If so how replicator was made aware of
application - scoped data and how  often in-memory index was
synchronised with secondary storage (NAS / NFS / database) 

Any thoughts will be appreciated

Jake
