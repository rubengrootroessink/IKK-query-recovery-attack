SUBJECT: bad link in mailing list archive?

When I load

http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=2648

there are three replies listed at the bottom of the page, one by Otis 
Gospodnetic. The subject of his reply is "Concurency in Lucene".

When I click on Otis' reply, my browser loads a post with a different 
subject; "Problems compiling the java source codes of lucene search engine".

Just a heads up -- seems like something funky's going on :)

cheers,
Gerret
