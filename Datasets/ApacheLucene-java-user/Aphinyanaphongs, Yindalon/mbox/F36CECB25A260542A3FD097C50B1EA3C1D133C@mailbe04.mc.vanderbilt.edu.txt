Thanks for the quick response.  I don't necessarily need to calculated the similarity score.
It was my understanding that the inverted index had a list of all the hits for each term so
technically, no document returned from the inverted index should have a score of 0.  Thus,
if I have some numerical field to sort by, the inverted index itself handles returning the
documents with the term.
 
Would you know in what java class the call is made to Similarity and where that code may be
commented out, or would it be preferable to write my own similarity sub-class instead?
 
Thanks,
Yin

Yes, Similarity is still computed.  It has to be in order to determine
if the documents considered are a hit or not.  Scores of 0 are not a
hit.

You certainly could simplify the Similarity computations though, by
creating your own implementation and returning 1 from all the methods.
