Erik!
Thanks for the response.  I'll take a look and see to customizing a solution.

It's certainly true that the inverted index has a list of all documents
that contain each term.  However the word "hit" is by definition a
document with score > 0 given a query, not just a term.  Queries can be
quite sophisticated.  For example, I was very easily able to create an
XOR query by using a custom similarity.

Similarity use is spread out in several places.  Get a good IDE(A!) and
surf the code and you'll easily be able to see where methods of
Similarity are being used.
