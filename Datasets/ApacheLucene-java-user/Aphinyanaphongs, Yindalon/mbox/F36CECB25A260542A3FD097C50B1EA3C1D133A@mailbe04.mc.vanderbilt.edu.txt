SUBJECT: Are similarity scores computed when using sort?
DATE: 27 Nov 2004

I have an search application that is very performance conscious.  I've looked through the IndexSearcher
code, and haven't been able to clarify whether a similarity score is calculated if the results
are sorted by some numerical field value? Basically, it would be preferable to not incur the
computational cost of generating a similarity score if it is never used.

Thanks
