Thanks Ketin for your input. There is already build in HTML strip reader i.e. HTMLStripReader
in solr, which I am currently using to strip all HTML tags before creating index. This also
solved my earlier problem related to highlighter , which was highlighting HTML tags e.g. I
was searching for "net" and result was something http://sdjkkjsd.net and it got converted
to http://sjhdnjkshn.<b>net</b> by highlighter.

I suggest you take a look at the code of any of them, 
StandardAnalyzer for instance.
