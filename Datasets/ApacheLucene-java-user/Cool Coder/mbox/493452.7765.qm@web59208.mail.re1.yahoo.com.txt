SUBJECT: Re: How to delete old index
DATE: 26 Nov 2007

I tried with your suggestion but still it did not delete old index files. Anyway I closed reader
before closing writer and reopened reader after closing writer which deleted all old index
files.
   
  reader.close();
  writer.close();
  reader.open();

OK, I'm glad we have it explained!

Just insert this:

new IndexWriter(luceneDirectory, analyzer).close();

after you've reopened your reader above. That should prune all deletable files from the index.
