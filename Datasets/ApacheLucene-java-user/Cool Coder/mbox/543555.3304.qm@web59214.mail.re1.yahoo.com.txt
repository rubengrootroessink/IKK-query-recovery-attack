SUBJECT: Best way to count tokens
DATE: 31 Oct 2007

Hi Group,
              I need to display list of tokens (tags) in my side those have got maximum occurances
in my index. One way I can think of is to keep track of all tokens during analysis and accordingly
display them. Is there any other way? e.g. if I want to display tokens in order of their occurences
as well as their weightage.
   
  regards,
  Ranjan
