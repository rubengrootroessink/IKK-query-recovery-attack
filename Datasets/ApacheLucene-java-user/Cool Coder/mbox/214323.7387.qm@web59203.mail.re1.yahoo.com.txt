SUBJECT: How to delete old index
DATE: 25 Nov 2007

Hi,
      I used have index refreshed in every 4 hr. However after each refresh, I can see two
index. I am not sure how can I delete old index.
   
  On starting of indexing process, I create Writer
  writer = new IndexWriter(luceneDirectory,false,luceneAnalyzer,true);
   
  At the end of Indexing process:
  writer.flush();
  writer.close();
   
  and reopen the indexreader
   
  luceneDirectory = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexPath);
  
  reader = IndexReader.open(luceneDirectory);
  searcher = new IndexSearcher(reader);
  Is this the right way or I am missing something?
  Let me tell you that I dont want to update index rather I just want to delete the old index.
  Your help would be appreciated.
