This is what I am looking for prior to adding into index. SO that it can help me  to display
in my site first 10 tokens that has got maximum occurences in my index. In otherword, user
can add weightage to these terms.

Are you looking for the term frequency vector?

IndexReader.html#getTermFreqVector(int,%20java.lang.String)>

If you are using 2.3 the TermVectorMapper might save you a couple of 
clock ticks sorting.


Or is this something you want to do prior to adding the document to 
the index?
