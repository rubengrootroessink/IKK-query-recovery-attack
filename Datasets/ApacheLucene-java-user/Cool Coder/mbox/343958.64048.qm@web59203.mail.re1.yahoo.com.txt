  I can see two sets of lucene index files with same size and time stamp difference is 4 hrs.
   
  E.g. At start up , the lucence generated index file 
   
  _8w.cfs (also some more files)  with size 4 MB and time stamp  November 24, 2007, 2:57:48
PM

  After 4 hr, it generated another set of files like _32.cfs(also some more files) with size
4MB and timestamp November 24, 2007, 6:59:48 PM.
   
  But at the sametime, old index files did not get deleted. I think that all old index files
should get deleted once new index is created and IndexReader is reopened.
   
  Can you tell me why this is not happening?

What do you mean by "you can see two index"?

This is exactly right. That final true (which is the "create" arg) will
clear out the index.

The writer.flush() isn't necessary: writer.close() will always flush.

This looks right to me!
