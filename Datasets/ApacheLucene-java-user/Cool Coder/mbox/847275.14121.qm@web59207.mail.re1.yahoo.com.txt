SUBJECT: Highlighter and href fields
DATE: 24 Oct 2007

Is there anyway I stop highlighting text if it is a href/url etc...? The problem occurs when
the field content is a URL which contains the query e.g. my search is for .net and fields
has value http://jkjsd.net. After applying highlighter, it becomes http://jkjsd<b>.net</b>,
which is a wrong URL. Can I filter it out?
