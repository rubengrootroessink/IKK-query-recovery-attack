Is there any analyzer that can be configured to stop searching url test i.e. href=""? Maybe
I need some sort of filter with reg ex so that searcher will skip searching text if it matches
regular expressions in the filter. I am not sure whether this is possible? I would appreciate
your valuable suggestion/input.
