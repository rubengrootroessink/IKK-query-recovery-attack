SUBJECT: lucene for statistical analysis
DATE: 2 May 2003

hello,

I am just starting looking at lucene for my project.

Before I proceed, I would like to know if it's a good idea to use lucene for
creating index and also performing statistical analysis on the index (e.g.
most frequent words, number of appearance of certain index token, etc.)

if lucene is not a good candidate, can anyone suggest an alternatives ?

thanks in advance
andy
