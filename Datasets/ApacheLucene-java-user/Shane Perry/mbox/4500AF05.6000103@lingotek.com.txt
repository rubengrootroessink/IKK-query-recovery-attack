SUBJECT: Determining index from MultiSearcher
DATE: 7 Sep 2006

I am currently working on an application which requires the ability to 
search multiple indexes using the same query.  I can use the 
MultiSearcher object to do this without any problem.

For ranking purposes, I need to know at least the String version of the 
Directory associated with the index for each returned Document.

Does anybody know if there currently some built-in functionality to do this?
