As I am always looking for ways to enhance a searches response time, if 
I were to use the MultiReader as suggested, would it still be possible 
to determine which index a hit came from?  Currently I  use the 
MultiSearcher.subSearcher() method to determine this information.  After 
taking a, albeit quick, look through the javadocs, nothing stands out.
