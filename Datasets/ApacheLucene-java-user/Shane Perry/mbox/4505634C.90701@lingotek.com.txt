Not sure if this is something of interest, but there is an open source 
project called File2XLIFF4j on Sourceforge.net 
(http://file2xliff4j.sourceforge.net/).  The project converts many 
common file formats to XLIFF.  It may be useful for getting a common 
format, highlighting, and the recreating the original file with the format.
