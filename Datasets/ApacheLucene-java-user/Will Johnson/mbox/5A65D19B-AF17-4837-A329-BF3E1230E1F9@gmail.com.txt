SUBJECT: Re: function query - get DocValues
DATE: 24 Aug 2007

at a basic level yes, just getting the avg/min/max from a function  
query would be awesome.   once that is in place getting more complex  
stats would be gravy.  i need to do something in this area i just  
want to know if there is some more fundamental that i'm working against.
