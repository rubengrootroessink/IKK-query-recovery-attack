SUBJECT: Re: function query - get DocValues
DATE: 27 Aug 2007

the patch i have worked out allows passing up the DocValues returned  
by the ValueSourceScorer to the ValueSourceQuery and then on up via a  
getDocValues().  am i missing any design/performance issues or does  
this sound generally useful?  i'll submit a patch to jira once  
everything is doc'd and tested appropriately.

this allows you do to things like:

FieldScoreQuery q = new FieldScoreQuery("qty",  
FieldScoreQuery.Type.INT);
Hits hits = searcher.search(q);
System.out.println(q.getDocValues().getAverageValue());
System.out.println(q.getDocValues().getMaxValue());
System.out.println(q.getDocValues().getMinValue());


- will
