SUBJECT: function query - get DocValues
DATE: 24 Aug 2007

i'm looking at doing some statistical work with lucene searches and  
the function queries look like a nice starting point.  i found the  
DocValues.getMin/Max/Avg functions already however there doesn't seem  
to be a nice way to get to this information without doing a fair  
amount of subclassing.  it would seem possible to pass the DocValues  
or perhaps a new DocValuesStats object back up the chain to avoid  
having to do all of this extra work just to get some basic info from  
the query.  is there some reason why this might be a bad idea/design  
or would a patch be interesting to anyone other than me?
