Ah, faceting. That could very well be the defining requirement for your
selection of hardware. As far as I remember, Solr supports two different
ways of faceting (depending on whether there are few or many tags in a
facet), where at least one of them uses counters corresponding to the
number of documents in the index. That scheme is similar to the approach
we're taking and in our experience this quickly moves the bottleneck to
RAM access speed. Now, I'm not at all a Solr expert so they might have
done something clever in that area; I'd recommend that you also state
your question on the Solr mailing list and mention what kind of faceting
you'll be performing.

In your first post you stated "I currently have an index which is 16GB
per machine (8 machines = 128GB)" so it's a bit confusing to me what you
have?

I tried a few searches and that seemed snappy enough. Not anywhere near
10 seconds?

No problem. The BlogSpace thingy was nice eye-candy.
