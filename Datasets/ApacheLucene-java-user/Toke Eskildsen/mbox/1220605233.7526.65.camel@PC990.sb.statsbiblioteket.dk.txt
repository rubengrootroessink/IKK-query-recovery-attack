For disks (as in conventional 10.000/15.000 RPM harddrives), IO is
clearly the bottleneck for us also.

As for Flash-SSDs, we've tried 2 * MTRON 6000 32GB RAID 0, 2 * SanDisk
5000 32GB RAID 0 and SanDisk something (64GB model) both as single drive
and 4 drives in RAID 0.

However, the performance-observation only goes for querying the indexes.
For building, we haven't performed any substantial tests for RAM and for
Flash-SSDs vs. harddrives, only the newest SanDisk gave any noticeable
increase.

One important observation with regard to updating is that our setup with
SSDs requires a lot less warmup-time as compared to conventional
harddisks. This allows for shorter delays before new content is visible.
