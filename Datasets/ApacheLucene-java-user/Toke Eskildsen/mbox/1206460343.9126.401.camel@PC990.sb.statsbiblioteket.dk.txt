That's fairly slow. Are you doing any warm-up? It is my experience that
it helps tremendously with performance.

I tried requesting a stored field from all hits for all searches with
logged queries on our index (9 million documents, 37GB), no fancy
tricks, just Hits and hit.get(fieldname). For the first couple of
minutes, using standard harddisks, performance was about 2-300
field-requests/second. After that, the speed increased to about 2-3000
field-requests/second.

Using solid state drives, the same pattern could be seen, just with much
lower warm-up time before the full speed kicked in.

There's no need to initialize the selector for every collect-call.
Try moving the initialization outside of the collect method.

The system will (hopefully) utilize the free RAM for disk-cache, so the
last 3GB are not wasted.
