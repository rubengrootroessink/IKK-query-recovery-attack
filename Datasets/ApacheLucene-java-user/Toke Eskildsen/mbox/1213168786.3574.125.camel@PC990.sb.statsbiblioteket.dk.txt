That's without reusing the searcher, right? In that case the increased
rate must be attributed to the disk cache being warmed. Please try and
test again with the searcher being reused.

Not to my knowledge. Search time and RAM consumption goes up, of course,
but I'm not aware of any special point where things start to go bad at
an increased rate.

With an index of 10M/3GB? It doesn't sound unrealistic after warm-up.
How much RAM is available for disk-cache, when the machine is running?
