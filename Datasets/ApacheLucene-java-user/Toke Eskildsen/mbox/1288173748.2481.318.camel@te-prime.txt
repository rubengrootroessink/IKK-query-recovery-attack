4 * 64GB Samsung MCCOE64G5MPP-0VA00 drives. They were pretty cool two
years ago and still work very well for search-servers (random writes are
not good, but we don't need that for searching):

Yes. Hopefully an internal project for maintaining digital objects will
change gears during this year. This will result in objects with a lot of
meta data and some fulltexts. Depending on economy, the amount of
objects will range from 100.000+ to a few million. I would guesstimate
that this would mean a doubling of the index size, due to the richness
of the new objects.

Further out, the projections are unreliable. As a technician I hope for
a serious jump in size within a year or two, but I have hoped for that
the last two years. Politics does not move as fast as technology.

A doubling of the index size makes the existing 256GB/machine a tight
fit. I seem to remember that there are two free slots in our servers, so
adding 2 new consumer-class SSDs is the obvious upgrade. We're switching
to a more memory- and CPU-efficient way of handling sorting and
faceting, so we should not need to boost CPU and RAM.
