In your test you're reusing the searcher. For each search your program
performs, you will see faster response times, until the searcher is
fully warmed.

If your production-system, you re-open your searcher every time and do
not have the benefit of a warmed searcher.

So yes, Singleton searcher helps, as opposed to opening a searcher for
every search. Try making a test where the only thing you do is open a
searcher 100 times and you will see that it takes a non-trivial amount
of time.
