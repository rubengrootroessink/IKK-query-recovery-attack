8 million indexes is at a minimum 16 (24?) million files. If you are
using a conventional harddisk for that, then yes, it takes forever.
SSD is the answer to that problem, but then again, SSD is the answer to
most IO-performance problems.

Just a quick sanity check: I hope you are not storing the individual
index folders under the same root folder? If you have
indexes/index0000001/
indexes/index0000002/
indexes/index0000003/
...
indexes/index8000000/
in the same folder, you are asking for trouble since most file systems
don't perform well with folders with millions of entries. If that is the
case, split them in sub folders for every X order of magnitude, such as
indexes/000/000/index0000001/
indexes/000/000/index0000002/
indexes/000/000/index0000003/
...
indexes/000/500/index0500001/
...
indexes/008/000/index8000000/


Having that many tiny indexes sets off an alarm bell for me. That's
quite a special use of Lucene you've got going.

Use compound files, optimize to single segment. If I understand
correctly, your indexes are tiny, so this should not give any noticeable
performance hit.
