I'll second that. We use this in most of our outer methods and log the
time used on DEBUG level (and INFO in a few select cases).

For pinpointing bottlenecks I'll also recommend VisualVM. It ships with
Java, but the newest version can be found at
https://visualvm.dev.java.net/ 

The beauty of this tool is that it requires no preparation. Just start
is and connect to a running Java program. It provides detailed CPU-usage
and RAM-allocation statistics.
