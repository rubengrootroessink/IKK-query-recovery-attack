We did a fair amount of testing two years ago and put some graphs at http://wiki.statsbiblioteket.dk/summa/Hardware
The short version is that they'll probably boost your raw search speed a lot. However, often
all the web service wrapping and similar is the main performance bottleneck.

Things has changes since then: CPU's, RAM and SSDs has gotten faster while hard disks has
stayed the same, so the performance gap between SSDs and harddisks has widened.
