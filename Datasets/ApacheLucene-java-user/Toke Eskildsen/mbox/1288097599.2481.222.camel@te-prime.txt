How large do you expect the documents to be and how many hits do you
need to process? If both are low, this seems to be a fairly straight
forward iteration with a HashMap<String, Integer> to collect the counts.

If you're scaling up, you could make a field with all bi-grams and do
prefix faceting on that.

By remembering the previous term, the iteration method should be about
the same as above. For the faceting method, just reverse the order in
the bi-grams.
