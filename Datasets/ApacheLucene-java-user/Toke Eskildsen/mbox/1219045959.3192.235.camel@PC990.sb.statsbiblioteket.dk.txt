Sounds fine so far. If the RAM isn't used for anything else, the system
should use it for caching.

Not so fine and also unexpected. Are you sure that what you're seeing is
swapping and not just flushing of the write-cache? Are you observing the
disk-activity only when your switching from writer to reader or does it
continue to be a problem with subsequent searches?

Have you profiled the JVM memory usage? Do you have the same problem if
you specify 6GB as the ceiling?
