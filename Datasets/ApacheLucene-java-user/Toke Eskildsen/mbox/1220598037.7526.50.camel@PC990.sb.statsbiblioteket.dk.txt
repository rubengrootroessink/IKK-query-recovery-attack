We've done some comparisons of RAM (Lucene RAMDirectory) vs. Flash-SSD
vs. conventional harddrives. We've seen significant improvements for
Flash-SSDs over harddrives, but less for RAM over Flash-SSDs.

For our setup (Linux, Flash-SSDs, 4 core Xeon, simple searches, 37GB
index, 10M documents, ~70 fields), the CPU seems to be the bottleneck.
Testing with a commodity Flash-SSD might be worth trying before going
all-out with the RAM-based systems.
