A reference to a String takes up 4 or 8 bytes, depending on JVM and
setup. When doing String-based sorting in Lucene, there will be a
reference for each document for each sort-field. With 18M documents,
this will be at least 18M * 4 bytes * 6 = 432 MB. Plus the negligible
amount of String objects. It is less than the previously estimated
1.2GB, but still worth noting.
