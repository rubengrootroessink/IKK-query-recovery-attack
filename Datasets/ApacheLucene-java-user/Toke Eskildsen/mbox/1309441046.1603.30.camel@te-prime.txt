Yes, that is a prime blocker for proper distributed search with Lucene.

There's some work being done with Solr, but it is not stable:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-1632

We're experimenting with distributed idf by assigning different weights
to the queries sent to different searchers, based on term statistics
from the different indexes. However, it is quite a hack and one we've
done because one of the indexes is external and out of our control.


3 years ago (or was it 4?) we also used distributed indexing with
searching being done on a single merged index. It worked surprisingly
well, but it was replaced by indexing on a single machine, when we
finally got around to doing a proper profiling of our indexing process
and removed some serious bottlenecks.
