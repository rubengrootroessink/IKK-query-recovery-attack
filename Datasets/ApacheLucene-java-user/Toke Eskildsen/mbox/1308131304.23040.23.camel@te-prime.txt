The boost is something you do with your query, before it is issued to
the searcher.

If you use the query parser, you can provide the additional query
parameters by concatenating them to the standard user query:
String fullQuery = userQuery 
  + " OR myrange:[" + from + " TO " + to + "30]^" + myBoost;

If you build your Query by code, you can use ConstantScoreRangeQuery or
RangeQuery for the range part, where you can call setBoost(float).
