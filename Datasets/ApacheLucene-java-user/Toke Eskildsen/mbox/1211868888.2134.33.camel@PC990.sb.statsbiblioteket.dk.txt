What is the speed if you queue the queries and perform them one at a
time?

As for your code, then you don't do any warm-up. Looking at your
result-list it seems clear that the first 10 threads takes longer to
execute than the other threads. Try performing a short warm-up before
measuring by running the query a couple of times.
