I now see my query-logic was flawed. In order to avoid matching all
documents every time, the query would have to be
"foo AND (
  groupboost_A:dummy^10 OR 
  groupboost_B:dummy OR 
  groupboost_C:dummy^0.1 OR
  ... 
  groupboost_Z:dummy
)"

With that query, it seems that only documents matching foo will result
in a hit and be scored?

Thanks for the correction. The first query was clearly bad.

Possibly, but my understanding is too weak to see how I can avoid a
substantial performance-hit for the check for source?

Thanks,
