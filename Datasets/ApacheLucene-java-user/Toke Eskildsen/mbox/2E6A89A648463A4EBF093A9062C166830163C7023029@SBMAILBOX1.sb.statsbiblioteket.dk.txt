SUBJECT: RE: Old Lucene src archive corrupt?

> I'm trying to download some old Lucene source, e.g., http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/lucene-2.9.0-src.zip<http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/lucene-2.9.0-src.zip>
I get "unexpected of Archive" report from WinRar, which never has had problem with zip files.
 It's also the same problem with lucene-2.9.1-src.zip and perhaps with other versions as well.

I just downloaded the ZIP-file from the link above. No problems with Ubuntu's default unzip,
WinRar 3.92 or Total Commander (the last two running under Wine).

Can you check if the md5-sum is correct after download? If not, try downloading again and
see if that changes the md5-sum.
