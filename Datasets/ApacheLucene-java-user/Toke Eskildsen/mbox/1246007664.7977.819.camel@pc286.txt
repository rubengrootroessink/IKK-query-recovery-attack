We were hit by GC hell some time ago when we ran JVMs with 5-7GB
allocated. It turned out that using Sun's RMI forces a total garbage
collection once a minute. At least for the version we used at the time.

Some info at http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6200091

We've tested MTRON-SSDs from 2007 vs. 10.000 and 15.000 RPM harddisks in
RAID 0 and 1 on a dual-core Intel Xeon machine. There was no doubt that
the SSDs were substantially faster than the harddisks for searching.
Some related observations was that the need for warm-up and disk-cache
was greatly reduced.
