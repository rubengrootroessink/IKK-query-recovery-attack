Well, how many documents do you have? 10 million? That's just 160MB in
overhead, of which the 80MB are temporary on the first search.

You could dump the order-array on disk (huge performance hit on
conventional harddisks), but it's hard to avoid the temporary
inverse-array upon first search. Of course, you could generate it on
index build and thus have a memory-hit of virtual 0.
