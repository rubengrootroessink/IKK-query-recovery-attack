Looking at the graphs I can see that the 2 threads / shared searcher is
suspiciously fast at getting up to full speed. It could be because the
disk-read-cache wasn't properly flushed. I'll rerun the test.

I've performed an inspection of graphs for my other published
measurements and they looked as expected. I'll spend some more time on
it tomorrow.
