Be aware that arrays in themselves take up a fair amount of memory, so
you'll want to use only 3 arrays in total and not 1000001:

int[][] coordinates = new int[2];
﻿coordinates[0] = new int[1000000];
﻿coordinates[1] = new int[1000000];

[...]

Sounds fine when the index rarely changes.

The Sun JVM is perfectly capable of handling large arrays efficiently.
We use an array-based structure of ints and longs for quick facet look
up that is approximately 300MB.
