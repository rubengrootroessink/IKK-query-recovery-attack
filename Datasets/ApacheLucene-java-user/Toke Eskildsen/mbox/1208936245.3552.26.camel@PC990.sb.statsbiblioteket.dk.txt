Our index is 30GB+ with 9 million records and a machine handles an
average search in about 250 ms. This is without proper warm-up and using
conventional harddisks, simple queries and simple processing of hits
(extraction of a field from the first 20 hits).

How often do you change your index and do you perform any kind of
warm-up? What is a typical query, how many hits does it return and what
do you do with the hits?

I doubt that you'll find a formula as such, as there are so many
variables influencing performance.
