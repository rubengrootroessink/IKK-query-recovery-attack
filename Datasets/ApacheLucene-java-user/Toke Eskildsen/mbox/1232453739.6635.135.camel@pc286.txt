http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc//org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html
points to 
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc//org/apache/lucene/document/AbstractField.html#setBoost(float)
which leads to
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc//org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html#encodeNorm(float)
which says

"The encoding uses a three-bit mantissa, a five-bit exponent, and the
zero-exponent point at 15, thus representing values from around 7x10^9
to 2x10^-9 with about one significant decimal digit of accuracy. Zero is
also represented. Negative numbers are rounded up to zero. Values too
large to represent are rounded down to the largest representable value.
Positive values too small to represent are rounded up to the smallest
positive representable value"

However, setting the field boost to 7x10^9 won't work very well. See the
JavaDoc for AbstractField for details.
