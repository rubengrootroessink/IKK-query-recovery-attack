I took the opportunity to make a small test. Our index is 37 GB with 10
million records. I tested on a dual-processor Xeon machine with 8 GB of
RAM. The test-material was logged queries from our production system.
I tried with shared searcher between threads and a searcher for each
thread.

As for shared searcher vs. individual searchers, there was just a slight
penalty for using individual searchers. However, all our queries are for
standard ranked searches - no sorting on title or similar, so I see no
reason to disbelieve that multiple searchers often results in poor
performance.

As for threading, I noticed something strange: On the dual-core machine,
two threads gave better performance than one, while 4 threads gave the
same performance as one. I tried it with standard harddisks (two 15.000
RPM in RAID 1) and with Flash drives (two 32GB Samsung in RAID 0) - in
both cases the picture was the same. I would have expected the
performance of four threads to be on par with two threads, or at least
to lie somewhere between one and two threads?


There's some graphs for my measurements at

should anyone be interested.
