We're currently experimenting with this approach, albeit only for two
searchers. Since we have very little control of the secondary searcher,
just a basic search-API, we're really hacking and performing a query
rewrite based on term statistics. This only works for basic term queries
(no wildcards, ranges etc.), but fortunately our search logs show that
they are by far the most common.

The math is not too bad: Extract occurrence counts for the terms, sum
them, calculate the difference when sending a request to a specific
searcher and set a term boost in the textual query, so that the standard
ranking formula in Lucene will yield the desired score.
