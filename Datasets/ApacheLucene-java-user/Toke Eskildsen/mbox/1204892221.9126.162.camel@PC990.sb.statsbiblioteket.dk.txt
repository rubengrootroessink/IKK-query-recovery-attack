If you are just doing it to test large indexes (in terms of document
count), then you need to look into your index-generation code. I tried
making an ultra-simple index builder, where each document contains a
unique id and one of nine fixed strings. The index-building speed on my
desktop computer is 40.000 documents/second (tested with 100 million
documents).

I would suspect that your random text generator is where all the
time-intensive processing occurs. Either that or you're flushing after
each document addition (which lowers my execution speed to about 100
documents/second).
