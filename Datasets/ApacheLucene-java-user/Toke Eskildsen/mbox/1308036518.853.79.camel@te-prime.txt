It really depends on your scenario. If you have few concurrent requests
and are looking to minimize latency, sharding might help; assuming you
have fast IO and multiple cores. You basically want to saturate all
available resources for all requests.

On the other hand, if throughput is the issue, sharding on a single
machine is counter-productive due to increased duplication and merging.

One standard advice for speeding up searches is using SSD's. Our
(admittedly old) experiments puts SSD-performance near RAM. With the
prices we have now, SSD's seems like an obvious choice for most setups.

We tried a few performance tests at different index sizes and for us,
index size vs. performance looked like the power law: Heavy performance
degradation in the beginning, less later. It makes sense when we look at
caching and it means that if you do not require stellar performance, you
can have very large indexes on few machines (cue Hathi Trust).
