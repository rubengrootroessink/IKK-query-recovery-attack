It is only the unique field values, but remember that there is also an
array of length #docs with pointers to the strings that takes up 4 or 8
bytes/pointer, depending on 32bit/64bit JVM. Furthermore, the current
Lucene uses Strings which takes up a lot more than just #chars bytes:
300.000 Strings of average length 10 chars is is about 18MB.

I'm quietly hacking on a solution for this, but the current code is
still at the proof of concept-stage and way too flaky to use for
production: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2369
