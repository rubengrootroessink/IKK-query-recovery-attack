All pointers are doubled, yes. While not a doubling in total RAM consumption,
it does give a substantial overhead.

Fair enough.  We've chosen to use use 64bit on our 16 and 32GB machines
and have never looked back, but our initial requirements called for ~7GB
for each JVM, so we didn't have a choice at the time.

Solaris should be capable of giving you ~3.5GB for JVMs with 32bit.
