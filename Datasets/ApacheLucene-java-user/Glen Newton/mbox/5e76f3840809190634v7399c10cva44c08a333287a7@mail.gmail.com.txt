I strongly disagree with this position.

To qualify my disagreement: yes, you should not use Lucene as your
primary storage for your data in your organization.

But, for a particular application, taking content from your primary
storage system (SQL database, filesystem files, etc) and - in the
context of an end-user application - both indexing and storing the
content is a good solution. The stored content in Lucene if
effectively a cache.

Advantages:
- faster (don't have to make additional queries to find content in
primary storage system)
- less system dependencies (if the primary system is down...)
- no longer hitting primary storage system (which are usually already
busy doing other things and also tend to be expensive)
- simpler

Disadvantages
- larger index
- might be slower, if the index is significantly larger
- updating issues

thanks,

Glen
