SUBJECT: Re: How to add PageRank score with lucene's relevant score in sorting
DATE: 28 May 2008

You should consider keeping the PageRank (and any other more dynamic
data) in a separate index (with the documents in the same oder as your
bigger, more static index) and then use a ParallelReader on both of
them. See:
  http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_1_0/api/org/apache/lucene/index/ParallelReader.html
