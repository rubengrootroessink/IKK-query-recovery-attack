SUBJECT: Merging indexes & multicore/multithreading
DATE: 2 Dec 2008

Let's say I have 8 indexes on a 4 core system and I want to merge them
(inside a single vm instance).
Is it better to do a single merge of all 8, or to in parallel threads
merge in pairs, until there is only a single index left? I guess the
question involves how multi-threaded merging is and if it will take
advantage of all cores.

thanks,

-glen
