There are a number of ways to do this. Here is one:
Lose the parentid field (unless you have other reasons to keep it).
Add a field fullName, and a field called depth :

doc1
fullName: state
depth: 0

doc2
fullName: state/department
depth:1

doc3
fullName: state/department/Boston
depth: 2

doc4
fullName: state/department/Opera
depth: 2

doc4
fullName: state/Chicago
depth: 1

doc6
fullName: state/department/Opera/November
depth: 3

> 1. Same path, for example: /state/department/Boston – return doc3
query: fullName:+/state/department/Boston

> 2. Child of the path,  for example: /state/department – return doc3,doc4
query: fullName:+/state/department depth:+"1"

> 3. All childs of the path for example: /state/department - return doc3,doc4,doc6
query: fullName:+/state/department/

Is this what you need?
Depending on your use cases, there may be better ways of implementing this.

As this is not a relational db, we are not concerned (hopefully) with
the replicated information in the fullName field.

thanks,

Glen
