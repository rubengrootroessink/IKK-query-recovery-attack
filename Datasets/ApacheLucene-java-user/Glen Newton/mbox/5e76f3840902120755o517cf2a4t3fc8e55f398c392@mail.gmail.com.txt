V1 of a project of mine, Ungava[1], which uses Lucene to index
research articles and library catalog metadata, also uses Project
Simile's Metaphor and Timeline. I have some simple examples using
them:

Here is the search for "cell" in articles:
 http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ungava/Search?collection=jos&contents=cell

Here is a Timeline view of the search "cell" for articles:
 http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ungava/Search?calyHandler=timeLineView&collection=jos&contents=cell

here is the Exhibit view:
 http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ungava/Search?calyHandler=exhibit&collection=jos&contents=cell

Here is the keyword drill cloud[2] view:
http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ungava/Search?tagCloud=true&collection=jos&tagField=keyword&contents=cell&numCloudDocs=200&numCloudTags=50


Here is the "cell" search of the library catalog:
http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ungava01/Search?collection=csu&title=cell&sauthor=&keyword=&syear=-1&eyear=-1&sortBy=relevance

Timeline view:
http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ungava01/Search?calyHandler=timeLineView&collection=csu&title=cell

Subject Drill Cloud:
http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ungava01/Search?tagCloud=true&collection=csu&tagField=keyword&title=cell&numCloudDocs=200&numCloudTags=50&sortBy=relevance

I've used for visualizing the DBLP data set and it was OK. I also played with an early version
of LabEscape for TreeMaps. There is a paper on the project in case  you want to take a look:
www.oracle.com/technology/tech/semantic_technologies/pdf/informationgrid_oracle.pdf. BTW,
I'm not longer at Oracle but I'm happy to answer questions that you may have.
