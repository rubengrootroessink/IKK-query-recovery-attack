DATE: 14 Aug 2009

You are optimizing before the threads are finished adding to the index.
I think this should work:

IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter("D:\\index", new StandardAnalyzer(),
true);
File file=new File(args[0]);
Thread t1=new Thread(new IndexFiles(writer,file));
Thread t2=new Thread(new IndexFiles(writer,file));
Thread t3=new Thread(new IndexFiles(writer,file));
t1.start();
t2.start();
t3.start();
while(t1.getState()!=State.TERMINATED
||t2.getState()!=State.TERMINATED
||t3.getState()!=State.TERMINATED
){
  try{
   Thread.currentThread().sleep(100l);
   }
  catch(InterruptedException ie)
    {
       ie.printStackTrace();
    }

}//wait until the threads end.

writer.optimize();
writer.close();
Date end = new Date();
