> We have also launched a beta search site dedicated to searching all

> Droids, etc.  It's powered, of course, by Lucene via Solr (we'll
> provide details in a separate message later about our setup.)  You can

> To try it out, browse to http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/.

> Any and all feedback is welcome at find@lucidimagination.com.

> Thanks,
