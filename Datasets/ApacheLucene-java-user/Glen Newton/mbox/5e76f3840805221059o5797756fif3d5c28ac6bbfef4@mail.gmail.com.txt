 100 threads is a lot, I'm guessing you are reusing your searcher, which is good, but you
will actually improve performance a bit if you work with a small pool of searchers instead
of a single searcher.

Any chance you could explain why this is the case? Is it because the
parallel searches are serialized in the single searcher?
