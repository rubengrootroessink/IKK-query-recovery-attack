SUBJECT: Re: Creating tag clouds with lucene
DATE: 5 Nov 2009

Mathias,

This is a special case: I am doing this on fields that have single
term entries, or are treated like a single term (like 'author') and
not parsed.
Here is what I am doing:
//Loop through the top N Hits (this application is Lucene 2.2, so it
is still using Hits).
Foreach Document
{
  add the term in the Field to a HashMap<String,Integer>, <term,
count>, incrementing existing entries;
}
Sort the hash by count, taking the top M
Sort top M by term
Display tag cloud.
----------

If you were using full-text, I think you would instead would use the
 TermDocs IndexReader.termDocs(Term term)
and take the top N terms & add to the hash.

An issue is likely whether you want to have multiple word phrases in
your tag cloud, like in the above example "Cell adhesion molecules".
You would have to play with your Analyzer to get things like this.
N-grams for terms would handle this? Anyone?

thanks,

Glen
