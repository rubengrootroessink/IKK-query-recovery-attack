SUBJECT: Software Announcement: LuSql: Database to Lucene indexing
DATE: 17 Nov 2008

LuSql is a simple but powerful tool for building Lucene indexes from
relational databases. It is a command-line Java application for the
construction of a Lucene index from an arbitrary SQL query of a
JDBC-accessible SQL database. It allows a user to control a number of
parameters, including the SQL query to use, individual
indexing/storage/term-vector nature of fields, analyzer, stop word
list, and other tuning parameters. In its default mode it uses
threading to take advantage of multiple cores.

LuSql can handle complex queries, allows for additional per record
sub-queries, and has a plug-in architecture for arbitrary Lucene
document manipulation. Its only dependencies are three Apache Commons
libraries, the Lucene core itself, and a JDBC driver.

LuSql has been extensively tested, including a large 6+ million
full-text & metadata journal article document collection, producing an
86GB Lucene index in ~13 hours.
