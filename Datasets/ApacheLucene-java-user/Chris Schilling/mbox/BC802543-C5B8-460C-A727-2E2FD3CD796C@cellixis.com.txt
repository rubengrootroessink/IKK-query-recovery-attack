SUBJECT: Indexing with weights
DATE: 24 Jan 2011

Hello,

I have a bunch of text documents formatted like so:

keyword1 wt1
keyword2 wt2
keyword3 wt3

I would like to index the documents based on the keywords.  When I retrieve (search) for a
keyword, I would like the list of documents to be sorted by the weight for that keyword. 
 Is there an example anywhere of how to do this.  I own LIA, but have not made it through
the entire book yet.  Apologies if this is addressed.

Thank you!
Chris S.
