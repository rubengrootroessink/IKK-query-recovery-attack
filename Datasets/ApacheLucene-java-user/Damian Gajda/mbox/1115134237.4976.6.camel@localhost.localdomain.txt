I've created a component for parsing HTML entities (special characters).
This component is a part of ObjectLedge project - it is stored in
components subproject. Please feel free to use this component. It is
licensed under BSD (Apache like) license. You will need to check the
ledge-components CVS module.

You are also welcome to use ObjectLedge as a whole :)
