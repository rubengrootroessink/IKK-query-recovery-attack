I'm pretty sure this is a bug or incompatibility with Luke - I'm using
boosted documents, and I seem to remember that Luke reported everything
as 1.0, even though my test applications showed things correctly. 

The boost in the final app is working fine, so the functionality of
Lucene appears to be correct. 

Cheers,

Tim.

Subject: Boost value and LUKE


Hello All,

I am testing the boost value within the latest version of Lucene and I'm

inspecting the results through Luke.

For each FIELD that I want to boost I use the setBoost method.  And 
everything looks good.  But Luke is refusing to exposure the boost value

and keeps returning 1.0 for the specified columns (well actually all 
columns) when I have set one column to 0.5 and the other to 0.75.

1. Is there something I am doing wrong?
2. Is there a bug in Lucene?
3. is there a bug in Luke?

Anyone have any hints.

Thank You
