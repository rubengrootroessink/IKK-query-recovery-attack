Ah - the one bit of LIA I haven't read yet is the case studies section!
Many thanks, I'll check it out. Sorting by multiple fields isn't quite
what I want - that sorts entirely by field A, then uses field B for
records where A is identical, correct? 

What I really want to do is sort by "A * (1-(B/700))", where A is the
score, and B is the age (in days) of the document. IE - the score is
basically "scaled down" with date. 

Cheers,

Tim.

Tim, check out p. 155 in LIA where we discuss "Sorting by multiple  
fields".

However, what you're really after it seems is boosting documents.   
Check out TheServerSide's case study (online or in LIA) - Dion  
discusses how he implemented boosting for more recent documents.  If  
you're indexing documents in ascending date order, perhaps you could  
leverage the document id in such a boosting factor?
