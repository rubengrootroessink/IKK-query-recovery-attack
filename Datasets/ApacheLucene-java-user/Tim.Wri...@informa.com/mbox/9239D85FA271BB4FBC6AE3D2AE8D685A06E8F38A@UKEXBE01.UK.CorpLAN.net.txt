Thanks to everyone for the explanation. Given that RangeQuery is clearly
unsuitable for out requirements, ConstantScoreRangeQuery looks ideal.

However, we're building our queries (at the moment) using QueryParser.
Is there any way we can get QueryParser to use a ConstantScoreRangeQuery
instead of a RangeQuery?

Cheers,

Tim.

You could use either a RangeFilter or a ConstantScoreRangeQuery
