Ouch! Yes, we're indexing with seconds, that's almost certainly the
problem. :( I had no idea that rangequery worked by enumerating every
possible value, that's terrifying. 

We have a requirement to index data going back for about 20 years,
though, and although daily resolution would be fine, this is still 7000
days. That's more than BooleanQuery supports. 

So what's the solution? Surely we're not the only people who need to
search in date ranges going back this far? Does PrefixQuery work the
same way, or can we work around this by doing things like a prefixQuery
for "2005-01-" to catch an entire month in one query, etc?

Cheers,

Tim.

Tim,

This is possible a lot of days:
  date:[2005-03-16 TO 2006-03-16]
And if your 'date' field is more granular than 'a day', then this is a
lot more hours/minutes/seconds/milliseconds.

Your range query is expanded to all unique values in the range.  This is
probably in the FAQ, but if not, look at the first snippet:
http://www.lucenebook.com/search?query=indexing+date+millisecond

If you don't need hours/minutes/seconds/milliseconds, don't index them.

Otis

Hi,

We're using queryparser to generate my queries (not ideal, and we're
planning on rewriting it, but at the moment we don't have the resources
to do so). 

We have a default field "text" which contains all of our text fields,
and a "date" field which is just a string field in the format YYYY-MM-DD
(so we can sort). 

I'm passing in the query string: broadband AND date:[2005-03-16 TO
2006-03-16]^0.01

(I'm weighting the date portion of the query so it doesn't affect the
sorting too heavily). 

Running query.toString gives this: +text:broadband +date:[2005-03-16 TO
2006-03-16]^0.01

When I try to run the query, though, I get this Exception:

I know Lucene 1.4 has a limited number of clauses, but assumed two or
three would be okay. :)

Any ideas would be gratefully received! Oddly, this doesn't seem to
occur every time, just with certain date ranges...

Cheers,

Tim.
