SUBJECT: Handling hyphens and other puncuation in proper nouns
DATE: 24 May 2006

Hi all,

We're having issues searching for proper nouns (names) which have
punctuation in; things like "a-blah" or "blah'x". I suspect the
StandardAnalyzer is replacing the punctuation with spaces, and we get
back results that just contain "blah". 

Any suggestions? I'm guessing we could write our own Analyzer, but I
suspect this has come up before and wondered if there was an easier way
to solve the problem!

Many thanks, 

Tim.
