Ah - that's useful to know. Although in that case I'd suggest that the
sensible thing for Luke to do would be to either remove the boost field,
or show it as "unavailable", instead of (misleadingly) displaying it as
1.0... 

Cheers,

Tim.

This is not a bug or incompatibility - it's the way the boost values are

stored in the index. Once the index is written down, the original boost 
values per field and per doc cannot be retrieved, because they are 
calculated into so called "fieldNorm" values.
