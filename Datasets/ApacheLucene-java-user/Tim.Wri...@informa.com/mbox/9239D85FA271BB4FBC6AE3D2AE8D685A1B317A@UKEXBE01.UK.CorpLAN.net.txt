SUBJECT: Searching for "keyword" fields using QueryParser
DATE: 24 Nov 2005

Hi,

Our index has a large text field, and a number of "keyword" fields with
things such as the publication code, article reference and so on. 

We're analysing using the StandardAnalyzer, which works well. Obviously
the fields which are defined as Field.Keyword don't run through the
analyzer. 

The problem comes when we search using a QueryParser. If we've inserted
a field using:

Field.Keyword("pubcode"."PUB123");

We then search using 

Query q = QueryParser.parse(query, "text", new StandardAnalyzer());

When we try to search on something like:

"pubcode:PUB123" - the analyzer promptly lowercases the search term, and
we get no hits back. 

Is there any way to explain that where a search term is being applied
against a field of type Keyword, that it shouldn't be run through the
analyzer? 

We can get around this by creating separate Query objects and joining
them with a BooleanQuery, but we were hoping to be able to handle all of
our queries using QueryParser so that we could easily store queries as
String objects. 

Cheers,

Tim.
