The easiest way I can think of would be to build two indexes - one with
popularity boosted documents and one without, and search the one you
want. 

Alternatively, if you have to have a single index, you could add each
document twice, once with no boost, and once with "popularity" boost,
and specify a keyword field for each document defining whether it's
boosted or not. Then, when you want to search, restrict results to
documents where the keyword is "boosted" or "notboosted" respectively.

Both fairly low tech solutions, but I'm lazy like that!

Cheers,

Tim.
