If you're indexing a field like this in order to be able to use it as a
reference later, you should normally index it using Field.Keyword
instead of Field.Text - if you use Text, it will go through your
Analyzer, which is probably what's changing the case. (I think this is
right - I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong!)

Cheers,

Tim.

Subject: Deleting documents


I have a problem when deleting documents.
Lets say I have a Document object doc.
doc.add(Field.Text("id","index1,DML"));
doc.add(Field.Text("contents","some records"));
IndexWriter.addDocument(doc);
 Now if I want to delete the document with id:index1,DML I do something
like 
this:
IndexReader.delete(new Term("id", "index1,DML"));
 And it is not deleted.
 I have debuged it and noticed that lucene compares my "index1,DML" 
parameter with it's internal value "index1,dml".
 So when I do:
 IndexReader.delete(new Term("id", "index1,dml"));
the document is deleted.
 Now please explain me why is there a lower case value for my "id"?
And excuse my poor english!
