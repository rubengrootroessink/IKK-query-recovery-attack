It appears that I was confused about the way analyzers are working. I
assumed that a typical analyzer would just remove hyphens and treat the
phrase as a space. We're just using StandardAnalyzer. 

When we search (using QueryParser) for the phrase "t-mobile" (including
quotes) we're getting results back which only have the phrase "mobile"
in them. I would assume the analyzer would convert this to the "t
mobile" (again, in quotes) and would only return documents containing
that phrase. 

Oddly, however, if we search for "pay-tv", we only get back documents
that actually have the phrase "pay tv" or "pay-tv" - nothing which just
has "pay" or "tv". 

I'm not quite sure why "t-mobile" is behaving differently to "pay-tv".
If anyone could point me in the right direction I'd be very grateful!

Many thanks, 

Tim.
