SUBJECT: Changing default QueryParser operator from OR to AND
DATE: 10 Feb 2006

Hi guys, 

IF QueryParser gets a phrase with a number of words (ie: "here are
words") it uses the implicit operator OR - "here OR are OR words". LIA
on p94 says the operator "by default is OR", implying that there may be
some way to change this. 

We'd really like the default to be AND. Is that possible?

Cheers,

Tim.
