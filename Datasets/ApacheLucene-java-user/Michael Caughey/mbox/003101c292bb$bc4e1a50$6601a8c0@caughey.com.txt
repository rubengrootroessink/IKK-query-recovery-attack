SUBJECT: Date Range - I've searched FAQs and mail list archive.....  no help..... Really
DATE: 23 Nov 2002

Part of my problem seems to be that the Range Query Object isn't acting as it should as per
the FAQ and other mail list entries.
I'm using Lucene 1.2

I have a field in my index called DATE.  I'd like to do a date range search on it. I am using
Strings in the format of yyyyMMdd.

I have the following dates in my Index:
20021105
20021126
20021113
20021115
20021103
20021125


When I use the follwing code to search, I get an exception:
*NOTE: I'm using the MultiFieldQueryParser becuase In some cases I check other field, I've
simplified this one to demonstrate (and run my tests isolated from other factors)

       IndexSearcher search = new IndexSearcher("myindex");
       SimpleAnalyzer analyzer = new SimpleAnalyzer();
       String[] fields = new String[1];
       fields[0] = "DATE"
        
      String buff = "( DATE:[20021101 - 20021131] )";
      Query query = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(buff, fields, analyzer);
      searcher.search(query);

I get the following error:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: At least one term must be non-null

if buff = "( DATE:20021101 - 20021131 )";
as well as
if buff = "( DATE:(20021101 - 20021131 ))";
I simply get no results.

I have added the date to the document by both
Field.Text("DATE", dateStr);
and
Field.Keyword("DATE", dateStr);

I have also tried to build the queries up creating Objects.  One of the things I notice is
that if I use the RangeQuery Object there are no spaces on either side of the "-".

The documents which I created have the following Fields:
TITLE, DESCRIPTION and DATE.
If I search on TITLE or DESCRIPTION or a combination of both I get results just fine.

Am I doing something stupid, or is this a bug?  Seems to based on what I read that the example
above where String buff = "( DATE:[20021101 - 20021131] )"; is correct and should work.

I published the complete source in an earlier posting called "Problem with Range".  It also
contains a stack trace of the error.

Thanks in advance,
Michael
