 I am not sure, I was assigned to do this task. It must be related to
furthur tweaks of the result-set which is based on scores.

    But, I have got some results whose score is above 1. I do not know
whether I met your conditions (default) .
For ex..

3.0334244 = (MATCH) fieldWeight(freeTextField:england in 7083017), product of:
  2.236068 = tf(termFreq(freeTextField:england)=5)
  7.235139 = idf(docFreq=14539, maxDocs=7420800)
  0.1875 = fieldNorm(field=freeTextField, doc=7083017)

Thanks.
