Here is the list of possible languages. Don't laugh :) I know those are almost all world languages
but it is a true requirement. Well, actual number will be closer to 70 not 100 but still I
don't really know which ones from the list below will end up in the DB.

its not too bad, here would be a simple one that only breaks words on
whitespace and lowercases:

public class Example extends Analyzer {
 public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
   TokenStream ts = new WhitespaceTokenizer(reader);
   ts = new LowerCaseFilter(ts);
   return ts;
 }
}

can you give a better idea as to what languages you have and what your
search requirements are (accent marks, punctuation, etc etc) ?
