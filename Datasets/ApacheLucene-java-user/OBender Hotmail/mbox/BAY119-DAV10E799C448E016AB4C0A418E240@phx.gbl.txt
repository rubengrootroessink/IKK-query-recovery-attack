I'm using default analyzer. Actually one that is set by default by Compass framework but I
assume it is the same that would be used in Lucene by default.
Which one should I use?

Which analyzer in particular are you using?

Its probably not doing what you want for hindi. These "diacritics" are
important (vowels, etc).
