you should also make sure the data is indexed twice, once w/ the original

I finally got around to really needing this, and I'm just a little confused
by the implementation.  Should I physically use two different indexes (one
with StandardAnalyzer, one with WhitespaceAnalyzer?), two separate fields (I
don't think that's possible?), or could you explain your idea a little
more?  Should I implement my own WhitespaceTokenizer with the TokenFilter?

Thanks.
