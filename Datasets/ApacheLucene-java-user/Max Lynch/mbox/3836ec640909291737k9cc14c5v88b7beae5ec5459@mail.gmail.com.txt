SUBJECT: TopDocCollector limits
DATE: 30 Sep 2009

Hi,
I am developing a search system that doesn't do pagination (searches are run
in the background and machine analyzed).  However, TopDocCollector makes me
put a limit on how many results I want back.  For my system, each result
found is important.  How can I make it collect every result found?

Thanks.
