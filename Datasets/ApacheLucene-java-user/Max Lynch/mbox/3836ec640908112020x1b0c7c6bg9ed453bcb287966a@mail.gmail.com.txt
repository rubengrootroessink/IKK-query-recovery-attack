SUBJECT: Different Analyzers
DATE: 12 Aug 2009

I just want to see if it's safe to use two different analyzers for the
following situation:

I have an index that I want to preserve case with so I can do case-sensitive
searches with my WhitespaceAnalyzer.  However, I also want to do case
insensitive searches.

What I did was create a custom Analyzer that creates a LowerCaseFilter with
a WhitespaceTokenizer, and use that analyzer to search when I want case
insensitive searching, and use the default WhitespaceAnalyzer when I want
case sensitive.

Is this the right approach, or should I change something?

Thanks,
Max
