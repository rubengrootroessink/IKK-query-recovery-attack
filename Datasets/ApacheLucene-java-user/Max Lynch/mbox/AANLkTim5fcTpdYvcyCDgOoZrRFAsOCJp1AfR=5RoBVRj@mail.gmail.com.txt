SUBJECT: "WI" not Wi-Fi
DATE: 8 Sep 2010

Hi,
I am using the StandardAnalyzer, but I am not interested in converting words
like Wi-Fi into "Wi" and "Fi".  Rather, "WI" is an important word for my
users (indicating the state of Wisconsin) and I need "WI" to only match the
distinct word.

I know in Solr I can set generateWordParts="0" for my
solr.WordDelimiterFilterFactory, but for some reason when I read the index
with Lucene the tokens are still separated.

Is there a way to disable this?  Thanks.
