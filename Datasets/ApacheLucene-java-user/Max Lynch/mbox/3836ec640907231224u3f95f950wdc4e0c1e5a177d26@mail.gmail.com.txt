I would want all of those.  What I wouldn't want would be

doc7: "Term 3"

I rank documents more highly based on how many of these terms they contain.
For example, my system ranks doc5 the highest in your example, then doc3,
then doc6. I don't need Term 3, but I need to have Term 1 or Term 2 before I
go looking for Term 3 to further organize my results.  Order doesn't matter,
they are put through a separate scoring system.  I am really just trying to
improve the performance a little bit since "Term 3" will, in my index, hit
on far more documents than Term 1 or Term 2, but I only care about the
documents where Term 1 or Term 2 were found first.

Thanks,
Max
