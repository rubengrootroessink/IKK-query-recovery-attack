I'm getting this error when I try to run my searcher and my indexer:

Traceback (most recent call last):
self.searcher = lucene.IndexSearcher(self.directory)
JavaError: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/spider/misc/index/_275c.cfs
(No such file or directory)

I don't know anything about the format of the Lucene index, but I notice I
have several _275* files from b to j but no c.

Any ideas?

Thanks.
