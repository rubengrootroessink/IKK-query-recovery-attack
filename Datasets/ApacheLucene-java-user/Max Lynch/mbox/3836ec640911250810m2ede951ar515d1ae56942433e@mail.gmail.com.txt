So in my case I have an indexer running in the background, and if it had
been running for more than 8 hours, I would remove the write lock and start
another indexer, which would cause corruption if the first one was still
writing.  It's a bad process I'm using and I know it's not how Lucene
usually does things so I need to improve my system.
