SUBJECT: Whitespace/Standard Analyzer and punctuation
DATE: 30 Sep 2009

I would like my searches to match "John Smith" when John Smith is in a
document, but not separated with punctuation.  For example, when I was using
StandardAnalyzer, "John. Smith" was matching, which is wrong for me.  Right
now I am using WhitespaceAnalyzer but instead searching for "John Smith"
"John Smith." "John Smith," etc., which seems like a dumb thing to be
doing.  Can I separate the punctuation but keep the analyzer aware of where
the punctuation occurred in my matching term?

Thanks.
