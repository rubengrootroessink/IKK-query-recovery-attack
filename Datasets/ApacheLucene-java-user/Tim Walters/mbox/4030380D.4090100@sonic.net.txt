SUBJECT: Field Reindex Question
DATE: 16 Feb 2004

Hi,

I'm thinking of using Lucene in an application that might change the 
field data without modifying the document. It would be nice to only have 
to rewrite the field index information, which is much smaller than the 
information for the document. Would anyone know if this is possible?

Thanks in Advance,
Tim
