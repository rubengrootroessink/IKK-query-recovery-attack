Hey guys, here is the exact thing you want, check out this searchable archive hosted by Nabble:
http://www.nabble.com/Lucene-f44.html - it archives all Lucene mailing lists into a forum,
you can cross search all or drill down and search a single list. You can also narrow search
by author, sort by date or relevance. By the way, the Nabble people use lucene for search.
