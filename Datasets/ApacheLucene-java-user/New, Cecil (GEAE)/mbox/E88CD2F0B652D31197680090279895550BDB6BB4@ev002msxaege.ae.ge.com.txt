SUBJECT: Transactional Indexing
DATE: 29 Nov 2001

I have noticed that when I kill/interrupt an indexing process, that it
leaves a "lock" file, preventing further indexing.

This raises a couple of questions:
a. When I simply delete the file and restart the indexing, it seems to work.
Is there a risk in doing this?

b. Can indexing be done in a concurrent fashion?  For example, allowing
multiple uploading of files over the web and doing incremental indexing as
they arrive.  In this situation, you may have several documents that need to
be indexed simultaneously.

Also I have seen some mention of a mailing list archive... how does one find
it or search it?  I do not see a reference at apache.org.

Thanks
