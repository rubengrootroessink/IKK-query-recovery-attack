this is exactly what I was doing.  Store=false, index=true, and token=false.

This combination is *not* represented by one of the factory methods.  It
appeared to work ok, but searches *never* returned any hits.

That's why I suspect it is a bug.

The Field() constructor is public, can't you use that instead of one
of the factory methods?

public Field(String name,
             String string,
             boolean store,
             boolean index,
             boolean token)
