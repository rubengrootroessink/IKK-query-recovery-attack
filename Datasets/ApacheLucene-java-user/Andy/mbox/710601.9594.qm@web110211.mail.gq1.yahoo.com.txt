Hello all,

I'm new to lucene and trying to implement a vector space model using lucene. I need to have
a file (or on memory) with TF/IDF weight of each term in each document. (in fact that is a
matrix with documents presented as vectors, in which the elements of each vector is the TF
weight ...)

Please Please help me on this
contact me if you need any further info via andykan1984@yahoo.com
Many Many thanks
