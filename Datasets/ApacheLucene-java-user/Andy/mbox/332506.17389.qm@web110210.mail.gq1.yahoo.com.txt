Hello all,



I'm trying to implement a vector space model using lucene. I need to
have a file (or on memory) with TF/IDF weight of each term in each
document. (in fact that is a matrix with documents presented as
vectors, in which the elements of each vector is the TF weight ...) 



Please Please help me on this
