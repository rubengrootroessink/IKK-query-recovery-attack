SUBJECT: $ or £ symbols are excluded from Search Query
DATE: 29 Jul 2009


Hi All,

I am using Lucene 2.2.0 and have created an Index with some text including
values in $, £ and euros too! But I can't search for text that includes $, £
or euro. I checked the index with Luke and can see the $ and £ symbols in
the index. When I ask Luke to explain the structure of the Query it always
excludes the $ and £ symbols from the query. I read the help on special
symbols and it said / could be used to escape the characters. Although I
didn't see $ or £ listed as a special operator and when I tried escaping
them it made no difference. Can anyone tell me how I can search my index for
$ or £.

Thanks,

Chris
