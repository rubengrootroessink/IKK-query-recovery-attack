Thanks for the suggestions. I had tried SimpleAnalyzer and StandardAnalyzer
within Luke. When I switched to WhitespaceAnalyzer the $ and £ symbols were
maintained.

Within my own Application we seem to be using a custom Analyzer that sub
classes Analyzer. What is the implication of switch the base class to
WhitespaceAnalyzer?

Thanks,
