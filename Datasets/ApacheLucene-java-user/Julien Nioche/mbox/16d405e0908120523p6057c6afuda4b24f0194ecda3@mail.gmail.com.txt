Hi,

you should also have a look at GATE (http://gate.ac.uk) which comes with a
NER application called ANNIE. You could use it to analyse your docs before
indexing them with Lucene or SOLR.

As Grant mentioned, UIMA can also be used for that as there are a number of
NER annotators available for it (OpenCalais, Stanford NER)
