Hello,

Has anybody already developped a program to monitor Lucene indexes?
This could be useful in order to know how many documents are in a given
index, what are the fields used and view the stored fields of a document. It
could help to merge indexes as well.

There's already everything in the core API to access these infos.

I just spent a lot of time debugging my application before realizing that I
indexed the wrong value for a given field. This kind of small app could have
helped.

If nobody ever did it I could try to build a webapp for that. Any
suggestions, needs or hints?
