I was about to announce the first release of LIMO (Lucene Index Monitor)
this morning when I found Andrzej's message about Luke. Although LUKE seems
to be definitly more complete and useful, I announce LIMO anyway.

LIMO is a web application made mainly of JSP. It can be found at
http://www.jnioche.freesurf.fr/LIMO/

Cheers

Julien
