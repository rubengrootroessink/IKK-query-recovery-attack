Looking at the mail archives is a good clue of whether a project is still
alive or not. In the case of Nutch, the project is active as you can see on
the list archives below :

http://www.mail-archive.com/user%40nutch.apache.org/
http://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40nutch.apache.org/

We're about to release a new version (1.3) and have a 2.0 in beta. SOLR is
now used by default for indexing in Nutch.
