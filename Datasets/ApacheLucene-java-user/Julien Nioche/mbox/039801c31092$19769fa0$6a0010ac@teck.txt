Creating an index for Lucene is indeed a good idea ;-)

It's very easy to retrieve informations about the most frequent Terms in the
index and the frequency of a given Term.
(e.g. using  IndexReader.termDocs(Term term))

But there's currently no method in the API to get the frequency of a
PhraseQuery. There was a discussion about that particular point a long time
ago (see
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org/msg00101.html).
This is also in the list of future improvments
http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18932.

I implemented it, but in a old version of Lucene. Because of the
modifications made in the Scoring recently it has  to be redone. The problem
is that computing the frequency of a PhraseQuery takes a lot of time (in a
regular search as well).

If you don't need frequencies for PhraseQueries - Lucene is a good
solution.Otherwise changes must be done in Lucene.

I'll try to take a look at it soon and propose a patch to the core sources.
