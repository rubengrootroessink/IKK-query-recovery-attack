SUBJECT: Sort Collection of ScoreDocs
DATE: 2 Mar 2009


Is there an existing Utility class which will sort a collection of ScoreDocs
? I have a result set (array of ScoreDocs) stored in JVM and want to sort
them by relevanceScore. I do not want to execute the query again. The stored
result set is sorted by another term and hence the need.

Would highly appreciate if you would please let me know how do I do so?

Thanks,

-Chetan
