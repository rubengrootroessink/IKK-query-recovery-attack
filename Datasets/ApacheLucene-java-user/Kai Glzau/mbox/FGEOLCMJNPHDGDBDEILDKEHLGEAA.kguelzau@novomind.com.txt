SUBJECT: handling related words
DATE: 18 May 2005

Hi *,

i know how to handle stop words and synonyms, but how to handle related words?

red <-> orange (70% sim)
red <-> pink (60% sim)
red <-> yellow (20% sim)

When i got things right it's not possible to store this information at index time.
Do i have to expand related words at query time?

  query     : red skirt
  new query : (red orange^0.7 pink^0.6 yellow^0.2) skirt



Thanks,

	Kai GÃ¼lzau
