DATE: 9 Mar 2006

Just a short one, it rocks in some cases (when actual
BitSet/IntSet is compressable, long runs of set or
clear bits...). Very good general BitSet
representation

I have tried it and found no bugs so far (+- 2 months
of using it)

Unfortunately, there is an issue with Licence (not ASF
compatible :(

cheers

PS:
To use something like that with Lucene you will hit
the problem with Filter interface that suports only
BitSet. It means you will have to wait a bit until
more flexible Filter interface gets accepted by the
comunity. Apart from that, I would not evaluate too
much, just take Lucene, it is briliant ;)

PS1: If you are interested in compressed bit sets, try
to search for "utilities for compact sparse filters
lucene"
