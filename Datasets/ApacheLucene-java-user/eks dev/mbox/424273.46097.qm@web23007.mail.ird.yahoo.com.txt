SUBJECT: Stored Field vs "offset plus external file"?
DATE: 13 Feb 2008

I would like to try to replace our external storage of documents with Lucene stored field,
so a few questions before we proceed:

Background: We store currently complete documents  in a simple binary file and only keep offsets
into this file as a Stored field   in Lucene index. Documents (compressed) are short, avg
300-400bytes per document

What we would like to try is to store these documents as binary (compressed with simple/fast
static huffman + dictionary) stored Fields in order to make maintenance of this setup easier
as Lucene already does maintain updates and fetching of these fields, also indexing works
very well from multiple threads now. Complete Document would be the only Stored field we have
in index (I know about lazy loading). 
Simply what we do today is , search index, get offsets from found documents and than fetch
them from binary file. 

So the questions would be:

1. Does anyone see any theoretical/practical reason why our homemade "fetch offset from lucene
stored field-> jump to this offset in document" would be faster than "fetch stored field
from Lucene directly"

2.  We use Lucene Index wit MMAP directory now, so the concern is that index could grow too
large for MMAP with stored field like that.  Is there a way to say, "do not use MMAP Directory
for stored Fields, rather FSDirectory". I think not, but it is worth to ask as I think this
could be useful thing... Imagine to be able to say "Load terms with RAM Directory, postings
wit MMAP and stored fields with FSDirectory"... of course this is only for searching, not
indexing.

Thanks a lot.
Eks
