if you have possibility to sort your index once in a while on something like DateRange  you
will be surprised how good OS File cache utilizes locality of reference... we had dramatic
(ca 30%) improvements just by having index sorted once a week on the most used fields... depend
on nature of your collection and is not always possible, but if possible, does the job. If
this is also only used as boolean condition to select range of documents, not affecting score
(guess not), give omitTf() a try, your index will be smaller as well
