SUBJECT: Re: A lot of short documents, optimal query?
DATE: 11 Nov 2005

Thanks Hoss,

I've looked intio it and you were absolutely right,
could not be simpler.

Two quick ones on the same topic (my personal
education like questions):

- What is the purpose of hasCode and equals methods in
XxxFilter? (this is a question about actual usage in
Lucene, not java elementary :)

- What would be recommended usage of the SetFilter?
a) to use search(Query, SetFilter, HitCollector)
or
b) search(Query, HitCollector) + I do AND inside
hitCollector

Option a) could be faster because inside collect()
method in HitCollector there is no way to skip to the
first set bit of the SetFilter (bitset of the Query is
not visible) 

When we are done with testing (takes a while), I will
post results. Also, If somebody has interests in
SetFilter, I see no problems to post it back.

Agan, many thanks for usefull tip!
