DATE: 2 Apr 2008

the example you have sent is too small for the type of compression implemented in lucene. The
problem is that you have to store decoding symbol table , header ...* for each* document you
compress.  
The best you can do for this would be to use some compressor with static decoding table (some
entropy codec, huffman or so) and maybe some static dictionary compressor. As Grant said,
the best way to do it would be to compress your field before storing it into lucene
