300k documents is something I would consider very small. Anything under 10Mio documents IMHO
is small for Lucene (meaning, commodity hardware, 1G RAM should give you well under second
response times).
The number of words is not all that important, much more important would be the number of
unique words.

Thanks, Karl.

Do you know if 290k articles and 234 million words is a large lucene index
or a medium one? Do people build them this big all the time?

Thanks!
