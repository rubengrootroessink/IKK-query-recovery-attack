Hi Doug,

Yes they are. There were some comprehensive empirical
studies on this topic. Winkler modification on Jaro
string distance is based on this assumption (boosting
similarity if first n, I think 4, chars match).
Jaro-Winkler is well documented and some folks thinks
that it is much more efficient and precise than plain
Edit distance (of course for normal language, not
numbers or so).
I will try to dig-out some references from my disk on
this topic, if you are interested.

On another note,
I would even suggest using Jaro-Winkler distance as
default for fuzzy query. (one could configure max
prefix required => prefix query to reduce number of
distance calculations). This could speed-up fuzzy
search dramatically.

Hope this was helpful,
Eks
