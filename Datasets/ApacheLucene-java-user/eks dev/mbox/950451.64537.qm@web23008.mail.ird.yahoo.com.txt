you said, if an Index is optimized, isDeleted() does not present performance problem? I think
there is still check for null in synchronized method, can jvm optimize this, I doubt it?

Yes, my index is a "full-snapshot" created every "n" hours, there are
no incremental updates, so I decided to make another MatchAllDocsQuery
taking advantage that my index is read-only and basically removing
this checks.
