SUBJECT: Re: Analyzing performance and memory consumption for boolean queries
DATE: 24 Jun 2009



another performance tip, waht helps "a lot" is collection sorting before you index. 

if you can somehow logically partition your index, you can improve locality of reference by
sorting. 

What I mean by this:
imagine index with following fields: zip,  user_group, some text  

if typical query on this index contains ZIP and user_group as a MUST fields,  by sorting on
ZIP, user_group before indexing, you will get an index where Lucene does not have to seek
back and forth during search, reducing disk contention. It is quite ok to sort once in a while...
that is a standard trick database admins use.

This improved our average response times by almost factor 2 on FSDisk. Of course, depends
on your index distribution, but if you have a lot of categorical variables that segment your
collection logically, it is worth trying.
