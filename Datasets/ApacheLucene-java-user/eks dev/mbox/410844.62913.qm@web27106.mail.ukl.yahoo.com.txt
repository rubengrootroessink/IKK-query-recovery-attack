You omitNorms(), did you also omitTf()? 

when something like https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1345 gets commited, you will
have a posibility to see some benefits (e.g. by packing single postings lists as Filters).
The code there optimises exactly that case as filters contain no Scoring information ...
