The simplest sorting would be to sort your collection before indexing, because Lucene will
preserve order of added documents  I think nutch sorts index afterward somehow, but I do not
know how this works

 
by omitTf() I mean the new feature in the trunk version, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1340
