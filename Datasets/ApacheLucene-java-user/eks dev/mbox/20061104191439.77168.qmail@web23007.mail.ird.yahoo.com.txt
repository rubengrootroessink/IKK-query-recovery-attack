I would strongly suggest not storing these fields in lucene, just keep them as files and store
some kind of url to get them latter. that will boost your speed heavily. If you really, really
need to store documents in lucene, try some compression
Also, so many fields hurt performance, any chance you could pack some of them together?

Did you have  a chance to read Lucene in Action, could help you greatly. 

good luck

Subject: Re: How to improve document retrieval speed.

Hi,

I am using Lucene's Remote Parallel Multisearcher with 10 nodes in my search
cluster having 200+ distributed index fragments (1 Index fragment = 4GB). I
have 30+ fields in my index, and I am storing a master XML file (contains 5
to 30 pages of information) in one field. I also  have two web servers
behind a load-balancer.

My system works as follows.

I) When the user search for a document, the search result page will display
3 stored fields from the index (Document Number,Title and Date).

II) On clicking a particular result I am searching again(Since I am using a
load-balancer I can't use the same RemoteSearchable object) for that
particular 'document number' and retrieve the stored master XML from the
index.

The first step is ok with me, but I want to improve the speed in the second
part. Is it necessary to do the scoring and weight calculation in the second
step?

Thanks,
Sunil
