do not forget that Filter does not have to be loaded in memory, not any more since LUECEN-584
commit! Now it is only skipping iterator what you need.


translated, you could use:
ConstantScoreQuery created with Filter made from TermDocs (you need to implement only DocIdSet
/ DocIdSetIterator, this is rally trivial as TermDocs implements next() and skipTo() methods)

If TermDocs is not enough for you you could have a look at the BooleanFilter that will create
only one (Open)BitSet per request if you feed it with TermDocs based Filters... 

Generally, it would be great to have BooleanQuery that Accepts Filters as clauses (infrastructure
is now there thanks to Paul , see LUCENE-584)
