SUBJECT: speed of BooleanQueries on 2.9
DATE: 12 Jul 2009


Is it possible that the same BooleanQuery on 2.9 runs significantly slower than on 2.4?

we have some strange effects where the following query runs approx 4(ouch!) times slower on
2.9, test done by 1000 times executing the same Query... But! if I run test from some real
Query log with mixed Queries, I get almost the same results (?!), even slightly faster on
2.9 !?

The question is just to get some hints where I should look... 

Both fealds are without norms, omitTf(true) , RAMDirectory, using 
TopDocs top = ixSearcher.search(q, null, getMaxNumOfCandidates());
and BooleanQuery.setAllowDocsOutOfOrder(true);

maybe we made some mistakes on measuring, but we did simple timing here on search() method...
strange. I would bet it is something we did, but I cannot see where ...
