try:
1.  query-string: "hello +area:home"  to get Filtering effect

2. to minimize scoring use boosts: "(hello)^HIGH_BOOST +(area:home)^LOW_BOOST"

3. If scoring via boosts does not work good enough for you, or is slow, use Filter interface
from your code... search this list for Filter

Subject: Search precondition: matching area

Hello LuceneList,

I've got at least following fields in my index:

  AREA = "home news business"
  CONTENTS = "... hello world ..."

If I submit the query

  query-string: "hello area:home"

Lucene should only search these documents which has the matching area.
Actually Lucene searches the area, but it should

  NOT return results if the area doesn't match --> actually Lucene
searches also in the other fields for the area - indeed with less
rating - but they are returned.
  NOT include a matching area to the rating
In other words: The area shouldn't handled like a standard search able
field, more like a precondition if the query should be applied.

Additionally: If I submit no area

 e.g. query-string: "hello"

the query should be applied as it would have a matching area.


Any help would be appreciated,
Best Regards,
David
