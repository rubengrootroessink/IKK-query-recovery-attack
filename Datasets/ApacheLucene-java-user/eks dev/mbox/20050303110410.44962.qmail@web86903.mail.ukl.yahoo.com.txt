SUBJECT: Not storing norms and term positions info, possible?
DATE: 3 Mar 2005

Hi,
Is there a way to create index which does not store
norms (.f..) and Positions (.prx files)?

In the case I need to support, no length normalisation
is needed, the same is with positional info.
(Similarity.encodeNorms(float) returns 0; and
Term.SetPositionalIncrement(0) is used)

>From the size of these files I speculate a lot of io
should have happened during indexing. 

Does that make sense?

thanks, Eks
