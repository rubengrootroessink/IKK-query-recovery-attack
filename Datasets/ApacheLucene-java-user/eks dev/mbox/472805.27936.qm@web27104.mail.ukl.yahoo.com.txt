SUBJECT: OOM with 2.9
DATE: 12 Jul 2009


Hi,
We just upgraded to 2.9 and noticed some (to me) not expected OOM.

We use MMapDirectory and after upgrade, on exactly the same Index/machine/jvm/params/setup...
we cannot start index as mapping screams "No memory"

any explanation why this could be the case?
