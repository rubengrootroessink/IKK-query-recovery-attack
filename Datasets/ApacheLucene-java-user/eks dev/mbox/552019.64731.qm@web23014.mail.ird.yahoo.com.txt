DATE: 16 Apr 2008

NGrams will do ok, 
depends a lot on what you are up to, if there is a person looking at result lists making decision,
it will work fine as default TF/IDF similarity will give you ok order of hits, but if you
need to set some cutoff value to decide automatically if this is a match or not, then you
should start digging deeper into record linkage theory.

also, if you need to do deduplication and you have a lot of records then this is going to
be slow, e.g you have 20Mio documents means you need to make 20 Mio searches .... there you
need to pull some  tricks 

and finally, make your analyzers smart, normalize data, remove noise like "Mr. Dr, senior...",
lowercase, punctuation, spec characters... standard 

have fun, this is nice problem, looks simple at first sight, but is not!  I've spent last
6 years doing this like this at 500Mio+ documets scale   and is fun, Lucene helps a lot ther,
this is nice inverted index lib :)
