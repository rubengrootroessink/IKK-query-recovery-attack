This is windows/jvm issue . Have a look at how ant is dealing with it, maybe we could give
it a try with something like that (I have not noticed ant having problems).

We are not able to reproduce this in our environment systematically, so it would be great
if you could patch your lucene with this trick and let us know how it goes.
delete/rename->System.gc()->Thread.sleap()->delete/rename Again  


    /**
     * Accommodate Windows bug encountered in both Sun and IBM JDKs.
     * Others possible. If the delete does not work, call System.gc(),
     * wait a little and try again.
     */
    private boolean delete(File f) {
        if (!f.delete()) {
             System.gc();
            try {
                Thread.sleep(DELETE_RETRY_SLEEP_MILLIS);
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
                // Ignore Exception
            }
            if (!f.delete()) {
                if (deleteOnExit) {
                    int level = quiet ? Project.MSG_VERBOSE : Project.MSG_INFO;
                    log("Failed to delete " + f + ", calling deleteOnExit."
                        + " This attempts to delete the file when the Ant jvm"
                        + " has exited and might not succeed.", level);
                    f.deleteOnExit();
                    return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

I agree Lucene should not be affected by things like having Windows 
Explorer windows up!

Can you post the traceback you're seeing?  In particular, what's failing 
about the fallback approach?

Is it in the FSDirectory's renameFile method?  There is this comment in 
there:

     // Rename the old file to the new one. Unfortunately, the renameTo()
     // method does not work reliably under some JVMs.  Therefore, if the
     // rename fails, we manually rename by copying the old file to the 
new one

and correspondingly this comment in the original commit for this (back 
on March 1 2003):

- Added a manual renaming of files in case the java.io.File's renameTo(File)
   call fails.  It has been reported that this happens on Windows JVMs.
