SUBJECT: integration of lucene into opencms
DATE: 28 Mar 2007

I have integrated lucene to search into files i tried that in the
jsp-examples like that

1st step
Indexation des fichiers de JSP-examples

C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat
5.5\webapps\luceneweb\WEB-INF
\lib>java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles "C:\Program Files\Apache
Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\jsp-examples"

2nd step
Research in files

C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat
5.5\webapps\luceneweb\WEB-INF
\lib>java org.apache.lucene.demo.SearchFiles
Query: Hello World Tag
Searching for: hello world tag
80 total matching documents

all right

but when i tried to use the same principle to integrate lucene in opencms
the 1st step does n't work because the web site i want to index does nt
exist physically so the path should be like this "
http://localhost/opencms/opencms/site_directory/index.html"
an error message show "path inreadble"

if someone have an idea about integrating lucene into opencms and a
specially into a specific folder i have created from the workspace!!!

can i give to the lucene a web path as a origin of searsh
