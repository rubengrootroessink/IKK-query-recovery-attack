Hi,

I have read some posts in user/developer archives about Lucene-based
document similarity comparison. In summary there are two approaches are
mentioned:

1 - Construct document to a query;
2 - Calculate each document to be a vector, then rank accoring to their
distance (cosine).

Do they produce same ranking results? Is there any other way to do so?
I guess the 2nd approach will be more precise but slow.

Thanks.

Jing
