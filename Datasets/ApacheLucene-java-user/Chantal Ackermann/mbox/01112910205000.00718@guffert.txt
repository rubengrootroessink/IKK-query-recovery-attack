hi Ian, hi Winton, hi all,

sorry I meant heap size of 100Mb. I'm  starting java with -Xmx100m. I'm not 
setting -Xms.

For what I know now, I had a bug in my own code. still I don't understand 
where these OutOfMemoryErrors came from. I will try to index again in one 
thread without RAMDirectory just to check if the program is sane.

the problem that the files get to big while merging remains. I wonder why 
there is not the possibility to tell lucene not to create files that are 
bigger than the system limit. how am i supposed to know after how many 
documents this limit is reached? lucene creates the documents - i just know 
the average size of a piece of text that is the input for a document. or am I 
missing something?!
