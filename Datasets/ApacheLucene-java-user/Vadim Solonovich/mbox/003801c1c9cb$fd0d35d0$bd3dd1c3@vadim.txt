Hi !

Sorry for delay in answer.
Recently I have found that Russian and Ukrainian stemmer for Lucene can be implemented based
on Andrew Kovalenko (http://linguist.nm.ru)  stem library, which is free. Though it is not
100% pure Java solution, this library is compiled on multiple platforms  and will be available
soon on SourceForge. Andrew Kovalenko's code works in many russian projects such as Aport
search engine, Rambler and MediaLingua products. So I think of using his code in my own project
 in common with Lucene.

And now I have a question. Does anybody know how to deal with multiple word stems  in Lucene
? 

Thanks in advance.
