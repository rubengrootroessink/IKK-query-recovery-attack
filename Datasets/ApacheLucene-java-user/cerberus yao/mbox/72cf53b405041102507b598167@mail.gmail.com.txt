SUBJECT: Lucene Search Result with Line Numbers?
DATE: 11 Apr 2005

Hi, Lucene users:

  Does anyone knows how to add the Lucene search results with Line
number in original source content?
  for example:
     I have a file "Test.java" which is indexed by lucene.
     When I search inside the index, how to enhance the search result
with line number in Test.java?

  ps. the lucene sandbox has a highlighter for search result. where
can I find a line number decorator for search results?

 Thx.
 Best regards,
