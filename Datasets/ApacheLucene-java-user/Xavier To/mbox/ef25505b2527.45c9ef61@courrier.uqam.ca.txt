Thanks Erik and Erick,

I guess my question was rather unclear, but you guys answered it all the same : it is impossible
for an analyzer to index something and having the same analyzer ignore the thing indexed during
a search. 

If it makes everything clearer, during indexation, numbers  are indexed, whether or not they
are accompanied by letters ( 2003 and 4wd are both indexed). That's fine, since we want this.
 The problem occurs when I try to search for them : They are ignored. I know they are indexed
because I ran through the index using Luke. 

Any thoughts regarding this problem ?
