SUBJECT: Question concerning Analyzers
DATE: 7 Feb 2007

Hi, me again

I'm still stuck with my search engine, but something popped in my head : Can an analyzer index
something but ignore it during a search ? I'm asking this because now that I've been searching
for an answer, I've come to think that I should redo the whole search engine, but I don't
want to reproduce the same error as we have now. It would be stupid to accidentaly redo the
same mistake. I still haven't received news from my seniors about me posting code and all...
