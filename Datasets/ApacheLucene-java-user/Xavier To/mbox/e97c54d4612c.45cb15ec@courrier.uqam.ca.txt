Hey !

I tried using WhitespaceAnalyzer during the search and it works. I refactored the tokenizing
process so it uses TokenStream instead of StringTokenizer and it works fine for one thing
: the query "this is a test" becomes "thisisatest". I fixed it by adding a space after each
token except for the last one, but is there a clean way to do it ? I'm using WhitespaceTokenizer.

Thanks a bunch !
