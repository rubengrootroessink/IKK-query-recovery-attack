use absolute, it is easiest. if you use relative your implementation will
rely on what dir the program is started from..

absolutely absolute path as you might never know where your webapp-container
will place your webapp. On tomcat it's relatively easy as it will be in the
same directory as your .war file. but on say jboss the container will place
your webapp a totally other place.

your webapp might find the placement of the webapp in the container by using
the "getServletContext().getRealPath("");" function. but this path is
ofcourse not know for you when you create the index on command line....
