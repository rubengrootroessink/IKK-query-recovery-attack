SUBJECT: wildcards in fieldname
DATE: 7 Feb 2002

Hi, I am trying to create contextual search for SGML/XML documents and have
an idea about a indexer and a query like this:

- all elements(tags) are stored like /PATH/TO/ELEMENT=text
- all attributes are stored like ATTR_NAME@/PATH/TO/ELEMENT=value


Then I want to construct queries like:

- */CHAPTER:mandrake

to find all "CHAPTER" elements with the text "mandrake"


- */BSECTION/CHAPTER:mandrake

to find all "CHAPTER" elements within all "BSECTION" elements with the text
"mandrake"


- AUTHOR@*/ASECTION/CHAPTER:karl

to find all "CHAPTER" elements within all "ASECTION" elements that was
written by "karl"


The building of the index is perfectly possible but expensive. But is it
possible to match fieldnames with wildcards?

Any pointers are appreciated!


mvh karl oie
