Chris,

Thanks for your reply. I'm currently evaluating different products for full 
text search. I visited DBSight web site briefly. Basically, I have a main 
table which has a number of fields for Ids from look-up tables, for example 
category_id, brand_id, product_id etc. Main table also has a description and 
detail columns. After user types a number of keywords in a text box. My 
query needs to search category table, brand table, product table, main table 
etc. to see if anything matches. If matching, need to retrieve the record 
from main table.

I didn't see this kind of example at DBsight web site. I'm just wondering if 
DBSight can do that.

Thanks,
Tony
