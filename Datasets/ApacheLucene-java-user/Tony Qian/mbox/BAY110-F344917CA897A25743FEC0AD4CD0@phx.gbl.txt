SUBJECT: full text search using Lucene
DATE: 11 Apr 2006

All,

I'm working on a project which requires full text search on multiple tables 
in MySql database. Although, MySql supports full text search, it only 
supports full text search on signle table. I'm wondering if Lucene can help 
me to do full text search against MySql database. (I noticed that DBSight is 
built on top of Lucene.)

Any suggestion and links pointing to examples and tutorial are appreaciated.

Tony
