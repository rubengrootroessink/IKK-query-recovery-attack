All,

After playing around with Lucene, we decided to replace old full-text search 
engine with Lucene. I got "Lucene in Action" a week ago and finished reading 
most of the book. I got several questions.

1) Since the book was written two years ago and Lucene has made a lot of 
changes, is there any plan for 2nd edition? (I guess this question is for 
Otis and Erik, btw, it is a great book.)

2) I have two processes for indexing. one runs every 5 minutes to add new 
contents into an existing index. Another one runs daily to rebuild entire 
index which also handles removing old contents. After rebuild process 
finishes indexing, we'd like to replace the index built by first process 
(every 5 minutes) with index built by second process. How do i do it safely 
and also avoid duplicating or missing documents (It is possible that first 
process is still adding documents to the index when we try to replace it 
with second one).
NOTE: both processes retrieve data from same database.

3) we are doing indexing on a master server and push index data to slave 
servers. In order to make new data visible to client, we have to close 
IndexSearcher and open it after new data is coped over. We use web based 
application (servlet) as search interface, creating a IndexSearcher as an 
instance variable for all clients. My question is what will happen to 
clients if I close IndexSearcher while clients are still doing search. How 
to safely update index when client are searching?

4) Lucene caches first 100 hits in memmory. We decided to use requery to 
return search results back to clients. For first 100 documents, i can 
iterator through "Hits". Do i have to use doc(n) to retrive documents for 
any documents > 100? Any performance issues?

Thanks in advance for help,
Tony
