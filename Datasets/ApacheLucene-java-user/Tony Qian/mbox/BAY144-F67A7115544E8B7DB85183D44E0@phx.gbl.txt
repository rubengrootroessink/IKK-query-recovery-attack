Erick,

Thanks for your explaination. I thought using HitCollector. The search 
interface we are facing now actually is pretty simple. One of the search 
requires maximum of search results of 500 and page size is 500 (basically 
return first 500). Second one requires max of 250 and page size is 25. At 
this time, we are ok even we have to hit query several times.

I see one problem with HitCollector, which is HitCollector caches a huge 
data if the document is very large. One best of implementation (I think) is 
client passes in a page number and page size in search method, Lucene 
returns documents on that page instead of always returns first 100 
documents.

I haven't  looked at Lucene code yet and don't know how hard to implement 
that.

Tony
