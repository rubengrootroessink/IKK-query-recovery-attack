SUBJECT: Re: searching data indexed from database??
DATE: 31 May 2003

Take a look at org.apache.lucene.queryParse.MultiFieldQueryParser.  It 
allows you to past a list of field names to search on rather than just a 
single field name.

Regarding your second question, the query you specified works fine in 
1.3 RC 1 although I am not familiar enough with 1.2 to know whether it 
was supported there or not.

Sincerely,
Anthony Eden
