SUBJECT: Re: What could be the table structure
DATE: 3 Jul 2003

I wrote a Directory implementation which allows you to store indeces in 
a database.  Currently I have only tested it on MySQL but you should be 
able to get it to work on SQL Server I imagine.  If you do then please 
send me a copy of the DB schema to add in.  If you can't get it to work 
then please send an email and I'll try to help you out.
