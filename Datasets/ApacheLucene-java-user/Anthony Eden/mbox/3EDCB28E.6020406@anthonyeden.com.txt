SUBJECT: Re: Field where the search term has been found?
DATE: 3 Jun 2003

I cannot find a way to do this via the API.

In addition to knowing which fields matched it would be good to be able 
to say where the match position starts and ends in each field.  This 
would make it easy to display search results with highlighted terms.

Sincerely,
Anthony Eden
