I had the same problem as Brian. But since you have to rewrite the query
anyway to do a query in two different fields it makes no difference if you
use term or field boosting. Performance is the same.
For new applications I'd say field boosting is a little simpler because you
save on some commands during the query rewriting phase. Since I already had
written that when field boosting came up, for me there is no difference.

Btw. I changed the query classes to allow query rewriting. I made them
Cloneable and added setter methods for them. If there's interest I'll
contribute the patches asap.
