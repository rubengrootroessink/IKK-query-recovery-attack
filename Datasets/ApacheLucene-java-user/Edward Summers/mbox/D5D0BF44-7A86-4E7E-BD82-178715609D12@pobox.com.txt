SUBJECT: large index sizes
DATE: 20 Sep 2005

I'm investigating possible alternatives for indexing/searching a very  
large dataset (2TB) of xml data from the pubmed  database[1]. Does  
anyone have any experience working with indexes of this size? Granted  
the actual index size would be smaller than the source files, but I'm  
just curious how big the largest known lucene indexes are, and what  
sort of hardware they run on...assuming they're not behind closed  
doors at the Dept of Homeland Security ;-)
