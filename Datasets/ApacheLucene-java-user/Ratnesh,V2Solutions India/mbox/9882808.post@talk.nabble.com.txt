DATE: 7 Apr 2007


Hi,
I am trying like this in my code but  control is going in catch instead of
try block

else {
			//if (LOG.isInfoEnabled())
				//LOG.info("Document " + url + " has no OBJECT links.");
				try{
					//LOG.info("Document " + url + " has no OBJECT links.");
					surl1=url.toString();
										
				String indexDir="E:\\eclipse\\310307\\objtest\\crawl-result\\index";
				FSDirectory directory = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexDir,true);
				//LOG.info("Document " + directory + " is the  DIRECTORY VALUES.");
				IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(directory);
				if(true){
				System.out.println("The value of Deleted Document is " +directory);
				Term term = new Term("url", surl1);
			    int deleted = reader.deleteDocuments(term);
			    
				}
				directory.close();
			    reader.close();
				}
				catch(Exception e){System.out.println("Exception Found In Block");}
				
				//IndexReader ir=new IndexReader(dir);
				//setNonObjectUrl(surl1);
				//return surl1;
		}

		return doc;

can you brief me where did I go wrong??
