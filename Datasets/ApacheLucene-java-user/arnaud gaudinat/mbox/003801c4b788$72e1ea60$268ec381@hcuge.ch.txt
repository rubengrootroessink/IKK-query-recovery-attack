SUBJECT: index files version and lucene 1.4
DATE: 21 Oct 2004

Hi,
Certainly  a stupid question!
I have just upgraded to 1.4, I have succeeded to access my 1.3 index files
but not my new 1.4 index files.
In fact I have no error, but no hits for 1.4 index files. More, I don't
know if it's normal but now I have just 3 files for my index (.cfs,
deletable and segments).
However if I use Luke with the 1.4 index files, It works perfectly.

An idea?

Regards,

Arno.
