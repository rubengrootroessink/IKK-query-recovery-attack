You need to increase the memory for java. I think 32-bit jave is limited 
to a 1.3 gig heap but could be wrong. No heuristics at the tip of my 
fingers.

To make the spell checker smaller you can prune the tokens using the
pruneLM method in the TrainSpellChecker. Pruning the 1 counts should 
make a big difference and not hurt spelling too much (depends on how 
things are paramterized). Probably up to 5 counts won't matter.

Also look at my tuning tutorial that is in very rough shape but will
get you going on tuning at:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@alias-i.com:/usr/local/sandbox co 
querySpellCheckTuner

I will try to get another pass at it over the weekend.
