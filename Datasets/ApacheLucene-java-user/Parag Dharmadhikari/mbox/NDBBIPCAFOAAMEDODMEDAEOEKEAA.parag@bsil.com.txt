Thanx Otis,

My question is I will create only sigle index from root directory having
subdirectories and files. Now can I use this single index for selective
searching i.e. I will pass any subdirectory path for the created index so
that I can search on those files only which resides in the supplied
subdirectory path and excluding other files under other directories.

Hope my question now makes sense,

Thanx again,

regards
parag

Parag,

I'm not sure if I understood your question correctly, but it seems like
you want to create a Field that holds the path information (e.g.
TEST/subdir1 or TEST/subdir2, and so on), and then include that in the
query based on which path(s) you want to search.
You could use TEST to search just TEST, TEST/subdir1 to search just
TEST/subdir1, or TEST* to search everything under TEST.
