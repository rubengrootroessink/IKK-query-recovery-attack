Hi all

In my application if I serach on alphbet "e" only then I get right result but if I search
on "t" then it is not showing any result. Now there will be many common words like "to" or
"the" which should be shown in the searching. and more intrestingly if i search with wildcard
like "t*" then it gives me the results. Why this inconsistencay?? 

Thanks

regards
parag
