SUBJECT: how to update index
DATE: 2 Apr 2002

Hi all,

As I know there is no direct method for updating the index, so I have to delete the index
first and then add the new entries in the index.I tried to find my answer in  the mailing
list but could not found my answer.
Now If I want to do above procedure then how exactly should I go? Is there any other way of
updatng the index?

regards
Parag
