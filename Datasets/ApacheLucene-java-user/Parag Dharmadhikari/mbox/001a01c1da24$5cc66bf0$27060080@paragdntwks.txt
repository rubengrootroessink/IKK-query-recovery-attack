Thanks For reply

I have checked on jguru and found some helpful links.
Now if I want to delete then I have to use method as
"IndexReader.delete(Term)".
But my question is before deleting the index I have to add the document to
the index and then I will delete the index.
but can please anybody will show me the way how to add the document using
Term(I have saw the APIs but still not clear about it).

regards
Parag
