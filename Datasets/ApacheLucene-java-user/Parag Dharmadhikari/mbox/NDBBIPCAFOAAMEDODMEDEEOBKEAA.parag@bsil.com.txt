SUBJECT: About indexing
DATE: 11 Jan 2002

Hi all,

If I will create the index of files in different thread (which may be
invoked at any time)then is it possible to index on files from the root
directory and then selectively search on the different path on created
index.

For example first I will index from root directiory say , TEST. Then
depending on the selected directory path (which will be resides inside the
root directory TEST) I will search on the created index.

Thanx in advance

regards
parag
