SUBJECT: setting problem for lucene
DATE: 26 Oct 2001

Hi all,

I am facing one problem with Lucene search.
My code is perfectly working fine on my local machine but when I try to run
the sane code on the Tomacat-Jakarta (version 3.2.3) then it gives me the
FileNotFoundException for the directory I am trying to search.

I have copied the directory structure under the root in the tomcat server
and lucene jar file to the lib of server.

I guess , I missing some kind of settings required for the server.

Can anybody help me on this issue???

Regards
parag
