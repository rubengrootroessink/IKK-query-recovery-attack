SUBJECT: printing file in html format??
DATE: 9 Nov 2001

Hi all,

This question may not be directly related to the lucene but still I would
like to put up this question as it could help me a great deal.

How should I show the file (of any type like word or excel) in the html
format which make it compatible throughout the any type of browser. Does
lucene provides any type of help to solve my problem?

Regards
parag
