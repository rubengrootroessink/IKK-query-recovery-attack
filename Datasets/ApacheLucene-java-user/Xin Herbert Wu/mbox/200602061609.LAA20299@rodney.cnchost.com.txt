DATE: 6 Feb 2006

The Luke search worked on the index files. But my query client may be not
built correctly. Upon further test, I supplied an UnStored field in library
B with a guaranteed value - white space(previously it sometimes has new
StringBuffer().toString() empty value).  This makes my query client works
for now. But I will further look into my code and figure out the reason.
Thanks a lot!

I recommend you take a look at your indexes with Luke and see what  
actually is indexed.
