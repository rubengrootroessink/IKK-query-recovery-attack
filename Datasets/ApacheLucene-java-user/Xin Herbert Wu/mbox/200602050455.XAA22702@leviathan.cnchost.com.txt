SUBJECT: Field search problem(only single word query works)
DATE: 5 Feb 2006

Hi,

I have two libraries A and B indexed from database tables where A has about
10 fields and B has about 30 fields(with about a couple of hundred records).
A and B both have a TEXT type field "headline" reading data from the same
database table column. 

 

However the field query - "headline: fire water" works for library A, NOT
for library B(returns 0 results without any error) when the headline field
value is "fire and water". But query "headline:fire headline:water" does
work for library B. 

 

Any possible reason why library B only accepts single word fielded query?

 

I am running Lucene 1.4.3 on Java 5/JBoss4.0.3 in XP/Linux environment. 

 

Thanks.

 

-Xin
