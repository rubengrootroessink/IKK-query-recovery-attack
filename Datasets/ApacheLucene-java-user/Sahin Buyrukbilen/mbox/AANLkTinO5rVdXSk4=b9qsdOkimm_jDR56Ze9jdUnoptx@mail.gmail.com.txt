SUBJECT: how to index large number of files?
DATE: 20 Oct 2010

Hi all,

I have to index about 4.5Million txt files. When I run the my indexing
application through Eclipse, I get this error : "Exception in thread "main"
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"

eclipse -vmargs -Xmx2000m -Xss8192k

eclipse -vmargs -Xms40M -Xmx2G

 I tried running Eclipse with above memory parameters, but still had the
same error. The architecture of my computer is AMD x2 64bit 2GHz processor,
Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 64bit. java-6-openjdk.

Anybody has a suggestion?

thank you.
Sahin.
