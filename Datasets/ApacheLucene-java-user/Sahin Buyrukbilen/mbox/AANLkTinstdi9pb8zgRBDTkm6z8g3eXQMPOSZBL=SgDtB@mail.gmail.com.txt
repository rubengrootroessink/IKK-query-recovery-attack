SUBJECT: How to get the score of a term in a document?
DATE: 1 Oct 2010

Hi all,

I need to retrieve the score of a term in a document? I dont want to play
different scoring schemes. I just checked my index with Luke and it shows me
a score for each term in each document the term exists. So, I need just to
get that score.

Can anybody help me?

Thank you in advance.

Sahin.
