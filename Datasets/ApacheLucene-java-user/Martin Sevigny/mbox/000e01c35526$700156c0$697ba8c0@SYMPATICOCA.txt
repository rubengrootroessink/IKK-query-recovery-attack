Exponentially? Would be surprising.

When you add documents, I think these factors will make your index
larger :

- you add new terms => this tends to disappear with the increase in
documents indexed if your data is in only one language for instance
- you add new references to documents with terms => should not grow
exponentially, no?
- you add new contents in stored fields : this shoud be proportional to
the number of documents, and since you only have one stored field...

I've seen indices being somewhat around 20% larger than the data
indexed, with a few stored fields, for a few thousand documents indexed.

I'm still not convinced that you don't have a problem somewhere else. I
did'nt inspect your code, but are you sure that you are not indexing
data more than once? Or storing lots of fields?
