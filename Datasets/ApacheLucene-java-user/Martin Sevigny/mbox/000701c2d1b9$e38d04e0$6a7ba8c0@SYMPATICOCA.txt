Well SDX (an XML search engine based on both Cocoon and Lucene, see
http://sdx.culture.fr and http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/sdx/) does
that.

See in particular the class
fr.gouv.culture.sdx.search.lucene.highlight.LuceneTermHighlighter, or
the demo application (sdxworld) with an example of its use.
