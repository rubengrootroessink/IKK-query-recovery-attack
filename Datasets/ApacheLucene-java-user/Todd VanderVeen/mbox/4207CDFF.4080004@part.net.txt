SUBJECT: Storage Cost of Indexed, Untokenized Fields
DATE: 7 Feb 2005

Is there an additional storage cost to flagging an untokenized, indexed 
field as stored? Is the flag just for indicating that it be returned in 
result sets? I assume storage for tokenized fields is managed 
separately, but am curious if untokenized fields are resolved from the 
native index structure?

Thanks,
Todd VanderVeen
