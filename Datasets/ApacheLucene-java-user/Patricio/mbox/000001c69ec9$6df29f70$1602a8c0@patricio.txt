SUBJECT: QueryTerms vs. IndexTerms
DATE: 3 Jul 2006

Hello, I'm novice in Java.
I try to understand how the query terms are matched with the index terms to
calculate the Hits.

I thought that the class "IndexSearcher" was responsible for this process,
but apparently the classes "Scorer" and "HitCollector" are essential to
determine the retrieved documents.

I looked for this information in "Lucene in Action", but unfortunately I
couldn't find enough details (in Chapter 3.2) about this topic.
 
Does somebody know where takes place (source code) this comparison?

Thank You in advance
Best regards,
Patricio

PS: I'm using Lucene 2.0.0.
