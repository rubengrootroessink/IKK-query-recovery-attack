SUBJECT: Re: Changing the Punctuation definition for StandardAnalyzer
DATE: 21 Dec 2007

I actually hadn't implemented the TokenFilter solution before deciding not
to go with that solution, so didn't have any benchmark.

But eventually I have taken care of this problem with a different
variation of your quick and dirty solution. I have captured the character
'@' in FastCharStream.java, and replaced it with a blank space. That took
care of it.

Thanks for your help!
