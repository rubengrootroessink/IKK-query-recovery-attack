Thanks again! The analyzer is working now. But seems like actually the
QueryParser I am using is probably converting the queries to lowercase
first. Is there any way to stop that? Here is the line of code where I am
parsing:

Query query = QueryParser.parse(line, "contents", analyzer);

As for analyzer, I have tried both StardaAnalyzer and StopAnalyzer.
