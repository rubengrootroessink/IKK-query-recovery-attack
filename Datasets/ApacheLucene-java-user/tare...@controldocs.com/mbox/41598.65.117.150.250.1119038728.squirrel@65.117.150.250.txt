SUBJECT: discrepancy in the number of hits
DATE: 17 Jun 2005

I just installed lucene for full text search,since mysql was too slow at
that. But I see, for same query (e.g. 'information') lucene is returning a
slightly fewer number of documents than mySQL. I checked the docs missing
from the result set and found that those documents actually contain the
word 'information' but lucene is not returning them anyway. Is it a known
issue? Any way around?

Thanks
Tareque
