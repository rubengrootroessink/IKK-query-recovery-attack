The CFQ scheduler is the default in Red Hat Enterprise 4 and recent
Fedoras (3 and 4 IIRC). My FC4 system is usable even with processes like
'updatedb' running.

Maybe give one of those OSes a try and see what performance is like?

Pertaining to the OP, if CFQ isn't sufficient to keep one NFS process
from hogging the disk, I would take a look at bandwidth shaping (the tc
and iptables utilities, assuming you are on Linux).
