DATE: 27 Aug 2010

Hi,

I mean to say ..if I want to query like "Solr rocks" with Surround query
then I have to explicitly pass slop like "Solr 1w rocks"
I want to implement this logic in code so user can only enter "solr
rocks"..so internally  default operator (1w) will be added inbetween two
words.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Jagdish
