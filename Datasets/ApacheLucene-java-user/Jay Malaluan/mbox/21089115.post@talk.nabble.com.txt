SUBJECT: Stemming behavior
DATE: 19 Dec 2008


Hi,

I'm using the SnowballAnalyzer for my stemming processing.
search words: love, loved, loveliness, loveless, lovely, and loving

On my index I have the word love. The behavior during searching is that it
can't correctly stem the two words loveliness, loveless to love. And the odd
thing is loveliness is stemmed to "loveli" and loveless is not stemmed at
all.

Does anyone already encountered this and have suggestions on other
Analyzers?


Regards,
Jay Malaluan
