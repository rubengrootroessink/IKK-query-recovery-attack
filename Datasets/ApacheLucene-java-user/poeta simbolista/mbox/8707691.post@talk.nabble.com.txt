Thanks for your reply.
I am working with an index which is created separately. It is created with a
StandardTokenizer.
I have read there should be used the same tokenizer which the index was
created with.
Anyway, I have tried other tokenizers while consulting, such as the
WhitespaceTokenizer, but the same results happen.
So, does it boil down to the tokenizer which the index was created with? 

Thanks a lot.

Ps. Yes, I was using Luke which works great. But anyway, things like <* dont
work in any analyser -- don give me any results, although searching in the
db gives me loads -- and also i can get those results (via searching other
fields) on luke and i can see the text is there, the < and > are there.
