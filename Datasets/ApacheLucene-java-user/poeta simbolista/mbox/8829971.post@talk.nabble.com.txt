SUBJECT: deviations
DATE: 6 Feb 2007


Hi, 
I would like to query results, regarding results.
For example, get those results whose field "size" is 2 standard deviations
from the median.

It looks like sth I should do myself, processing results first, getting the
median, and then calculate that threshold and perform a new query. Is it
however, sth there that may help with that?

Thank you
