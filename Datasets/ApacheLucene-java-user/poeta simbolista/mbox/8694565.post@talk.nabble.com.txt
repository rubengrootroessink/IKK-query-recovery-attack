SUBJECT: Problems with some characters
DATE: 29 Jan 2007


Hi there, this is my very first post at this forum... please be considerate
:)

Well, i have a problem when sending a query such as:

+description:<

Once the query is parsed, it returns me the empty String, which means the
String "<" that i want to search for on the field description is ignored.
If i use normal words then it is taken. Do you know why this could be? 

Thanks.
