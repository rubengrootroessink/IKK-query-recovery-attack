SUBJECT: FieldCacheImpl not "extendible"
DATE: 14 Feb 2007


Hi,
I have been diving into the code and I don't see why the class
FieldCacheImpl is not extendible. It is not defined as a public class...
though, I would like to be able to subclass it to change a slight bit.

Why is it defined like that?
Thanks
