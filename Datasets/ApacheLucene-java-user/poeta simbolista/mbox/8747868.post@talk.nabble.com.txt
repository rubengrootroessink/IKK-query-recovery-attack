SUBJECT: Use of only a prohibit search
DATE: 1 Feb 2007


HI guys,
I've read on 
http://www.nabble.com/Using-NOT-queries-inside-parentheses-tf1234775.html#a3272973
this  forum about the problem of using, for example, only a prohibit search
such as

-description:plot

I really would like to get this done on a good manner, I am constructing
queries where elements may vary greatly. 
I am using 1.9.1 at the moment. Is the solution provided in the post I
linked still the best one "nowadays" (it was stated for 1.4) ?  I find that
a bit "hacky" for such an operation, though...

Thanks a lot!
 D
