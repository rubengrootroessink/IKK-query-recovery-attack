SUBJECT: query problem: grouping "with same field"
DATE: 6 Feb 2007


Hi all,

First of all thanks for this forum, I have read stuff that helped me a lot.
Second, I would like to query a Lucene index in this way:
I want to do operations on groups of entries. These entries I want them to
be grouped by a field, (called websiteid), so the queries will only go to
those listings.
What would it be the best approach for this?
Thanks a lot
 D
