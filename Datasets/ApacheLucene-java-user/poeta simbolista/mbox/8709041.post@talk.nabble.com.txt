SUBJECT: Why this query is not correct?
DATE: 30 Jan 2007


Hi guys,
I have been through the docs and I can't see why the parser does not parse
this correctly:

description:*sql

is not correct:

Lexical error at line 1, column 16.  Encountered: "*" (42), after : ""

However, the following:

description: sql* 

is correct.
Any idea why you can't use wildcard there?
Cheers
 D
