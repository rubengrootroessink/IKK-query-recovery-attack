Cool.
Thanks!

BTW, I have another issue here.
The array of floats for the Float cache is not initialised. Which means that
it will return '0.0' (not initialised) as the value for those documents that
have a '0' as the value, as well as for those ones that do not have the
field.
  In my actual system I do not want that and I have worked it out by
modifying the code from FieldCacheImpl.
  i suggest it could be defined a (e.g.) NOT_FOUND_FLOAT_VALUE, modifiable,
so it does not necessarily have to be 0. And used for initialise the array
of floats before processing (or do it on the loop if better performance can
be reached).
  I have set it to Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
Cheers
