Hi...

This may/may not have anything to do with Lucene/Nutch, but I figured I'd
ask/post anyway.

I'm working on a project, dealing with courses/classes on college sites. I'm
trying to figure out how to create an automated process where I can create a
process to link a given faculty member to a given class..

The issue arises where a class will have an instructor. However, there might
be multiple instructors with the same name listed in the faculty/staff
directory for the college. I'm interested in various/different approaches to
solving this issue. My hope is that someone here might have a
pointer.reference to areas that I can examine/research to figure this out..

Thanks in advance for any assistance with this issue.

Thanks
