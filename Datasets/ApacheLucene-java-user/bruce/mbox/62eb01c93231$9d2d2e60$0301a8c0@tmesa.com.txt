as someone who's posted, and replied to other project requests on other
sites, if you're not apamming... then i'd say go ahead!!

in this day/time, when you don't know if your job is safe next week, who's
really going to frown upon a potentially serious project/offer...

just be cool on the spamming aspect, and you should be ok!!

Generally, people just throw out the request to the list and no one
really complains, but I do think its frowned upon. I'm sure someone else
can give the 'official' stance (since we are not a job board/list I
assume its against).

You might instead limit your email to those that have agreed to be
contacted at http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/Support
