hi simon....

like a hole in my head!!!!

what i really need is a way to recursively iterate through a site, and to to
be able to selectively iterate through the 'form' elements on a given page.
ie, if i visually analyze a site and determine that the 1st level (page) has
a form, and i need to set the 1st two elements of the form, i'd like to be
able to somehow perform this function when i crawl through the site as
opposed to every potential combination of the form, or as opposed to only
using the default for the form...

i'd also like to be able to handle forms at lower levels in a similar
manner. this would/should allow the app to return all the required pages.

i could then create the parser(s) to extract information from each page.
although it would be better to actually have the ability to somehow manage
the data extraction from the DOM within the crawling application...

You might also check out an old paper by Kruger, Giles, Lawrence et al. on
a search engine called Deadliner (see here at
http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/papers/CIKM-2000-deadliner.pdf).
Deadliner crawled for Calls for Papers for conferences, using Support
Vector Machines trained to
recognise relevant pages, and then applying sets of regular expressions
to extract information
from the CFP pages.  Lawrence is now with Google, I believe.

Hope this helps,

Simon
