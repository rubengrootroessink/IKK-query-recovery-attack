Hi.

Got a very basic lucene/nutch question.

Assume I have a page that has a form. Within the form are a number of
select/drop-down boxes/etc... In this case, each object would comprise a
variable which would form part of the query string as defined in the form
action. Is there a way for lucene/nutch to go through the process of
building up the actions based on the querystring vars, so that lucene/nutch
can actually search through each possible combination of urls....

Also, is nutch/lucene the right/correct app to use in this scenario? Is
there a better app to handle this kind of potential application/process.

Thanks

-bruce
