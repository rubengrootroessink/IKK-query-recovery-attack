SUBJECT: Websphere and Dark Matter
DATE: 16 Jan 2007

Hi,

Has anyone encountered significant amounts of Websphere Dark Matter
generation when using Lucene?

We have a scenario where a web search app using Lucene causes
Websphere 5.1 allocated memory to grow but not shrink. JProfiler shows
the heap shrinks back ok, leaving the JVM with over 1GB allocated to
the jvm but only 400MB in use. Websphere does not perform a level 2
garbage collection and there is significant dark matter in the
allocated memory.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Rol.
