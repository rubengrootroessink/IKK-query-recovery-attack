Hi John,

I was hoping it would, yes. Does websphere not release memory back to 
the OS when it not longer needs it? I'm concerned that if the memory 
spiked for some reason (indexing a large document) then that would 
hamper the rest of the OS because it'd hold on to far more memory than 
is needed.

Thanks,

Rol.
