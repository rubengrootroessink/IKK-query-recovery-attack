Hi Mark,
Thanks for your inputs.

In our content, we have indexed Author as separate field. We want to expose
a feature to  'browse' the Author list. They can type any author name and do
a locate from there onwards.. While doing that they need to navigate
'previous' & 'next' author list.

e.g AU:Rowling

sample code snippet:
TermEnum browseTermEnum = indexReader.terms(new Term("AU", "rowling"));
 while(browseTermEnum.next()){
  System.out.println( browseTermEnum.term().text());
}

Navigating the next 10 authors is straight foward becuase we do that by
calling browseTermEnum.next(), but we couldn't do previous. I did consider
the approach of all terms while navigation. But the problem is, when we do a
lookup of term like 'rowling', we didn't iterate from the start of the list,
hence we may not have the previous terms..

Any thoughts ?
