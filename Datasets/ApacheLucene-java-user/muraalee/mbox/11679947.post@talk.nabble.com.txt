SUBJECT: TermEnum  - previous() method ?
DATE: 18 Jul 2007


Hi All,
I searched in this forum for anybody looking for need for previous() method
in TermEnum. I found only this link
http://www.nabble.com/How-to-navigate-through-indexed-terms-tf28148.html#a189225

Would it be possible to implement previous() method ? I know i am asking for
quick solution here ;) Just i want to ensure if it not implemented, there
might be a reason. So i can consider alternates approaches to implement
similar feature..

appreciate your thoughts...

Thanks
Murali V
