SUBJECT: Re: How to give a score for all documents?
DATE: 25 Aug 2009

Can you please elaborate more on the use case? Why if a certain document is
irrelevant to a certain query, you'd like to give it a score? Are you
perhaps talking about certain documents which should always appear in search
results, no matter what the query is? And instead of always showing them,
you'd like to give them a "static score", so that they can compete w/ other
docs?

If that's the case, I think you can use a BooleanQuery such that the user
query is added as a clause and then you add another clause (MUST) which is
in fact a MatchAllDocsQuery or something like that which returns a
customized score. It's expensive though as for each query you'll score all
docs in the index.

But I don't think that will help (at least for this use case) since every
relevant document to the query will be added the same score as an
'irrelevant' document, which means the relevant docs will still win, no?
