>From my experience, you shouldn't have any problems indexing that amount of
content even into one index. I've successfully indexed 450 GB of data w/
Lucene, and I believe it can scale much higher if rich text documents are
indexed. Though I haven't tried yet, I believe it can scale into the 1-5 TB
domain, on a modern CPU + HD and enough RAM.

Usually, when rich text documents are involved, some considerable time is
spent converting these into raw text documents. The raw size of a rich text
document (PDF, DOC, HTML) is usually (based on my measures) 15-20% of its
original size, and that is compressed even more when added to Lucene.

I hope this helps. BTW, you can always just try to index that amount of
content in one index on your machine and decide if the machine can handle
that amount of data.
