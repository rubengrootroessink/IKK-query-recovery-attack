I didn't say we won't need CSF, but that at least conceptually, CSF and my
sort-by-payload are the same. If however it turns out that CSF performs
better, then I'll definitely switch my sort-by-payload package to use it. I
thought that CSF is going to be implemented using payloads, but perhaps I'm
wrong.
