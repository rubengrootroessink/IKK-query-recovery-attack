If this file has a predefined construct, e.g.:
title: someting
location: new york
....
then you can write a simple parser that extracts that information.

But I think otherwise this falls outside the scope of Lucene, unless I
misunderstood you.

If I had to give it a long shot though, I'd try to index all the data using
WhitespaceAnalyzer, and then query for "Location". I'd also use the
Highlighter in contrib to find matching segments of text, and take whatever
has come after "Location". You should know though how much to take after
Location ...

Maybe if you post here a sample input, it'll trigger something in me :).
