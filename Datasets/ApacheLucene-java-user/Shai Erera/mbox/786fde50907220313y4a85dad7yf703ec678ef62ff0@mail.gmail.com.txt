Perhaps I misunderstood something, but how do you update a document?

I mean, if a document contains vol:a, vol:b and vol:c and then you want to
add vol:d to it, don't you remove the document and add it back?

If that's what you do, then you can also update the numvols field, right?

Or .. you mean you already have an index w/ all those documents indexed, and
you want to search it now? If you cannot rebuild it, may I suggest the
following - created another index and add documents to it in the same order
as they were added to the current index. To each document add a 'numvols'
field. Then use a ParallelReader to search over the two indices in parallel
with the query I gave before. The two indices should look like this:

    Index 1                                      Index 2
-------------------                           ------------------------
Doc: vol1, vol2, vol3                  Doc: numvols:3
Doc: vol1, vol4, vol6, vol7           Doc: numvols: 4
Doc: vol5                                 Doc: numvols: 1
Doc: vol3, vol8                          Doc: numvols: 2

It should work if your index doesn't have deletes. If it has, consider
optimizing it or call expungeDeletes.

If your scenario is different, then perhaps try to explain it more
accurately.
