I don't know if that proposal is the most efficient one, but you can try it.
In general, what you're looking for is a GROUP BY Bill-Id feature and then
select the most recent one, right? Only you don't need all the Versions of
the same Bill, and therefore you can hold the most recent Version-Id only.
What you can do is write a Collector which for each received document checks
its Bill-Id and Version-Id. It keeps a Map Bill-Id -> Version-Id and for
every incoming doc checks the map:
1) If the Bill-Id hasn't been seen yet, stores it in the map.
2) If it has been seen, compares the Version-Id of the incoming doc to the
one in the map and replaces them if needed.

By storing the Bill-Id and Version-Id in the FieldCache you can make that
Collector work very fast. Also, you can apply some optimization to the
process by e.g. not checking the map if the document has no chance in being
selected for the top-K requested docs (for e.g. a low score) etc.

I've outlined a general approach .. other, perhaps more efficient ones, may
exist.

Another alternative is to run your search, collecting top-NK, where N is a
factor/multiplier you activate on K. After the search is done, you filter
out the unneeded docs w/ "old" Version-Id. If you choose your N smartly,
you'll do it just once, not re-running the query in case it filtered out too
many docs.

Hope this helps,
Shai
