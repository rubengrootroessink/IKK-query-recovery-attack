SUBJECT: Retrieve the number of deleted documents
DATE: 11 Jan 2008

Hi

I didn't find a proper API on InderWriter or IndexReader to retrieve the
total number of deleted documents.
Will IndexReader.maxDocs() - IndexReader.numDocs() give the correct result?
or this is just a heuristic?

Thanks,

Shai
