Hi Dean

Could you share a little more information about those indexes (and your
problem in general), such as:
* Is there one index, or 8M indexes?
* How many files do those indexes contain? Do you use compound file format?
* What is the command/API you use to delete the indexes?
* Lucene version, IndexWriter settings etc.
