I think you should write your own Analyzer and use:
* StandardTokenizer for tokenization and ACRONYM detection.
* StopFilter for stopwrods handling.

The Analyzer you write should override tokenStream() and do something like:

************************************************************
TokenStream result = new StandardTokenizer(reader);
result = new LowerCaseFilter(result); // if lower casing is also what you
want.
result = new StopFilter(result, stopWords);
return result;
************************************************************

StandardAnalyzer wraps StandardTokenizer with StandardFilter, which strips
the acronym off its '.', so you don't want to use it.
