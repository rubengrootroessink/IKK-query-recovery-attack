You can look at org.apache.lucene.search.MultiPhraseQuery which does
something similar to what you ask. From its javadoc:

 * To use this class, to search for the phrase "Microsoft app*" first use
 * add(Term) on the term "Microsoft", then find all terms that have "app" as
 * prefix using IndexReader.terms(Term), and use MultiPhraseQuery.add(Term[]
 * terms) to add them to the query.

It works for simple phrases and I don't know if it works for fuzzy phrases
as well ... however I believe it can be tweaked to work for fuzzy phrases
also.
