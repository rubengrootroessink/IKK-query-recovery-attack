I have multiple JVMs on different machines accessing the shared file system.
I don't really have multiple IndexWriters on the same JVM, I asked this just
out of curiosity.

So I don't understand from your reply if it's safe to use NoLockFactory, or
I should use SimpleFSLockFactory and unlock if needed?
