SUBJECT: Re: Sorting field contating NULL values consumes field cache memory
DATE: 21 Jul 2009

FWIW, I had implemented a sort-by-payload feature which performs quite well.
It has a very small memory footprint (actually close to 0), and reads values
from a payload. Payloads, at least from my experience, perform better than
stored fields.

On a comparison I've once made, the sort-by-payload feature performed better
than the FieldCache solution, for the first search. The reason is that
FieldCache reads the values from the stored fields, which is slower than
payload. However subsequent sorts performed better using the FieldCache. For
very large indices though, FieldCache is not an option.

If it's interesting enough, I can do some work to contribute it to Lucene.
It's not a very big package, but not a small one either. I also think that
if this feature will go into Lucene, we can improve FieldCache to read
values from the payload rather than stored fields.
