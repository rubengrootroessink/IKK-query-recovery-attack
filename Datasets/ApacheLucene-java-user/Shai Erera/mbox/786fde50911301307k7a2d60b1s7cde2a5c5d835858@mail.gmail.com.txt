Thanks again, I'll use this table as well. What I do is read those tables
and store in a char[], for fast lookups of folding chars. I noticed your
comments in the code about not doing so because then the tables would need
to be updated once in a while, and I agree. But ICU's lack of char[] API
drove me away from it. I've had bad experience, performance-wise, with it in
the past.

I even compared Java's Collator to ICU's, and Java's seemed to perform
faster to me, although that wasn't a real performance test. But ICU seems to
be more accurate than Java's (which is annoying). I figured that I can apply
some rules on my own, but the more I read about contrib/analyzers,
contrib/collation, LUCENE-1488 and this thread, I think I'm beginning to
understand that "on my own" means staying alert to a lot of stuff I'm not
today :).

Two comments about the patch in LUCENE-1488. In some places you use
StringBuffer and others StringBuilder. Is that intentional? If not, I think
you should move to StringBuilder. Also, in ICUCaseFoldingFilter, I believe
termAtt can be declared final?

Thanks,
Shai
