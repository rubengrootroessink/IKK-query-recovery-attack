If I understand correctly, you compare the size of the .frq when
WhitespaceTokenizer is used, vs the CJK ones?

I'd bet this is because WhitespaceTokenizer creates far less terms than the
CJK one. Whitespace tokenizes the text by separating on whitespace, while
CJK does sort of N-Gram tokenization, which usually leads to much more terms
created. This affects the .frq file in that there are much more posting
lists created, which are stored in the .frq file.

See if the .tii and .tis files differ and if their difference is the same
order of the .frq differences (e.g. if they are 2x larger w/ CJK, so .frq
should be of the same order of difference), then I believe this is the
reason.
