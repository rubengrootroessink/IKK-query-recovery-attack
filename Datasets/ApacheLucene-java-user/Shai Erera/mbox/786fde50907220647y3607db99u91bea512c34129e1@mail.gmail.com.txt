Hi Alex,

You can start with this article:
http://www.manning.com/free/green_HotBackupsLucene.html (you'll need to
register w/ your email). It describes how one can write Hot Backups w/
Lucene, and capture just the "delta" since the last backup.

I'm about to try it myself, so if you get to do it before I am, I'd
appreciate if you can post back some initial observations/impressions.
