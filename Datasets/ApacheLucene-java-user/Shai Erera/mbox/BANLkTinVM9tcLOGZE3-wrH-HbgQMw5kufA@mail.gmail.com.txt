No I don't cache the results. The Filter is an OpenBitSet of all docs that
match the filter (e.g. have the specified language field's value) and it is
refreshed whenever new segments are added / old ones deleted. So I think it
actually works well w/ NRT because the 'warmup' would just update the filter
w/ the new segments. I suggest you take a look at CachingWrapperFilter to
get an idea how this works.
