Queries cannot be ordered "sequentially". Let's say that you run 3 Queries,
w/ one term each "a", "b" and "c". On disk, the posting lists of the terms
can look like this: post1(a), post1(c), post2(a), post1(b), post2(c),
post2(b) etc. They are not guaranteed to be consecutive. The code makes sure
the posting list parts come logically one after the others, by
file-system-wise, they can be completely messed up on disk.

Besides, I'm not sure that what you want will get you anything. If you run 3
queries in parallel, you open 3 file descriptors (at least). Modern machines
can very well read 3 files in parallel, so you won't be seeking around as
much as you think.

I just don't think that application-wise there's something you can do, at
least in this case.
