SUBJECT: Re: Doc IDs via IndexReader?
DATE: 23 Jul 2009

off the top of my head, if you have in hand all the doc IDs that were
returned so far, you can do this:
1) Build a Filter which will return any doc ID that is not in that list. For
example, pass it the list of doc IDs and every time next() or skipTo is
called, it will skip over the given doc IDs.
2) Execute a MatchAllDocsQuery, together w/ the above filter.
3) The result will be the list of doc IDs the filter accepted, namely those
that were not returned so far.
4) Delete each doc ID.

This will make sure you attempt to delete only docs that are not deleted
yet.

Another approach you can take is iterate from 0 to reader.maxDoc() and
delete only the docs that were not retrieved so far. with this, you may
attempt to delete an already deleted document. If you want to avoid it, call
reader.isDeleted(id) and delete it only if it returns false.

Hope this helps,

Shai
