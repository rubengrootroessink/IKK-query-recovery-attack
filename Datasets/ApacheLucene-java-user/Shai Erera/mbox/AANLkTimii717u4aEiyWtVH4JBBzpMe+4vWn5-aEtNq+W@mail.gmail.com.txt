SUBJECT: Re: performance merging indexes with addIndexesNoOptimize
DATE: 12 Nov 2010

 In Lucene 3x there is a new addIndexes which accepts Directory… that
simply registers the new indexes in the index, without running merges.
That makes addIndexes very fast.

Also, you can consider calling close(false) to not wait for merges.
That can speed things up as well.

But note that not running merges, or letting them finish, is not
recommended long term. The approachs I've mentioned are good if you
want to quickly add new indexes and plan to run index optimization at
a later time.
