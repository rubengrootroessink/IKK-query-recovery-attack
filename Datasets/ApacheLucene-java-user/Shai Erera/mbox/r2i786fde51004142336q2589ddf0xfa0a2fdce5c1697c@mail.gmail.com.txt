I'm still not sure I understand ...

If the first document includes "Lucene in Action. Lucene" (two sentences,
the 2nd one with Lucene only) and the second "Lucene for Dummies", then what
exactly do you want to get for the queries "\"Lucene in Action\"" and
"\"Lucene\""?

If I understand correctly, then you want just the first doc as a match for
these two queries? Which means the second query "\"Lucene\"" should not
match the second document, because Lucene appears as one of the words in a
sentence?

If that's what you want, then you need to create a Tokenizer which
recognizes end-of-sentence boundaries, and indexes each sentence as a single
token. So the tokens in the index will be:
Lucene in Action -> doc1
Lucene -> doc1
Lucene for Dummies -> doc2

Is that what you want? If not then I apologize, but I still don't understand
...
