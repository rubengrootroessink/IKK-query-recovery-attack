Robert, what if I need to do additional filtering after CollationKeyFilter,
like stopwords removal, abbreviations handling, stemming etc? Will that be
possible if I use CollationKeyFilter?

I also noticed CKF creates a String out of the char[]. If the code already
does that, why not use String.toLowerCase(Locale)?
