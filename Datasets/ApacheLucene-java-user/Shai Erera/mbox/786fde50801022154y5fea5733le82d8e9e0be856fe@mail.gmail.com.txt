Hi

You could create a three static maps between the String and and appropriate
Index/Store/TermVector objects. Those maps are not expensive, and are far
more efficient than the String comparisons ...
If you choose to stick with String comparisons, you might wanna check using
Collator instead of String.equals as it is more efficient for comparing
strings.
