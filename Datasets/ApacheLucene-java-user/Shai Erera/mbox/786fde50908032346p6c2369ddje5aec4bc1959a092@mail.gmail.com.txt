I can think of another approach - during indexing, capture the word
"aboutus" and index it as "about us" and "aboutus" in the same position.
That way both queries will work. You'd need to write your own TokenFilter,
maybe a SynonymTokenFilter (since this reminds me of "synonyms" usage) that
accept a list of words and their "matching counterparts" ... something along
those lines.

Another thing, which is basically the same, but from the other side -->
check the query string for such words and replace them w/ what you want. So
you can search for "about us" in the query string and replace it w/
"aboutus".

I prefer the first approach since it's much more performing, but is more
complicated than the second one. It will also allow you to handle other
cases like that.
