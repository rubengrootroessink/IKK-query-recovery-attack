Interesting ... I don't have access to a Japanese dictionary, so I just
extract bi-grams. But I guess that in this case, if one can access an
English dictionary (are you aware of an "open-source" one, or free one
BTW?), one can use the method you mention.

But still, doing this for every Token you meet is extremely expensive (for
Japanese is all you can do, but this case is rather special), so I'd first
make sure I can pinpoint the very small number of possible tokens I should
process like that.
