The I think what you're looking for is getting the ScoreDoc[] stored in the
TopDocs object. Then modify each doc's score (a ScoreDoc has a doc ID and
score [float]) and then sort the array. You can use Arrays.sort(ScoreDoc[],
Comparator) by passing a Comparator which will compare the docs by their
score, and then possible by ID (when scores are equal).

Does that sound like what you're looking for?
