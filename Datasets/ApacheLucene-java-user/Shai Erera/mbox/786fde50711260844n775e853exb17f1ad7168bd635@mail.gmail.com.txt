DATE: 26 Nov 2007

Hi

I tried this code:

        TokenStream ts = analyzer.tokenStream("content", new StringReader("
www.abc.com"));
        Token t;
        while ((t = ts.next()) != null) {
            System.out.println(t);
        }
If I pass "www.abc.com" (without an extra '.'), it prints
(www.abc.com,0,11,type=<HOST>)
---> it recognizes the type HOST.
If I pass "www.abc.com." (with an extra '.'), it prints
(wwwabccom,0,12,type=<ACRONYM>) ---> it recognizes the type ACRONYM.

Personally, I think it is a bug, as ACRONYMs are usually of the form A.B.C.
and not ABC.DEF. ... maybe you can try the java-dev mailing list and consult
them if you should open an issue on that ...
