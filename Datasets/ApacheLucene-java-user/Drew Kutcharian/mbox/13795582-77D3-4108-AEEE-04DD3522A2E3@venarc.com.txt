SUBJECT: Looking for a Lucene Contractor
DATE: 6 Mar 2011

Hi Everyone,

We are looking for someone to help us build a similarity engine. Basically we want to be able
to show similar posts when a user posts a new block of text. A good example of this is StackOverflow.
When a user tries to ask a new question, the system displays similar questions.

Can Lucene be used to accomplish this? Is it the best tool for this task?

Thanks,

Drew
