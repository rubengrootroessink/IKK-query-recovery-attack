if I understand correctly, each document is 50 megs and does a document
represent one record (the whole 50 megs) or is it a collection of records?

if your document is a collection of records (XML tree) then you can index a
single record at a time upon it's change. But if each document represents
one
logical block than you'll have to index the whole thing every time it
changes.

Weekly changes don't sound too bad, you can get away with re-indexing it at
some dead time in the middle of the night so it doesn't slow down peoples
searches while indexing

I don't think you can do that, but you should index the
whole document (you'd be amazed how fast it is) I
imagine you're documents are large and that's why you
want to partially index but I would try the whole thing
first, how large are your docments and how often do you
invision updating the index
