it's not a matter of releasing the handles, it needs to keep them open,
this tricked me as well I thought it kept the file handles of the
source XML files open, but if you look at the code it actually reads the
contents of
the files from an HTTP request, the file handles are consumed by the files
that lucene creates
to store the index results, that's why you get the same error when you try
to search as well
it tries to open all the files but runs out of handles in the process, you
have to increase your
unix file handles and reboot the system (how to depends on your OS), this
solves one problem.

I just hit another one, but I'm convinced it's worth it, I've gotten
excellent results after indexing
20 000 files, very fast and very responsive and if it's going to take some
tweaking to get it over this
problem so be it, that's the joy of open source

cheers .. I hope that was useful

Hi List!

Doesn't Lucene releases the filehandles??

because I get "too many open files in system" after running lucene a while!

I use the 1.2 rc 4 version!
