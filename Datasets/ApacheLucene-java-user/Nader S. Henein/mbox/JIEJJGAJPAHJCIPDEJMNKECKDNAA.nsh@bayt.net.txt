I maintain the index on multiple machines UPDATING/DELETING/OPTIMIZING on
all three machines,
it's hard to make sure that everything is synchronized but it provides a
fall back in case anything happens
to the index. What you're doing is mainly a copy witch is probably like my
backup, witch is quite simple now in the
sense that I check the index directory for *.lock files if none are present
(the index isn't being edited/optimized)
I create a write.lock file witch tells the indexer not to run and I read the
file list using a shell script and copy
the files to a different directory. It's a hack but it works fine. I'm
currently working on a backup and rollback
API for Lucene witch should work for copying the index across.

Hello Everybody,

I have a requirement where i need to replicate the index files generated by
lucene to another server at a remote location.
What i have observed is that lucene keeps on changing file names for the
index files  . does it follow any speific pattern in doing this ?
Is anybody doing something like this ?

>From what i understand it will be best if i optimize the index before i
replicate it and also make a local copy so that the index is not
updated while it is being replicated. What other issues can be there if i
try something like this .

TIA

Regards
Harpreet
