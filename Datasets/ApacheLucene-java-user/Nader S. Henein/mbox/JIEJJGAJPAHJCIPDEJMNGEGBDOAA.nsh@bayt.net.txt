but then you'd have to always be case sensative,
the only way to offer the option of doing both types
of searches is to have duplicate fields.

StandardAnalyzer uses LowerCaseFilter so is unsuitable
for case sensitive searches.  Easiest solution is probably
to create your own analyzer as a copy of StandardAnalyzer
but without LowerCaseFilter.
