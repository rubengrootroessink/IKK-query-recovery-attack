that might be the case I'm indexing 200 000 files each one has about 30 XML
fields each one
has a set of attributes .. could that be it ?

I have worked a little with the cocoon indexer and it indexes each
xml-attribute in a Field. I have done some indexing on both plaintext and
xml
sources and i think the "Too many open files" problem is directly related to
number of fields stored in a document in a index.

the reason for this is that i have never encountered "Too many open files"
when indexing clean text into one large field, but when creating many-many
fields as required by indexing xml i got a "Too many open files"  until i
had
to use a ram-dir to index document batches into..
