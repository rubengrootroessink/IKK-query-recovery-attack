I wrote an entry about that subject at this link

Subject: identical field names


Hi,

Does Lucene allow Document with more than one Field of the same name but
different values?
I'm wondering about this because I'm trying to implement hierarchical search
as suggested by
the FAQ, i.e. /dir1/dir2/dir3.  But that seems to work only for one folder
assignment for each
Document, I need to support multiple folder assignment to a Document.

Thanks
