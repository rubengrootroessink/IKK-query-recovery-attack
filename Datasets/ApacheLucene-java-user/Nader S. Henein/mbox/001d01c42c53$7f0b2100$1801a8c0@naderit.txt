Here's my two cents on this:
Both ways you will need to combine the date in one field, but if you use a
millisecond representation you will not be able to use the FLOAT sort type
and you'll have use STRING sort (Slower) because the millisecond
representation is longer than FLOAT allows, so you have three options:

1) Use YYYYMMDD and sort by FLOAT type
2) Use the millisecond representation and sort by STRING type
3) If the date you're entering here is the date of indexing then you can
just sort by DOC type (which is the DOC ID) and save yourself the pain

Hope this helps.

Subject: sorting by date (XML)


my XML files contain something like

<date>
  <year>2004</year><month>04</month><day>27</day>...
</date>

and I would like to sort by this date.

So I guess I need to modify the Documentparser and generate something like a
millisecond field and then sort by this, correct?

Has anyone done something like this yet?

Thanks

Michi
