SUBJECT: MultiSearch Join - Applicaiton Issues
DATE: 14 May 2002


The structure of my application is as follows, I allow users to
create folders in their accounts and then I allow them to search
within these folders, now if I'm to use my main index ( the same one
I use to search globally the whole database) I will have to use
a statement that looks something like this (doc_id: 1 OR doc_id: 2 OR ...
doc_id: n )
to limit the search to the documents in the folder.

Since my application has 100 000s of documents, I can't depend on Filter
option
because I would have to sore and maintain massive BitSets, overkill and
prone
to error.

So what I was looking at MultiSearch but the problem is MultiSearch is a
mere
UNION as opposed to an intersection, can anyone shed light on this problem,

I can't maintain the changes over the folders in my master index because I
would be updating
it constantly, I can't use bitsets because they become massive and I can't
just create them on
the fly from the index (recursive problem) and the MultiSearch is a union.

HELP
