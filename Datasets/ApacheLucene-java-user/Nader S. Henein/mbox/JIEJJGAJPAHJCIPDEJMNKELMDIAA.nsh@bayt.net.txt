SUBJECT: DateField issues
DATE: 13 Jun 2002


I managed to index according to the date field no problem, but then
when I search using a date filter, the search is slightly slower and
the results do not seem to be constraint by any date.

The following code segment shows how I'm searching :
(I basically want all the records indexed with dates after "start" )


// Current time in mills
long currInMills = DateField.MAX_DATE_STRING();
// startTime = currInMills - ( a number of days * ( length of a day in
mills) )
long start = currInMills - ( freshness * dayInMillis ) ;

Query query = QueryParser.parse(queryString, "title" , new
SuperStandardAnalyzer());
filter = new DateFilter.After("datemodified", start)  ;
Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(indexPath);
Hits hits = searcher.search(query,filter);


I know I'm indexing the dates correctly because I encode them then I decode
them and print them
and they seem to be accurate, just to be sure time in mills is measured
since 01 01 1970 right ?

if anyone has any idea why this isn't working please feel free to contribute
, oh and if you're wondering
yes I also tried the date filter with start and end .. nada
