You're catching an exception and acting on it, but you're not reporting it,
for now, comment out the deletion and copyfrombackup and try reporting
errors, if the batch is failing on a regular basis you want to know about
it, comment the deletion and copy across code out, also watch out that if
you backup the index during an indexing you could end up with a limp index
missing a few files, hence the missing segments, I would check for write and
commit locks pre-backup so as to avoid that. This is probably caused by two
unrelated errors first batchindex() fails then the backup restores a version
that may not have all the indexes there (depending when it was backed up)
thereby giving you the feeling that segments are disappearing randomly.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for responding Nader.

hmmmm...you've hit the nail on the spot. I do have a cron job which backs up
the 
index. Its run in a batch index scheduled job. 

The logic is basically

backupindex()
try
{
	batchindex()
}
catch(Exception e)
{
	deleteindex();
	copyfrombackuptoindex()
	deletebackup();
}

I assume that the original index before backing up was complete and
'working'. 
I'm also deleting the index that failed, instead of just overwriting. Where
did 
I go wrong? 

I'm not checking that the index isn't write-locked before backing up, but I 
don't think that's the problem (though it very well can be a separate
problem).
