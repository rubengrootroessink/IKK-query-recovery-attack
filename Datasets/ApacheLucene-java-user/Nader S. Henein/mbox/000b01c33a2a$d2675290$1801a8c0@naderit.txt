 I handle updates or inserts the same way first I delete the document
from the index and then I insert it (better safe than sorry), I batch my
updates/inserts every twenty minutes, I would do it in smaller intervals
but since I have to sync the XML files created from the DB to three
machines (I maintain three separate Lucene indices on my three separate
web-servers) it takes a little longer. You have to batch your changes
because Updating the index takes time as opposed to deleted which I
batch every two minutes. You won't have a problem updating the index and
searching at the same time because lucene updates the index on a
separate set of files and then when It's done it overwrites the old
version. I've had to provide for Backups, and things like server crashes
mid-indexing, but I was using Oracle Intermedia before and Lucene BLOWS
IT AWAY.

Hi Nader,

I was wondering if you'd mind me asking you a couple of questions about
your implementation?

The main thing I'm interested in is how you handle updates to Lucene's
index. I'd imagine you have a fairly high turnover of CVs and jobs, so
index updates must place a reasonable load on the CPU/disk. Do you keep
CVs and jobs in the same index or two different ones? And what is the
process you use to update the index(es) - do you batch-process updates
or do you handle them in real-time as changes are made?

Any insight you can offer would be much appreciated as I'm about to
implement something similar and am a little unsure of the best approach
to take. We need to be able to handle indexing about 60,000
documents/day, while allowing (many) searches to continue operating
alongside.

Thanks!
Chris
