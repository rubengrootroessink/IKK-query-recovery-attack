My index changes ( updates every 15 minutes and delete every 2 minutes ) so
using the filter is not going to work for me because the order of the
Documents might change from the time the initial search is done to the time
the filter is done, I'm currently using a crude method ( ... doc_id:(23 AND
78 .. ) ) and so to filter it works surprisingly well because I thought the
query parser would cave but it's doing great even with sets as large as
filtering within 2000 documents

Cool.  But instead of adding a new class, why not change Hits to inherit
from Filter and add the bits() method to it?  Then one could "pipe" the
output of one Query into another search without modifying the Queries...
