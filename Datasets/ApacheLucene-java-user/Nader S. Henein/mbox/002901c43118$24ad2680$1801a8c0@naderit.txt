When my server restarts, I have a little procedure that validates and "sorts
out" the index in case the server crashes mid-indexing/optimizing, what it
does is it checks for locks and frees them if need be then it optimizes the
whole thing (as a precaution) here's the code I use, try it out in your
lucene init:


		try {
			Directory directory =
FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexPath,false);
			if ( directory.list().length == 0 ) clear() ; //
Create a new index
			Lock writeLock = directory.makeLock(writeFileName); 
			if (!writeLock.obtain()) {
				IndexReader.unlock(directory) ;
			} else {
				writeLock.release() ;
			}
		} catch (IOException e) {
			logger.error("Index Validate",e) ;
		}

Try it out, hope it helps.
