I was going through the lucene-user posts on the web and I came accross
a posting by Scott Oshima 
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg00693.html

witch is talking about creating a IndexReader pool to spead up the search
I've looked into that but I can't fiure out what to use for a DataSource 
like in creating a pool for DB connections, is there an equivalant in the 
lucene architecture or should one just take the initiative.
