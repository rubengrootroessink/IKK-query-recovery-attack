sorry .. but still the same problem, I've saved the index in a seperate
direcory
and I've re-indexed overnight so, testing (witch is currently underway) on
the
system can resume. Like I said in my previous email , worst case scenarios
and the index
is corrupted any ideas as to why, I'll gladly go into the source but some
guidance as
to a starting point would be nice

You can also do something like this:

# lsof | wc -l
   8727

# lsof | grep -c java
   5382

# lsof | grep java | head
mozilla-b 8428   otis  mem    REG        3,5  1242726   1287892
/usr/local/.version/IBMJava2-13/jre/bin/libjavaplugin_oji.so
mozilla-b 8453   otis  mem    REG        3,5  1242726   1287892
