SUBJECT: Filtering in Lucene
DATE: 13 May 2002

For those of you who have worked with the BitSet concept to
use lucene in searching within a subset, just to make sure that
I got this right, if I have 100 000 documents to search, my Bit Vector
will be of 100 000 length, just to save that vector for repeated use
I'll have to use a clob! Am I thinking right or have I misunderstood the
concept.

thanks
