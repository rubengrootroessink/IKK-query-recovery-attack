So if Alan wants to limit it to the first 100 he can't really use a range
search unless he can guarantee that the index is optimized after deletes,
but then if his deletion rounds are anything like mine ( every 2 mins) then
optimizing it at each delete will make searching the index really slow.
Right?

They are unique and ascending.

Gaps in id's exist when documents are removed, and then the id's are 
squeezed back to completely sequential with no holes during an 
optimize.
