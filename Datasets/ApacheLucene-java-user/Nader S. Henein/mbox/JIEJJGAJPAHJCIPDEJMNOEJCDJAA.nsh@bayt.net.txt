As their is no update in lucene, this is exactly what you need to do,
and I would advise you to batch your update and optimize after you update,
because the number of files baloon if you don't

Subject: Updating Documents in the index


Hi,

My application needs to provide a feature for updating documents in the
index.
I am thinking of doing this by deleting the original document and indexing
the updated one again , I think this is possible using the delete methods in
the IndexReader class .

Is there some other better way to achieve this with lucene .

Thanks and Regards
Harpreet
