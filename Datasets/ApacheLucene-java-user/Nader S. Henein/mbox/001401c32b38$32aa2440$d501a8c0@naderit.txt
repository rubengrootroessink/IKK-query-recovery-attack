We use Lucene http://www.bayt.com , we're basically an on-line
Recruitment site and up until now we've got around 500 000 CVs and
documents indexed with results that stump Oracle Intermedia.

Subject: commercial websites powered by Lucene?



Hello All,

I've been trying to find examples of large commercial websites that
use Lucene to power their search.  Having such examples would
make Lucene an easy sell to management

Does anyone know of any good examples?  The bigger the better, and
the more the better.

TIA,
-John
