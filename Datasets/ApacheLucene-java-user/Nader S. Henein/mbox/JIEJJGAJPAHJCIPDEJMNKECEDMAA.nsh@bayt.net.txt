That's the weird thing I wasn't writing to the index at the
time I was searching (hardcore searching) 20 clients each one
issuing 20 simultaneous search request .. it was going fine until
it started throwing errors at me and when I looked at the logs, I found
a set of "Too many files open" error. Previously this only happened if
their was a crash on the server while indexing leaving an un-optimized index
with 800+ files.

It's very hard to leave an index in a bad state.  Updating the
"segments" file atomically updates the index.  So the only way to
corrupt things is to only partly update the segments file.  But that too
is hard, since it's first written to a temporary file, which is then
renamed "segments".  The only vulnerability I know if is that in Java on
Win32 you can't atomically rename a file to something that already
exists, so Lucene has to first remove the old version.  So if you were
to crash between the time that the old version of "segments" is removed
and the new version is moved into place, then the index would be
corrupt, because it would have no "segments" file.
