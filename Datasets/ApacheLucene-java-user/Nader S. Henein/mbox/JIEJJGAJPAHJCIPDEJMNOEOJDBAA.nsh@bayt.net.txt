I'm currently working on indexing 200 000 documents with
index updates every half hour on three separate webservers.

So you can see my ordeal I have to update the index ( delete and add)
on three separate machines, how many files are you indexing, the first
issue I faced was the "Too Many files open error", and are you indexing your
files from the webapp or did you write the indexer to run from the command
line ? Sorry about all the questions but there are very few people in the
dev mailers talking about the lucene cocoon issues that it's a joy when a
new voice props up

Hi everybody,

All documents of my application (indexed by Lucene) came from a Web Form
which
the application´s Administrator can change/remove/add (fields) regularly.

Researching Lucene´s FAQs I got that the only way to alter a indexed
document (adding index, deleting index, modify fields) is deleting the given
document and after this adding the modified version. Unfortunately this
looks
very slower on my application, because I have thousands of documents of each
Form.

My questions are:
  - Are there any eficient way to do what I need using Lucene?
  - If not, where is the best place to modify Lucene code? Is someone
working on this?

 Thanks by advance and best wishes,

                Flavio
