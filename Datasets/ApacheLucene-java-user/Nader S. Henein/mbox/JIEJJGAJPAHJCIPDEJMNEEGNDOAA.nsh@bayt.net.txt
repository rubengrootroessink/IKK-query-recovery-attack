if you can't use an "OR" statement and a boolean search won't give you the
right results,
you can just do two searches and do your merging and ordering in a
collection or array, should be
fairly fast

Subject: is it possible to merge Hits?


don't know if i am thinking in the rigth direction here. What i would like
to do
is search an index with respect to two different fields of the documents and
then merge the hits together so that the resulting Hits are sorted by the
score.
Is that the way to do it, or do i have to use multiple indices?

Best regards,
Markus Krogemann
