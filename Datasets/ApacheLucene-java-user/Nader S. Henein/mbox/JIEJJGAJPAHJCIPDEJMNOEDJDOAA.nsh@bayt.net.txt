since it's file system based index I don't see any limitations other than OS
max file size, and Imagine if you're data is 3 Terabytes you have monster
machines with monster memory (you'll need it) also you'll need to max up the
file handle set up on the OS and probably use a high MERGE_FACTOR.

PS: I'm hypothesizing here, so please anyone feel free to jump in

Can anyone tell me the amount of data that Lucene is able to index?  Can it
handle up to 3 Terrabytes, how large are the indexes it creates, (1/2 the
size of the data)?

Thanks,

Scott
