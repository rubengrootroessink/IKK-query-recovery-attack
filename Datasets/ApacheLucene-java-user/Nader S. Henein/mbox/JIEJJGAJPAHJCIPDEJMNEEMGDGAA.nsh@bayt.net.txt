So if I do a search and then two minutes later I filter but sometime in
between
the index was automatically updated (let's say deleting a document from the
middle
of the index), my Filter will become skewed by 1 and thereby screwed.

Because if that's true, we need to start looking at a different way because
if you have an index that changes constantly (I delete documents every 5
minutes and
add/update + optimize documents every 30 minutes) no way will this filter
work.

Yes, the BitSet has to be the same size as the number of documents in the
index.

If you have enough memory you could cache the BitSet in the VM's memory
rather
then storing it in a clob though.
