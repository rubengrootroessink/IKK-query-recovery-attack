SUBJECT: Re: Indexing - scheduled batch process or server?
DATE: 17 Apr 2006

I'm pretty new with this, but with my index for a database, I'm using  
a Quartz scheduler.  Also at the end of the index update, I set my  
singleton of IndexSearcher to null.  That way the index searcher will  
be using the latest information.  That bit as well as setting it to  
null and not closing it I found searching around on forums.  The  
reason given for not closing it is to allow searches currently using  
the index searches to finish using it.
Anyway, I hope this helps.
