SUBJECT: Re: Boosting Fields (in index) or Queries
DATE: 14 Apr 2006

I still have a similar problem with the boost factor.  I change the  
name to have the AND operator and set that query's boost to a very  
high value in relation to the others.  I also have a regular OR based  
name so that it doesn't rule those out.  However whenever I change  
the boost values with the queries, nothing, absolutely nothing  
changes with the results.  Besides that - I search for: playstation  
game.  The only value that has both playstation and game in the name  
field is Hit number 20.  That's really why I put the name AND  
operator in there with such a high boost value, to see if it would  
bring that single ANDed record towards the top, but nothing.  Am I  
doing something wrong in all of this?  Am I doing the boost wrong or  
something?
