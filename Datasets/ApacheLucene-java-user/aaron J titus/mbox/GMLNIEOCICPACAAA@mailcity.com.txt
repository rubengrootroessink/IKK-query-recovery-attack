SUBJECT: hit scoring on latest build
DATE: 4 Nov 2002

Hello Everyone,

I have just downloaded the newest of the nightly builds (10/27) from the apache.org site because
I was looking for the specific feature of being able to control the default conjunction. I
noticed that the hit scoring has changed drastically since the release build. I checked bugzilla
and did not see anything reported. Has anyone experienced this and do you have any suggestions
on how to fix it? 

Thanks in advance!

-Aaron
