SUBJECT: Two problems of lucene.
DATE: 4 Feb 2006

Hi,

I got two problems of lucene.

1. How does the lucene calculate each term's weight in the query? Is it a
simple boolean value?

2. Can i change the similarity measure in the lucene? For instance, i only
use the term frequence instead of the tf/idf value to give weight to each
term in the document.
