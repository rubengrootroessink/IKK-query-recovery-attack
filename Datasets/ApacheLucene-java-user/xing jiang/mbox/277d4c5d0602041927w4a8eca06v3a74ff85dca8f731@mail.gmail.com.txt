SUBJECT: two problems of using the lucene.
DATE: 5 Feb 2006

Hi,

I got two problems of using the lucene and may need your help.

1. For each word, how the lucene calculate its weight. I only know for each
work in the document will be weighed by its tf/idf values.

2. Can I modify the lucene so that i use the term frequency instead of
tf/idf value to calculate the similarity between documents and queries.
