SUBJECT: Re: Use the lucene for searching in the Semantic Web.
DATE: 19 Jan 2006

Hi,

I have done some surveys about the information retrieval on the Semantic
Web, (maybe i miss many papers, most papers i used are published in recent
WWW and CIKM conferences, :).

1. A typical way of using the ontology is to select exact term from the
domain ontology to form queries. The first one may be the OntoSeek (
www.loa-cnr.it/Papers/OntoSeek.pdf ).  Similar work may be Latifur Khan's
work ("Retrieval effectiveness of an ontology-based model for information
selection", VLDB 2004).

2. Guha et al. ("Semantic Search", WWW2003) used domain ontology to form a
concept graph. Then, users only need to browse the concept graph egenerated.
Similar work may be Eero Hyvonen's  work "MuseumFinland". They all used the
semantic structure of the domain ontology to help users browsing.

3. QuizRDF (www.cs.rutgers.edu/~shklar/www11/final_submissions/paper6.pdf) used
another kind of method for using the domain ontology.  Klaus, I think your
method  should be better than QuizRDF.

One interesting method i found is Roha's work ("A hybrid approach for
searching in the Semantic Web", WWW2004). They still used keyword based
method for retrieving documents on the Semantic Web. But i cannot find any
more information about their work and the application i am building can be
seen an extension of their work.

Actually, the swoogle focuses on the ontology level's files only. It will
crawls RDF, OWL & DAML files. But they do not provide any new method to
combine the traditional keyword method for searching the text files. Li Ding
used a variant of page rank method for ontology files. But i am not sure
this method can be combined with the page rank method.

Maybe i have missed too many things when i do this survey. However, I think
we may can find some good new methods of using the domain ontology in the
Semantic Web.

Yours truly,
Jiang Xing
