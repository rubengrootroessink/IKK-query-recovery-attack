SUBJECT: How does the lucene normalize the score?
DATE: 27 Jan 2006

Hi,

I want to know how the lucene normalizes the score. I see hits class has
this function to get each document's score. But i dont know how lucene
calculates the normalized score and in the "Lucene in action", it only said
normalized score of the nth top scoring docuemnts.
