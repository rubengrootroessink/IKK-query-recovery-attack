SUBJECT: Re: Use the lucene for searching in the Semantic Web.
DATE: 18 Jan 2006

Hi,

I think one problem of the existing method is that, to query on the RDF
files or similar structures, we have to form SQL like queries. However, for
searching in the text files, we only need to type several keywords. Can we
combine the two methods and how can we combine the two methods. For
instance, i only need to enter some keywords. Then, the system can handle
the left process. Why do we have to learn some SQL like language for
searching in the Semantic Web.

regards
Jiang Xing
