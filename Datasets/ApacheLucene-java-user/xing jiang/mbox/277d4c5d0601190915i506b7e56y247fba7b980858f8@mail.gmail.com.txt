The feature vector may be bigger than the object-predicate pairs. In my
application, each document may be annotated with several concepts to say
this document contains an instance of a class. Thus, each document will be
indexed like (keywords in the document, concepts in the document) --> URI.

I am very interesting at your approach. You can see the page rank like
method used in the SWOOGLE. But the relations they used only some simple
relations, Such as "import" (used in OWL files"). IF we can use the Semantic
level relations, It's should be better. But I am not sure it can succeed, as
it requires how to weight the relations.
