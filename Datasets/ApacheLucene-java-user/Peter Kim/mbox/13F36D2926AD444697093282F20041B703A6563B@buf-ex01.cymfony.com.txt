DATE: 27 Oct 2005

If you're using the QueryParser, you just prefix the field-specific part
with the field. For example, the query in your email should be submitted
to the query parser as:

(Title:"baseball" OR Summary:"white sox") AND Publication_date:"199501
TO 200412"

or if you're creating is programmatically, the constructor to the
TermQuery takes a Term(field_name, search term)

You'll hear this a million times if you're on this mailing list long
enough, but buy Lucene in Action. The time you'll lose without it is far
more costly than the $30 it'll cost to buy the book.
