Hi,
I'm still mostly a beginner, both with Java and Lucene, so I apologize
if this may be  dumb questions. 

Is making index-modifying operations "safe" as simple just doing the
following?

synchronized (writer) {

	while (IndexReader.isLocked(directory))
		wait();
	writer.addDocument(document);
	writer.optimize();
	writer.close();
	notifyAll();

}


Also, should the IndexWriter or IndexReader be static (since you can't
have more than one open anyways?) or is there a reason to make it
non-static?

Thanks!
Peter
