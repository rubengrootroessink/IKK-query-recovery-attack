SUBJECT: NFS/iSCSI SAN with Lucene
DATE: 19 Jul 2006

Hi,
I did a search on the Lucene list archives, found a lot of posts about
the use of Lucene with NFS and how there are locking issues, but don't
see anybody coming to a real solution to this. Here's the most promising
thread I found:

g=nfs%20locking;#8302


Does anyone have any experience putting Lucene indexes on a SAN that's
connected over iSCSI rather than NFS? Does iSCSI have the same locking
issues as NFS?

Thanks,
Peter
