I just wanted to clarify... I don't believe the following statement is
accurate:

> 
> The "contents" field searches on the entire document, 
> including all indexes.


There is no default field named "contents" that automatically combines
the contents of all your fields. As Erik mentioned, you need to create
this field yourself and assign it a string value that is a concatenation
of all the fields you want to have indexed.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks,
Peter
