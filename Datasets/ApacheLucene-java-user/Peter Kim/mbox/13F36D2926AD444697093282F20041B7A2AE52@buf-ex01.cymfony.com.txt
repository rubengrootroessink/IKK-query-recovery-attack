SUBJECT: Query based stemming
DATE: 7 Jan 2005

Hi,

I'm new to Lucene, so I apologize if this issue has been discussed
before (I'm sure it has), but I had a hard time finding an answer using
google. (Maybe this would be a good candidate for the FAQ!) :)

Is it possible to enable stem queries on a per-query basis? It doesn't
seem to be possible since the stem tokenizing is done during the
indexing process. Are people basically stuck with having all their
queries stemmed or none at all?

Thanks!
Peter
