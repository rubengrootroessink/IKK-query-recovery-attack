David please let me know if you submit your code. So we could take a

> We work on NFS and have had major problems with locking, which often leads to the indices
becoming corrupt.  Our solution was to replace file locking with a database system.   I can
release the code but I'm not sure of the process or where to put it.  It basically two classes
one that extends the Directory class and one that deals with the database interaction.
