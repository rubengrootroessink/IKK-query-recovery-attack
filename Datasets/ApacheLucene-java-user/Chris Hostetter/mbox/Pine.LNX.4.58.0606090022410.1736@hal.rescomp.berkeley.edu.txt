:    ! If a document does not contain a queryterm this score can be larger
: or smaller than 0 !

if a document doesn't contain a term, then the scorer for that query will
never even try to score that document -- regardless of what your
Similarity class looks like.

if you really want this kind of behavior, you'll need to roll your own
TermQuery/TermScorer classes and change next and skipTo to allways advance
ot the next doc -- regardless of wether or not it matches (you can check
for that in the score function and act accordingly)
