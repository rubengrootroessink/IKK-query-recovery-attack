did you try triggering a thread dump to see what it was doing at that
point?

depending on your merge factors and other IndexWriter settings it could
just be doing a relaly big merge.

: Hi all,
:
:   Is there any limitation of number of file that lucene can handle?
:   I indexed a total of 30000 XML Documents,however it stops at 10000th documents.
:   No warning,no error ,no exception as well.
:   ....
:   Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491876.xml
:   Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491886.xml
:   Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491887.xml
:   Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491891.xml
:   Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491893.xml
:   Indexing C:\sweetpea\wikipedia_xmlfiles\part-180000\491896.xml <--10000th doc
:   --it idles here--
:
:  At first I thought that it was the size of  10000th document is so big so that it took
quite a long time to put  into the index.Then i found out  that the 10000th document has the
 size of 6 KB only.Indexing process stops for about 1 hour,so that i  decide to terminate
the progress.
:
:   Is there anything to do with smt like setCompoundFiles etc?cause I dont include any in
my program...
:
:   Any suggestion pls?
:
:   THanks and Best Regards,
