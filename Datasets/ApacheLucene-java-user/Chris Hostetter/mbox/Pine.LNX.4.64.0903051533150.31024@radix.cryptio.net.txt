FYI...

by default the jira homepage has a form for searching by legacy 
bugzilla ID...
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/
...if you create a Jira account you can customize that page (which is why 
some people might not see it if they are logged in)

Also: if you go the "Find Issues" and select a project that was migrated 
from Bugzilla, you can then click the link that apears to refresh the 
search menu to show you new options specific for that project ... a search 
by bugzilla id box will appear at the bottom of the left nav.
