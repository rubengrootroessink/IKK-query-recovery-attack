: I added a single document with two fields, one with the default boost and
: another with a boost of 0.0F.  hits.score(0) = 0.10848885, but Explanation shows:
:
: 0.0 = match required

1) you can never compare the score from a Hits object with the score from
an Explanation.  Explanation has the raw score, Hits has the
psuedo-normalized score.

2) Explanation was notoriously kludgy and buggy when dealing with "non
matches" or BooleanQueries that had prohibited clauses, or clauses
which scored <= 0 prior to the resolution of LUCENE-451, LUCENE-557, and
LUCENE-605.  Regretably these changes are "post 2.0" so you'd have to use
the head to try them out.
