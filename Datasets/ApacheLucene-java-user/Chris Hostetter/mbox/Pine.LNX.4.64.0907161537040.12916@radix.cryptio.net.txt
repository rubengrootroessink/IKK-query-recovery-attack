SUBJECT: Re: How to get rid of unused fields?
DATE: 16 Jul 2009


: After deleting documents from the index it can happen that fields become
: unused (i.e. no document has this field anymore). And
: IndexReader.getFieldNames() still returns these unused fields, even
: after optimizing the index. Is there any chance to get rid of these
: unused fields?

that's odd ... i'm 99% sure that should work (optimizng should perge 
unused fields).  

what version of Lucene are you using?  (if you're on the trunk it might be 
a bug introduced recently with some of the indexing changes)

Can you post some test code demonstrating the problem?
