Generally the best approach for restricting what results a person sees is
with a Filter ... if you do this, then you can get a BitSet from the
Filter which tells you everything they are allowed to see, if you then
also build a BitSet for each of the Terms you wantto "browse" by (again:
a Filter can help you with this), the size of the intersection of those
two BitSets will give you the number you want.

this is frequenctly refered to as "facet counts" "faceted searching"
and "category counts" ... you might find more info in the archives using
those search terms.

: Hi ,
: I am looking at exposing a "Browse" like functionality using lucene. Assume
: this scenario, a user Browses a Field ( Untokenized one like Book Title )
: and he sees a list of "terms" [Book titles ] and their associated doc Hits (
: Number of articles / documents this term appears in ). I believe this can be
: done bit straightforward.
:
:
:
: Here is the twist.  Since all the users don't have access to all the Books,
: basically i want to bind the "terms" by a Filter which ensures that they see
: only the "terms" that belongs to their subscribed "books".  For search, i
: have modelled the above functionality using "QueryFilter", where i "OR" the
: query, with the list of Books.
:
:
: Is there an elegant way to attack this one ? Appreciate your inputs.

: thanks
