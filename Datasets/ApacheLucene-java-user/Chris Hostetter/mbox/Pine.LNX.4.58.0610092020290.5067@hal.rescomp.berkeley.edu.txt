don't forget to optimize your index every now and then as well... deleting
a document just marks it as "deleted" it still gets inspectected by every
query during scoring at least once to see that it can skip it, optimizing
is the only thing that truely removes the "deleted" documents.

: The biggest thing would be to limit how often you open a new
: IndexSearcher, and when you do, warm up the new searcher in the
: background while you continue serving searches with the existing
: searcher.  This is the strategy that Solr uses.
:
: There is also the issue of if you are analyzing/merging docs on the
: same servers that you are executing searches on.  You can use a
: separate box to build the index and distribute changes to boxes used
: for searching.
