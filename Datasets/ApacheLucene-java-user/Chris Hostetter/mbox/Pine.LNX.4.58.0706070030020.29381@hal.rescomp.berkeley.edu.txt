: Isn't RegexQuery slower than '???' at the end of a
: word?

I've nevered used RegexQuery but a quick glance at the regex javadocs
indicates that some "RegexCapabilities" can optimize the cases with a
fixed prefix, and JakartaRegexpCapabilities is one of those cases ... so
if you construct a RegexQuery and call setRegexImplementation(new
JakartaRegexpCapabilities()) it should be just as fast sa a WildCardQuery

(both will start at the first term with a prefix in common, and then test
each successive term against a common pattern)
