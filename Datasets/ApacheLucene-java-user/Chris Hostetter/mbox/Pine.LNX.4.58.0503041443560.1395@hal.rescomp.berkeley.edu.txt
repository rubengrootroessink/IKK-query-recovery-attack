If your goal is to setup a web based search interface that queries a
lucene index containing all of the documents from your intranet
webservers, without writting a lot of code; then perhaps using Lucene 9and
the demo programs it comes with) isn't the best course of action.

"Nutch" is an OpenSource project built on top of Lucene that may better
serve your needs.  It is designed to be a full featured "web search
solution" with a built in crawler, parsers for various document types, and
a web based search interface.

I haven't played with it very much myself, but from what i've seen, it's
trivial to get it up and running and indexing an intranet (or a single web
server).
