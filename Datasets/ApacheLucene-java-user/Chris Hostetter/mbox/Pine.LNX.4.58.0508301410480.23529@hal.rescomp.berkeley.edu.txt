: Hi Tom,
:
: You could distribute your index files in a plain old directory outside
: of a jar file and install them with your application, then use
: FSDirectory to read from the installed location.
:
: But I can think of at least two ways to get the index files packaged
: into the application jar. One would be to write your own subclass of
: Directory (and perhaps IndexReader) that knows how to read entries
: directly from the jar file using JarInputStream. The other would be to
: use a RAMDirectory and populate the directory with the index files,
: perhaps reading the files using Class.getResourceAsStream or by creating
: a JarInputStream from an URL to the application jar.
:
: You can easily get an InputStream to your own application jar like this:
:
: 	CodeSource cs = theClass.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource();
: 	URL providerURL = cs.getLocation();
: 	InputStream is = providerURL.openStream();

: Have fun,

: Hello,
:
: I have a set of index files that I'd like to distribute with my Java
: application. The only way this seems practical is to place the index
: files
: in a jar file. I tried this, but the search choked when I told
: IndexSearcher
: the index path inside the jar file ( and placed the jar file path in the
:
: CLASSPATH ).
:
: Any ideas on wrapping my index files inside a jar file?
:
: Thanks in advance for any help.
