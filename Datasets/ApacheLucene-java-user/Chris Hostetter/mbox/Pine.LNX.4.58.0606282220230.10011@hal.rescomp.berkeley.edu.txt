: I'm trying to do a numerical search for a property in Lucene using
: RangeFilter.Less

: Field("id","property",Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOKENIZED) );
:        doc.add( new
: Field("num",NumberTools.longToString(5L),Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.TOK
: ENIZED) );


: Since five is less than ten, why doesn't it work?

becuase you've tokenized the "num" field.   Your Analyzer has mucked with
the value so that it won't look right when RangeFilter tries to compare it
with the value for 10 later.
