: Thank you, this was exactly what I needed.  So "tokenizing" really denotes a
: more general process that can involve normalizing the case or whatever else
: can be done with a filter.  This is where I was confused.

When constructing a Document/Field "TOKENIZED" really referes to the 
broader sense of "Analysis" (ie: should the Analyzer be used on the value)
