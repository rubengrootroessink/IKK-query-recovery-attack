SUBJECT: Re: Matching at least N terms of subqueries
DATE: 21 May 2006

: "wrapping" it with a SpanNearQuery. Unless, there is a way to make
: Span(Near)Query take a BooleanQuery as its clause. Is there a way to

ope .. span queries can only contain other span queries -- they need the
sub queries to propogate up the span information which normal queries
don't know about.

: set the min. number of terms to be matched in an OR subquery inside a
: SpanNearQuery?

not that i know of ... but you might be able to adopt the code from
BooleanQUery ... I've never looked at SpanOrQuery close enough to see how
hard it would be.
