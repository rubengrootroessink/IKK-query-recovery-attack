SUBJECT: Re: Document ids in Lucene index
DATE: 12 Apr 2008


: I am wondering if there are possible "holes" in set of index documents
: ids. Being more specific - is it possible that there exist integer i
: between 0 and IndexReader.maxDoc() such that
: reader.document(i) == null
: and
: reader.isDeleted(i)==false
: ???

That should not ever happen ... if it does, I would consider it a bug 
until someone smarter then me explained why it isn't.

(minor nit: document(i) won't ever return null, if you call it on a 
deleted docId you'll get an IllegalArgumentException)
