the orriginal Query, Weight, and Scorer APIs provided no mechanism for 
doing this -- this is one of the reasons why the SpanQuery API exists, to 
model the types of queries that (can) collect this type of information as 
they score documents.  Non-Span based queries typically have no idea about 
this type of information.  (which typically allows them to be faster)
