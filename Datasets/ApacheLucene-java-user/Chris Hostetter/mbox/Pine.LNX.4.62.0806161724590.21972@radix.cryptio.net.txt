SUBJECT: Re: Options of Field constructor accepting Reader
DATE: 17 Jun 2008

: I was wondering why only the Field constructor which accepts a String offers
: Store and Index options? I understand there might be no logic in offering
: them for the TokenStream constructor, but what's wrong in Storing an input
: from a Reader, that 2.3.2 does not allow it?

if you want to store all of the text associated with a Reader, then 
"something" needs to slurp all of that text into a String -- the Lucene 
API makes you be explicit about doing that (via the String constructor)
