: This is like, it scores sth for each document that has a field, no matter
: the content?

it scores the same value for all docs that have a field value within the
range -- if the range is unbounded then it will match anything with any
value.  if you are using the QueryParser you can get this behavior with
field:[* TO *] (but i don't remember when that was commited to the trunk,
so your milage may vary)
