SUBJECT: Re: Using Hits as document space for new search
DATE: 22 Sep 2008


: For example,  in my case it's car  searching form.
: First of all i'm telling that i want to search for BMW. System returning set
: of results. 
: In process of viewing results system shows additional criterias for making
: search result more exact, and shows count of result set after adding this
: criteria (..this count is smaller than current result set size, because new
: result is just subset of current result list).

this is generally known as "faceted searching" ... if you search the list 
archives for "facet" or in some cases 'category counts" you'll find 
numerous discussions on how to tackle problems like this.

In general: you don't want to try this using something like the Hits 
class, it's internal behavior is very inefficient forsoemthing like this 
-- building Filters (and caching them) tends to be the way to go 9and you 
can always build a Filter out of a query)
