SUBJECT: Re: Problems with QueryParser
DATE: 17 Jul 2006

: IÂ´m using lucene 2.0.0 and I would like to generate a BooleanQuery from a
: QueryParser. The problem is that when I parse a query like this: "(rafael
: todor rossini)~2" the property of the BooleanQuery ,
: minimumNumberShouldMatch is not setted properly. Is there a way of doing
: that?

if i remember correctly, when that feature was added to BooleanQuery, no
query parser support was written for it so a new task was cloned from
the orriginal to do this later ... yep, here it is...
