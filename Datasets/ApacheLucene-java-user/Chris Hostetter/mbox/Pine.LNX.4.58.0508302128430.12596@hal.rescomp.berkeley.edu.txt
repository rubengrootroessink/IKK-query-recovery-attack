: How large is the index?

I'm not sure if i'm permitted to give out that info, but I do happen to
recall seeing this page before...

...so, yeah... you can draw whatever conclusions you want from that.

: And when you keep posting new content to the index, will you optimize
: the index?

Ah, good question.  A cron runs once a day which pauses the
updaters and optimizes the indexes.  When it's finished, the updaters
resume and they "catch up" with any changes that were missed.
