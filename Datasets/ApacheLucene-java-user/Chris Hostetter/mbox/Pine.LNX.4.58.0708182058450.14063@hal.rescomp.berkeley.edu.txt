the simplest approach that will work in a general case:
  1) build you query object
  2) call rewrite on your query
  3) call extractTerms on the rewritten query
  4) iterate over all those terms and delete.

if you have Filter it's even easier...
  1) call the bits method on your filter
  2) iterate over each bit and call the delete method that takes a docid.
