: I don't believe, though haven't checked, that doc.getBoost() is a
: valid thing to call on documents retrieved from an index.  The boost
: factor gets collapsed into other factors computed at index time, so
: it is incorrect to expect the exact boost factor set at indexing time
: is available during searching.  Look at the Explanation (from
: IndexSearcher.explain) to see the factors used in scoring.

...even then, it may not be obvious from the explain output that your
field/doc boosts have been included in the score, because they are all
roled into the "fieldNorm".
