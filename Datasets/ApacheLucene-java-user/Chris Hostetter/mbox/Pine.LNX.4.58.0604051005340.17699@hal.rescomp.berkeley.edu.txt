I don't know if there is anyway for a Custom Sort to access the lucene
score -- but another approach that works very well is to use the
FunctionQuery classes from Solr...

http://incubator.apache.org/solr/docs/api/org/apache/solr/search/function/package-summary.html

...you can make a FunctionQuery object that scores things linerarly (or
reciprocally, or any other funciton you impliment in java) based on the
value of any field -- and then add that query to a BooleanQuery along with
your orriginal query and use the boost to determine how much of an
influence it has on your final score.
