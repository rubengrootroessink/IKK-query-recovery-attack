: There is however virtually no cost for me to calculate the full path,
: so I might just experiment with the span query thingy.

if you odn't mind using a span, then just reverse the ordering so the
"leaf" that the docs are at appear in the first position -- then you can
use a SpanFirst to check for exact matches.

personally ... i'd rather have a slightly bigger index then slightly
slower queries.
