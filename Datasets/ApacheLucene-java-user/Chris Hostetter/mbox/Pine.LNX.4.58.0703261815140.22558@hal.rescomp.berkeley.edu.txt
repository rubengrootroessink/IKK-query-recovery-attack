SUBJECT: Re: Matched Query Part in Hit Object
DATE: 27 Mar 2007


Lucene Query objects do not generally "carry" this kind of incormation ...
for debugging purposes you can use the Explanation class, but it is not
particularly efficient.

you may also want to look at SpanQueries ... they are a specialized
subset of Queries which do keep track of this info, and you can call the
getSpans method on them to determine what/where each clause matches on
each document.

: Is there a way to find the matched part of query string in the Hit object?
: Lucene's Hilghlighter module does part of the job, highlighting the matched
: word in the result document, however it doesn't give the effective keyword
: in query string.
