Um, yeah.  I'm actually the one that added that FAQ answer last week :)

My question is: Given the assertion that it's not safe to keep lock
files on an NFS partition, what mechanism do/would/should people use to
enable two applications running on seperate physical machines to use the
same lock file directory?

(this question is based on the understanding that unless the applications
are sharing the same lock directory, and index may be corrupted by
concurrent modifications, correct?)
