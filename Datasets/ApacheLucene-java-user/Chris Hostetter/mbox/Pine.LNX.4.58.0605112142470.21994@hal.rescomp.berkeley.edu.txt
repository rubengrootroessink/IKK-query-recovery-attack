: Have a look at the MemoryIndex (in contrib/memory) - it is perfect
: for this sort of thing.  You'd index each e-mail individually into a
: MemoryIndex and then run all the queries against it getting a hit or

alternately, if the "queries" you need to test each email against are
fairly simple (ie: basic term matches) and you expect the total number of
"queries" to be significantly greater then the average number of words in
a typical email, you could build an index of your "queries" (where each
query becomes a document with a stored feild telling you what to do if it
matches) and then as an email comes in, tokenize it on all of it's words
and search your index for each word in the email.

...but this starts to get into the area of "lucene *can* do it, in the
same way a hammer *can* drive a screw into wood -- but it's not exactly
ment for it".
