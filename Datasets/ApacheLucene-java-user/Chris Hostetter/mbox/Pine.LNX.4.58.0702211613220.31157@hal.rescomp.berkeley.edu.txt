: So, if you can add 1000, shouldn't setting 0 each time cause it to start at 0
: each time?  The default Analyzer.getPositionIncrementGap always returns 0.

it's not called Analyzer.getPositionAfterGap .. it's
Analyzer.getPositionIncrementGap .. it's the Position Increment used when
there is a Gap -- so returning 0 means that no exra increment is used, and
multiple values are treated just like one long stream of tokens (each
token has a position of 1 greater then the token before it).
