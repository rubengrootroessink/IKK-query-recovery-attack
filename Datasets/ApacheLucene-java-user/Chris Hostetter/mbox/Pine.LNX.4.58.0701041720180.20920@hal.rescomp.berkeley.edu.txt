SUBJECT: Re: Enhance similarity to pass in field name (Reposting)
DATE: 5 Jan 2007



: However, we don't have access to the field name in the function public float
: tf(float freq).
: Is there any way out ? I would think passing the field name along with the
: freq to
: create public float tf(float freq, String fieldName)  would be useful -
: unless there is a better way.

there was some discussion about this previously, see this thread and all
replies...

...but no one has ever taken the initiative to make sure change.

(note in particular Marvin's point about why adding a field name param to
the tf method is not as good of an idea as changing the
Searcher.getSimilarity method to take in a field name ... it's not clear
to me if that will play nice with every possible multi-field query thta
might ever exist, but it should work fine for every query i can think of
that exists at the moment).
