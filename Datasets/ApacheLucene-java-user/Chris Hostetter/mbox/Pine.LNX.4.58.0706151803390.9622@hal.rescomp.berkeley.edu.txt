: My question is: If I just want to update the small fields in one index
: and do not want to update the large fields in another index, how can I
: make sure these two indexes are synchronized and have the same document
: number?

the short answer: build them in the same order, use the exact same
IndexWriter settings, and optimize both indexes.  you can rebuild either
of them again and again and again if you want -- as long as you keep doing
it in the same order.

ParallelReader is a pretty special caes class that not a lot of people
seem to use (or if they are they don't talk about it much) but there has
been a few discussions about it in the past .. i would suggest searching
the mail archives and pay special attention to anything by Chuck Williams
... he's pretty much the foremost authority on ParallelReader.
