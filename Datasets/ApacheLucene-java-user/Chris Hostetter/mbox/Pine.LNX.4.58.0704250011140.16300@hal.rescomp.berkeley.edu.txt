: Suppose user makes a search for "X" and he get 200 hits from s[0], 150 hits
: from s[1] and 300 hits from s[2]. Now we need to cluster/group the results
: according to each searcher.

it sounds like you don't really want a multisearcher .. it sounds like you
just want to search each of the individual indexes and return the results
from each as seperate groups.
