: how can i compile it?

The supported method for compiling Lucene is to use the ant build.xml
file.  If you take a look at the BUILD.txt file you'll find more
information.  If you run ant "package-zip" and still get compilation
errors, please mail the complete error message and someone will probably
be ablt to help you.
