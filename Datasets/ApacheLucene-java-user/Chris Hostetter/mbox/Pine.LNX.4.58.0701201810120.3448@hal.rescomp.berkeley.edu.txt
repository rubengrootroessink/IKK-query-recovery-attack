: This exchange has caused me to reassess my syntax. It seems that
: QueryParser's handling of A B C -D -E is special because QueryParser
: does not have any operator precedence rules (unless the 1 rule is that
: all operators resolve with the same precedence <g>). What would appear

there are some precedence rules, but they really only apply when using
"AND", "OR", or "NOT" -- which as i've gone on record with many teams: are
big freaking hasks that people shouldn't use.

the big reason QueryParser doesn't have to wory about precidence, is
because it's core operators: "+" and "-" are unary, which makes sense
given the way BooleanQuery works: the "prohibited" and "mandatory"
options apply to individual clauses... in your syntax you've made all
operators binary, so you have to decide how to map those binary
opertor concepts to the unary "options" of BooleanQuery.
