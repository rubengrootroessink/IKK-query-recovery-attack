:    I'm wondering what will happened if I performance indexing and have 10
: peoples do searching at the same time? Can I retrieve the results while I do
: index, and the other way around?

Does Lucene allow searching and indexing simultaneously?

Yes. However, an IndexReader only searches the index as of the "point in
time" that it was opened. Any updates to the index, either added or
deleted documents, will not be visible until the IndexReader is re-opened.
So your application must periodically re-open its IndexReaders to see the
latest updates. The [WWW] IndexReader.isCurrent() method allows you to
test whether any updates have occurred to the index since your IndexReader
was opened.
