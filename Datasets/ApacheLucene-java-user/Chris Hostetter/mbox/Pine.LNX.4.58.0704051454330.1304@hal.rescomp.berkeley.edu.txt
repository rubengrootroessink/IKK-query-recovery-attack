1) which version of FunctionQuery are you using (from the solr repository
or from a Jira issue attachment?)
2) what is hte full stacktrace? (ie: which function/line is throwing the
Exception)

FunctionQuery supports explain just fine, not sure why you'd have
problems, oh wait ... i see exactly what hte problem is...

: The ms is a MultiSearcher.  I read that

...this is the implemnetation for MultiSearcher...

    public Explanation explain(Weight weight,int doc) {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }

...it's got nothing to do with FunctionQuery.
