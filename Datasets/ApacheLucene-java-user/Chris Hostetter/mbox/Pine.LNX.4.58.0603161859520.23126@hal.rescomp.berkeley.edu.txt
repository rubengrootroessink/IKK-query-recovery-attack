DATE: 17 Mar 2006


: And I read the following issue again:
:
: ConstantScoreRangeQuery - fixes "too many clauses" exception
: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-383
:
: But still, I cannot understand very well why ConstantScoreQuery comes out.
: Is it for to implement ConstantScoreRangeQuery? Or, is it used for something
: by itself?

ConstantScoreQuery provides the underlying mechanism that allows any
fitler to be used as a query that provides a constant score to matching
documents.  It is what a ConstantScoreRangeQuery rewrites to (wrapped
arround a RangeFilter) but it may also be usefull if you have your own
custom Filter that you want to use as a Query.
