Mark: I only read your querysyntax.php and didnt' dig into the source, but
i'm curious about the "There are no unary operators in Qsol syntax"
statement.... what is the Qsol equivilent of the QueryParser syntax: "A -B -C"

It's also not clear to me how differnet fields can be queried ... you give
creditcard[23907094 - 23094345] as an example of a range qery, but how
does one search for the word "foo" in the field "title" ?

Hmm... is there no support for query boosts?
