SUBJECT: Re: Jason format exception for stats component facet results | stddev value of NaN
DATE: 19 Nov 2010


: I am getting a mal-formatted json response when using the
: stats component with a facet that returns a stddev value of NaN ,e.g

I'm not a JSON expert, but i suspect NaN just isn't legal JSON, and the 
JSON response writer has a bug.

quick google search...
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1423081/json-left-out-infinity-and-nan-json-status-in-ecmascript
...suggests that the only valid value is "null"

please file a bug.
