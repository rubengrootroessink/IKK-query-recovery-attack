:      +p The first term preceding the second within the same paragraph:

: I am not sure lucene support this kind of search expression, How can I ?

As discussed in the past, if you inject artificial tokens denoting

accomplish this.  Search the list archives for "lucene span sentence" for
several of the past discussions.
