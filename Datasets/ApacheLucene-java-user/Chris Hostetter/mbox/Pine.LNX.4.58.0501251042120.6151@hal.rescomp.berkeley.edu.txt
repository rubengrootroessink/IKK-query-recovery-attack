SUBJECT: Re: How to give recent documents a boost?
DATE: 25 Jan 2005

: What is the best way to give recent documents a boost? Not sorting them by
: strict date order but to give them some preference. If document 1 filed
: last week has a score of 0.5 and document 2 filed last month has a score
: of 0.55, then list document 1 first. But if document 1 has a score of only
: 0.05, then keep it at the end. Any experience of fine tuning by date order?

a short thread on this subject came up fairly recently...
