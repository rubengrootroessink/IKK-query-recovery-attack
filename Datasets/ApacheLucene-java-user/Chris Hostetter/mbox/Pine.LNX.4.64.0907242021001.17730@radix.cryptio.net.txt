SUBJECT: RE: How to get rid of unused fields?
DATE: 25 Jul 2009


: : The same here, even with trunk from yesterday. If you create a field, it
: : stays there forever, even after deleting *all* documents from index,
: : reindexing without the field and optimizing.
: 
: Uwe: if you have a quick test case already written can you try it against 
: 2.4 (and maybe 2.3) because i'm pretty sure that use to work.

i just tested 2.4, 2.3, and 2.2 .. sure enough you can't seem to get rid 
of fields even when you delete all docs.

this seems like a bad thing.  so i'm oging to open an issue and hope that 
the big brains of Index Internals can see an easy way to make this work.
