: I have some questions regarding the GetMoreDocs(50) call in the
: constructors of the Hits class.

: First off whats the purposes of this call?

Hits is designed to meet the simple needs of simple clients -- the
assumption is that clients using Hits want simple paginated results - so
Hits goes ahead and gets you page#1.

: Can I do something so I don't cache up 100 docs when I'm just asking for
: a count?

This is what the search method that returns TopDocs is designed for --
when all you care about is the totalHits and the first N docs (in your
case N is 0 or maybe 1)
