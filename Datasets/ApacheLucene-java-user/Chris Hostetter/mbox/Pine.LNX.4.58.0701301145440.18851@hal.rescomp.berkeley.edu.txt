SUBJECT: RE: Score
DATE: 30 Jan 2007


: I make a BooleanQuery with the input of the user and include in the query
: title:keywordofuser headlines:keywordofuser content:keywordofuser
: I tried to Boost field title, then if keyword appear in the title, score grows like I want
to, but if keyword occurs in content or headlines score decrease more than before ...
: I would like to have a score independent for each query in the BooleanQuery, sounds basic
but I just can't achieve this.
: Is this also possible to change ?

it's really not clear to me what you are asking ... what do you mean
the score is decreased if the keyword appears in the content? ... how can
the score be independent of the sub queries? -- the subqueries are what
determine the score, there is nothing else.

Have you looked at the constructor for BooleanQuery and tried passing
"true" to disable the Coord factor? ... that eliminates the pnalty
documents get for only matching some of the clauses of a BooleanQuery --
which may be what you are describing (i'm really not sure)
