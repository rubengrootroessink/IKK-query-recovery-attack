SUBJECT: Re: Hits issue or custom filter issue?
DATE: 13 Sep 2005


: Hits h1 = oMultiSearcher.Search(new FilteredQuery(combinedQuery, new
: myCustomFilter(1)));
: Hits h2 = oMultiSearcher.Search(new FilteredQuery(combinedQuery, new
: myCustomFilter(2)));

...do you get the same results if you use...

   Hits h1 = oMultiSearcher.search(combinedQuery, myCustomFilter(1));
   Hits h2 = oMultiSearcher.search(combinedQuery, myCustomFilter(2));

...I'm not sure why you wouldn't use that method call instead anyway.

This may be another sympton of a bug that worked in the trunk when i
reported it...
