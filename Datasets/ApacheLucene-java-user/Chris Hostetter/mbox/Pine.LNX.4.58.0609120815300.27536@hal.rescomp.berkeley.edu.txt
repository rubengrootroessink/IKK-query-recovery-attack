: However the BooleanQuery's disableCoord seems to make effect.
: But I still have the problem when I'm constructing queries with wildcards.

really? ... that's strange, WildcardQuery uses the disableCoord feature of
BooleanQuery.  Do you have an example of what you mean?

: already had implemented my own similarity class that has the coord fixed
: to 1. And it doesn't work as excepted.

are you setting your Similarity as the default on your IndexSearcher prior
to executing your Queries?
