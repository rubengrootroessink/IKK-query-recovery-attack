: I currently have a boolean query which contains a MultiFieldQuery  for all

MultiFieldQuery is not a query class that comes with Lucene ... did you
write it yourself?

it sounds like what you want is a boolean query (of a
DisjunctionMaxQuery) containing a seperate phrase query for each field ...
if you just do term queries you might not get the order you want if one of
hte "words" apperas a lot more often (and in more fields) then the other.
