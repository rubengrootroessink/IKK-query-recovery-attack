: Does it make sense for me to rewrite the ShingleFilter patch to ensure
: the first token returned always has positionIncrement=1 regardless if
: enablePositions is true or false?

I don't know anything about ShingleFilter -- i've never looked at it and 
i'm not entirely certain i even understand what it does, let alone how 
your patch is attempting to modify it -- but if you've got code that takes 
in text and it produces multiple tokens as a result, then that first token 
it produces should (probably) have a non-zero positionIncrement.  if your 
code takes in "a" Token and produces multiple tokens to replace it, then 
the first token you produce should (probably) have the same 
positionIncrement as the input Token.


(Disclaimer; it's been a lon time since i worked with the TokenStream 
APIs, so i'm hoping my memory isn't faulty and someone else backs me up 
with a "yeah, that's correct")
