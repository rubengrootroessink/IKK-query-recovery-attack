SUBJECT: Re: MergePolicy public but SegmentInfos package protected?
DATE: 24 Mar 2009


: I'd rather not make SegmentInfos public; it's a large API and we do
: make changes to it as we change the index format.  It's also quite
: internal to Lucene.
: 
: Making your own MergePolicy/Scheduler is very much an "advanced" use
: case... so I think it's acceptable to have to put it into o.a.l.index
: package?

i don't know enough aboutthe APIs involved to have an opinion on this, but 
your comments lead me to conclude: if we assume subclassing MergePolicy is 
so advanced that you should only do it in the o.a.l.index package, then 
shouldn't MergePolicy itself be pacakge protected?
