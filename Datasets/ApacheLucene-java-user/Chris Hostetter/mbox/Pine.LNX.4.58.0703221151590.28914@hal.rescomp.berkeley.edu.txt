see also the FAQ "Why am I getting no hits / incorrect hits?" which points

:
: This is a pretty common issue that I've been grappling with by chance
: recently. The main point is that the parser is NOT a boolean logic
: parser.....
:
: Search the mail archive for the thread "bad query parser bug" and
: you'll find a good discussion.
:
: I tried using PrecedenceQueryParser, but that didn't work for
: me very well, search the mail archive on that and you'll see some
: examples of why.
:
: I solved this problem for my immediate issues by writing a very
: quick-and-dirty parenthesizer for my raw query. If it wasn't going
: on summer, I might see if I can contribute something by
: seeing if there's a way I can see to fix PrecedenceQueryParser.
