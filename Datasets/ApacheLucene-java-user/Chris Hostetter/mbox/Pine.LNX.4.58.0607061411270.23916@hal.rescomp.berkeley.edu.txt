SUBJECT: Re: Finding docNum of a given indexed file
DATE: 6 Jul 2006


: Could the file name (fully qualified filepath/filename) be used as the
: search
: term ?
:
: Could the entire file be stringified (one long string, with or without
: new-lines)
: and that be used as the term (probably not, since not tokenized) ?

either of those can work -- it all depends on how you want to define a
"unique" file for the purposes of deleting the old one to add the new one
-- all that matters fordeleting by term is that you can specify a term --
how big that term is is irrelevant, so you can certinaly index the full
path as an UNTOKENIZED field, or you could index the entire string
contents of the file (with newlines) as a an UNTOKENIZED Field -- it all
depends on what you consider the "same" file.
