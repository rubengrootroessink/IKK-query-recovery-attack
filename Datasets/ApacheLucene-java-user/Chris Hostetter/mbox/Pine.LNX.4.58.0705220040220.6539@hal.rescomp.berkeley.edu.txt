SUBJECT: Re: Optional terms in BooleanQuery
DATE: 22 May 2007


: BooleanQuery.Occur.SHOULD for C, D and E. However the javadocs for
: BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD states:
:
: "Use this operator for clauses that /should/ appear in the matching
: documents. For a BooleanQuery with two |SHOULD| subqueries, at least one
: of the clauses must appear in the matching documents."

Yeah, that's missleading... i've commited an updte that reads...

    /** Use this operator for clauses that <i>should</i> appear in the
     * matching documents. For a BooleanQuery with no <code>MUST</code>
     * clauses one or more <code>SHOULD</code> clauses must match a document
     * for the BooleanQuery to match.
     * @see BooleanQuery#setMinimumNumberShouldMatch
     */
    public static final Occur SHOULD = new Occur("SHOULD");

...does that make more sense?
