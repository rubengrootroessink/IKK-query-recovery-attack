: My understanding is that an optimized index gives the best search 

there is an inherent inconsistency in your question -- yo usay you 
optimize your index before using it becuase you heard thta makes searches 
faster, but in your orriginal question you said...

...if you are willing to sacrifice search performacne, why don't you just 
stop optimizing altogether?

there's very little point to optimizing unless you don't pln on 
updating the index for a while afterwards, and are trying to squeeze 
every little bit of speed out of each search.  if the time it takes to do 
the optimize is prohibitive, and you don't care if searches get a *little*
slower (and i really do suspect the difference will be fairly small, some 
really great improvements were made to searching with multiple segments a 
few point revs back) then you don't need it.
