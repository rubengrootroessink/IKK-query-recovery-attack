: You should explore the use of IndexReader.  Index your documents with
: category id field, and use the methods on IndexReader to find all
: unique categories (TermEnum).

to expand on erik's suggestion: once you know the complete list of
categories you iterate over then and execute your search once per
category, filtering each time on the category Id (to determine the number
of results from that category).
