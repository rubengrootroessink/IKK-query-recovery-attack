if you can post a short unit test demonstrating the problem, that would
help us understand the problem you are having.  At this point, i would
guess the problem relates to your custon filter.

if you look at the attachment to the bug i mentioned, you can see that the
"testFilters" method domonstrates something similar to what you
describe, with a very simple query and two very simple custom filters.
(it works, it's the testBooleanFilteredQuery method that will fail in 1.4)

Perhaps you can make minor, iterative, modifications to that test untill
you reproduce your problem.  Once that happens, people on this list might
be able to help you determine if it's a problem with your filter or a
problem with in the lucene library.
