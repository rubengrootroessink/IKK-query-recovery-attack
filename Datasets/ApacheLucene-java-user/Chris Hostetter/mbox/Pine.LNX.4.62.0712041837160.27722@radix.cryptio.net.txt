: A quick look at the code would say no, unless I am missing something. Neither
: the weight or span scorer seem to take distance into account.

uh, i think you're wrong ... SpanScorer takes the distance between the 
"end" of the spans and the "start" of the spans into account just like a 
PraseQuery considers the positions of the terms (it's just a bit more 
complicated with Spans because of the nesting that's possible)

(look for "matchLength" in SpamScorer)
