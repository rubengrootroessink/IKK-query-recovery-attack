you should check the return count from deleteDocuments ... if i had to
guess i would say that your analyzer is steming the input in such a way
that your indexed terms don't match the Term you are trying to delete on.

: Hi all,
:
: I am using the IndexModifier class to perform index modification.  I
: have deleted 1 document from an index and the output indicates that 1
: document does indeed get deleted.  However, running the program again
: reveals that the document deleted has appeared again in the index.  This
: despite the fact that I close the IndexModifier after the deletion.
: Does anyone know what I'm missing?  Here is my code:
:
:        	Analyzer analyzer = new PorterAnalyzer();
:             IndexModifier indexModifier = new IndexModifier("D:\\Index",
: analyzer, false);
:             Console.WriteLine(indexModifier.DocCount() + " docs in
: index");
:             //indexModifier.Delete(1);
:             indexModifier.Delete(new Term("artist", "hot"));
:             Console.WriteLine("Deleted a document");
:             Console.WriteLine(indexModifier.DocCount() + " docs in
: index");
:             indexModifier.Close();
:
: Cheers
