:
: is it possible to filter the hits returned from a certain query?. for
: example if I have a search like this:
: 	Query searchQuery = queryParser.parse( query );
: 	Hits  results = m_searcher.search( searchQuery );
: is there a way to use the results and find out how many of the returned
: documents their url ends with com, and how many ends with net and so
: on... without the need to form a new query?.

There was a recent thread regarding this issue, with several
implimentations suggested, each with different pros/cons depending on
the specifics of your situation...
