you obviously haven't seen the amount of spam that the apache wikis use to
get ... The account creation form currently asks you a simple question
(expanding an acronym) before it will let you create an account -- before
that rule was added several apache wikis were getting slammed with spam
links by automated bots that were even registering with the wiki and
creating account to add the spam.

I think it's a fair trade to lose out on a few wiki contributions from
people who don't want to create an account in exchange for all the other
contributions actually being available because they haven't been deleted
by a wikispambot and replaced with viagra links.
