SUBJECT: FieldSelectorResult instance descriptions?
DATE: 8 Oct 2006


there aren't any javadocs for the static instances of FieldSelectorResult,
and the javadocs for FieldSelector.accept suggest that it returns a
boolean ... can someone fill in the blanks about what the various
constants are suppose to mean?

LOAD seems obvious, NO_LOAD seems relatively clear .... the exact meaning
of LAZY_LOAD is something i'd like to clarify (so i might as well go for
broke and ask about LOAD_AND_BREAK and LOAD_FOR_MERGE too).
