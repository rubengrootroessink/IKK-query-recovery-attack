: I tried by using only the title of (5-8 words) the query documents instead
: of full text of the document. But that is also taking 0.5-1 sec for each

i can't speak to your 200-300 word BooleanQuery timings, but 0.5-1
seconds for an 8 clause BooleanQuery is very very wrong.  i suspect
there's something going on in your acctually code that wasn't conveyed in
your spuedo code.

can you post a real functional bit of java showing what exactly you are
timing (we don't need the whole index -- jsut the part of the code you
are timing)
