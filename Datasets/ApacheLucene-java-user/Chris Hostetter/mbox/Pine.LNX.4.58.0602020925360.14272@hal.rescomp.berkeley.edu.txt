Please do not cross posting to every java/lucene list you can find.  The
@jakarta lists are no longer used and forward their mail to the equivilent
@lucene lists.  The commits list exists only for people to recieve
notification about changes in the SVN repository, and people should never
send mail directly to it.

Unless you have a specific reason why you want to send mail to java-dev
regarding development of the internals of the lucene code base please send
your questions to java-user -- java-user is the correct place to send
questions about using the lucene code base.  Even if you think your
message may relate to a bug, or a possible change in the code base, do
not cross post to both lists.  Start by mailing java-user, and if people
think you have encountered a bug, or that your topic warrants discussion
about a change in API/Implimentation then the discussion can move to
java-dev.
