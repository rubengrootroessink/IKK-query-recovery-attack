SUBJECT: Re: query parser syntax -- does "-" require no-space after it to act as "prohibitor"?
DATE: 23 Jan 2007


: If you want literals, put quotes around your terms...
: "Sales +    service"

or if you don't want a full phrase, you just want "-" to be treated as
a term match you can escape it, or quote it by itself...

    Sales \- service
    Sales "-" service
