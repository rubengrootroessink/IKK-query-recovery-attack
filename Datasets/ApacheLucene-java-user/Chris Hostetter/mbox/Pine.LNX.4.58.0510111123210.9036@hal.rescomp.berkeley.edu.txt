Try Luke, see exactly what is indexed for these companies.

:
: I have a set of indexes containing business information (name, address, phone, etc).  There
are a couple particular companies that don't come up when people search for them.  I've used
our debugging app that allows lucene queries to be executed directly, and I have confirmed
this.
:
: I can find the company if I search for it in the debugging app either by its unique ID or
address, but when I search for it using query only on its exact name, it doesn't show up.
:
: Any advice for how to debug this?
:
: Thanks!
