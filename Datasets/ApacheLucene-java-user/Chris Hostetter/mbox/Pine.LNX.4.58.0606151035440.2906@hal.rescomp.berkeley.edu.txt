: I'm still trying to get my head around ConstantScorePrefixQuery. Could I
: simply use this as a drop-in replacement for PrefixQuery?

that's what it was designed to do .. you just need to grab a copy of
ConstantScorePrefixQuery and PrefixFilter from the same package
(ConstantScorePrefixQuery is just a convinient wrapper around "new
ConstantScoreQuery(new PrefixFilter(prefix))")
