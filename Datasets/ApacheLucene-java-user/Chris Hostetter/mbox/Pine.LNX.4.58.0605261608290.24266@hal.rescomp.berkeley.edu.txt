: How easy is to add new fields to the documents in the index?
: Suppose that today I can search for book title and decide that including the
: author in the search would be a good idea. How easy is to do that with
: lucene?

very.  whenevery you add a document, you specify what fields that document
has -- those fields don't have to be the same as any other document in the
past, even if there is a field with that name in some documents, but it
has differnet properties (ie stored/unstored tokenized/untokenized) that's
irrelevant to any documents you add going forward.

modifying exiting documents however (ie; to add an author field to all of
your existing "book" records) is not currently possible.
