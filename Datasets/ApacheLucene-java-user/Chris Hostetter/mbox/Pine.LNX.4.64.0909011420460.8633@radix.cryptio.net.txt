: Right, and those methods (IndexReader.lastModified and
: IndexCommit.lastModified) aren't used at all.  I guess what I meant to say

they aren't used internal in Lucene, but they are part of the public API, 
so client code (apps built using Lucene) may expect them to work for their 
own internal purposes.
