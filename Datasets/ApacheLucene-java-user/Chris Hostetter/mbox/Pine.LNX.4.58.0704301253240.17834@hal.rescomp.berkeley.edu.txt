SUBJECT: Re: Modifying norms...
DATE: 30 Apr 2007


: I want to modify the norms to only include values between 0 and 100.
: Currently, I have a custom implementation of the default similarity. Is it
: sufficient to override the encodeNorm and decodeNorm methods from the base
: implementation in my custom Similarity class ? Please let me know if there
: are any performance implications to this.

those methods are static, so it's not possible to override them.  if you
are not using doc or field boosts, overriding lengthNorm is suitable for
your goal.
