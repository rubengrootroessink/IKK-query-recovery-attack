SUBJECT: Re: Lucene scoring question (how to boost leading terms match)
DATE: 3 Oct 2006


take a look at the SpanFirstQuery ... do do "A*" type searches inside of a
SpanQuery you'll eithe need to use SpanRegexQuery, or roll your own
SpamPrefixQuery out of a SpanOrQuery containing SpamTermQueries.

:   I have a question about the lucene scoring. In my following example,
: how can I ensure the doc1 has the higher score than doc2, if I search
: for "A*". In another words, I want to boost the docs which match their
: leading terms.
:
:   doc1: Aterm  Bterm  Cterm
:   doc2: Bterm  Aterm  Cterm
