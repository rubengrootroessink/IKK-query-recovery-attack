: How do I combine two queries - one made by the QueryParser and the
: programmatically made RangeQuery?

you could make them both children of a single BooleanQuery, but as long as
you're going to write a little java code to put them together -- why not
use a DateFilter instead?

http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/DateFilter.html

...it's more efficient then a RangeQuery, it doesn't have the same
"TooManyCLauses" limitations as a RangeQuery, and it would artificially
affect the score of your results.
