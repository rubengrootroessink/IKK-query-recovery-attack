SUBJECT: Re: date filter filtering out non-dated items?
DATE: 1 Jun 2008


: While I could add a future date to these documents, this kind of feels 
: hackish and I would be interested in other ideas on how to filter out 
: expired documents.

this just came up on the solr list, the answer is equally applicable 
but note that you'll need to combine it with some other query class 
(MatchAllDocs perhaps)...

>> you have to invert your logic.  docs that "have not yet expired, or will 
>> never expire" match the negacted query for "docs expired in the past"
