: Actually I don't see how it could not be multi-threaded,
: since it seems normal to me that I run it in a web application which is
: multi-threaded for each user request ?

every application in the world is not a web application.

if you are dealing with multiple threads, you will need to o something to
ensure that threads don't try to use an IndexReader refrence while you are
in the middle of closing it and assigning a new IndexReader to it ... you
can do this with synchronization for example.
