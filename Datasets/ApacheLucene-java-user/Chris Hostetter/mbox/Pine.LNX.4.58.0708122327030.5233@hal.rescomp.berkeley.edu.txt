: Thanks. Probably this should be mentioned on the documentation page.

it does say right above the "date" example: "....  Sorting is done
lexicographically."

(Admitedly I'm not sure why the word "Sorting" is used in that sentence,
but it should make it clear that it's a lexicographical comparison)

patches to improve documentation are always appreciated!
