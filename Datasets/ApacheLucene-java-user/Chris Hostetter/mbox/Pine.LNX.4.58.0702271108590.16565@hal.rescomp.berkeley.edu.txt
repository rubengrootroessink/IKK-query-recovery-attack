IndeexWriter has an addIndexes method which takes in a directory ... so
open a new IndexWRiter pointed at the FSDirectory you want to write to and
add your RAMDirectory to it.

: Subject: recovering an index from RAM disk.
:
:
: I generate my index to the file system and load that index into a
: RAMDirectory for speed.  If my indexer fails the directory based index
: can be left in an inadequate state for my needs.  I therefore wish to
: flush the current index from the RAMDirectory back to the File system.
: The RAMDirectory class doesn't seem to support this feature.  Is this
: possible and can anybody give me some pointers ?
