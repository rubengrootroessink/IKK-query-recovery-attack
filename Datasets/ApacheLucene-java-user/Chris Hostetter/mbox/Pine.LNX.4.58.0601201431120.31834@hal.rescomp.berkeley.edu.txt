1) instead of building up a string, and giving it to QueryParser, i would
suggest you look at the MultiFieldQueryParser

2) it sounds like what you are interested regarding the category field, is
not to restrict your search to a particular handfull of categoryIds, but
to a large set of categories that have something in common.  i'm not sure
what it is that these categories have in common, but perhaps you could
make a field for it and put that in each document.   (ie:
doc.add(Field.Keyword("in_leaf_cat","1")))

if not, if you really do just want to restrict to all categories with an
id between 1 and 30000, i suggest you use a RangeFilter.  it should work
for you perfectly.

if there isn't some common property of hte categories you are interested
in that you can specify, nor are the category ids all truely sequential,
and you still need some way to specify an arbitrarily large set of
category ids to restrict your results to, a Filter is still probably a
better way to go then just building up a mongo BooleanQuery.  search the
mailing list archives for discussion about a "SetFilter" ... it's not
something anyone has written an commited, but it is a fairly simpel
concept to impliment given some of the hints from previous messages.
