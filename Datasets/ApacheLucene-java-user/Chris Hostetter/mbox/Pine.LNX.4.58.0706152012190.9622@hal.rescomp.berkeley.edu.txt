the "explain" method on a Searcher, and the Explanation classes can
explain everything baout how/why a particular document in a particular
index gets a particular score for a particular search.  The only tricky
thing about it is understanding that it refers to the "raw" scores (what
you seem to be quoting look like "normalized" scores from the Hits class,
but if your cheif concern is the relative order of hte results this is
largely irrelevent)

When looking at the Explanation info, many of the terms may not make a
lot of sense .. this is where the scoring.html document can fill in the
gaps and explain the explaination...
