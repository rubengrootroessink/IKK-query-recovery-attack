: Is my subscription working... I got no reply on my previous question.
: Sorry the disturbance.

1) if you see your message show up in one of the archives, that' a pretty 
good indication that your post made it to the list...

2) People answer questions on the Lucene lists voluntarily ... they do it 
because they want to help and they enjoy it.  but since it's not a paid 
support service, that means there is no garuntee of how long it will take 
someone to reply to any given post.  it's not that unusually for messages 
to go unanswered for  few days -- particularly when it's a 3 day holiday 
in the US.
