SUBJECT: ANNOUNCE: Application Period Opens for Travel Assistance to ApacheCon US 2008
DATE: 26 Sep 2008


NOTE: This is a cross posted announcement to all Lucene sub-projects, 
please confine any replies to general@lucene.

-------------

The Travel Assistance Committee is taking in applications for those wanting
to attend ApacheCon US 2008 between the 3rd and 7th November 2008 in New
Orleans.

The Travel Assistance Committee is looking for people who would like to be
able to attend ApacheCon US 2008 who need some financial support in order to
get there. There are VERY few places available and the criteria is high,
that aside applications are open to all open source developers who feel that
their attendance would benefit themselves, their project(s), the ASF and
open source in general.

Financial assistance is available for flights, accomodation and entrance
fees either in full or in part, depending on circumstances. It is intended
that all our ApacheCon events are covered, so it may be prudent for those in
Europe and or Asia to wait until an event closer to them comes up - you are
all welcome to apply for ApacheCon US of course, but there must be
compelling reasons for you to attend an event further away that your home
location for your application to be considered above those closer to the
event location.

More information can be found on the main Apache website at
http://www.apache.org/travel/index.html - where you will also find a link to
the application form and details for submitting.

Time is very tight for this event, so applications are open now and will end
on the 2nd October 2008 - to give enough time for travel arrangements to be
made.

Good luck to all those that will apply.

Regards,

The Travel Assistance Committee
