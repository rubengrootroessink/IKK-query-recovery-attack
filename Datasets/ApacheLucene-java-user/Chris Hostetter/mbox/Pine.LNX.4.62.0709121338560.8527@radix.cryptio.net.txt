: Excuse me, Could you give more details ?
: Are you telling me that functionality exists ?
: Which class should I use for this ?

"MoreListThis" is a class name ... it is in a "contrib" (which means it is 
not inlcuded in the main lucene jar, but it can be found by looking in the 
"contrib" directory of lucene releases.  The Lucene FAQ has a question 
titled "How do I find similar documents?" which talks specificly about 
where to find this class in various releases of Lucene (because it was 
moved)...

when googling for "MoreLikeThis" the top two hits are a blog article on 
using it, and a link to the javadocs.  explicilty searching the mailing 
list archives give you lots more great info.
