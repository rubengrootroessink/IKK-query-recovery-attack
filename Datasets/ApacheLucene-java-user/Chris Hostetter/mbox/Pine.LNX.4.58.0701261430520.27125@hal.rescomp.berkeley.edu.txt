regular Lucene BooleanQueries should work fine for this ... but you may
want to customize your Similarity so that the idf and lengthNorms aren't a
factor .. you may want to take the tf out of hte picture too (if you care
more about matching lots of terms and less about matching one term lots of
times)

the Similarity javadocs have lots of info on this stuff, and there's lots
of past discussions baoutwritting custom Similarity classes.
