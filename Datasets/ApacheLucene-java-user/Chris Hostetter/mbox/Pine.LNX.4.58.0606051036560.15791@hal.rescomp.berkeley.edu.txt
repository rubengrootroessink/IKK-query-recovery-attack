SUBJECT: Re: query parser field name aliases
DATE: 5 Jun 2006


: There is a problem with this. Java does not allow multiple inheritance
: and there are other subclasses of QueryParser. Perhaps I can fix it with
: a decorator instead.

you might be able to go with a Delegator/Wrapper .. subclass QueryParser
to inherit the grammer, override all of the normal methods you override in
a subclass to include your field aliasing, but instead of defering to
super defer to another instance of QueryParser specified at runtime.

I haven't thought through all the implications of wether it will work that
easily though .. there's a lot more intra-class "this.foo()" calls in
Queryparser then in something like Similarity that may make the Delegator
approach problamatic.

Honestly: QueryParser is such a mess, you may just want to roll your own
from scratch.
