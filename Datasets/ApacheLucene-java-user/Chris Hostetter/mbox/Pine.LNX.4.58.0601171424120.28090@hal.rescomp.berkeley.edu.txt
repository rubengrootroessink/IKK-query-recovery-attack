The concept of a category means very differnet things to different people,
but if you've got several differnet use cases that you think other people
can benefit from, by all means feel free to write up descriptions of the
problem you solved, and how you solved it and post it in the HowTo
section of the wiki.

Not all HowTo pages need to be the same style, or have the same
granularity ... feel free to just "brain dump" any ideas you want to
share.

: If that's it, that's fine.  I guess I had in mind something else?  For
: example, one of mine uses categories (something mentioned quite a bit),
: but it has some slight differences from what I've seen before.   Items
: can be in multiple locations, the categories can move around amoungst
: themselves, and a couple other issues.  Then there is an event/calendar
: system..  it allows for repeating occurances by filling the date field
: with iterations at the frequency and count of the event.     A bible
: searcher that uses different books to compare translations, allowing
: also for comments, etc.   I've talked with a couple other people and it
: seems something basic like 'categories' take on different solutions each
: time.    Maybe it's the model of the customer, but maybe there is a best
: way to do that.   I know that's in this wiki, but there are others.
: But like I said, if this is wiki is it, perfect!    Maybe it is what I
: was thinking of.
