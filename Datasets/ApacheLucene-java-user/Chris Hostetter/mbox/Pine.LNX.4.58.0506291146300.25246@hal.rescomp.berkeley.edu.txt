keep in mind, you can "store" the raw field for display purposes and
"index" many different token sequences that represent the same orriginal
data parsed in several ways -- all using the same field name.

: For a hard-core approach to this problem, you could try converting

: 0 "sort key" (the C API is col_getSortKey). This will be a string
: suitable for comparison to determine weak equality, but you can also
: just index it as a regular token.
:
: There are some subtle issues w/locale-specific behavior of the sort
: key generation step, where you could guess at the right locale to use
: for the conversion, but in general that shouldn't matter.
:
: Two other issues are code/data size (ICU can be big) and the
: performance hit while indexing documents.
