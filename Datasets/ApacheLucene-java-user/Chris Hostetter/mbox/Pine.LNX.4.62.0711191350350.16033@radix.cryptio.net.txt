SUBJECT: Re: Scoring for all the documents in the index relative to a query
DATE: 19 Nov 2007


: My simplistic view has been that all the docs returned via Hits
: or HitCollector have scores > 0, and all the rest have scores of 0,
: and this view is supported by the explanation of
: HitCollector.collect
: 
: " Called once for every non-zero scoring document, with the
: document number and its score."

(Hmmm... i thought those javadocs had been fixed a while back?  oh well, 
i just did: r596462)

Strictly speaking there's nothing to stop a document from having a zero or 
negative *raw* score for a query (ie: a ValueSourceQuery for example) it's 
just not common.

the HitCollector.collect method is called for every *matching* document, 
with it's raw score.

(I'm not actually sure how the Hits class treats negative values ... odds 
are no one using the Hits class is going to be dealing with a query that 
can product negative scores though)
