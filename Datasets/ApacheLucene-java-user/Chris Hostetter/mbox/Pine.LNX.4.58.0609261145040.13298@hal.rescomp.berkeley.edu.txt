: I am thinking should be this faster

The ConstantScoreQuery wrapped arround the QueryFilter might in fact be
faster then the raw query -- have your tried it to see?

you might be able to shave a little bit of speed off by accessing the bits
from the Filter directly and iterating over them yourself to check the
FieldCache ad build up your sorted list of the first "N" -- i think that
would save you one method call per match (the score method of
ConstantScoreQuery)

At some point you just have to wonder if it's fast enough?

how long does a typically sorted query take for you right now?

how many documents are in your index?

how many matches do you typically have?
