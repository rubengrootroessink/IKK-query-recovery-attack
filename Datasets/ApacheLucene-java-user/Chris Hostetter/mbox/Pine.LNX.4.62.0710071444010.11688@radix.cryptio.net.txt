: i dont know from which directory i have to execute this command.

it doesn't matter which directory you run it from -- that's why it says 
"{full-path-to-lucene}".  as long as you set your CLASSPATH up like the 
previous step said, then you can run that command anywhere you want, just 
keep in mind what it's going to do...

"This will produce a subdirectory called index which will contain an index 
of all of the Lucene source code."

...so that "index" directory will be in your current working directory -- 
so make sure you have write permisions for your current working directory.
