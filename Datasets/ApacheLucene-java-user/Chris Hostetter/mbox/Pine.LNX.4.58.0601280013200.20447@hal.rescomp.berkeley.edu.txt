SUBJECT: RE: problem updating a document: no segments file?
DATE: 28 Jan 2006


: this code works in a couple other boxes as is.  that deleting code

Are those boxes running the same OS?  The same JVM?

: removes the active index after this one builds in a different location.
: then the searcher is told to make this newest one the current and the
: old one is deleted.  it effects directories and their entire contents.
: it wouldnt select just a segment file.  also, like i said, this runs

I'm not convinced.

If your getIndexDirectory() method is returning a string from a config
file (or something like that) and it includes a trailing seperator (in
addition to the seperator your code adds) then the index directory would
be created fine (if i remember right, extra seperates don't generate an
exception) but your string equality test would fail and you'd try to
delete the files in the directory you just created.

If your searcher has already opened some of the files, then (depending on
your OS) the delete code may not be able to delete them -- you're not
checking the return value from subFiles[j].delete() so you have no way of
knowing.  The segments file may be the only file getting deleted, because
it may be the only file your searcher doesn't have open at the moment the
delete code runs.  If i remember right IndexSearcher only opens the
segments file to get a list of all the individual segments, and then
immdeiately closes it, but keeps the rest of hte files open permenantly.

: fine on my laptop and g5.  and actually, this code was fine till
: recently on that box.  i modified a different method and updated the
: code to this server and now i have this problem.

what was the code that changed?



: : 	    String newPath = getIndexLocation() + File.separator +
: : System.currentTimeMillis();
: :
: : 	    IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(new File(newPath),
: : analyzer, true);
:
: 	...
:
: :         writer.optimize();
: :         writer.close();
: :
: : 	SearchSO.setSearcher(newPath);
: :
: : 	File[] subFiles;
: : 	File[] subDirs = new File(getIndexLocation()).listFiles();
: :
: : 	for (int i=0;i<subDirs.length;i++) {
: : 		if (subDirs[i].isDirectory()) {
: : 			if (!newPath.equals(subDirs[i].getPath())) {
: : 				subFiles = subDirs[i].listFiles();
: : 				for (int j=0;j<subFiles.length;j++) {
: : 					subFiles[j].delete();
: : 				}
: : 				subDirs[i].delete();
: : 			}
: : 		}
: : 	}

: :     }
