: So I don't see why using a SpanNear that respects order and a large
: IncrementGap won't solve your problem...... Although it would return "odd"

i think the use case he's worreid about is that he needs to be able to
find matches just on the "start" of a persons name, ie...

	Email#1 To: Jim Bob; Sue Anne-Marie Brown; John Doe
	Email#2 To: Tom Smith; Bob Jones; John Doe

...he needs to support existing semantics that let him say "find emails
where the start of a persons name is 'bob' and it returns Email#2, but not
email#1 .. hence his interest in SpanFirst -- he wants to match the
"first" few tokens of a "value" added to a field (which isn't waht
SpanFirst does)
