: i am concerned about not being able to see the logical operator in the
: print string. Should i be able to see the operator?

I've never looked at it closely, but a quick glance at the source
indicates that the toString does not make any attempt to show the "logic"
operator used to join any of hte sub filters.

i would consider this bad behavior, feel free to open a jira issue with a
proposed patch to include that information in the toString.
