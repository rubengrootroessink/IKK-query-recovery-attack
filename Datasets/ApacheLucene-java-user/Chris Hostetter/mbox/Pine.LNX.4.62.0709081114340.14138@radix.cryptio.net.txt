(NOTE: cross posted apache announcement to all Lucene project user lists, 
please be careful about your reply-to)

Hey everybody, just wanted to forward some info from the ApacheCon US 
organizers ... the deadline for the discounted "early bird" price has been 
extended.

On the last day of the Con one room is going to be almost almost 
completely dedicated to Lucene talks from Me, Ken Krugler, Grant 
Ingersoll, and Michael Busch (with a Tomcat session in the middle just to 
cleanse your pallet).  Plus Grant is doing an all day Pre-Confrence Lucene 
training session as well for those that really want some hands on time.

With this much Lucene talk going on, I'm also confident there will be a 
nice big BOF session, plus you never know who might be sitting next to you 
at lunch :)
