: In case you have an OR like boolean query, with optional clauses only,
: it may be faster iterate over the documents of each clause seperately
: to set the document bits.

And depending on the types of "queries" you want to do, using Filter
varients and calling the bits() method directly might be even faster.

(There is not TermFilter ... but it would be trivial to write, other
Query->Filter translations would be equally simple)
