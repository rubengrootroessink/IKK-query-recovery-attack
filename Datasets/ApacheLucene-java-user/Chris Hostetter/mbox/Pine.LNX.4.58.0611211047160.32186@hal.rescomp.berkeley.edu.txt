: Could you also try a nightly build to test the later performance improvement
: on BooleanScorer2?  The nightly builds are here:
: http://people.apache.org/builds/lucene/java/nightly/
: The jar is called lucene-core-nightly.jar in the .tar.gz build.
:
: It's not likely that this is faster than the 1.4 BooleanScorer,
: but one never knows.

...and there have been other performance improvements that may make up for
it ... MultiTermDocs.skipTo for example (if you use non optimized indexes)
