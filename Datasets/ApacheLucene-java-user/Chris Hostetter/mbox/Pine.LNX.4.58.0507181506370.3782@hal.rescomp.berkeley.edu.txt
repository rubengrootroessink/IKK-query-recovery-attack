Your intuition is right, but i can't think of any reason why you need to
add the n-grams at indexing time -- or why using phrase queries would be a
bad thing in this case.  When you get a multiword query, construct the
n-grams of the query words as multiple phrase queries and search for a
BooleanQuery of all those phrases (with bigger boosts given to longer
phrases)

Using your example of "united states of america" generate a query that
looks something like...

     united states america
     "united states"^10 "states america"^10
     "united states america"^100

: Intution behind adding n-grams is to boost naturally occurring larger
: phrases versus using phrase queries. For example, if I am searching for
: "united states of america", I want the search results to return the
: documents ordered as follows
:
: Rank 1 - Documents containing all the words occurring together
: Rank 2 - Documents containing maximum number of words in the same
: sentence
: Rank 3 - Documents containing all the words but some might appear in the
: same sentence some may not
: Rank 4 - Documents containig atleast one or two words
:
: If we have a n-gram index, most probably document talking about "united
: states" gets preference over document containing "united" and "states"
: seperately. If I am correct, this can be achieved without using phrase
: queries. I am not sure if there is a better way to achieve the same
: effect.

: I can't see any real advantage of storing n-grams explicitly. Just index
