: I can see that tops.totalHits, returns all matched documents. So is this
: really "paged search", or I'm just doing a complete search and put a window
: on the returned result each time?

that's all paginated searching is ... you have to know the first 10
results to show 1-10, but you also have to know the first 20 results in
order to be able to show 11-20.
