SUBJECT: Re: Making SpanQuery more effiicent
DATE: 23 May 2006


: Unfortunately, I want to have subqueries inside my query (e.g. (t1 AND
: t2) NEAR (t3 OR t4)), and PhraseQuery seems to allow only Terms inside
: it.

In that case, you aren't just using SpanQuery for the use of slop -- you
are using the Span information, you just don't realize it (that's how all
of the SpanQueries work -- the get the Slop information from the sub
queries and propogate them up.  (which is also why you can't use just any
only Query as a clause in a SpanNearQuery)
