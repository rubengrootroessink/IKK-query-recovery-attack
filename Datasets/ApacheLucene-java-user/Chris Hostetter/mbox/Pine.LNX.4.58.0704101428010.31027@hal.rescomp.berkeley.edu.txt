SUBJECT: Re: How to sort on a tokenised field?
DATE: 10 Apr 2007


: The worse solution is to have another duplicated field which is un-tokenized
: but it is not scalable when we have lots of fields need to be searchable.

That is really the only solution that exists in in Lucene at the moment.

Typically the number of fields people want to sort on isn't that big
(even if "lots" is 10 it's still feasible to duplicate those 10 fields)
and this appraoch works very well -- people tend to run into more problems
relating to the size of the FieldCache neeeded for each sort field because
they have too many documents long before they have to worry about having
too many sort fields.

There is a fairly low impact patch for people who want to sort on
the "stored" string value of a field if you'd like to try it, but you
should search the archives for discussion about it's tradeoffs.
