in your query parser, you'll need to use an Analyzer that knows that
"documenttype" should not be tokenized, and the raw user string entered by
the user should be treated as the query Term value.

you can make you own analyzer that subclass StandardAnalyzer and only does
the special behavior for that specific field very easily.  if you have
complex rules that require very differnet analyzers for lots of differnet
fields, you'll probably want to look at PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper.

: Hi,
:
: Daniel's suggestions was quite correct. Is the "/" suposed to be turned into a whitespace?
In that case, how do I stop it? I do wish to search for the entire exact word "Blankett/Mall".

: I suggest you use toString() on the parsed query. The "/" is probably interpreted like a
whitespace and you may end up with a query "documenttype:blankett mall", i.e. "mall" searched
in the default field, not in documenttype.
:
: If that doesn't help you could create a small test case (index and search just one document)
and post that to the list.
