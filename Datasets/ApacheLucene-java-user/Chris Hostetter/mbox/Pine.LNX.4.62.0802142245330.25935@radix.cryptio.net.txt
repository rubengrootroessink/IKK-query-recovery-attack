SUBJECT: Re: regex expressions within phrase queries
DATE: 15 Feb 2008


: I was wondering if anyone has a more efficient method for achieving this.
: Would changing QueryParser.jj and developing a custom PhraseQuery class be a
: good idea?  Any comments would be appreciated.

extending QueryParser and overriding the getPhraseQuery function to return 
your own SpanNearQueries composted of SpanRegexQueries shouldn't be any 
more efficient then modifying the QueryParser grammer.  either way it's 
going to be calling some method you write that returns a SpanNearQuery.
