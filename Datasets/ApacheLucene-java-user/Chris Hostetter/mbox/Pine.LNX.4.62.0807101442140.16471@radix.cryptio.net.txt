: I have a MultiSearcher from remote using by 
: Naming.bind("rmi://"+IP+":"+PORT+"/"+NAME, RemoteSearchable)
: ,but MultiSearcher  doesn't has getIndexReader() .
: How to get IndexReader?

It's not possible to get a remote IndexReader ... that's the main 
distinction between the Searchable interface and the Searcher class -- the 
methods availabel in Searchable can be (decently) streamed across the wire 
-- but returning a whole IndexReader remotely would be ... insane ... in 
most cases.
