: thanks a lot for your reply. Currently I'm using a parallelreader, cause one
: part of index is in the memory and one part is on disk. It seems like
: parallelreader has a problem with sorting. So i have three questions:
:
: 1. Is there a know bug in the parallelreader?

not that i know of ... can you elaborate on why you think there is a
problem?

: 2. Is it true, that only fields with one single term can be sorted?

there can at most one indexed term per document ... which means you either
needed to index the Field UN_TOKENIZED you need to use KeywordAnalyzer, or
you need to know that you are only ever putting in values that get
analyzed to single Tokens.

: 3. The fields i would like to sort are indexed but not stored...is this a
: problem for sorting `?

they must be indexed, wether they are stored or not is irrelevant.
