: Lucene has historically taken the exact opposite approach... open up the API
: as needed.  Unless there is very good reason for it, classes and data should
: be kept private.

Just to clarify the reasoning behind this: once something is made public, 
the API has to be supported in perpetuity -- even if no one outside of 
the core is using it, because we don't *know* if anyone is using it.  

when things are private or package protected, committers have a lot more 
leway to commit changes that alter the API if it means better performacne, 
or easier long term maintence.
