: This is perfect, exactly what I was looking for. Thanks much Andrzej!

if you code that up and it works out well, contributing your code as a 
Jira attachment could help it become a re-usable tool for others in the 
future. 

(a simple command line that takes the directory of hte index, a 
value for N and a parent directory for all the new index directories seems 
like it would be very handy and very general purpose)
