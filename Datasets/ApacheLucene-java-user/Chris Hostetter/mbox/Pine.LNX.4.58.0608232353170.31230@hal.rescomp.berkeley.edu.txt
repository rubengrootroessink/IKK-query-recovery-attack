SUBJECT: Re: How to combine multiple fields to a single field for indexing
DATE: 24 Aug 2006


: What is generally the reason for indexing both individual fields, and the
: general-purpose "content" field ?

so you can explicitly query for "name:paris" or "city:paris" instead of
just "paris"

: name : John Smith
: food  : subway sandwich
:
: So the general-purpose "content" would have the following values:
:
: John Smith subway sandwich
:
: Hence, if the user search for "smith subway" (with quotation), the said

not exactly ... this is where the position incriment gap of your Analyzer
comes in.  you can say how much gap exists between two seperate values in
the same field, so if your gap is 10 then contents:"smith subway"~5 won't
match ... but contents:(smith subway) will
