DATE: 1 Feb 2006


: I've not used the sorting code yet, but it looks like you have to
: provide some custom ScoreDocComparator by adding a SortField using the
: SortField(String field, SortComparatorSource comparator) constructor.
: I'm just not certain what you should specify for the field value since
: you really want to just round off the score.
:
: Could someone with more experience using the Sort API clarify whether
: this is possible?

yes, it should be possible, and yes your description of a solution sounds
right ... the only odd thing is you'd be writting a
SortComparatorSource/ScoreDocComparator that would be ignoring the field
it's given, but there's nothing wrong with that.

Round your number to the desired precision, then compare them, and return
0 if they are equal so that the secondary sort (on date in this case) can
take affect.
