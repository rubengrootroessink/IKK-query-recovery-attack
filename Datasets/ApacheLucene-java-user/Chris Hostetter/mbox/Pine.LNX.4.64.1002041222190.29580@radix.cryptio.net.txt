: Since phrase query terms aren't analyzed, you're getting exact matches 

quoted phrase passed to the QueryParser are analyzed -- but they are 
analyzed as complete strings, so Analyzers that treat whitespace special 
may produce differnet Terms then if the individual "words" were analyzed 
individually (which is what happens when QueryParser is given multiple 
"words" that aren't in a quoted phrase)
