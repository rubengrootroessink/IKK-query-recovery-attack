SUBJECT: Re: using boolean operators with the PhraseQuery
DATE: 19 Apr 2006


: The code above just adds the terms of phrase2 following the
: terms  for phrase1.
: Can you give me an example building a BooleanQuery OR  for the
: newTerm1 and newTerm2.

At no point does your code use a BooleanQuery ... have you looked at the
javadocs for the BooleanQuery class?
