Well the FieldCache default value issue is a seperate problem (hence the
seperate thread where we are already discussing it) I'm just pointint out
a flaw in your Scorer: if you want to indicate that a document doesn't
match, then next/skipTO should be skipping over it.

: Does it do the comparison numerically or lexicographically?

yes it probably does what you want, i don't know about the speed issue, it
works lexigraphicaly (but that's why things like NumberTools exist to
encode numers in ways that sort lexigrahicaly)
