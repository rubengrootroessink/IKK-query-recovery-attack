: I have to keep one index though. Is there a way to reproduce an index from
: an indexReader?

asuming you have indexes that work in conjunction with eachther they 
way you want when using ParallelReader, you should (in theory) be able to 
use...

   ParallelReader r = ...;
   IndexWriter w = new IndexWRiter(...);
   w.addIndexes(new IndexReader[] { r });
   w.close();

...to "combine" those indexes into a single physical index.  but i've 
never personally tried it.  there may be quirks about ParallelReader that 
prevent this from working.
