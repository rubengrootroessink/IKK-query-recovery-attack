: What about a shutdown hook?

Interesting idea, at the moment the file is created on disk, the
FSDirectory could add a shutdown hook that checked for the existence of
the file and if it's still there (implying that the Lock owner failed
without releasing the lock) it can forcably remove it.

Of course: this assumes that LockFiles are never shared between processes
-- ie: if client A is waiting on a lock that client B is holding, does the
lock A eventually gets use the same file that B's lock was using, or does
the old lock file get deleted and a new one created ?

(I don't really understand a lot of Lucene's locking code)
