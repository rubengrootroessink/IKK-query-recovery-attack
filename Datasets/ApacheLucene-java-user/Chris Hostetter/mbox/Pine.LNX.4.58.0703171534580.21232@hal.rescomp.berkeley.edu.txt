to clarify, it's really just one approach, with an extension: Nutch is
still "timingout" the underlying Lucene calls by using a HitCollector --
it's just extending the basic concept to use a Timer thread to abort at
the timeout without waiting for a collect call to notice that too much
time has elapsed.

This Timer version Nutch is using certainly seems like a more robust and
elegent approach to me ... i'm just shy about spining up Threads ... i
think it stems from making lots of disasterous multithreading mistakes in
C code when i was a foolish young engineer.
