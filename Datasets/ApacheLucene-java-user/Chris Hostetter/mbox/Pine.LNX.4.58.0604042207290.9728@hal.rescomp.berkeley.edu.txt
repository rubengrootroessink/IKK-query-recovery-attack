: We take an approach somewhere down the middle...
	...
:      FuzzyQuery q = ...
	...
:      FilteredTermEnum enum = q.getEnum(reader);
	...
: In fact our own code takes any query and looks at the type of it to
: extract terms from it, potentially recursively if it encounters a
: BooleanQuery.  It would be Really Nice [TM] if Lucene had a method on
: the Query class to do this directly. :-)

Isn't that what Query.extractTerms is for?  Isn't it implimented by all
primitive Queries, so you should be able to say...

	HashSet terms = new HashSet();
	query.rewrite(reader).extractTerms(terms);

...and have yourself a list of all the terms?
