: Is the query "cat dog"~6 same as (cat dog)~6 ?
: I think both case will search for "cat" and "dog" within 6 words each other.
: But I am getting different number of results for the above queries. The
: second one may be the higher. Please clarify this.

i don't believe:    (cat dog)~6     is even a legal query in the Lucene 
QueryParser sytnax ... it isn't documented, and it doesn't work in Lucene 2.2.
