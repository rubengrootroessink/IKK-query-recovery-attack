more specificly: opening an IndexReader on a an index with multiple
segments is functionally the same as opening a MultiReader on several
indexes with single segments.

so instead of having one index, and carefully controlling maxMergeDocs,
you could manually create many small indexes, all of which you
continiously optimize (both to remove deletions, and to keep the index at
a single segment) which you then explicly open a multi reader on.
