: I think that overriding getFieldQuery would work, yeah... you're right.
:    It's just a matter of comparing efficienty of this:
:
:      BooleanQuery of (TermQuery, FilteredQuery of (AllDocsQuery, Filter))
:
: to the efficiency of this:
:
:      FilteredQuery of (TermQuery, Filter)

the third option is as easy to impliment as the first, and probably close
to being as efficient as the second...

       BooleanQuery of (TermQuery, ConstantScoreQuery(Filter))
