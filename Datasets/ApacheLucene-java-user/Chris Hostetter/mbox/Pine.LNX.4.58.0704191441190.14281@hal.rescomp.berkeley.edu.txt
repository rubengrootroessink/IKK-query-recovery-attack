i'm not udnerstanding your problem ... not every document needs to have
the same fields, and not every field of every document needs to have hte
same number of values.  you cna have a field falled field3_equal_field4
and only use it for hte documnts where it's true, and then it's easy to
query on ... you can do this for every permutation of fields you've got
and as long s you omitNorms on these ields, it won't "cost" much for your
index.  (althought i would suggest instead a sime "fields_have_same_value"
field where the tokens are "field3_field4" just for simplicity)
