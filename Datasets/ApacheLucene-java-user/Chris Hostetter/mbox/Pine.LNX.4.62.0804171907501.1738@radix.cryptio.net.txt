: But then the FieldCache is just starting to feel alot like column-stride
: fields
: (LUCENE-1231).

that's what i've been thinking ... my goal with LUCENE-831 was to make it 
easier to manage FieldCache and hopefully the norms[] as well particularly 
in the case of reopen ... but with column-stride fields the need for both 
of those might go away completely)

that doesn't mean LUCENE-1231 won't still be usefull .. it could probably 
still be leveraged by things like CachingWrapperFilter, and some of the 
Solr caches to reduce the amount of work on reload -- i just don't know 
that FieldCache will really need to exist in the future.
