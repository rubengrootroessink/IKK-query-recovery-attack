: PS: I am a newbie to the mailing list - I hope I've got the etiquette right

you may have figured this out already, but please CC email to
multiple lucene mailing lists -- in this particular case,
lucene-users@jakarta is just a legacy alias that points at java-user@lucene -- so
there's *really* no reason to send to both.
