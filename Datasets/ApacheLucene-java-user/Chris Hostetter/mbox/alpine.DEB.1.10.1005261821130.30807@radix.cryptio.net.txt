It would be helpful to know:
1) what version of Lucene you are using
2) what exactly like 167 of LibraryBuilder looks like (ie: what options 
are you using when instantiating the IndexWRiter)
3) what filesystems are using on each of the two different machines you 
are using.
4) does it really say "\\whatever\index" ? ... that's the actual directory 
path you are using on both machines?  and that same path works on one 
machine but not the other?

: Hi Everyone,
: 
: Thanks in advance for any help.
: 
: I've been building lucene index to a MS Windows Server 2003 test
: environment with no problem. When attempting to build the same index
: onto a Windows Server 2008 machine I get the following error:
: 
: Cannot create directory: \\whatever\index

: 	at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.<init>(IndexWriter.java:1108)
: 	at qp.builder.LibraryBuilder.buildNewLibrary(LibraryBuilder.java:167)
: 
: I found some info via google where people were having a similar issue
: now and then, but this is always. Anyone had a similar issue?
: 
: Thanks,
