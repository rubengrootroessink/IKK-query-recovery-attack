: I'd *strongly* recommend, if you haven't, just using the regular
: FSDirectories rather than RAMDirectories and only getting
: complex if that's too slow...

...and if you are "Multi Searching" over a bunch of local directories
anyway, then use a single INdexSearcher on a MultiReader instead ...
that should be much faster then youre MultiSearcher.
