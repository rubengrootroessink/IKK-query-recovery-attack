SUBJECT: Re: DisjunctionMaxQuery with tie breaker=1 same as MultiFieldQueryParser?
DATE: 11 Mar 2010


: If I want to search let's say "ipod" in three different fields (device,
: sound,technology)
: Would be the same to use a DisjunctionMaxQuery with the tie braker = 1 than
: to use a MultiFieldQueryParser with and OR to build the boolean queries?

strictly speaking even with tie breaker of 1, a DisjuctionMaxQuery differs 
from a BooleanQuery in the details of how the score is calculated when a 
document matches *some* of the subclasses, but not all  ..  there is no 
"coord" concept in DisjunctionMaxQuery.

If you look at the explain output of various queries agaisnt various docs 
you'll see what i mean.
