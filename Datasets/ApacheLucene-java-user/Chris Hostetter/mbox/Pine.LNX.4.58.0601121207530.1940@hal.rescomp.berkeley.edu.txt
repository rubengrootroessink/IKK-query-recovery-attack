: Yes, that's precisely what I am talking about. Sorry for being unclear.

I would start with the most straight forward appraoch: try executing
queries where each permutation of the input is grouped into phrases.
start with the phrases that include the fewest number of words first, that
was if "A B" isnt' a valid phrase, yo know you can skip "A B C".  design
your API so that you can specify a "max time to look" and once that time
has past give up on looking for more phrases.

wants youv'e got that, you might be able to optimize the order that you
test phrases by looking at the TermFreq for each of hte individual words,
and trying the phrases hat include hte most common term first (and the
second most common term second, etc...)
