Asking people to write some code for you isn't typically an effective 
strategy to get assistance.  You're more likely to get assistance from the 
community if you provide some indication that you've at least looked at 
the Lucene APIs and made some attempt at investigating a solution for 
yourself -- ideally br asking specific questions about things you've 
tried that haven't worked for you...

That said: if you have no experience and/or interest in java code, and 
just want someone to write it for you, there are a list of 
people/companies that provide services for hire...
