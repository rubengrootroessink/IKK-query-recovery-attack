DATE: 5 Dec 2007


first off: if you are looking at the score from the "Hits" class, bear in 
mind they are "psuedo-normalized" and don't mean much.

second: a "query" doesn't have a score, a document has a score relative to 
a query ... scores can't be compared between different queries.

third: there is a "queryNorm" that comes into play, it's designed to keep 
scores "managable" you can read more about it (and how to change it if you 
want) in the scoring documentation.  you should also look at the 
"Explanation" info for each query/doc to make sure you understand what's 
going on.



: For example:
: apple
: 
: Has the same score as:
: apple^3
: 
: But repeating the term will up the score
: apple apple apple
: 
: I expected the score to go up when boosting a one term query.  Is that a
: wrong expectation?
