SUBJECT: Re: post-normalization score filter
DATE: 24 Aug 2005


It doesn't look like there were any replies to this while i've been away,
so i just wanted to point out that this isn't really a practicle thing to
do because the score's don't have any meaningfulll absolute value (ie: you
can't compare the scores from one search with the scores of another).  the
first Hit will allways have a score of "1" and the score of the other hits
will be normalized against the first one.

I've added this to the FAQ as "Can I filter by score?"

: Subject: post-normalization score filter
:
: I've seen a few posts which reference using a HitCollector to help
: filter the returned document's scores.. but are there any
: implementations out there that perform this filter of results by score
: after they've already been normalized, short of walking the hits
: array.... If i was to walk hits until i reach my threshold, just
: checking the hits.score() ... what am I looking performance wise, are
: the scores all calculated at this point and I'm simply accessing them
: or are they normalized on the fly?
:
: Obviously I can trim my results a bit for results that score a million
: documents only allow the first few thousand as results, but even in
: the case of where I might get two thousand results, the lower end
: results have such minimal scores in comparison to the earlier that it
: seems unintuitive for them to be accessible.
:
: thanks as always!
