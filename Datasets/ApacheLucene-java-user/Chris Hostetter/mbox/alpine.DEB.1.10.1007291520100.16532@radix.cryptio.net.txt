: 
: These APIs are very different in the next major release (4.0) of
: Lucene, so except for problems spotted by users like you, there's not
: much more dev happening against them.

To be clear: the 3.x branch is still under active development, so if you 
spot performance improvements that can be made (while maintaining API back 
compat) then those suggestions would absolutely be welcome -- but many 
developers working on Lucene internals are more focused on potential 
performance enhancements to the 4.x branch of development (trunk)
