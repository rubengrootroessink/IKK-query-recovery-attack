: Does anyone have the file IndexWriter.java?

your question is very perplexing.  are you looking for the class that
comes with lucene? ...

http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.java?rev=372350&view=markup

...or are you looking for some other more high level API that just happens
to have the same name?
