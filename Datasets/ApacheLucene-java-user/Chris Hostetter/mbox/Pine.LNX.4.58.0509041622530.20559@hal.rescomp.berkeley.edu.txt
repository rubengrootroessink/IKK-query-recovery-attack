DATE: 4 Sep 2005


I don't use Eclipse, (and in fac i've never acctaully built the from
source) but if i remember correctly, one of the main reasons why the
"sandbox" was retired and everything in it was moved to where it is in the
"contrib" directory was so Lucene and all of the "contrib"uted code could
be compiled as part of one larger project.

I believe that if instead of checking out
"lucene/java/trunk/contrib/surround/java" and
"lucene/java/trunk/contrib/surround/test" and treating them as seperate
projects, you mind find things a whole lot easier if you just checkout
"lucene/java/trunk" and treat that as one whole project.

lucene/java/trunk/build.xml has the targets "build-contrib" and
"test-contrib" which should do everything you need to do.

If for some reason you find that those are too general for your purposes,
there is also a single lucene/java/trunk/contrib/surround/build.xml file
that can be used directly for both building and testing just the surround
package, but it does require that
lucene/java/trunk/contrib/contrib-build.xml and some other files from
lucene/java/trunk/ are checked out, so you might as well just check out
the whole thing.

: Subject: Lucene contrib (surround), Subversion, and Eclipse
:
: Hello,
:     I am new to subversion, junit and the Lucene contrib repository. I
: am looking over the 'surround' project at the moment. If there is anyone
: out there with Eclipse experience who uses the contrib subversion (or
: cvs) repository could you look over my approach listed below?
:
: I am using Eclipse (3.1.1) and have the Subclipse plugin.
: I have connected to the repository at:
: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf
: (no username or password)
:
: I then navigate to
: Lucene/java/trunk/contrib
: and I see the 'surround' project.
:
: I checked out
:     'surround/java' into a java project named 'surround-java'
:     'surround/test' into java project named 'surround-test'
:
: I checked out  the Lucene source code into a java project named 'Lucene
: Source' (could have simply used a recent Lucene jar file I _think_)
:
: I added the "Lucene Source" project as a required project for
: 'surround-java' to resolve dependencies.
:
: I added the "Lucene Source" project as a required project for
: 'surround-test' to resolve dependencies.
: I added junit.jar as an external library 'surround-test' to resolve
: dependencies.
:
: This seemed to build clean, and I then ran a junit test (e.g.
: Test02Boolean.java) via 'Run as...' 'Junit Test' (Alt-Shift-X, T)
:
: Everything (23/23) passed, so I think I have my environment set correctly.
:
: Is there a more direct way to this? I assume the ant build.xml file
: would solve some of these issues, especially if I wanted to build
: several/all of the contrib projects. I was getting some errors with the
: build scripts, almost certainly due to my ignorance regarding ant build
: scripts.
:
: I would be happy to post a revision of these steps if someone else might
: benefit from this information. I assume though that anyone (else)
: wanting to play with Lucene development code would already be familiar
: with these steps, so it's probably not an issue.
: Thanks,
:
: Sean
