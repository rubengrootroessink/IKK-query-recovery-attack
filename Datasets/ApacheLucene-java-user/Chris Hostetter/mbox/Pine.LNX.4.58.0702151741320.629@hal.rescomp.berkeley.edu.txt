Thinking about this a little more: my short term advice to you would be to
use FieldCache.getCustom with your own SortComparator that just returns
the Float/Int value parsed fro mthe string ... the Comparable[] should
default to "null" for any doc that doesn't have a value for the field, so
you'll be able to tell which ones have no value.
