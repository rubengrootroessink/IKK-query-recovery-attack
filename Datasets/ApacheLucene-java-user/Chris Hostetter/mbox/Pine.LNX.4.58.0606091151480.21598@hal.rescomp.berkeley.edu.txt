: That kinda would be the point - "contents:germany" would get the same
: fileIDs, but "contents:germany title:medicine" would (hopefully) give
: us a more specific query.

when you say "contents:germany title:medicine" i'm not sure if you are
assuming that both clauses are mandatory or optional ... if they are
optional then yeah you can do that, and in some cases you'll get the same
fileID twice .. if you mean you want the list of fileIDs that match both
clauses, you're not going to get any results back -- because no doc with a
contents field is going to have a title field, and no doc with a title
field is going to have a contents field.
