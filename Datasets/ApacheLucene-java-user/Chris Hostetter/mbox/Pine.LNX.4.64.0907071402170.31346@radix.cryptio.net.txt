SUBJECT: Re: Alternative scoring of BooleanQuery
DATE: 7 Jul 2009


: false). In my context this is not really what I want. I would prefer to have a
: simple "maximum" function over the scores of the subqueries. Since I do not
: consider myself an expert in the internal working of Lucene, is there an easy
: way to achieve this or do I have to reimplement the whole BooleanQuery class?

Try a DisjunctionMaxQuery with a tie breaker value of 0.0f
