SUBJECT: RE: New "Stream closed" exception with Java 6 - solved
DATE: 17 Sep 2009


: It turns out that the cause of the exceptions is in fact adding an item 
: twice - so you were correct right at the start :-)  I ran a test where I 

glad to see it all worked out.

: Just a minor point: isn't Lucence in a position to detect the duplicate 
: insertion attempt and flag it with something less vague than "Stream 
: closed"?  :-)

not really ... adding a document multiple times is a perfectly legal use 
case, adding a document with a "Reader" based field where the reader is 
already closed ... that's not legal (And Lucene doesn't really have any 
way of knowing if the Reader is closed because *it* closed it.
