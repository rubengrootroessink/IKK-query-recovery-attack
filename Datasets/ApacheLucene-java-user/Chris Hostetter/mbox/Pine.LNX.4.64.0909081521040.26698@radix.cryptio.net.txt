the mailing list is finicky about attachments ... the best thing to do is 
to include your test case directly in the body of your email as plain 
text.

it sounds like perhaps you just need to group your clauses...

  data:HELLO (uw-reference:HELLO +uw-uwb:HELLO)

...if HELLO is in data, you'll get a match regardless of the other fields.  
if it's not in data, but it is in uw-reference, it will only match if it's 
also in uw-uwb.
