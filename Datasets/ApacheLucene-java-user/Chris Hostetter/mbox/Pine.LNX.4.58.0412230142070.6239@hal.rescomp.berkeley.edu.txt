SUBJECT: Re: sorting on a field that can have null values
DATE: 23 Dec 2004


: I thought of putting empty strings instead of null values but I think
: empty strings are put first in the list while sorting which is the
: reverse of what anyone would want.

instead of adding a field with a null value, or value of an epty string,
why not just leave the field out for that/those doc(s)?

there's no requirement that every doc in your index has to have the exact
same set of fields.

If i rememebr correctly (you'll have to test this) sorting on a field
which doesn't exist for every doc does what you would want (docs with
values are listed before docs without)
