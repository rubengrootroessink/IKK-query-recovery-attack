: when using a new Similarity class.

as discussed: norms are a value explicitly stored in your index, so the
easiest way to ensure that they don't factor into the score is to use
OMIT_NORMS (or use your custom SImilarity with your customlengthNorm
function) when indexing.

once your index is built, the only way to ignore norms is with a custom
IndexReader (it's the "IndexReader.norms" method you need to worry about)

fortunately FilterIndexReader solves a lot of the busy work so you can
focus on just the norms method.
