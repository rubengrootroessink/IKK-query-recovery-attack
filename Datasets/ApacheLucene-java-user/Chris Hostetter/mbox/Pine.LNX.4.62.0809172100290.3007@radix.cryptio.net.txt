: I know in applications where we search for a words or phrases and expect 
: the result sorted by relevance, TopDocCollector would work like a dream. 
: But what about scenario where the result needs to be sorted 
: chronologically or by some kind of metadata.

These two methods are available, and aren't deprecated...
 TopFieldDocs 	search(Query query, Filter filter, int n, Sort sort)
 TopDocs 	search(Query query, Filter filter, int n)
