SUBJECT: Re: Query for "Bigger then" specific term
DATE: 11 Mar 2008


: I know there's a range query where I can use a large upper bound but maybe
: there's something more efficient (instead of Lucene transfrom to query to
: thousands of OR queries).

If you use ConstantScoreRangeQuery then there is no transformation per 
term - just a uniform score if hte document contains a value in the range
