SUBJECT: Re: How does the lucene normalize the score?

: ..but this means, that the scores are not comparable across queries,
: because a hit with the score '0.7' from one query mustn't be as 'good' as
: a '0.7' from another query...and this is only the case, whether the original,
: unnormalized top score value was less than 1.0.

Scores are not comparable between differnet queries, regardless of wether
the scores from one query are normalized or not.  This is mentioned in the
FAQ...
