: Roughly speaking:
:
: * Documents containing *all* the search terms are good
: * Matches on rare words are better than for common words
: * Long documents are not as good as short ones
: * Documents which mention the search terms many times are good

Be wary of the distinction between "term" and "word" and how that affects
statements like "Long documents are not as good as short ones" ... If you
have a title field and body field and one document has a really long body,
but a very short title then a search on the title isn't going to be
penalized by the length of the body ... you have to choose your words
carefully.
