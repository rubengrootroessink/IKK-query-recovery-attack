SUBJECT: Re: Does lucene support distributed indexing?
DATE: 28 Apr 2008


: There are actually several distributed indexing or searching projects in 
: Lucene (the top-level ASF Lucene project, not Lucene Java), and it's 
: time to start thinking about the possibility of bringing them together, 
: finding commonalities, etc.

I would actually argue that almost all of the examples you listed describe 
"distributed searching" to query multiple shards.

As far as i know, none of them address the "distributed indexing" aspect: 
throw some raw data at the system and trust that it it will be indexed by 
one (or more) shard(s) in a way that "evenly" distributes the indexing 
"load"
