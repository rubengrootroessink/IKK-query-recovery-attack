: Btw, this is the statement the sort field is added to the document.
:
: 	doc.add(Field.UnIndexed("_s" + sortField, sortableData ));

Um ... only index fields are sortable ... are you sure you are sorting on
the field you think you are?

It's possible that since you are trying to sort on an UnIndexed field,
lucene is happily sorting all of them as if they have the same value (the
empty value) and you are just getting them in docid order instead.
