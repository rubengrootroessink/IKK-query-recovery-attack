: But when my code runs, I get a NullPointerException in Lucene's
: SortComparator,
: line 54 which reads:
: 
: 	return cachedValues[i.doc].compareTo (cachedValues[j.doc]);
: 
: because cachedCalues[i.doc] is null.  But why is it null?

I'm going to guess you have a doc where that field doesn't have a value.  
ordinarily that's fine, but maybe SortComparator doesn't handle 
that case very well.  what's the full stack trace look like?
