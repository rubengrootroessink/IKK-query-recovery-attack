DATE: 6 Jul 2007


:   A possible solution is store in a document object two fields: the original
: and the lowercased. I use the last one to make the query, and the other one
: to show the results. It works, but it doesnt smell good!

if your analyzer is what does hte lowercasing then you don't need two
seperate fields, the stored value (returned to you for displaying to the
user) is unaffected by the analyzer, only the query options and sorting
are affected by the indexed values produced by your analyzer
