if you've got enough ram, and you really want everything loaded into
memory, you can allways use a RAMDirectory.

even if you want your index stored on disk for persistence, you can open a
RAMDirectory that mirrors an FSDirectory and use the RAMDirectory for
searching...

your OS's filesystem cache.
