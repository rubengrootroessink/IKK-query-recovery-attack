: Another approach would be to index this as:
:
: token:       use   power      query for advanced searches
:                     powerquery
: position:    0     1          2     3   4        5
:
: Then use phrase queries with slop=1, to permit a one-token gap when
: someone searches for "use powerquery for advanced searches".

right, but in your example "1" is a magic number that works because we are
only dealing with "multi-word synonyms" of 2 words.  in general, this
approach requires that you pick some some N such that you are garunteed no
synonym contains more then N-1 words, and set the token positions to...

 token:       use   powerquery         for  advanced  searches
                    power      query
 position:    0     N          N+1     2N   3N        4N
