: It is possible to always have Lucene end up with the
: same set of index filenames for each index generation
: process?

this smells like an XY problem .... why do you car what the file names 
are? that's an implementtaion detail of lucene -- the directory as a whole 
is the index -- what are you trying to do that you are concerned about 
wanting to "rename" the files?

XY Problem

Your question appears to be an "XY Problem" ... that is: you are dealing
with "X", you are assuming "Y" will help you, and you are asking about "Y"
without giving more details about the "X" so that we can understand the
full issue.  Perhaps the best solution doesn't involve "Y" at all?
