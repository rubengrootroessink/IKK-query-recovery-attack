: If I use a sort on the datefield and perform a query (with that sort)
: will it always rebuild the whole cache or just the cache for the actual

the FieldCache is built for all documents so that it's completleyte
reusable for any search that sorts on that field -- as long as you keep
your IndexSearcher open.
