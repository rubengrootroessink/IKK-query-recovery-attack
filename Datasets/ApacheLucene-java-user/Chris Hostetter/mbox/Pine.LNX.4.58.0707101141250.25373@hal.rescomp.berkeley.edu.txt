: Does anyone know if the RangeFilter  is a cached filter? I could not
: tell from the api.

Generally speaking classes only document what they do, not what they
*don't* do ... so if the javadocs don't say anything about caching, then
it doesn't have any caching.

more specificly, the existence of CachingWrapperFilter makes it
unneccessary for any other filter to implement caching ... which is why
QueryFilter has been deprecated in favor of QueryWrapperFilter.
