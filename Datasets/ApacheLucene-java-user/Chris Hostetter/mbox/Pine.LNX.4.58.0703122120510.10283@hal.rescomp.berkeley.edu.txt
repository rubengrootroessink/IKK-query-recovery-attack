:
: I have a question regarding the close() CSIndexInput class, why there is
: no close operation defined...
: Like ...
: base.close()

i'm not expert on this kind of thing, but since CSIndexInput only reads
from a portion of another IndexInput, closing base seems like a bad idea
... super.close() might make sense, but not base.close() i don't think.
