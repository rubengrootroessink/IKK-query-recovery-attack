: No, as far as I know you can't combine wildcards in phrases. This would

The QueryParser doesn't support it, and there is no native query type 
for it, but if you are willing to do the query expansion yourself, you can 
build a MultiPhraseQuery (where you generate the terms using a 
WildcardTermEnum)  

alternately, you could use something like SpanRegexQuery in combination 
with a SpanNearQuery.

...lots of things are possible with Lucene Queries that just aren't 
possible with the QueryParser.
