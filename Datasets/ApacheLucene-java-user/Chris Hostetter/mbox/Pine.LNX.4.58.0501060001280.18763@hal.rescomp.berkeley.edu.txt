how big is your index?  What are the term frequencies like in your index?
how many differnt queries did you try? what was the structure of your
query objects like?  were you using a RAMDirectory or an FSDirectory? what
hardware were you running on?

Is your test application small enough that you can post it to the list?

I haven't done a lot of PMA testing of Lucene, but from what limited
testing i have done I'm a little suprised at those numbers, you'd get
results just as good if you ran the queries sequentially.
