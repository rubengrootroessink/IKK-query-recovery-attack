I think we've moved well beyond the point where anyone can offer you
suggestions based purely on a description of hte problem.

As i mentioned in my last post, can you post some code that demonstrates
the problem (ie:  writes some arbitrary docs, opens a searcher, does a
query that returns N results, adds some more docs, reuses the searcher to
execute the same query and now gets M results).

:
: Hi again Erick.
:
: Yes I know the hits exists in the index at all time.
:
: I will illustrate exactly with approximently values for the hits.length():
:
: Mergefactor 10.
: MinMergeDocs 5000.
:
: Searching for a very common Swedish word ("han" which equals to "he" in English).
:
: Indexing 100000 docs.
:
: After 1000 docs I do a search. Lets say I hit 200 docs.
: Now my searcher will be hold for 3 minutes time.
:
: After those three minutes lets say I got the following index structur:
: 5 x 5000 docs in FSDir
: And 1000 docs in RAMDir
: Total : 26000 docs
:
: The search now yields 220 results, but since I'm sorting on date and adding the oldest first
I see the newest added hits.
:
: Holding this searcher for 3 minutes.
:
: After three minutes lets say I have the following index structure:
: 1 x 50000 docs in FSDir
: 2000 docs in RAMDir
:
: The search now yields 10000 hits. Which seems a lot more appropriate.
:
: 3 minutes later:
:
: 1x50000
: 5x5000
: + 1000 RAMDir
:
: Search hits count: 10111.
:
: And after the big 100 000 merge ( 2 x 50000 ) I will get approximately 20000 hits.
:
: ---
: As you can see it's a very strange behavior. At some points the hits.length() can even temporary
decrease from the previous length.
:
: I will have to point out that I have a minMergeSize for the IndexWriter working on the FSDir
set to 5000. I also have a separate RAMDir and another IndexWriter that is writing to that
RAMDir until my own RAMDir have 5000 docs. Then I flush it into the FS IndexWriter ( which
will result in a immediate disc write ). This way I have total control over when the disc
writes occurs.
:
: And yes I'm afraid that this will affect my system in a very negative way. Cause my clients
will browse the index on their stored search profiles.

: I think, but am not certain (chime in here guys) that this is expected
: behavior. As I remember from various threads, internally indexing uses a
: RAMdir to accumulate data until it merges it with the FSDir. Since the
: searcher and indexer are separate, I assume that the searcher is looking at
: the snapshot that is on disk and missing that in the RAMdir. After you
: merge, the RAMdir data has been added to that on disk, and the two are "in
: synch".
:
: So I guess my real question is "why do you care"? Is this affecting your
: application or is this an anomaly that you want to understand so you don't
: get surprised? If the latter, I think you're OK if you open your index after
: merging, you'll have the data available....
:
: BTW, I assume that when you say hits.length() is not correct, you're getting
: fewer hits than you *know* are in the index (including the stuff you're
: currently indexing but haven't merged yet).
