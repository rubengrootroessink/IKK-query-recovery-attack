I *believe* that because of the ConjunctionScorer in 1.9, BooleanQueries
consisting of all required terms are now optimized for situations like
this, the Scorer for the common clause won't be asked to score things that
the un-common clause has allready given a score of 0.0.

: I have a index with documents that have only 2 fields, the first
: (unique) is 'very unique', in that most document have at least somewhat
: varying terms, the second is a boolean that contains only (boolean)
: 'true' or 'false'. The index contains 100,000,000+ documents.
: If I perform the following search "+unique:somevalue +boolean:true',
: lucene with search on the first term, returning very few documents, but
: then it will search the second term, returning possibly a million+
: documents, then it will intersect the list, return 'hits' of only a few
: documents.
: [. . .]
: This behavior has been observed with the 1.3 final code.
