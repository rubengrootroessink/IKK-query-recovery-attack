: I was looking at the new 1.9 api and can't seem to find this expert mode
: of searching.

yonik's refering to all of the methods in the Searcher class that have
"Expert" in their (javadoc) description.

: http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/IndexSearcher.html#search(org.apache.lucene.search.Weight,%20org.apache.lucene.search.Filter,%20org.apache.lucene.search.HitCollector)

...that method isn't labeled "expert" but it also uses raw scores
(HitCollector's have allways recieved the raw scores)
