: "svnversion": java.io.IOException: error=2, No such file or directory

: and my jar files are not created...wt to do?

it's an informative message that execing svnversion failed because it 
wasn't found ... but the build itself was successful (ie: the jar file 
should have been created) ... are you certin it didn't work at all

(NOTE: it looks like grant opened LUCENE-1159 to try and make the message 
more clear)
