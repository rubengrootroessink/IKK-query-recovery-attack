SUBJECT: Re: Filter query method
DATE: 7 Nov 2006


:    Is there anyone built your own filter query before, in order to perform
: search within search results. Meaning after the first search, the result is
: cached and the second search searches the result that return from the first
: searched, and is not searching the whole index again.
:
:    Just wondering by using Hits, can it achieved the result above?

1) it's typically not neccessary to worry about the caching of the results
too much for the simple cases that Hits can be used in.

2) you have to decide what semantics you are interested in ... is it a
"search A within a result set B" where the score is only based on query A,
or is it a "search on A and B" where A and B both make up the score?

...in the first case, you can use the serch method that takes a Filter
and some caching is possible, in the second case BooleanQuery is what you
really want.
