: Is there anyway I can change luicene to rank longer documents with more
: phrase occurences higher

if what you care about is only the number of occurences, and you don't
want the length to be a factor at all, then using Field.setOmitNorms(true)
on the Field for every document you add will not only accomplish this, but
will also save one byte per field per document in your index.

that can add up if you have a lot of fields whose length you don't care
about.
