SUBJECT: Re: Customizing termFreq
DATE: 12 Dec 2004

: H1:"text in H1 font"
: H2:"text in H2 font"

: content:"all the text"
:
: The problem is that query of a type
:         +(H1:xyz)
: is getting scored with the termFreq of xyz in the H1 field whereas I want
: it be scored using the termFreq of xyz in the entire document (i.e.
: content field)

so why not query for "+(content:xyz)" .. or is the problem that you only
want to get back docs with xyz in an H1, but you want the score based on
the whole doc?

if that's the case, then construct a Filter with the requirement of
(H1:xyz) and make youre query (content:xyz)
