: program at ApacheCon 2006. The Solr talk looks interesting.

Why thank you :)

: I was wondering if there have been any other self/semi-organized things
: around Lucene in the past, like a BOF?

This will be my first ApacheCon, so i can't speak to what's happened in
the past -- but I'm certainly up for putting some faces to some names.
