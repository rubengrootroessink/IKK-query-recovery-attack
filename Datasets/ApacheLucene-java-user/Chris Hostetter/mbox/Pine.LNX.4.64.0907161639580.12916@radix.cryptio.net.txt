SUBJECT: RE: How to get rid of unused fields?
DATE: 16 Jul 2009


: The same here, even with trunk from yesterday. If you create a field, it
: stays there forever, even after deleting *all* documents from index,
: reindexing without the field and optimizing.

Uwe: if you have a quick test case already written can you try it against 
2.4 (and maybe 2.3) because i'm pretty sure that use to work.

(the reason i'm confident is because once upon a time, before solr 
implemented special logic to make "<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>"

explicitly removing the index directory the FAQ on changing schemas told 
people to make sure to optimize before reindexing so the field stats would 
be removed.)
