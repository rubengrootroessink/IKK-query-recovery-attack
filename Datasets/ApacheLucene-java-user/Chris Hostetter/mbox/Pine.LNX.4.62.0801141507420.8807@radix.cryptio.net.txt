I'm 99% certain this message isn't coming from anything in the "Apache 
Lucene Java" code base ... this looks like an erro from the "WikiMedia 
Lucene Search" plugin.  Unfortunately the docs for that plugin: 

 1) do a really shitty job of distinguishing/disambiguating "Apache Lucene 
    Java" from the "WikiMedia Lucene Search" code.  

 2) don't identify any channel/mechanism for seeking help or discussing 
    errors.

...your best bet (assuming no one else on this list says "oh hey, i know 
all about the wikimedia code, i can help you.") is probably to post your 
question on the "discussion" tab of the plugin pages and hope someone 
replies.
