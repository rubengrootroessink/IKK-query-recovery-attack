: with Lucene 2.1 than 2.0?

i'm not understanding this part of the thread ... are you saying that if
you have two identical setups, the only difference being that one uses 2.0
and the other uses 2.1, then you see different idfs after
adding/deleting/re-adding many docs?

if so, i'm at a loss to explain that.
