A typical solution to problems in this "space" is to index marker terms to 
denote boundaries in the term sequence ... in combination with things 
like SpanNear and SpanNot, this can be used to make queries like "these 
5 words must be in the same sentence"

in your specific example however, where you want to match the entire 
sequence of terms for a doc in a specific field, i don't think you need 
any special indexing tricks ... you could probably just use a 
SpanFirst query containing a SpanNear query right? ... 
the key being that the end value of the SpanFirstQuery should be the same 
as the number of lcauses in the SpanNearQuery.
