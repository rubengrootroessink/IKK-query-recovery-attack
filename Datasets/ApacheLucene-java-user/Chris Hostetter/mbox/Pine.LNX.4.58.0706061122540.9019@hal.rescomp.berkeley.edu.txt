SUBJECT: Re: Case Insensitive but not Tokenized
DATE: 6 Jun 2007


: For now, I am storing both the exact phrase (as is, for retrieval) and
: the string lower-cased (to search against) with no analyzers in the
: index.  When I search, I lower-case my query string and search against
: my lower-cased index, I give the matching exact phrase back to the user.
: This doesn't seem like the best approach but I can't seem to make it
: work any other way.  Any suggestions?

1) if you only ever return the exact string, then you only need to store
it and you don't need to store the lowercase version
2) if you only ever want to do case-insensitive searching, you only need
to index the lowercase field, and you dont' need to index the exact
string.
3) the KeywordTokenizer along with a LowerCaseFilter should take vare of
everything you want, without needing to preprocess the input to lowercase
it before using lucene.
