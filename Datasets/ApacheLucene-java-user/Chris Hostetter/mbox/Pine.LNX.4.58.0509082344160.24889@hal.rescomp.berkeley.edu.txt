: Hmm... Hits is passed to the caller and works as a standalone cache.
: While it maintains a reference to the Searcher, it only uses that to
: resolve Documents upon misses.  Perhaps the current separation of
: concerns is actually more appropriate?

just to clarify, i ment take the call to getMoreDocs(50) which is
currently in the Hits constructor, and refactor it out and into the
"Searcher.search" methods.  that way the behavior is hte same as before
for all existing clients, but new subclasses cna change the behavior so
that hte "search" method just generates the Hits object, without fetching
any initial results (so a search executed purely to retrieved
paginated results above 101 don't do an unneccesary initial search up to
100)
