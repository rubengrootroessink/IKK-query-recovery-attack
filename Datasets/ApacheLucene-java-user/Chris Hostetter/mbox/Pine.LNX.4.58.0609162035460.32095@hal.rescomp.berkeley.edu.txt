: No, I am talking about the Lucene Examples (not from LIA).

you're going to need to be more specific about what you mean ... what is
the exact location of the file where you are seeing the "Example" in
question? ... is it a URL? is it a file from a release you downloaded?
what is the URL of the release?

If i had to guess, i'd assume you are talking about either this file...


http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/trunk/src/demo/org/apache/lucene/demo/SearchFiles.java
or one of these files...
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/trunk/src/jsp/

...but i can't be sure because none of those file have the exact string
you mentioned...

: > > out.println (doc.get ("path"));

... they do refrence a field named "path", so it's my best guess,
except that...

: > > the Index code, there is no mention of "path". My question are:

...both HTMLDocument and FieldDocument (the classes used to build the
indexes for the demo code) do in fact crete fields named "apth" .... hence
i am stumped as to what exactly you are looking at.

there are no reserved field names, but you can get a list of all the
fields in a document using Document.getFields()
