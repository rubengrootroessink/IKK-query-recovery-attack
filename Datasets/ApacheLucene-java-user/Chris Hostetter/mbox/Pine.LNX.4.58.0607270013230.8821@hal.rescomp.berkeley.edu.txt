: Unfortunately this is not that easy. Because I must be able to retrieve
: only one article and if i index all the content in one document then all
: the document will be retrieved instead of the single article.

i didn't say you had to *only* index the article contents in "group"
documents ... you can still index "article" based documents, and use a
Filter to decide wether you are interested in getting back "groups" or
"articles"

if you allways want to display article type information, even when
displaying "group" results, you have to decide which article in each group
is the "flagship" article, and store it's data in the gorups stored field.
