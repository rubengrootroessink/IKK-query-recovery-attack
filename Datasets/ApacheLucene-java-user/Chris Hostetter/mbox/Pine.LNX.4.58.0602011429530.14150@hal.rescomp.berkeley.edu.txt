: from your previous post about memory..."Every time you sort on a field,
: a FieldCache array is constructed for that field."
:
: would that happen in this case for the field this comparator is not using?

Ooohhh ... good question.  As long as you write your own implimentation of
SortComparatorSource from scratch, then no -- not unless you went out of
your way to initialize the FieldCache.  but if you subclass an existing
SortComparatorSource it might.  (trying to use the abstract class
SortComparator would definitely have that problem)
