: i am trying to CO or update it for 2 hours... can you perform updates or COs?

both.  I tried the exact revision checkout you specified in your orriginal
email...

svn co -r 417135 http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk lucene-java-2.0.0-417135

...and had no problems.

perhaps there is something odd about your SVN client?
