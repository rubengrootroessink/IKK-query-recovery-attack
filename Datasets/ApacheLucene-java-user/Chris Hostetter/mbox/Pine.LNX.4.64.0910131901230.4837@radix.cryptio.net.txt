SUBJECT: Re: PhraseQuery in BooleanQuery not working properly in 2.9.0
DATE: 14 Oct 2009


: With the new Lucene 2.9.0 (on a newly built index of approx. 30
: million documents) running BooleanQueries containing PhraseQuery does
: not work properly. I've verified this on both optimized and
: unoptimized index versions.

I suspect that this is the same problem as identified in LUCENE-1974, a 
fix has already been identified, and a 2.9.1 release will most likely 
happen very soon...
