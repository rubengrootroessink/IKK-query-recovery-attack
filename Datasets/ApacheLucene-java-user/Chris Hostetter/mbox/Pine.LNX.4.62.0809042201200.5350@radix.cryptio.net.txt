: Now, I would like to to access to the best fragments offsetsfrom each 
: document (hits.doc(i)).

I seem to recall that the recomended method for doing this is to subclass 
your favorite Formatter and record the information from each TokenGroup 
before delegating to the super class.

but there may be an easier way.
