Why not put the application on the CD as well? .. or at a minimum, the
lucene JAR.  That way you never have to worry about the possibility of it
changing.

: Otis,

: Let say I have a static index on CD, and my customer will be using this
: CD for the next 10 years. I will also probably fix bug in the

: at some point. How much backward compatible is Lucene with old index
: when Lucene release new version?
:
: Does Lucene has any "good" history on index backward compatibility?

: As somebody already said, you can have an in-memory index with
: RAMDirectory.  You can also pre-build a Lucene index on that CD - CD is
: "static", you can't add/remove/change files on it, so you can build an
: index and burn it onto the CD at the same time when you put the Word
: files on it.
:
: As for getting the indexable text out of Word and other documents, look
: at the code for the Lucene book - http://lucenebook.com - there is a
: little framework there, that parses and indexes a number of common file
: types.
