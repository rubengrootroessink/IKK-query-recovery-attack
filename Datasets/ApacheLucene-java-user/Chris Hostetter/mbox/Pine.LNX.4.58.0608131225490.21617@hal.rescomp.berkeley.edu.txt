: subtitle. Can I simple add both fields with a field name title (this
: seems to work fine), or is it a better approach (for example more
: efficient) to concatenate both title and subtitle first and add them as
: a single field to the index?

there's no reason to concatenate them unless you want to *store* them as
one long string (so you get the value back as a single string instead of
an array of two strings) ... i'm guessing you don't.  from a search
perspective the only difference is that with two values the
positionIncrimentGap method of your analyzer will be called, putting a
"gap" between the last word of hte title and the first word of hte
subtitle ... this can be usefull if you want to make sure that phrase
searches don't falsly match one word in the title and one word in the
subtitle.
