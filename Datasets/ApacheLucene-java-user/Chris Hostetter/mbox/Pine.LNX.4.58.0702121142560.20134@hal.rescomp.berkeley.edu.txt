: SOLR seem to have a problem if you don't specify the full path to
: java.exewhen starting Jetty.

To clarify: this isn't an issue with Solr, or with Jetty - it's an issue
with Windows java installations ignoring JAVA_HOME in favor of a registry
key; so no matter which java.exe comes first in your path, you get tools
from the jRE instead of hte JDK (hence: no compiler)

(And yes: please send Solr questions to the solr-user list in the future)
