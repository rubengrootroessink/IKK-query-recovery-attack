: Apologies and thanks all at the same time, everyone.

No apologies neccessary, you're not the first person to be confused by
this, which is why I asked if you had any ideas on how we can improve hte
docs -- people who know the APIs inside and out aren't in the best
position to understand how to improve the documentation for new users.

any suggestions?
