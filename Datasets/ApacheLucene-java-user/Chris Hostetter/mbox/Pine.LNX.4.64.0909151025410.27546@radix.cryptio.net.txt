SUBJECT: Re: NumberFormatException when creating field cache
DATE: 15 Sep 2009


: Would it be useful to allow some sort of data tolerance when creating these
: caches?  At least now the only solution is to delete that Document.  Perhaps
: the values could then be returned as 0 in the Parser implementations for
: numeric failures.

picking an artibtrary number wouldn't be very general purpose.  it would 
hide errors.

clients that want more tollerant parsing behavior are free to provide 
their own parser...
