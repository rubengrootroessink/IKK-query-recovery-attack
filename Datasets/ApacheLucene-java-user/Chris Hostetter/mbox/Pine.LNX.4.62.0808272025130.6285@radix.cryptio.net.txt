: QueryParser indeed doesn't know about IndexSearchers and IndexReaders, so 
: you either have to do the work outside (whereever you have an 
: IndexSearcher, it lets you access the IndexReader) and hand the results 
: over to your QueryParser via e.g. its constructor. Or you hand over the 
: IndexReader to your QueryParser. That's not really elegant but I don't 
: know a better solution.

it's what the Query.rewrite method is for, it gets an IndexReader as 
input. your custom QueryParser should return a new type of query that 
rewrites itself into a MultiPhraseQuery
