: Subject: when do internal doc IDs change?

This is a FAQ...

"When is it possible for document IDs to change?"
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#head-e1de2630fe33fb6eb6733747a5bf870f600e1b4c

: One idea I have is to maintain a set of binary on-disk files (one for 
: each field we want to cache) on our master index server and replicate 
: these files with each index snapshot, so that they are directly read 

You may want to take a look at LUCENE-831 which may add support for 
soemthing like this directly into IndexReader, so you could hook 
in whatever kind of cache logic you wanted (FieldCache), as well as 
whatever type of cach impl (ie: disk based) that you wnated, and 
Indexreader would "do the right thing" when the index was opened or 
reopened or closed.
