SUBJECT: Re: Can the score be changed dynamically?
DATE: 14 Feb 2006


: 10 documents ordered by score. But the 2nd document are more frequently
: choosen and clicked by users than the 1st one. Of course, I will record the
: click number. I want the 2nd document to bubble up and become the first one.
: How can I integrate the function to Lucene.
: Any suggestion?

Take a look at Document.setBoost, or for more complicated stuff, search
JIRA for FunctionQuery.
