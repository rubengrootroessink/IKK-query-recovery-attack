: Yes, see IndexWriter.setTermIndexInterval(). How much RAM are you giving to 
: the JVM now?

and in general: yes.  Lucene is using memory so that *lots* of searches 
can be fast ... if you reuse the searcher object for multiple searches, 
they will all reuse those same internal memory structures.


there's also the specific issue of norms ... did you OMIT_NORMS when you 
indexed your data? do you need norms for this field? (if you aren't sure, 
take a look at the scoring docs)
