: Yeah, they are more complex than the "exactish" match -- basically, there are
: more fields involved -- combined sometimes with AND and sometimes with OR,
: and sometimes negated field values, sometimes groupings, etc.  These other
: field values are all single words (no spaces), and a search might involve a
: wildcard on them.  Hope that helps.

I'm not seeing any problems with using QueryParser -- what you still need
however is an Analyzer for the fields you want the special treatment on.
if you write that analyzer, combine it with the StandardAnalyzer into a
PerFieldAnalyzer and use that in your IndexWriter and QueryParser you
should be good to go with things like.

if you do that, and it still doesn't work the way you expect, write a
small self contained JUnit test that indexes a few sample docs into a
RAMDirectory index and queries against showing whta you expect to happen
(that isn't working) and send that to the list.

People will be able to give you much better advice once they see some
executable code that illustrates the problems you are having.
