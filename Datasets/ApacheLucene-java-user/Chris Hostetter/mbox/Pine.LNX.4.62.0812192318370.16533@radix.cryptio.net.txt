SUBJECT: Preserving old releases
DATE: 20 Dec 2008


a couple of refrences to "Lucene 1.2" in the last few months got me 
thinking and made me realize that 1.4.3 is the oldest release available in 
the lucene dist archive, they might still be in the jakarta dist archive. 
sure enough...

http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/lucene/source/
http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/lucene/binaries/

so i'm wondering what people think about copying/moving them to 
archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java ?

alternately: leave them where they are (it was the jakarta PMC that 
released them after all) but maybe add a link along with the existing note 
about archived versions.
