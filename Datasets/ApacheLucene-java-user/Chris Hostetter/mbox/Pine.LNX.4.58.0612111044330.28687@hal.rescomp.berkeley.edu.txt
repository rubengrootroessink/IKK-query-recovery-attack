: Isn't it also true that using Field.Index.NO_NORMS when creating the field will
: remove it from the scoring formula?  I thought I read that somewhere, but now

queries on fields with NO_NORMS will still contribute to the score, but
the field *length* and/or field bosts won't contribute to the score.
