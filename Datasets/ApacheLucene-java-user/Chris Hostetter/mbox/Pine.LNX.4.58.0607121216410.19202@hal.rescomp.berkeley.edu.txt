: close to realtime as possible). Would it make any sense in trying to save
: the sort cache, insert the new doc in that (whatever that entails, I don't
: know), and then pass the sort cache to a new searcher? Or something along
: those lines...?

as crazy as this sounds -- it's even harder then you think.
deleting and re-adding a single document to your index can cause the
docIds of other documents to change as a result of segment merging -- so
reusing your FieldCache andjust making small modifications to it really
isn't feasible.

: try? Or mabye I am worrying about nothing at all...

Unless you have existing code and hard numbers demonstrating a
performance problem -- I wouldn't worry about it.  In my experience with
Solr, warming FieldCaches generaly only takes a few seconds. (It's
when I warm up 16,000 Filters that it takes a minute or two)
