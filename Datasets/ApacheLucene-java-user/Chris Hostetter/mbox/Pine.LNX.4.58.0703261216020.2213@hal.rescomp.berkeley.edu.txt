SUBJECT: Re: Virtually merge two indexes?
DATE: 26 Mar 2007


: I think the better question could be, given a large/stale index A, a
: small/updated index B, and the B does not satisfy the requirement of
: ParallelReader. How can I create an index C that "add the same
: documents in the same order of index A"?

1) optimize A so it has a single segment with no gaps in doc ids.
2) iterate over the docs in A, looking at their "unique key" field
   -- FieldCache should be handy for this.
   2.1) For each uniqueKey in A pull the corrisponding data out of B and
        add the doc to C

...the key here being that B need not be a lucene index, just something
that provides fast lookup by your unique Key (liek a database perhaps)
