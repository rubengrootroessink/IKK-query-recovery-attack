DATE: 31 Oct 2005


:  I've 4 fields in a document ie. id, URL, modified date, contents. id is
: unique for each document. I wanted to know if I index a document with
: the same id again , will the previous document (in the index) be
: overwritten or do I have to delete the index for that document first and
: then re index the modified one.

Lucene has no notion of a "unique field" ... you will need to delete
the old record ... but you don't neccessarily need to delete it first.
