SUBJECT: Re: Caching of BitSets from filters and Query.equals()
DATE: 6 Mar 2007


: equals to get q1.equals(q2).  The core Lucene Query implementations do override
: equals() to satisfy that test, but some of the contrib Query implementations do
: not override equals, so you would never see the same Query twice and caching
: BitSets for those Query instances would be a waste of time.

fileing bugs about those Query instances would be helpful .. bugs with
patches that demonstrate the problem in unit tests and fix them would be
even more helpful :)

These classes may prove useful in submitting test cases...
