: I'm using RAMDirectory ....
: If the number of documents to index is less than the maxBufferedDocs
: properties nothing is write into my index.
: ex:  RAMDirectory ramDir =new RAMDirectory ();
:         this.indexWriter.addIndexes(new Directory[] { ramDir });
:         ramWriter.close();
:         indexWriter.close();

it's not really clear to me what that code is suppose to be doing what is
rawWriter? are you ever adding any docs to the ramDir? ... without seeing
any of these things happen (and in what order they happen) it's hard to
guess what might be going wrong.

if i had to guess i'd suppose that you are adding documents to your ramDir
using ramWriter, but you don't close your ramWriter untill after you pass
the ramDir to this.indexWriter.addIndexes.

a RamDirectory is just like an FSDirectory -- no "files" get written to
it until maxBufferedDocs is reached, or the writer is closed.
