: I was wondering if there is a standard way to retrive documents WITHOUT
: scoring and sorting them.  I need a list of documents that contain certain
: terms but I do not need them sorted or scored.

Using Filters directly (ie: constructing them, and then calling the bits()
method yourself) is the most straight forward way i know of to achieve
what you describe.
