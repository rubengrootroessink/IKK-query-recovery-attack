SUBJECT: Re: result explanations / how to get the current document id inside a similarity subclass
DATE: 10 Nov 2006


: Nevertheless, all values should be available during the calculation of the overall
: score, which is done inside the Similarity class. Thus, collecting of these should
: result into nearly no runtime overhead, its mainly a question about memory.

Similarity instances don't calculate any scores -- Similarity provides the
utilities neccessary for hte various Scorer classes to compute their
scores using common functions.  the "overall score" of a query depends
on the query type ... in your examples it seems that you are dealing with
BooleanQueries contaiing TermQueries, but I could write a new Query class
that never even used the Similarity class if i wanted to.

your best bet for getting out the information that you would be to
subclass BooleanQuery/BooleanScorer2 and add your logic there.
