SUBJECT: Re: performance implications for an index with large number of documents.
DATE: 24 Jan 2006

:
: The index is made up of approximately 10 million documents that have
: 11 fields.  The average document size is less then 1k.  The index has
: a total of 13 million terms.  The total index size is about 2.2 gig.
: The index is being updated relatively aggressively.  In a 24hr period
: there may be any where from 500k to 3 million updates.

I'm interpreting "update" to mean a deletion followed by an add (unless
you mean your index is growing by 0.5-3 million docs a day)

Which begs the question: How often are you optimizing?

Deleting documents doesn't free up all of the space used to store
information about which terms map to those documents, which could explain
why your total number of terms seems high to Dave Kor -- a lot of those
Terms may only be mapped to deleted documents.


(of course, i could be wrong.  maybe you are optimizing regularly, and
this is an unrelated issue ... but it's the first thing i'd double check
-- how does maxDoc compare with numDoc? what is the relative size of index
before/after an optimize? what is the relative number of terms
before/after an optime?)
