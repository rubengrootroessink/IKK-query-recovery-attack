SUBJECT: Re: How to find most popular terms quickly?
DATE: 27 Feb 2008


: 1) open IndexReader.
: 2) call terms() to get all terms, then filter out terms in field Brand.
: 3) call termDocs(Term) to get Docs having each special Brand.
: 4) count which term is used by most docs from above result.
: 
: Is this the most efficient way?

pretty much ... take a look at the HighFreqTerms class in the 
"miscellaneous" contrib.
