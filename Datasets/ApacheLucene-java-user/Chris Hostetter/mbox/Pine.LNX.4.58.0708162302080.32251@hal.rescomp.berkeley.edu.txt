: I don't see how to do this using either Lucene's QueryParser or the
: QsolParser. Is it possible to do it using the Query API (and the appropriate
: indexing changes)?

take a look at Span queries, particularly SpanNearQuery ... that can do
pretty much everything you describe assuming creative indexing.  the one
thing that's not quite ready made would be the range query -- you'd need
to write a kind of SpanRangeQuery that rewrite itself into a SpanOrQuery
containing all of the numbers in the range.
