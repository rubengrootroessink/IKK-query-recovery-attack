DATE: 20 Aug 2007


: So iterating over and deleting them term by term wouldn't
: preserve the sense of the original query
: (field1:query1 AND field2:query2) OR (field1:query3 AND field2:query4)

Doh! .. you are 100% correct, i am 100% wrong ... i don't know what i was

the Filter approach should still work though, and you could alwyas use a
QueryWrapperFilter to make it work for an arbitrary query.
