SUBJECT: Re: Retrieve nearest token based off location in original Text
DATE: 6 Jul 2007

: I never got a response to this and thought maybe I was too wordy.
:
: I'm wondering if there's a way where given a position in the original text
: you can retrieve the token index that is nearest to that position using the
: StandardToken/StandardTokenizer classes?

i may not be understanding the question, but wouldn't that just be...

  TokenStream s = getTokenStreamForOrriginalText()
  Token t;
  for (i=0; i<thePositionYouKnow; i++) {
    t = s.next();
  }
  return t;

?
