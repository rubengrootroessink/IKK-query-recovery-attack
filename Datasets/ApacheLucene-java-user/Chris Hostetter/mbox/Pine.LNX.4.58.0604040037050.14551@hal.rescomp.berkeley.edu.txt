DATE: 4 Apr 2006


: Or if to be more specific, can Lucene support BILLIONS of documents
: (across multiple indexes), and search all of them at once using the
: Parallel searcher?

I believe the theoretical limit in the number of documents is
Integer.MAX_VALUE -- regardless of how you partition the index, your
MultiSearcher has to be able to address every doc by (an) id.

There may be pratical limits you'd hit before you reach that point.
