: Does it possible to retrive the data order/sort by they were inserted in the
: index but without putting any extra column in the document?

The first step anyone should take in understanding Lucene, is to start by
spending a lot of time reading over the javadocs.  If you look at the Sort
class, you'll find a static instace called Sort.INDEXORDER.
