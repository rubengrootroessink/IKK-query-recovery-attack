SUBJECT: Re: using search instead of explain
DATE: 3 May 2006


: Now we want to use Search.search(Query, HitCollection).
: HitCollection adds the document to a BitSet as soon as the score is non-zero.
:
: Is there any relation between the value of the explanation and the score?

Generally speaking, calling Explain is suppose to return a detailed
explanation of how the score you would get in a HitCollector was
calcuated, but the documentation (and the code implimenting explain in
various Scorers) is vague as to what should happen in cases where the
document doesn't "match" your query.

So the score you get in a HItCollector forany matching document *should*
be equal to the value from an Explanation of that query and doc ... but
there are also some cases where the Explanation contains an incorrectly
computed value, this is a bug...
