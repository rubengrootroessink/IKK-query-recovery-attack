: We are hosting Lucene as a web service (following the instructions provided
: at www.lucene-ws.net) where I have provided the information regarding the

: newbie like me to be able to figure this out.
: 
: Any pointers will be very helpful.

Have you considered contacting the dicussion group for lucene-ws.net as 
mentioned on their "About" page?
