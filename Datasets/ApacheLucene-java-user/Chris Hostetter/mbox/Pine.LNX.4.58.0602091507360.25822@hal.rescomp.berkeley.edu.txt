SUBJECT: Re: Custom filters and booleanquery (MUST_NOT)
DATE: 9 Feb 2006


: I am experimenting with using a custom filter with QueryParser and ran into
: some unanticipated issues with using NOT terms. I narrowed down the issue

    ...

:             bquery = new BooleanQuery();
:             bquery.add(new BooleanClause(fq, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST_NOT));
:             hits = this.searcher.search(bquery);
:             assertTrue(hits.length() == 1);       // <<<<<<<<<
returns 0, expecting doc #2 (t2) to return...

...this isn't really a Filter issue at all, you're trying to execute a
query that only contains prohibited (ie: MUST_NOT) clauses.  Thus you are
not positively selecting anything -- this is one of hte main use for
MatchAllDocsQuery, try...


          bquery = new BooleanQuery();
          bquery.add(new BooleanClause(fq, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST_NOT));
          bquery.add(new BooleanClause(new MatchAllDocsQuery(),
                     BooleanClause.Occur.MUST));
          hits = this.searcher.search(bquery);
          assertTrue(hits.length() == 1);

...incidently, if you are constructing a FilteredQuery arround a
MatchAllDocsQuery, you might as well use a ConstantScoreQuery instead.
