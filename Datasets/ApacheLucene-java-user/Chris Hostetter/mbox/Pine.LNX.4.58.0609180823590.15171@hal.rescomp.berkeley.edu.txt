: Thanks for the info on this. Since I should use the search function that
: returns TopDocs, I was wondering what was the proper way to create a
: Weight object to pass into the search function.

I think you are getting too hung up on the method summary section of the
IndexSearcher javadocs ... IndexSearcher also supports all of the methods
in the Searcher interface, like...

   TopDocs d = searcher.search(myQuery, (Filter)null, 100);
