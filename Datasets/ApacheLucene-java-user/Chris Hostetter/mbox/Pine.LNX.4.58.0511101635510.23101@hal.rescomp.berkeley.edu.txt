: Thank you, I had thought a BitSet was appropriate here somehow, I'll work
: on this approach.

Paul's suggestion is acctually a lot simpler, and I suspect it might be
faster -- but it does require that you index with TermVectors.  If that's
soemthing you're already doing, then you should definitely try that
appraoch first, if not ... i don't know which one would be best.  adding
TermVectors would definitely increase the size of your index, which would
probably affect the performance of your application in other ways.
