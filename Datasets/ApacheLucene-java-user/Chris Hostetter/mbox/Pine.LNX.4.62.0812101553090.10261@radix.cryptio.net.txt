not inherently, that's just one of the most common mental models.  The 
common approaches for dealing iwth faceted search in Lucene all work 
equally well when dealing with a taxonomy as long as your faceting code is 
*aware* of hte taxonomy and only computes the facet counts it needs to 
based on the users "current" location in the taxonomy (unless of course 
you want ll the counts for hte entire taxonomy in all cases -- in which 
case no pecial logic is needed: only your presentation layer needs to care 
about the taxonomy)

the simple faceting support provided out of the box by solr can easily be 
used for taxonomy based faceting if you encode your taxonomy breadcrumbs 
in the docs (a google search for "solr hierarchical facets" will give you 
lots off discussion on this).
