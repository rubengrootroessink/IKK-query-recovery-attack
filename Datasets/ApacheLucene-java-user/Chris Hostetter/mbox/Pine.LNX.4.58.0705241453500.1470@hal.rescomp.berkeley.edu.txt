: Mh, some of my fields are in fact multivaluated. But anyway, I could store
: them as a single string and split after retrieval.
: Will FieldCache work for the first search with some query or just for the
: successive ones, for which the fields are already cached?

The first time you access the cache, it will populate it for every
document. ... it makes the first hit slow, but you can always force the
first hit arbitrarily prior to using the IndexReader for "real" queries
