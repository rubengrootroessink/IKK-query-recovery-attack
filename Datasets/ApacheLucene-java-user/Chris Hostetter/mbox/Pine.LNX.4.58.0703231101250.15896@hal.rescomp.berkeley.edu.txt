: Hi
: I am seeking for making use of the latest lazy field loading in lucene 2.1.
: I store the orignal bytes of a document, say a PDF file for example, in a
: special untokenized field in the index. Though there is enough facilities in
: IndexReader class for lazy field loading, the search API in IndexSearcher
: does not contain such facilities (seemingly). Hence, the Documents I get
: from the Hits.doc() would not benefit from the mentioned feature.
: Am I missing an important point or this is a desired feature to go on the
: todo list?
