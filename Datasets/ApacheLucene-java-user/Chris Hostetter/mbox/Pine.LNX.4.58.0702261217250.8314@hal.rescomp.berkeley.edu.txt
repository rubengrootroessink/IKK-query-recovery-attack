: OK I'm not sure I understand your answer.  I thought TermEnum gave you
: all the terms in an index, not from a search result.
:
: Let me clarify what I need.  I'm looking for a way to find out all the
: values of the FIELD_FILTER_LETTER field for any given search.
:
: INDEX TIME:   (done for each indexed person, stores the first letter of
: their name as a field)

what you are describing is basically a faceted search problem (see list
archive for copious discussion)

step #1: get a list of all possible "first letters" (that's where a
TermEnum comes into play ... iterate over all the terms for that ield)

step #2: for each first letter, get the BitSet of documents corrisponding
to that letter with a filter (this can be cached for hte life of your
IndexReader and interest it with a BitSet from a Filter made from your
users search critera

...there are other approaches to doing faceted searching that involve
iterating over the results to get the list of possible values -- but i'm
guessing the letters a name might start with is typically going ot be
smaller then the set of results from a search ... so this approach is
probably a safe bet.
