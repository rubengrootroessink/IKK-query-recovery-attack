SUBJECT: Re: query parser field name aliases
DATE: 5 Jun 2006


: Indeed!  I agree - I was temporarily blinded by the desire to hack
: QueryParser itself in perhaps a one-off way that I didn't consider
: the subclassing option.

if all you care about is aliasing term, and phrase queries yiu might even
be able to use the DisjunctionMaxQueryParser i wrote for Solr verbatim.

It maps from a single alias to a list of fields with unique boosts (and a
tiebreaker value) to build a DisjunctionMaxQuery for each input term --
but if you only alis to one field then the DisMax queries will rewrite to
their sole clause.

if you also want wildcards and range queries to work you'd have to
override those methods appropriately as well

It's near the bottom of this file...
