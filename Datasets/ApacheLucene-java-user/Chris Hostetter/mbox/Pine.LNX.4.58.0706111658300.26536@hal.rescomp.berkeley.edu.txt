SUBJECT: Re: "Contains" query parsed to PrefixQuery
DATE: 12 Jun 2007


: gets parsed to the PrefixQuery *abc. I did enable the leading wildcard in
: the QueryParser to allow the query above to be parsed so I'm wondering is

are you sure you called setAllowLeadingWildcard(true) first?

Are you using using 1.9 or earlier ... if so are you calling the
static parse(String,String,Analyzer) instance? it doesn't know anything
about hte other settings you can set on instances of QueryParser.
