: I am experiencing a same problem with some 40 segments. Chris, Do you have

do you have 40 segments, or do you have 40 files matching the glob
segement* .. there is a differnece (the "segment" files records the number
of segments, as of 2.1 they are versioned so they have names like
"segments_7" "segments_8" etc...

: any recommendation on the file system to use?

not really .. i just wanted to know which filesystem people noticing this
problem are using ... becuase it might make a differnece (since checking
currentness is esentially just a directory lookup followed by reading one
int from a file)

back in the day i remember being told that NFS volumns would have serious
performance issues doing any directory operations (list, create ne file,
dleete file) once they had ~4K files, but i have no idea if that's still
true.
