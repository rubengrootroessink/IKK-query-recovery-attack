: You need to write your own sort comparator
: SortField(String field, SortComparatorSource comparator)

A much simpler approach is to index a lowercase version of the field.  
since fields used for sorting are typically copies of other existing 
fields anyway because they can't be tokenized, there's not much additional 
overhead.
