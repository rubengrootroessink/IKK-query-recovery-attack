: The trick is that once segment files are written, they are never
: modified (except for the "segments" file itself).  New documents are
: added to new segments, not existing segments.  When segments are
: merged, a new bigger segment is created.  This way, the view of the
: index for a specific IndexReader will never change.

one thing to add here - when a segment is removed (beecuase it's contents
have been merged into a new segment) the file is deleted -- but any
existing reader/searcher that needs using that segment will still have it
open, so even though the file is no longer present in the directory, the
data will still exist and be available to the serachers that are using it.
