SUBJECT: Re: Sorting based on a selling rate
DATE: 30 Aug 2006


: I don't know what is the best way:

that depends on your needs ... if Selling rate changes very infrequently,
or if you are dealing with teh sell rate for lots of books per
query then i'd put it in your index ... if it's constantly in flux and you
only care about the sell rate of one or two books for each query, doing it
at query time is fine.

the definitions of "infrequently", "lots", and "constantly" all being
specific to the scope of your problem, and not something i can give
general advice on.

: or doing something like you said: "adding an optional clauses to your
: query for each of your N productIds"... but I don't really know how to do
: this...
:
: Any sample code exemple ?

I suggest you start by looking at the javadocs for BooleanQuery.
