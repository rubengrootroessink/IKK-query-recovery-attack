: I have a question: is the score for a document different if I have
: only that document in my index, or if I have N documents?

as i said before, yes it does...

...you will see a big difference between an index containing 1 doc, and an
index containing 10 docs which all match your query, and an index
containing 100000 docs.

I believe Doron already suggested you take a look at the Document
explainaing how Lucene's Scoring works correct? ...
