: That works fine if there are some criteria in filterQuery and query.
: But sometimes, the bean I'm passing in will not pass any criteria into
: the filterQuery part.  If that's the case, cwf looks like this:
: CachingWrapperFilter(QueryFilter())
	...
: will result in no results.  If there are no criteria in the filter,
: shouldn't that return all the results based on the query?

No.  If you filter a query, the filter defines the super set of all
results you can get back -- if you have a filter that matches nothing,
then you can't get anything back.
