SUBJECT: Re: Urgent : Specific string query search
DATE: 16 Nov 2006


: As far as I know, WhiteSpaceAnalyzer does support the field:text format. Try

More specificaly, the bit of syntax  field:value  ...or more generally
field:"some longer value" is parsed by QueryParser regardless of what
Analyzer you use.  QP is what extracts the field name and the colon, and
then gives the Analyzer the string:  some longer value

pay carefull attention that when you say "XXXX dosn't work with
WhitespaceAnalyzer" that you are using WhitespaceAnalyzer both when you
index your text and when you query (ie: set it on the IndexWriter, and on
the QueryParser) otherwise there will be a large disconnect between the
terms in your index, and the TermQueries the QueryPArser gives you...
