there's a few options...

you can define a custom SImilarity that makes the score based entirely on
the sloppyFreq ... it's not trivial, but it's certainly possible.

the other option is to call SpanQuery.getSpans directly, and then iterate
over it and compare end() - start() for each span.

: SpanNearQuery("quick","fox",50)
