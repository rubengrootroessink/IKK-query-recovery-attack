: By example doc contains 3 times the word "test", and 1 time the word
: "example", and the query was looking for both words, the score for the doc
: should be 4.
:
: But whatever I do, score is 1.

1) this is where Searcher.explain really comes in handy ... it will help
you seewhat is going on.

2) are you using the Hits API?  if so then if the high score is above 1,
all scores are normalized realtive hte high score.  use the TopDocs search
method instead.
