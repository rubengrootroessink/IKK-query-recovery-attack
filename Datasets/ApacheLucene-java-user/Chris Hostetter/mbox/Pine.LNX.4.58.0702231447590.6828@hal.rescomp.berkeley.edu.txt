:   String newquery = query.replace(query, ": ", " ");

you should be able to usea regex like so...

    String newquery = query.replaceAll(":\\b", "\\\\:");

...(i may have some extra/missing backslashes) to ensure that literal ":"
in your input which are followed by word boundaries are "escaped" fro mteh
query parser ... that way if your analyzer doesn't strip out the ":"
things will still work, and ":" at the end of your input will be properly
escaped (your current string replace will fail in this case)
