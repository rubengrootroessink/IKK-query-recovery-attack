: In the default StandardAnalyzer, the stop word list contains the word "on".
: If I have a document which contains the phrase "Disney on Ice", the index
: will show only "Disney" and "Ice", but not "on".

: "Disney on Ice"
:
: With the quotations indicating the desire for an "exact match", the absence
: of stop words in the index means this yields zero results.

: Am I going crazy here?

you should still get a match *if* you use the same analyzer (with the same
set of stop words) in your query parser as you did when you indexed your
documents.  if so, then "Disney on Ice" should become a phrase search for
the two successive tokens "disney" and "ice" which is what should have
cone in your doc when it was indexed using that analyzer.
