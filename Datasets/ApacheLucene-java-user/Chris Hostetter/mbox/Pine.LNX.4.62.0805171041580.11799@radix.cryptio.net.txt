SUBJECT: Re: Using more tokens in TokenFilter :(
DATE: 17 May 2008


each call of next can only return one token ... if you wnat to return more 
then one token based on each token you find in "input" then you need to 
buffer them.

There's an abstract class in Solr that you can look at to see how this can 
be done, and you can subclass it to get all the benefits...
