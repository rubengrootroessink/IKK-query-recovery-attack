deja vu ... didn't someone else just asking about "tolerant" query
parsing, and then followup that they have found this suggestion from past
me...

http://www.nabble.com/Error-tolerant-query-parsing-tf108987.html

...inspecting the ParseException should allow you to do all sorts of
iterative "fixing" of the query string.

: Subject: Better parsing of Queries
:
: I'm looking for some advice on dealing with malformed queries.
:
: If a user searches for "yow!" then I get an exception from the query
: parser. I can get round this by using QueryParser.escape(query) first
: but then that prevents them from searching using other bits of the the
: query syntax such as "author:alice".
:
: Is there an easy way to get a query such as
:
:     "yow! author:alice"
:
: and get back
:
:     "yow\! author:alice"
:
: i.e only escape the special characters when they don't make sense?
