SUBJECT: Re: how to change the segment file names
DATE: 10 May 2008

: Currently, segment file names all start with _0, and increase with each new
: segment created. But seems there is no easy way to change the segment file
: names.
: 
: This causes trouble when copying one index to another index's directory, if
: the .cfs files have the same name.

This isn't something that's really supported in Lucene.  A Lucene index is 
a directory -- you should treat the entire directory as special, and not 
add your own files (or files from another Lucene index) in to it.
