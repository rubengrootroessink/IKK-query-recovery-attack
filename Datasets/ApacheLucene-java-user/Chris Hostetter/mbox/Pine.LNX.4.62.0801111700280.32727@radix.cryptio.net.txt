SUBJECT: RE: Prioiritze new documents
DATE: 12 Jan 2008


: IMHO it would be nice if Lucene's Similarity formula took the
: indexed-date of the document into account.  Ideally as an optional
: setting, where the user can provide a date field as well.

It really wouldn't make sense to incorporate this into the Similarity 
class.

: Some of the other search engines do - for example Fast's Instream.  It

"Lucene Java" is not a search engine, or even an application -- it is a 
library that can be used to develop applications -- there are lots of 
differnet ways people might want to prioritize documents by external 
factors unrelated to relevancy -- recentness is only one of them.  there 
are also several differnet ways recentness can be prioritized, each with 
differnet tradeoffs (in terms of indexing performance vs query 
performacne, etc...) ... the application developer is best suited to 
decide which approach to take for their use case.   

There really won't be much value add in embedding one particular approach 
in the core Lucene scoring code.

: Is JIRA the mechanism where you can add "feature requests" for Lucene?

Yes.  you can login, create a a new issue, and pick "new feature" as the 
issue type.
