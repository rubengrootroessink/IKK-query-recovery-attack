: (with basically nonsense words), I'm wondering how others might have
: dealt with this issue.
: 
: Another option is to have a custom Similarity class with an altered
: lengthNorm method?

that is what i would recommend ... it's exactly what SweetSpotSimilarity 
does (you define a "platuea" of lengths that ar all treated equally, and 
anything shorter or longer then that drops off with lower lengthNorm 
values.
