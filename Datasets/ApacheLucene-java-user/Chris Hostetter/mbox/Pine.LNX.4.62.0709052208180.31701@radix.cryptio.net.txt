: how can i reconstruct the new IndexSearcher for every hour to see the

i'm confused ... my understanding based on the comments you made below 
(in an earlier message) was that you already *were* constructing a new  
IndexSearcher once an hour -- but every time you do that, your memory 
usage grows, and and that sometimes you got OOM Errors.

if that's not what you said, then i think you need to explain, in detail, 
in one message, exactly what your problem is.  And don't assume we 
understand anything -- tell us *EVERYTHING* (like, for example, what the 
word "crore" means, how "searcherOne" is implemented, and the answer to 
the specfic question i asked in my last message: does your application, 
contain anywhere in it, any code that will close anything (IndexSearchers 
or IndexReaders) ?
