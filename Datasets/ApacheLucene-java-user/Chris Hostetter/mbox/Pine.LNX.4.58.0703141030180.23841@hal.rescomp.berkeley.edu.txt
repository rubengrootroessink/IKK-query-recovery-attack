2 searchers is fine ... it's "N" where N is not bound that you want to
avoid.

from what i understand of your requirements, you don't *really* need two
searchers open ... open a searcher to do whatever complex queries you need
to get the docIds to delete, then delete
them all, then close/reopen searcher (and check that the delets worked if
you don't trust it)

the only real reason you should really need 2 searchers at a time is if
you are searching other queries in parallel threads at the same time ...
or if you are warming up one new searcher that's "ondeck" while still
serving queries with an older searcher.
