: Subject: Webfarm and Index Location
:
: Hey-
:
: I would like to store my index in one location, and then have all my IIS servers on the
farm call that one index. Basically, I am looking for the best approach here...and any ideas
anyone has...
:
: Options:
:
: 1. Store index on SAN and have each server call that location...seems this is an issue because
on the SAN I can not have more than one shared drive per computer calling it...would need
LUN for each.
:
: 2. Store index on a shared drive (not on a SAN), and then cluster that box that I store
the index on...will this work? What over-head for a shared drive call?
:
: 3. Make a webservice call
:
: 4. Make a remoting call
:
: Anything else?
:
: Regards!
