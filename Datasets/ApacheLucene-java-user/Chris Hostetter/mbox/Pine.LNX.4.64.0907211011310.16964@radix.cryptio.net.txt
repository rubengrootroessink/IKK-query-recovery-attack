SUBJECT: Re: Sorting field contating NULL values consumes field cache memory
DATE: 21 Jul 2009


: Right now, you can't really do anything about it. In the future, with the
: new FieldCache API that may go in, you could plug in a custom implementation
: that makes tradeoffs for a sparse array of some kind. The docid is currently
: the index into the array, but with a custom impl you may be able to use a
: sparse array object.
: Thats a ways off though.

I have no idea if this patch still applies...

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-769

...but this thread jogged my memory of it.  the lsat time i looked at it 
it still needed some documentation improvements, but it seemed to have 
some potential value for people who have too much data and too little RAM 
to build up a FieldCache for sorting, and were willing to take the 
time/space tradeoff for sorting using stored fields.
