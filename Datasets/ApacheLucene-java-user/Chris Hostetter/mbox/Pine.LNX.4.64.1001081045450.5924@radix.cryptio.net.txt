SUBJECT: Re: ShingleFilter with outputUnigrams=false
DATE: 8 Jan 2010


: I am using lucene 2.9.1 and I was trying to understand the ShingleFilter and wrote the code
below.
	...
: I was expecting the output as follows with maxShingleSize=3 and outputUnigrams=false :
	...
: Am I missing something or this is the expected behavior?

I'm not very familiar with ShingleFilter, and i'n not 100% sure i 
understand the example you describe, but it *seems* like there may be a 
bug here ... the easieest way to verify that is if you could tweak your 
example code into the form of a (failing) JUnit test and open a new Jira 
issue -- then other devs (who know more about SHingleFilter) could look at 
it and either verify that there is a bug, or point out what's invalid 
about hte test.
