SUBJECT: Re: Similarity for Span and Boolean query
DATE: 8 Jan 2007


: The equation for similarity is given on this web page:
: http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/Similari
: ty.html
:
: I would like to know what are the equations for similarity if the query
: is a span or boolean query.

That equation does cover BooleanQueries -- the "coord" factor is a
BooleanQuery concept -- strictly speaking that equation describes the
basics of a boolean query containing multiple term queries.

beyond that, the calculations can get a little hard to discribe in generic
equations -- the best way to understand the score calculations for any of
the other query types (including the Span queries) is to look at the
"Explanation.toString()" output for a query on a matching document -- and
consult the code for the corisponding Scorer class to see if there are any
special cases you might not be noticing becuase of the particular
query/doc explanation you are looking at (ie: query boosts, the coord
factor on a boolean query, etc...)
