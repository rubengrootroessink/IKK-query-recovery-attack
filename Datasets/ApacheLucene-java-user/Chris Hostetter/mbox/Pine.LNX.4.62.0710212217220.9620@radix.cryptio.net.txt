SUBJECT: Re: Is there bug in Range searches?
DATE: 22 Oct 2007

:   1. Are Range queries work correctly with all languages for which
:      there are analyzers? (for example CJK and Thai);

Terms when indexed are allways ordered lexigraphically (using 
Term.compareTo which uses String.compareTo) ... regardless of what field 
or language they are in, so "Range Queries" must do their comparisons 
lexigraphically as well.

because all Terms are indexed in one continuous TermEnum, it would be 
fairly imposible to definite different Collators per field at index time.

it's pretty rare that anyone ever talks about Range Queries on words, so 
this doesn't typiclly pose a problem ... i've never seen anyone comment 
that they can't do sane Range queries on their text because the language 
it's in doesn't collate in the same order as the default compareTo.
