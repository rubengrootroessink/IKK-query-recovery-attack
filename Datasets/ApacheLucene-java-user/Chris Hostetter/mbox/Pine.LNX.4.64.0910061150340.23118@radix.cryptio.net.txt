: I figured it might be less expensive if search() (I have extended 
: IndexSearcher) were to check that the underlying IndexReader is still 

if you're extending IndexSearcher anyway you can override the close() 
method to update a boolean and then add your own isClosed() method.

: open - and reopen() if necessary.  However, I cannot find a way to 

FWIW: I don't believe you can call the reopen() method on a close 
IndexReader ... but you can of course "re" open a new IndexReader 
instance.

: detect this ...  is there a way?  Failing that, what is the cost of just 
: issuing a reopen() anyway?

if the index hasn't changed, it's free.  If the index has changed 
a lot, it's as expensive as open() ... if there are minor changes then 
it's somewhere in between.
