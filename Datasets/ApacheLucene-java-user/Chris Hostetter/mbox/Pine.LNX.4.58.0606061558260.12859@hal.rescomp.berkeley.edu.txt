This isn't really a "learning search" issue as much as an issue of session
tracking and finding patterns.  Eliminate search from the discussion and
the same questions could be a applied to generic product/document viewing...

"users who looked at products AAA and BBB also looked at product CCC"

That's a a little out of Lucene's scope.

:
: Hi Everyone!
:
: Working on a project that requires a Search query similiar to what is
: seen on"amazon.com" in that after searching for and displaying an item,
: the system shows:
:
: "Users that have searched for "AAAAA" AND "BBBBB" have also searched
: for "CCCC".
:
: Where "BBBBB"  and   "CCCC" are other related entities.
:
:
: 1. Has anyone used or heard of this algorithm?
: 2. Is Lucene capable of executing "learning searches"?
: 3. Is Lucene capable of executing suggested Searches?
:
: Any assistance rendered would be appreciated.
:
: Thanks in advance.
