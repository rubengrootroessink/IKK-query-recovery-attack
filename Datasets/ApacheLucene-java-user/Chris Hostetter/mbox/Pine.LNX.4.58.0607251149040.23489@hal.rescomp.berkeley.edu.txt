1) please do not cross post to more then one lucene mailing list.  the
appropraites place for questions about using the Java Lucene library is
"java-user"

2) if you want the counts of all documents matching each keyword, then the
TermEnum.docFreq method can solve all of your problems.

if you want to know the counts in the context of a search that has
narrowed the document space, the problem becomes trickier -- you'll find
discussions on it if you search the archives for "faceted search"
"category counts" of "facet counts"

: Subject: Article keyword counters
:
: Hi all,
:
: I need some help from the Lucene experts because I coulnd't find the
: best solution for a problem...
:
: The problem: we have article entities which can have multiple keywords:
:
: - article #1: keyword #1, keyword#2, keyword#3
: - article #2: keyword#2, keyword#3
: - article #3: keyword#3
: - article #4: keyword#4
:
: I need to create a method to produce a list like this for keyword #2:
:
: - keyword#1 (1)
: - keyword#2 (2)
: - keyword#3 (1)
: - keyword#2 (0)
:
: This list shows counters of keywords and a counter means that how many
: article matches with the given keyword in the given scope (in this
: example: keyword#2). So, there's one article which has keyword#1 and
: keyword#2.
:
: What's the best way to produce the counters?
:
: Laci
