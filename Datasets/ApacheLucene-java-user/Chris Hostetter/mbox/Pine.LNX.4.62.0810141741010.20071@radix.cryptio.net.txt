DATE: 15 Oct 2008


: Have a look at SOLR (*lucene.apache.org/solr*). It is based on Lucene and
: provides additional functionalities including faceted search.

to more generally answer you question: while you may not find a lot of 
info searching for "lucene histogram" you should find loots of info about 
achieving getting the type of info you want (using either Solr or lucene) 
by searching the web and mailing list archives for info about "faceted 
search" ... it also gets asked about quite about under the name "category 
counts"
