Just to clarify: If you are doing paginated results, then the Hits API is
probably fast enough for you ... it's designed to work well in the first
100 results, and most people don't go that deep when looking at search
results.

if you look back earier in this thread, the "I hope you're not using the
Hits object" comment was in direct response to this...

: When the resultSet is very big, Searching is taking a lot of time.
: For returning responce of a query that finds approx 14 M results, first time
: it is taking approx 17Sec.

the comment was addressing the fact that if you are trying to iterate over
all 14 M results Hits is a very bad way to go.

perhaps that's not what you ment, perhaps you aren't iterating over any
results, in which case using a HitCOllector instead isn't neccessary going
to bring that 17sec down.

a better question is what exactly are you doing? .. what kinds of queries
are you executing?  what method calls are you timing?  how many iterations
are you testing to give the JVM a chance to warm up -- to give the disk
cache a chance to load all the pages for your index?
