: I want to boost recent documents....so that it top ups...
: what could be best strategy...

you might want to take a look at "FunctionQuery" hwich is part of hte solr
codebase.  if you search the archives you'll find several discussions of
it.  (as well as several past discussions on "boost by date" that have
other suggestions which don't involve FunctionQuery)
