: What I don't know is how can I make that fieldNorm returns the same value
: for both documents, and at the same time this values is bigger than if the
: query only found one of the words, smaller than finding three of three...
	...
: I subclass DefaultSimilarity and set it to IndexSearcher, but I don't know
: what reimplementation of the methods is what I need.

take a look at the lengthNorm function of Similarity.  As i said before
LIA ("Lucene In Action" just in case that isn't clear)  has some great
info on this, and if you search the archives for Similarity you'll find
previous discussions about writing custom subclass ... the one special
thing to note about lengthNorm is that it's used when the index is built
-- so setting it at search time isn't enough.

: what you want is not a customized sort as much as a customized Score ..
: scores can be customized by modifying your Similarity, class -- LIA has
: some good info on this, but the best way to figure out what you want may
: be to start by creating your own Similarity class and then look at the
: search.explain output for your searches to understand how your changes
: affect things.

: : Hi,
: : I want to execute a query searching a few terms
: :
: : QueryParser queryParser = new MultiFieldQueryParser(new String[] {"tags",
: "title"}, ProcessConstants.analyzer);
: : Query query = queryParser.parse("rocio ortega");
: :
: : and I want to obtain the results sorted by the number of founded terms,
: but not considering other factors like the number of times found each term.
: ¿How can I do this?
: :
: : SortField.FIELD_SCORE doesn´t work for this because I think it consider
: other factors like the number of times found each term.
