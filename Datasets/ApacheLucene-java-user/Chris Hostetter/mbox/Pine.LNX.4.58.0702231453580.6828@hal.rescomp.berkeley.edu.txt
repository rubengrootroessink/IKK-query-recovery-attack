: I've just been looking at IndexReader and it seems you can do it using
: that, but I don't know which concrete implementation of IndexReader to
: use.

there is a static factory method for opening an IndexReader in the
IndexReader class (you can't call the constructors directly)

please go through the Lucene-Java tutorial and read the corrisponding demo
code ... it covers topics like these.

beyond that i don't know anyone who won't recomend you get a copy of LIA
and read it cover to cover...
