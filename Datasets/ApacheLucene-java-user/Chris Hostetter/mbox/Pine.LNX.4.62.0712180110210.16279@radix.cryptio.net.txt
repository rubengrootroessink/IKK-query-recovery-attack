: You can look at org.apache.lucene.search.MultiPhraseQuery which does
: something similar to what you ask. From its javadoc:

good call .. funny thing, i was just pointing out MultiPhraseQuery as a 
way to meat this need only a few days ago, but for some reason it didn't 
occur to me in the thread.

if you build a custom query parser, you can easily use the 
WildCardTermEnumerator to get the list of all matching terms to use to 
build up a MultiPhraseQuery.
