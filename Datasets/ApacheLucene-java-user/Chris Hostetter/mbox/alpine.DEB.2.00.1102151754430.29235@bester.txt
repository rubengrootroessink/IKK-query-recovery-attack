: I used to receive the email myself because I subscribe the maillist.
: but recently if I post a email to the maillist, I can't receive the
: email posted by me. So I thought I failed to post this email.

I notice you are using gmail -- I recently migrated to using Goolge Apps 
for my domain and idscovered this is something that gmail does even if you 
use their IMAP and SMTP servers (and not their UI) -- messages you send 
(through their SMTP server) will not be delivered back to you under any 
circumstances, no matter what new headers might be added.  AS far as gmail 
is concerned you already hav acopy of htat message in your "Sent Mail", 
you don't need another one...
