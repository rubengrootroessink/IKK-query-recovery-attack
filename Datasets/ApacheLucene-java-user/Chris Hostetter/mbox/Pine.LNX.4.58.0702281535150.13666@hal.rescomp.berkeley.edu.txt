SUBJECT: Re: ParallelSearcher in multi-node environment
DATE: 28 Feb 2007


: I want to execute parallel search over several machines. But
: ParallelSearcher doesn't look perfect. It creates threads and spawns many
: requests to the underlying Searchables (over a network) for a single search.
: Is there a decent implementation of the parallel search over remote indexes
: somewhere?

what would you consider "decent implementation" of a parallel search? ...
how could it be done in parallel without spawning seperate threads for
each sub Searchable?
