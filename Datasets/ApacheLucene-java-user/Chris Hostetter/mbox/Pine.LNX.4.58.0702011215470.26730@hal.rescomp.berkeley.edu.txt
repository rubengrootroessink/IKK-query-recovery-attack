Please, do not ever, under any circumstances at all, cross post a
message to all of these lists -- there is absolutely no reason for it, and
doing so will most likely only make people mad and uncooporative.

if you are trying to use Java Lucene, then post your message to java-user
list.  if you are trying to use solr, then post your message to the
solr-user list, etc....  If you know you want to do something with Lucene,
but you aren't sure which list ot mail to, email general@lucene and ask
what the appropriate list is for your question.
