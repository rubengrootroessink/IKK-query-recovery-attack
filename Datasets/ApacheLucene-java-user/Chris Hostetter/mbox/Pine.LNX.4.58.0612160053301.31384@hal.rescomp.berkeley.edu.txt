: Exactly in this scenario, I would love to use my custom generated document
: id.
: The array reference number is MyId & its value is some-interested-value
: matched to MyID.
:
: So,how can I generate custom document id.?

you can't .. you can index you custom "MyID" value and use the FieldCache
to look it up -- using the lucene docid.

That's what Karl is refering to: he uses the lucene docid as the *index*
in the array, and his MyId values are *stored* in the array.
