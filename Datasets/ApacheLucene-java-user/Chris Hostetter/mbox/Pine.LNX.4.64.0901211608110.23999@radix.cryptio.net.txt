I believe Kay was asking about Lucene-Java nightly builds.

That's an old URL that no longer works, if you found a link to it 
somewhere on an apache.org site please let us know so we can fix it.

The problem is it's currently setup to redirect you here...
   http://lucene.zones.apache.org:8080/hudson/job/Lucene-Nightly/
...this is the same URL that's currently linked to from the developer's 
resource page...
   http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/developer-resources.html
...but unfortunately it doesn't work.  I believe the problem is that now 
that we have a central hudson system,even though the lucene zone is still 
doing lucene builds, i don't think it's running the hudson app on port 
8080.

I'll try to update things to link/redirect to...

http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Lucene/job/Lucene-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/
