SUBJECT: Re: Filtering of query based on field ID
DATE: 7 Oct 2005


: As a new user of Lucene I wonder if anyone can suggest how to do this query
: the fastest way:

Use a RangeFilter instead of a RangeQuery ... the performance will be much better.

keep in mind that either way you do it, you'll need to store your pathIds
with some sort of padding so that they sort lexigraphically, otherwise
when you ask for "1 to 1000" you won't get any numbers that don't start
with the digit "1".
