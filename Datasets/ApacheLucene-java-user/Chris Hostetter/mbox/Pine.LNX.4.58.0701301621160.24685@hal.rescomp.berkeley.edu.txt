1) did you look at the Explain output to seee what it's doing?
2) did you look atthe query.toString() of your Query object?

I suspect your query is being parsed as "Jess in the Author field, and
Hopkins in the defaultSearch field" - so the order you cited makes perfect
sense (assuming what you listed is everything in your index)

: Hi
: Thanks for the response
: To explain more clear  say I search on the Author field .
:
: Consider by data resides as follows
:
: Author                    title
: Jess Hopkins          ABC
: Jess howard            CCC
: James Hopkins       ZZZ
: Jess Hopkins          RRR
:
: I want all documents that were created by say Jess Hopkins
:
: My query goes like this
: author: Jess Hopkins
:
: I want the results to be returned for me in the following order
: Author                    title
: Jess Hopkins          ABC
: Jess Hopkins          RRR
: Jess howard            CCC
: James Hopkins       ZZZ
:
: But my result is in a different order
: Author                    title
: Jess howard            CCC
: Jess Hopkins          RRR
: James Hopkins       ZZZ
: Jess Hopkins          ABC
:
: It is not ordering based on the full text i give. It is taking each word and
: ordering accordingly ? Is that some thing additional I should say to
: retrieve the most matching  String first and the rest later ?
