: What about implementing a scoring policy that computes the score based
: only on which word position the term is matched?

if you wrote your own Similarity class and used SpanFirst queries that
should be possible.  It's the same basic principle as a Similarity
that scores entirely by tf, except that instead of tf being the only
method in your similarity class that doesn't return a 0 or 1, your
sloppyFreq method would be the only method returning something
interesting.


the Explanation class will be your best friend when debugging your code.
