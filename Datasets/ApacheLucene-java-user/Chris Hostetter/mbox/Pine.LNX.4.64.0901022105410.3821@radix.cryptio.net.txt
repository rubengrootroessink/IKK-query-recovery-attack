: you can solve your problem at search time by passing a custom Similarity class

In particular, consider subclassing SeweetSpotSimilrity ... instead of a 
truely "flat" tf function, it makes it easy for you to define a 
"sweetspot" so 2 instances of a word can score a lot higher then 1 
instance, and 3 can score slightly higher then 2, but 3-1000 instances can 
all score equivilently.
