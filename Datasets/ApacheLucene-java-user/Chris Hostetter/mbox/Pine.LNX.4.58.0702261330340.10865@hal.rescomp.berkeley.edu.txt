the java-user list is good -- but amazingly enough it's not unheard of for
two *whole* hours to go by without getting a direct response to a
question -- particularly when the last question/answer posted to the list
prior to your question was directly on topic: searching by dates, and
how to format the dates so that they would be in lexigraphic order...

...patience is a must when asking for help from others.

in general, if you'd searched the list archive before posting, you
probably would have had your answer immediately.
