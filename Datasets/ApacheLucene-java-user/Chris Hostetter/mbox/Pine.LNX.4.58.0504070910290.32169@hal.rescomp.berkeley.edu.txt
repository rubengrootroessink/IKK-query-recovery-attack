: 2) I doubt that ordering on 2 fields like "time" up to sec (or even to min)
: and "integer" will be quicker when sorting using just one "long"

i wouldn't be so sure untill you benchmark it ...

The biggest issue is the total number of Terms per field that come into
play when you sort ... with millisecond granularity, you have a huge
number of unique terms, if you were to break that up into 2 (or maybe
even 3) fields -- the first being down to minute resolution, then second
being seconds and milliseconds, then assuming you get logs and lots of
queries in a single minute, the number of unique terms for those two
fields decreases drasticly.

you may in fact find it faster to sort multiple fields in that case.
