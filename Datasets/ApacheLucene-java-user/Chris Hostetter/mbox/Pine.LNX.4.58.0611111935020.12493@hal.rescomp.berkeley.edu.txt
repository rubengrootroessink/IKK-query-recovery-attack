: Well, first ~ isn't a wildcard, it's a "fuzzy search" (aka similar terms).
: So getting "bellow" for "yellow~" is expected. Although, somewhat
: confusingly, "lemon orange"~10 is a proximity search.

FYI: the meme there is that in the QueryParser ~ denotes something is
sloppy or "loose" ... so  yellow~0.8  is a loose match on the word
"yellow" (with some character insertions/reordering/deletions allowed) and
"lemon orange"~10  is a loose match on the phrase "lemon orange" (with
some word insertions/reordering allowed)
