: It is strange that I was suggested not to call commit explicitly and leave
: it to the lucene but it seems it has its own disadvantages.

as long as you commit/close the writer cleanly on shutdown you should be 
fine ... i don't think you need to be so agressive as to call it on ever X 
docs (unless you want to)
