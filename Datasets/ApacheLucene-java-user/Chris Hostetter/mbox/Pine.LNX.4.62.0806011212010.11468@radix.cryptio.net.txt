Silly question, but you were sending your email to 
"java-user-unsubscribe@lucene.a..." and not "java-user@..." correct?

Are you still having a problem, or were you able to unsubscribe?

If it is still a problem, my suggestion is to file an "INFRA" bug in 
Jira using the "Mailing List" component, and attach copies of the email 
you sent (with full headers) and the response you got (with full 
headers)...
