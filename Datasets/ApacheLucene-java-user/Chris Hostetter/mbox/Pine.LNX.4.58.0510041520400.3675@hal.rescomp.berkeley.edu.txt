SUBJECT: Re: Threads locking around getFSDirectory
DATE: 4 Oct 2005


: How many IndexSearchers do people usually use in their applications?
: - In previous lucene versions, we found we had better concurrency using
: multiple IndexSearchers
: - Our current app uses an separate IndexSearcher for each thread (as needed)
: from a pool

In my experience, one "live" searcher is allways plenty, with an "on-deck"
searcher that is opened and used to warm up FieldCaches and filehandles
before being swaped over to replce the "live" searcher when updates have
been made.


: using the java nio package.... NioFSDirectory that offered better
: concurrency (

: We haven't found this in the lucene repository... where or is this available
: for use?

I think this is what you are looking for, but i'm not familiar with it at
all...
