SUBJECT: Re: alternative scoring algorithm for PhraseQuery
DATE: 6 Mar 2007

: My initial idea was to penalize a missing term position with its maximum error.
:
: Consider this:
: Query:  a b c d
: Document A: b c d
:
: Term a is missing, score it as if it was at the worst position possible
:
: result:       b c d a
: pos. diffs: -1 -1 -1 +3

side comment: this doesn't sound very useful, a document containing "b c
d" matches equally to a doc containing "b c d a" ? ... shouldn't a doc
containing "b c d a" be considered a much better match since it at least
contains all of the terms close together?
