: But what if that word is present in other fields also.
: does "docFreq " only look into that particular field ??

docFreq tells you the frequency of a term, a term is a field and a value
-- if you want the counts of a value across multiple fields, you'll have
to add them up yourself.  (or make a field that contains the union of all
the other fields)
