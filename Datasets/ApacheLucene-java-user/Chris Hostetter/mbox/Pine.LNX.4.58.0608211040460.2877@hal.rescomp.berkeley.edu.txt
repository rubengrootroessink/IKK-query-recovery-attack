SUBJECT: Re: Searching a untokenized field using SnowballAnalyzer
DATE: 21 Aug 2006

: doc.add(new Field("car","ferrari",Field.Store.NO,Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED);
:
: when I try to search it using the following search strings:
:
: car:ferrari

: it finds nothing.

the IndexWriter knew that the "car" field was UN_TOKENIZED, but the
QueryParser doesn't -- you've told it every query should be processed with
the SnowballAnalyzer.  (take a look at the query.toString() to see what i
mean)

Try using telling the QueryParser to use a PerFieldAnalyzer with the
KeywordAnalyzer configured for the fields you left UN_TOKENIZED and see if
that helps.
