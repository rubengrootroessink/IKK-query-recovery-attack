: that's probably because I move from lucene to solr.

: We will need to filter them from the result manually then first.

Can you explain why? ... in particular, can you explain what types of 
queries you have that produce negative scores for matches, but where you 
don't want to see those matches in the results?

becuase frankly the fact that some HitCollectors use to ignore negative 
scores was generally considered a bug -- the fact that a score is negative 
doesn't change that it's a match.  if you're dealing with some type of 
Query object whose results you think should be filtered to exclude the 
negativescores, that makes me wonder if hte Query itself is implemented 
incorrectly.

(excluding negative scores is like excluding scores below "3.1415" -- it's 
an arbitrary cut off that's generally meaningless)
