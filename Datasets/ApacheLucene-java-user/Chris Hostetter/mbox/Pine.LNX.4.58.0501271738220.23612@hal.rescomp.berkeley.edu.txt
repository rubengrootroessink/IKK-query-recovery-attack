In addition to the previous advice, keep in mind that depending on the
implimentation of your JVM, it may never actually "free" memory back to
the OS.  And even the JVMs that can, only do it after a GC which results
in a ratio of unused/used memory that they deem worthy of freeing (usually
based on tunning parameters)

assuming you are using a Sun JVM, take a look at...

http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc1.4.2/index.html

...and search for MinHeapFreeRatio and MaxHeapFreeRatio
