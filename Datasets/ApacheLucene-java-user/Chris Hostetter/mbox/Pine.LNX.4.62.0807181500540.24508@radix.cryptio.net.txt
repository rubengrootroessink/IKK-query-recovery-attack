DATE: 18 Jul 2008


: remote drive. Is there a way to easily modify lucene such that when it reads /
: writes from the Index it uses the XFile  object instead of File? In this way,
: there is a lot more flexibility on where the index can be stored (without
: having to rely on operating system mount points). Is it correct to subclass
: org.apache.lucene.store.Directory for this purpose? Are there any other

That is exactly what the org.apache.lucene.store.Directory abstraction is 
for, so you can keep your index anywhere you want.
