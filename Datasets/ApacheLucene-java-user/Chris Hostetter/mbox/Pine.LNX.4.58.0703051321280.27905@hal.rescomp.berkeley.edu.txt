: I override that method and just remove the try/catch block in which you put
: codes with Date stuffs and now it works fine
:
: my overridden method only return new RangeQuery(...);

subclassing QueryParser to override getRangeQuery and eliminate the
special Date code sounds like it would work just fine for you (and is in
fact mentioned in the javadocs for QueryParser)

i would however highly recomend you use ConstantScoreRangeQuery ... the
javadocs for RangeQuery explain why this is a good idea.
