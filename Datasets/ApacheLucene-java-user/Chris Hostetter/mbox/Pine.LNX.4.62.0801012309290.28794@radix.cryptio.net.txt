SUBJECT: Re: Question about Boolean Operators
DATE: 2 Jan 2008


: What's the difference between the "AND" and the "+" boolean operators. Also
: the "NOT" and "-" boolean operators? Are each of these pair of operators
: functionally equivalent?
: 
: >From the examples provided in the Query Syntax documentation at:
: http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html#Boolean%20operators
: it looks as if these are the same.

this doc may be of use to you...

http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BooleanQuerySyntax

In a nut shell: BooleanQuery is not really boolean ... prefix + and - 
corrispond directly to the MUST and MUST_NOT operators of a BooleanClause 
... AND, OR and NOT make best attempts at mapping singular clause rules to 
boolean operators.
