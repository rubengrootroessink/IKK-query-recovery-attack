SUBJECT: Re: span / position increment issue
DATE: 5 Jan 2006


: i have a problem with a SpanNearQuery returning incorrect (false
: positive) results.

I'm not familiar with how Span queries are implimented, but there doesn't
appear to be any test cases dealing with an index where term position
increments are ever 0, so i can neither confirm nor deny the bug you're
seeing.

Can you post code demonstrating the problem?  ideally in the form of
a simple, self contained, JUnit test?
