: Anyone  explain  solr's function  of  facet  ,thanks!

I gave  talk a few years back which goes into some of hte details of 
doing faceting in Solr.  that will give you a starting point, and then 
looking at the Solr "SimpleFacets" class can fill in the details.

http://people.apache.org/~hossman/apachecon2006us/

Note: the talk pre-dates the actual "SimpleFacets" functionality being 
added to Solr, so you won't see specific class names mentioned, and you 
will see some much simpler/crappier demo code of hte same principles.
