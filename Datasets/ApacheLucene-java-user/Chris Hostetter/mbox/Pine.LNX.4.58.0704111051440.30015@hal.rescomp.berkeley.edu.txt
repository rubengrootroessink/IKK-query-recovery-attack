: here is that it's not that I'm finding different documents, but rather it's
: the same set and they will be ranked differently.
:
: Can you point me at a resource that explains the ranking and coord factors?
: I'm trying to understand scoring better.  Going to the BooleanQuery

The best resource for stuff like this is the Scoring docs...

http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html

...it serves double duty as an explanation of hte underlying
Query/Weight/Scorer interaction works, but also gets ito the basics of the
"core" query/scorer classes (TermQuery, BooleanQuery, etc.)

The best way to understand this however is to try some examples and look
at the Explaination output for varoius queries and various documents.

Even though those Explanations are computed using an alternate code path,
a *LOT* of effort went into making sure they give na accurate picture into
why docs score the way they do against arbitrary query structures -- even
if they don't match at all)

(I know, because i'm the one that wrote all the test cases)
