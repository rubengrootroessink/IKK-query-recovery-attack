: 			for (String key : title.getTitel().split("\\n")  ) {
: 				titleDocument.add(new Field("TI", key, Field.Store.NO,
: 					Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
: 			}

that adds each new title one after the other with your analyzers
"getPositionIncrimentGap" in between them.

: but that didn't work. The query finds only matches for the first token
: in that field of a document.

you can insert an arbitrary marker token in between each title and search
for it with a spannearquery ... serach the archive for "sentence boundary"
or "page boundary"
