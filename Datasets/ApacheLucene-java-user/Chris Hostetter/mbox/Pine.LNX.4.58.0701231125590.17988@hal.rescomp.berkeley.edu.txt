: Chris, I was measuring the query time only. I have increased the heap size

that's still doesn't tell us what you are doing -- "query time" can mean a
lot of things ... are you using the Hits class? are you iterating over
results? are you pulling out stored fields? are you sorting? are you using
any Filters?

questions about improving concrete performance can only be answered by
looking at concrete code -- not vague discussions about the type of
activity being performed.
