SUBJECT: Re: Solr Cache
DATE: 23 Aug 2006


: It looks like Solr does not use a simple cached queryfilter as a query
: cache. Why is this? Is a cache queryfilter not efficient enough? Is this
: alternate method just so you can easily load the cache from an old
: Searcher to a new Searcher? Any info appreciated.

This would probably be better addressed on the solr-user mailing list --
please post any followup question there.

I'll through out some high level answers though in case any one else is
interested...

 * there's nothign to stop a solr request handler from using
   QueryFilter's if they want (i have and do)
 * Solr has several types of caches for different things
 * the "filterCache" has the most direct conceptual mapping to how a
   QueryFilter and CachedWrapperFilter work.  The big benefits it has are:
    - the DocSet API allows for more memory efficient representations of
      small sets of documents then just a BitSet
    - it can be configured with a size and replacement strategy
      (CachedWrapperFilter is more for things that can live "forever"
      relative the IndexReader)
