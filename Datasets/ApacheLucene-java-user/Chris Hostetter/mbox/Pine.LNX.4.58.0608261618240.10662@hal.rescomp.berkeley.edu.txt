DATE: 26 Aug 2006

: searcher. What exactly does that mean? Would I simply perform a search
: for "foo bar" or something like that? What happens inside the searcher so
: that it becomes 'warmed up'?

The key do warming up an index is do execute some *typical* queries.  If
your users typically query the contents and author fields, and sort on
pubDate or score then do at least one query that looks at both of those
fields, and does a sort on pubDate (there's nothing to be warmed with
regards to sorting on score)

the benefits of warming are that any initial "costs" are "paid" in advance
... getting the index files into your OS's filesystem cache is one cost,
building up the FilterCache for sorting is another cost ... i also seem to
recall that SegmentReaders cache every N terms (and their offset in the
file) so it's faster to find a sepcific Term when needed, but i'm not sure
if that is done when the SegmentReader is opened or if it happens the
first time it's asked for a TermEnum.
