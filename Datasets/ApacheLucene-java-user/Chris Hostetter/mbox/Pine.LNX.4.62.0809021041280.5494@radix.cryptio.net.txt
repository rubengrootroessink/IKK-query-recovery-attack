I may be missunderstanding your question, but i wouldn't attempt to tackle 
this with a TokenFilter unless you want both the "tag" and the numbers to 
appear in the same field.  i think what you want to do is first parse 
whatever file format you are dealing with, then build Documents based on 
the individual Fields.

a TokenFilter comes into play when you are Analyzing individual Field 
values.

but since i have very little understanding of your problem, and what you 
are trying to achieve, i may be way off base.

: <tag> <#1> <#2>
: 
: <tag> is a fixed list of words
: <#x> are small numbers <100
: 
: My idea is to simply build a TokenFilter that will look for those... do I
: have it right ?
: 
: Some side questions:
: what if I want to index <tag> <#1> <#2> as keywords ?
: what if I also want to give full text search on the select documents ?
