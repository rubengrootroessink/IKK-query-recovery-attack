There has been discussion in the past about how PhraseQuery artificially 
requires that the Terms you add to it must be in the same field ... you 
could theoretically modify PhraseQuery to have a tpe of query that 
required terms in one field be withing (slop)N positions of a term in a 
"parallel" field ... with N=0 you would get something like what you're 
describing...

(that thread oes on to discuss the complexities of trying to make 
something like this work if one of the query clauses you want in your 
"phrase" is non-trivial like a RangeQuery)
