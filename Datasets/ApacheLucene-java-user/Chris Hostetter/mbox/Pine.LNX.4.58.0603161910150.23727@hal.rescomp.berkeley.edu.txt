if you are trying to deal with teh possibility that your indexing process
might crash hard, then there's not much you can do about the possibiity of
your index getting corrupted ... that's where backups are useful.

if you are trying to have a way to "cancel" your indexing process and then
start again later that's not really an issue with lucene -- you just need
a cleaner way to notify your application that you want it to stop, close
whatever IndexWriter/IndexReader you may be useing and shutdown cleanly.
