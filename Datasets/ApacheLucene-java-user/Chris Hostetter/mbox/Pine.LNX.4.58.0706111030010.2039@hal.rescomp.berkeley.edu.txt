SUBJECT: Re: Retrieving TermVectors from a Field over the full index?
DATE: 11 Jun 2007


: It seems like what's missing is the efficient ability for
: TermDocs/TermInfosReader to seek to the first term of a given field.
: They already can seek to a given specific term; with some small

isn't TermEnum.skipTo(new Term("field","") followed by
termDocs.seek(TermEnum) going to take care of this for you?

The first call should efficinetly skip to the first term in the field
"field" (if there is one) and the second call should efficiently seek the
TermDoc to the first doc containing that term.

(This is how TermScorer and RangeFilter work work as i recall)
