: Question: how do I go about manipulating the search results?  Is it possible
: to "intercept" the listing of HTML pages returned by the Lucene search
: function and modify the report it sends to the screen.
:
: Can this be as simple as adding a line to the Lucene Java code so that
: instead of reporting a simple chapter number, it will report the chapter

please bear in mind that Lucene is not an application, it is a library ...
it will return you the results of a query as a datastructure which you can
then dispplay in your application anyway you want.  it sounds like you are
looking at a particular chunk of example client code that does a search
and prints some results to the screen (perhaps you are even looking at the
demo that comes with lucene and is refered to in the "getting started"
tutorial) ... if it is usefull to use that as a starting point for you
application then by all means do so, but the Lucene library doesn't know
(and doesn't care) how you are using the results it produces ... that's
entirely up to you.
