:     hits = searcher.search(query, new Sort("sid", true));

you don't show where searcher is initialized, and you don't clarify how
you are timing your multiple iterations -- i'm going to guess that you are
opening a new searcher every iteration right?

sorting on a field requires pre-computing an array of information for that
field -- this is both time and space expensive, and is cached per
IndexReader/IndexSearcher -- so if you reuse the same searcher and time
multiple iterations you'll find that hte first iteration might be somewhat
slow, but the rest should be very fast.
