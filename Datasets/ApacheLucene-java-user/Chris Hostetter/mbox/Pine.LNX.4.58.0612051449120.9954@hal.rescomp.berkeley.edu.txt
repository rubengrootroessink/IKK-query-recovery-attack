As stated before, a *self contained* test case would help people diagnose
your problem ... just cutting and pasting a few snippets of your code is
not enough for people to reproduce your problem.


: And the return is: contents:"(wind window)"

a MultiPhraseQuery that looks like that should be functionally equivilent
to a BooleanQuery .. as a matter of fact, it will rewrite to a
BooleanQuery ... does a straight search on either "wind" or "window"
return any results for you?
