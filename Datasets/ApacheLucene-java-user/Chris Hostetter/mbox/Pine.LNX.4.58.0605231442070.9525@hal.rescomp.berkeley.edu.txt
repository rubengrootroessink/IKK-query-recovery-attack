: Is it possible to have an IndexWriter apply different Similarity
: models to different Fields?

As far as i know, the only way Similarity comes into play when using an
IndexWriter is lengthNorm, and it is passed the fieldName so it's easy to
make it's behavior field specific (SimilarityDelegator makes it easy to do
this)

At query time things like coord and queryNorm don't erreally make sense as
field specific methods; the idf method on the other hand takes in a Term
(or a Collection of Terms) so it's also easy to customize.

tf and sloppyFreq however are somewhat frustrating ... i've definitely
wished more then once that they took in a field name as a parameter.
