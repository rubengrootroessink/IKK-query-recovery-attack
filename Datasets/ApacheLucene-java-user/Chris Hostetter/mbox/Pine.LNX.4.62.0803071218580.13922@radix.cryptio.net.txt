i think you are missreading that code.  the "needParens" variable adds 
parens arroudn the *entire* "this" BooleanQuery if "this" has a boost or a 
non 0 minShouldMatch value ... BooleanQuery.toString only adds parens 
arround individual clauses if those clauses are themselves boolean 
queries ... which is the point i was making.
