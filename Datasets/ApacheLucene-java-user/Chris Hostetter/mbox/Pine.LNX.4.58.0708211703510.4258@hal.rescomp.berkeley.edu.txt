SUBJECT: Re: NPE in IndexReader
DATE: 22 Aug 2007


: I found out in latest MultiReader.java, the "SegmentInfos" is set to null.

: However, segmentInfos are used in several places, causing NPEs.
: For example, in IndexReader.acquireWriteLock(),

MultiReader was refactored into two classes: MultiReader which is now only
constructed from other readers, and MultiSegmentReader which is what
IndexReader.open returns when a directory contans multiple segments ...
segmentInfos shouldn't be needed in the first case -- and doesn't make
much sense at all.
