I believe hte topic you are refering to is typically refered to as
"clustering" ... you may wnat to search for that.

I've never really looked at it, but carrot2 seems to be a favorite among
those who do result clustering.

: Hello,
: I tried to search myself for soultion, but without any good result, so I
: want to ask group.
: My problem concerns result grouping, the best example will be Google search
: where you have results sorted by relevance, and also grouped by domain (they
: have little indent/margin). In my project I want to get similar
: functionality, without very huge CPU consumption.
:
: Can you share any helpful hints ?
