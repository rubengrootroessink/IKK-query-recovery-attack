it sounds like what you're doing makes a lot of sense given your
situation, and the nature of your data.

the one thing you might not have concidered yet, which doesn't have to
make a big difference in your overall architecture, but might influence
the specifics of your design, is the idea that eventually you might want
to seperate Projects on onto different physical servers, letting you put
"important" projects on their own server, so they are alllways available
(even if they are the LRU).
