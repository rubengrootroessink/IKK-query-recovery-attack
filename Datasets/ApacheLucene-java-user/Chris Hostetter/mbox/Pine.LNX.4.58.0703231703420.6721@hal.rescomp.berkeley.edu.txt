: One final note, it may be much easier for you to throw all the
: fields into a single uber-field and search that rather than implement
: all four separate clauses, but it's a trade off between simplicity and
: size.....

this would be a very simple way to get the behavior you describe straight
from the lucene QueryParser ... i would certinaly recommend that approach.
