: Did you come across :
:       scoreNorm = 1.0f / topDocs.getMaxScore();
: or something of this sort in Hits?
: As per my knowledge, the initial score is more than 1 but finally the scores
: get divided by the maxScore of the matched doc set. i.e. Setting an upper
: limit of 1 (for the max scorer).

that code results in a "psuedo-normalization" that generally isn't 
meaningful -- mainly because it's normalized relative the highest scoring 
doc for that query against that index, not any absolute highest possible 
score for that query, or absolute highest possible score for that index.

scores aren't comparable from one query to the next, so normalizing 
between0 and 1 won't tell you anything meaningful -- a "normalized" score 
of "1" from query A isn't neccesarily better then a normalized score of 
0.9 from query B.
