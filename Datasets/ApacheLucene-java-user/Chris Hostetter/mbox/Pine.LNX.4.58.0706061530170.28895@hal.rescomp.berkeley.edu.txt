: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
: org.apache.lucene.document.Document.add(Lo
: rg/apache/lucene/document/Field;)V

: Very strange since the exception is NoSuchMethod  Document.add(Field)

I *believe* the problem is that there is actually no such method
(Document.add(Field)) in the Lucene trunk -- that method use to exist, but
was replaced with Document.add(Fieldable) ... Field is an instance of
Fieldable so your code will compil and run, but binary class files which
were compiled against older versions of Lucene will not.

if you compile all of the PDFBox code from source, it might work ..
laternately you could use the version of Lucene that PDFBox was compiled
against.
