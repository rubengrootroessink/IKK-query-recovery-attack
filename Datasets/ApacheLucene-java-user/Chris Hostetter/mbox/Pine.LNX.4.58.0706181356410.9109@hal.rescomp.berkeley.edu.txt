: Another good old trick is to index field values (tokenized) with
: appended special starting and ending tokens, e.g. instead of "Hiran
: Magri" use "_start_ Hiran Magri _end_". Then you can query for fields
: that are exactly equal to a phrase, while still retaining the
: possibility to search by individual terms and phrases not equal to the
: field value.

or build a SpanNearQuery, and then put it inside a SpanFirst query
configured to be as long as the number of terms (+desired
slop) in the SpanNearQuery.
