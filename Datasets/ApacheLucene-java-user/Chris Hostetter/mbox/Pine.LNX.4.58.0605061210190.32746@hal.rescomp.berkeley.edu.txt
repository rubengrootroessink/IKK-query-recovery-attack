: I'm not sure if it's worth fixing them all or not... implementing set

i'm -1 against making this change.  The results of searching on these
query objects may be the same -- but that doesn't mean the query objects
themselves should be considered equivilent.  attempting to define them as
equal would lead to a slippery slope of trying to determine that any two
queries (possibly implimented by different classes) are "equal" because
they produce the same results.

Assume that (hypothetically) a SpanNearQuery containing two
SpanTermQueries with inOrder=1 and slop=0 scores *exactly* the same as a
PhraseQuery with 0 slop containing the same two terms.  SHould these
queries be considered equal ?
