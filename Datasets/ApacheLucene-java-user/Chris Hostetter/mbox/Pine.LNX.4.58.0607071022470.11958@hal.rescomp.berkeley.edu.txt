: Subject: Nutch- Better than Lucene?

: > http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/Nutch_-_The_Java_Search_Engine

Asking if Nutch is better then Lucene is like asking if a Truck is better
then a Combustion Engine -- you can't compare them.  A truck is a vehicle
tht does stuff, and it gets it's power from a Combustion Engine, but the
engine itself could actually be used to power a great many other things
(not just vehicles)

Lucene is a Java IR Library or a "search library" if you will -- Nutch
uses the Lucene library to power the searching it does, but there is a lot
of other stuff going on in Butch (crawling for example) ... if you wnat a
"search engine" then Nutch is your man, if you want a "search library"
then use Lucene directly.
