DATE: 22 Apr 2005

: the app using JProfiler and found out that 90% of time
: is spent in the IndexWriter.addDocument call. As

what analyzer are you using?

: My machine: Pentium 4 CPU 2.40 GHz
:             RAM 1 GB

what JVM args are you using? (in particular: how much ram are you telling
the JVM to use) ... what else is running on this box while you index?

: Any help appreciated.

The biggest help anyone an give you is if you post your code ... there may
be little things in the way you are using the IndexWriter that will jump
out at people if they see exactly what you are doing.
