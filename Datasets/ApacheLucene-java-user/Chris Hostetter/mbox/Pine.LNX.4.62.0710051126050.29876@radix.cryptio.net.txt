: I understand the OP to want a PhraseQuery that has an intention (rather than
: side-effect) of doing proximity-based scoring.
: 
: "phrase query here"~1000 is the current hack that performs fine for N < 3
: query terms, but fails currently for N >= 3 since it requires that all the
: terms be present.  For larger queries, this effectively nullifies the
: usefulness of the phrase query approach.

that's what i thought first too, and it is a problem i'd eventaully like 
to tackle ... it was the part about "c" being in a differnet field from 
"a" and "b" that confused me ... i don't know what that exactly is being 
suggested here.
