if you want to write some there is a lot of good helper code already out 
there for making sure the hits and scores produced by a query match the 
explanations produced by that same query...

chrish@asimov:~/svn/lucene-clean$ ls src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/*Explan*
src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/TestComplexExplanations.java
src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/TestComplexExplanationsOfNonMatches.java
src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/TestExplanations.java
src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/TestSimpleExplanations.java
src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/TestSimpleExplanationsOfNonMatches.java

you could add directly to TestSimpleExplanations and 
TestComplexExplanations assuming you modify the index 
TestExplanations.setUp to include some payload data ... then you get the 
testing of NonMatches for free.
