: Thanks for the reply. I didn't know that as all the examples on Lucene still
: use the old approach.
: I had a look at the API  and it does not seem to provide any new methods as
: a substitute for Field.Text.

Please note there is a FAQ specificly about "How do I get code written
for Lucene 1.4.x to work with Lucene 2.x?"
