correct, adding new syntax to the parser currently requires editing the 
grammer.  

Something else you might consider is that ifyou expect "BESTOF" type 
queries to be the default behavior people want, you could just overriget 
the getBooleanQuery method of hte QUeryarser and *always* generate a 
DisMax query for any query containing multiple cuases.

it may not be what you want ... but it's pretty easy.

: > :   BESTOF( "apple"^10, "orange"^9, "pear"^8, "peach"^8, "grapes"^2 )
