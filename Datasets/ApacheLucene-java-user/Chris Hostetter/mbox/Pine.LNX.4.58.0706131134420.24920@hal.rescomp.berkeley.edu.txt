Israel, I don't really know much about MultiSearcher, but just to clarify:
are you saying that the change you have works ok, as long as people are
also using hte patch in LUCENE-789 (which will be in 2.2) or are you
saying that the change you tried doesn't work when using a custom
similarity, for the same reasons as LUCENE-789?

If it does work with the patch in LUCENE-789 and provies the same results
with less network overhead, then by all means please open a jira issue and
submit a patch ... it seems like a simple change and it seems correct to
me ... hopefully someone more knowledgable about MultiSearcher then myself
can comment on it and we can commit it.
