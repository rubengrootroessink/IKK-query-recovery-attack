SUBJECT: RE: FilteredQuery and Boolean AND
DATE: 6 Apr 2005


: shouldn't.  If the FilteredQuerys worked properly, they could be put in
: a BooleanQuery and then a BooleanClause.  That's why I was doing that

Peter:

Comments in bug#34279 indicate that this problem may have been
inadvertantly fixed in the latest development version of the code base --
or at least, the testcase i submitted now passes.

if you could ammend my test case with more examples of the types of
complex combinations of FilteredQuery/BooleanQuery that you've seen fail
(or add a new testcase file that works in a similar way, against a self
contained RAMDirectory based index) it would help to clarify wether the
problem is genuinely "Fixed", or if the test case i created was just a
lucky abnormality.
