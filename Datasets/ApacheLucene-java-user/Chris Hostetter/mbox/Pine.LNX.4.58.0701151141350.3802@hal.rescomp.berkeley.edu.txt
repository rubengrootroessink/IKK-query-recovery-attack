SUBJECT: Re: ordered by the default
DATE: 15 Jan 2007


: My search application is returning hits ordered by the default relevance. I
: migrated my application from lucene 1.3 to lucene 2.0. I observed that the
: documents are returned with a different order. I tested in using the new
: Scorer (BooleanScorer2) and in using the old scorer class (BooleanScorer)
: but that didn't fix the problem.

my tenure started post-1.4.3, so i don't know if any delibeate score
changes were introduced between 1.3 and 1.4.3.  There aren't any
intentional score changes thta i can recall between 1.4.3 and 2.0 -- but
depending on what types of queries you do, there have been some bug fixes
for various query types which have had a side effect of changing the
scores (becuase they now score correctly).  The other possibility is that
QueryPArser semantics which were somewhat undefined before have been
formalized a bit more, so if you use that class you may find that it's
parsing your queries slightly differently and producing differnet query
objects.
