: Im interested in intersecting two indices. Or more exactly, I only want
: those terms of index A that also occur in index B.
:
: How could i do that (efficiently)?

look at the TermEnum class, and the IndexReader.terms() method.  It
iterates over the Terms in order.  If you open a reader for each index,
and iterate in sequence it should be easy to get what you want.
