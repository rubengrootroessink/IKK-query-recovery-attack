: Each doc is going to get a score -- if the score is positive the doc
: will be a hit, if the score is 0 the doc will not be a hit.

that's actually a fairly missleading statement ... the guts of Lucene
doesn't prevent documents from "matching" with a negative score
(specificly: a HitCollector can be asked to collect a match with a
negative score)

(dropping matches with negative scores only happens in the Hits
class/collector as i recall)
