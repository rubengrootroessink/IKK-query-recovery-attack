take a look at the HitCollector and Filter APIs .. you can impliment any
logic you want in either of those classes to restrict what results you get
-- and the FieldCache gives you an easy way to check what the value of a
particular indexed field is.

storing the mappings of field value to "best" matching doc is up to you.

: g'day,
:
: i've two questions.
:
: let's say the following is my index with 2 field : title and contents
:
: title                   contents
: beer                  beer is good
: beer                  beer is good
: cat                    sleepy
: dog                   what a cute one!
: beer                  beer is good
:
: if i do a search on beer, i'll get 3 result returns and three of them
: are the same, is there any elegant way to workaround so the hitlist
: contains only one document instead of 3? (and i want the index
: contains duplicate records for some reason)
:
: ____
:
:
: yet, another senario,
:
: title                   contents                      location
:         date
: beer                  beer is god                   /usr/data/beer
