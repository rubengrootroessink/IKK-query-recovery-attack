The information Erick gave you when you asked this question yesterday is
all very accurate -- the one addition i would make is that you don't need
SpanNear queries to take advantage of positionINcrimentGap --
PhraseQueries do that to.

Consolidating your fields into a single "all" field, or constructing a
BoolenQuery across all of your existing fields are really the two
main options -- each with their tradeoffs.
