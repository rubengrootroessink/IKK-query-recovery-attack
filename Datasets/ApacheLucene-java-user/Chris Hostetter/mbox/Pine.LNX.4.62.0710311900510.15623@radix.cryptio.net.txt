NOTE: the score returned by Hits is not a "percentage" ... it is an 
arbitrary number less then 1.  it might be the "raw score" of the document 
or it might be the result of dividing the "raw score" by the "raw score" 
of the highest scoring document, if hte raw score of the highest scoring 
document is greater then 1

(kinda silly huh?)

basically it's just a way to ensure you always have a number less then 1 
-- but a score of 0.9 from one query isn't neccessarily better then a 
score of 0.1 from another query.

you replied to and your question is "hidden" in that thread and gets less 
attention.   It makes following discussions in the mailing list archives 
particularly difficult.
