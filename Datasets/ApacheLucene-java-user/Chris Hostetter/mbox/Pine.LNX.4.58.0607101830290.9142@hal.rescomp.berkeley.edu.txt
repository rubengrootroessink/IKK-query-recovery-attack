: I could (1) up front, put in both versions of the numbers or (2) during
: query, play with the number and search both ways.  What's the best
: practice approach?

In the imortal words of Erik Hatcher...

	"It Depends :)"

#1 takes up more space on disk and in memory, and makes it imposible to
sort on that field (you can only sort on fields with 0 or 1 terms per doc)
... #2 makes the query take a little longer ... you really won't notice a
difference if you have an index of 1000 Documents and one user, but you
might if you have 1,000,000 items and 100 concurrent users.
