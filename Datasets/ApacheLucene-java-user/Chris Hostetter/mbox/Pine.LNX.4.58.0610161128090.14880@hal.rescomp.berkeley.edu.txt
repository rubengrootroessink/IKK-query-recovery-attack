RangeQueries expand to a boolean query containing all terms in the range,
so it doesn't matter if you search on a course grain range, if you store
the dates with high granulatiry -- the number of terms will be high.

this wiki page discusses some of the merrits of using multiple date fields
with various levels of granulairty...

...but frankly, i suggest you just use a ConstantScoringRangeQuery (which
uses a RangeFilter under the covers) and save yourself the headache.

: Subject: BooleanQuery.TooManyClauses exception
:
: Hi - Can someone explain the reason why I'm getting the TooManyClauses
: exception?  I have a general understanding of the issue based on my
: reading, but I don't understand the mechanics of the it.  Specifically
: how is my query being expanded to cause this problem?  How am I
: exceeding the default 1024 clauses?  My query looks like the following.
:
:
:
: pyLabel:(test) OR pyDescription:(test) AND ( pxCreateDateTime:[20060401
: TO 20060901] )
:
:
:
: The problem only happens when my date range exceeds ~2 months.  The date
: is indexed with more precision, but for my query purposes I only care
: about the date and not the time stamp portion.  What can I do to solve
: or mitigate this problem and be able to search a date range that spans
: at least a year? Is setMaxClauseCount() a predictable solution?  How
: would reducing the precision of my date during indexing help?
