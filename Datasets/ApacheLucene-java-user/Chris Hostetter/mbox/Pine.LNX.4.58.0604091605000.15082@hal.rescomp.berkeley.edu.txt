DATE: 9 Apr 2006


: I noticed when using the Luke tool that I it provides a set of top words
: from an index.  What is a programmatic way of doing this?

I'm not intimately familar with Luke, so i'm not sure what you mean by
"top words" but this utility class might be what you are refering to...

http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/miscellaneous/src/java/org/apache/lucene/misc/HighFreqTerms.java?view=markup

..if not, i would download the Luke source and poke arround in their to
see if you can find the functionality you are looking for.
