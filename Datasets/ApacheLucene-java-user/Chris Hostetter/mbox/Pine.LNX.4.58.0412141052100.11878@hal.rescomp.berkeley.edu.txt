: select * from MY_TABLE where MY_NUMERIC_FIELD > 80
:
: as far as I know you have only the range query so you will have to say
:
: my_numeric_filed:[80 TO ??]
: but this would not work in the a/m example or am I missing something?

RangeQuery allows you to an open ended range -- you can tell the
QueryParser to leave your range opened ended using hte keyword "null",
ie...

	my_numeric_filed:[80 TO null]
