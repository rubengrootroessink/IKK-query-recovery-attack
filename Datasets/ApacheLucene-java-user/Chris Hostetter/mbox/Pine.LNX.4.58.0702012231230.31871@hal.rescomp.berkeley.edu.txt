SUBJECT: Re: bad queryparser bug
DATE: 2 Feb 2007


: The query parser produces the correct query with the parenthesis.
: But, I'm still looking for a fix for this. I could use some advice on where
: to look in QueryParser to fix this.

the best advice i can give you: don't use the binary operators.

  * Lucene is not a boolean logic system
  * BooleanQuery does not impliment boolean logic
  * QueryParser is not a boolean language parser

(If i could go back in time and stop the AND/OR/NOT/&&/|| "aliases" from
being added to the QueryParser -- i would)
