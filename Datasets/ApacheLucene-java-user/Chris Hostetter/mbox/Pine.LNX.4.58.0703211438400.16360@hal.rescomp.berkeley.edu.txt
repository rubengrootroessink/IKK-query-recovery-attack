SUBJECT: Re: Lazy field loading in
DATE: 21 Mar 2007


: IndexReader class for lazy field loading, the search API in IndexSearcher
: does not contain such facilities. Hence, the Documents I get from the
: Hits.doc() would not benefit from the mentioned feature.

Lazy loading stored fields is really about perfermance tweaking ... if
yoiu are that concerned baout performance, you shouldn't be using Hits at
all.

there was a change made to the trunk recently to support
Searchable.doc(int,FieldSelector) but i dont' think you'll ever see a
method returning Hits which takes in a FieldSelector .. use TopDocs or
TopFieldDocs and fetch the docs with calls to doc().
