DATE: 11 Dec 2006


if you are trying to think of Lucene's docid as a meaningful number, you
are doing something wrong.

A lot of people want to view Lucene docids the same way they look at
auto-incrimented unique keys in a database -- don't do that.  Instead
think of them as memory addresses in C or C++ ... they are a handy
numberic value that tells Lucene at what offset in various segment files
it can find data about that document -- as your index changes, as data
gets moved arround, docids change.

the best corrallary that can be made to a database is not auto-generated
unique keys, it's row numbers ... the physical row number of where that
row is in the sequence of rows in your table -- a number most databases
never give you access to unless you are dealing withthe low level
internals of hte table, because as you add or deleted lots of data, as you
drop and load new indexes those numbers can change.

if you want control of a unique ID for each of hte documents in your index
-- at one as a field just like any other.
