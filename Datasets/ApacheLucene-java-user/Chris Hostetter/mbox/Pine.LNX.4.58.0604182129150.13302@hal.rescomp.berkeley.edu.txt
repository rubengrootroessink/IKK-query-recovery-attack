SUBJECT: Re: using custom sort method
DATE: 19 Apr 2006


: I have asked the exact same question a few weeks ago. I just follow the
: customized distance example and loop the results again to get another
: field and compute the scores. It will be painful if you need more than 3
: fields. So far I didn't find any other way to do it. Hope we can see

It's not clear to me what exactly you've tried so far, and what it doesn't
do that you want it to ... can you post some code demonstrating your
problem?

: some new classes to address the problem. To be able to customize ranking
: is very important to a search engine.

Customizing ranking/scoring is not exactly the same thing as defining your
own sort -- there are lots of ways to customize the scoring of your
queries: doc boosts, field boosts, query boosts, customomized Similarity ...

you should also take a look at the FunctionQueries available in Solr, they
allow you to define custom functions that are factoried into the total
score of your query...
