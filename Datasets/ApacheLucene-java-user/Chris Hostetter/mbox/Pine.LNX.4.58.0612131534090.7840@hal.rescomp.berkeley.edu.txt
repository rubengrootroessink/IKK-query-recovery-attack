:   For 10 million records We recommend an strong database such as Oracle.

eh ... who is "We" in that statement?

I Suspect you'll find other people on this list who have no problems
running Lucene indexes containing 10 million documents.

If you want a database, then by all means use a database, but if you want
a Lucene index of 10 million documents, you can build one.
