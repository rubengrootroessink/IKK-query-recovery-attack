: This is the simplest thing I could think of:
:
:   * store full namespace path as one term: "1/2/3"
:   * store each namespace identity as on term: "1", "2", "3"

I use the second approach for finding all Docs at a given node or below in
the tree ... instead of the first appraoch, have a field which just
contains the specific node (not it's parents)) a Document is located at
for doing the first type of query you described (at a node, but not below
it)
