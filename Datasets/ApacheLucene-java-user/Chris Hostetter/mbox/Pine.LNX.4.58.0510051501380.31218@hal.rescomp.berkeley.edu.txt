SUBJECT: Re: Query to return all documents in the index
DATE: 5 Oct 2005


: method to gather results. But as it turns out, sometimes we just want all of
: the documents that match with the filter, sorted by the sort field. Does
: anyone know a query that returns all the documents in the index, so that i
: could use that in this case?

use a ConstantScoreQuery wrapped arround your filter.  It works with
lucene1.4.3, but requires java1.4 ...
