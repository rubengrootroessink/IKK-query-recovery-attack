: I am doing some documentation on scoring and I am interested in use
: cases people have for overriding the DefaultSimilarity.  If you can
: share what you did and why you did it, it would be much appreciated.

I touched on this a little bit when i commited SweetSpotSimilarity...

...really any situation where you know more about your data then just that
it's "text" is a situation where it *might* make sense to to override your
SImilarity method.
