I don't think << category:* >> does what you think it does.

category:[* TO *] will find all docs that have any indexed tokens in the 
category field, so combining that as a prohibited clause with a 
mandatory MatchAllDocsQuery will give you all docs that don't have 
anything indexed in the category field....

                *:* -category:[* TO *]

(although i can't remember if *:* is a Solr extension of part of hte core 
QueryParser)
