SUBJECT: Re: Position of a word in a document?
DATE: 16 May 2006


: There is a "TermPositions pos = reader.termPositions();" [reader is an
: instance of IndexReader] - but I have no clue, how to get a position of
: a hit in a document. What can I do with TermPosition?
:
: So, I have all hits of my query with "Hits hits =
: searcher.search(query);" - with the help of "hits" I know the
: document(s) where I can find my query ... but how can I retrieve the
: position now?!

Start by understanding the TermDocs API -- TermPositions subclasses it.
TermDocs provides a way to iterate over docid,frequency pirs ..
TermPositions adds another dimension to the iteration by letting you
iterate over the positions within the document that a term appears in.
