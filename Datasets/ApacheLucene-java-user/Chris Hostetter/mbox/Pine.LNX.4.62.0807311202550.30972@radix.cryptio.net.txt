SUBJECT: RE: too many clause exception when using a filter
DATE: 31 Jul 2008


: Or, to avoid the clause limit issue altogether, you could use a 
: PrefixFilter instead of a QueryWrapperFilter around a 
: {Wildcard,Prefix}Query:

right ... the missconception here seems to be that if you use a Filter, 
all your Too Many Clauses problems are sovled -- but if that Filter is 
just a wrapper arround a query, the problem is still there.
