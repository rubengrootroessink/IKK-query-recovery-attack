SUBJECT: Re: how to forbid prefetching found Documents?
DATE: 7 Jan 2006


This is the reason i suggested a while back that the initiall call to to
getMoreDocs should be moved out of the Hits constructor, so no prefetching
is done untill the client asks for hte first hit they want -- if on page#2
of some paginated results we wants docs 101-200, then the first prefetch
will get 1-200

...but since I never actaully use a Hits object in any of my apps, i
haven't tried actually making these changes to see if it works out well.

:
: Correct, it does not.  The first time Hits is returned to you, it will
: internally contain the ids and scores of the top 100, but not the
: stored fields (the Document instance).
:
: When you access beyond the 100th element, Hits will internally redo
: the search asking for more ids and scores this time.
