: How can that be so? When the segments file is re-written it will surely
: clobber the copy rather than creating a new INODE, because it has the same
: name... wouldn't it?

if you take a look at SegmentInfos.java you'll see that an existing
segments file is never modified.  a new segments file is created (named
creatively "segments.new" and once it is complete, it is renamed
"segments" in the index directory (so the old inode is completley
unmodified and still accessible from the cloned directory)

: 	echo update > x/x.txt

i believe what is happening is analogous to...

        echo update > x/x.new
        mv x/x.new x/x.txt
