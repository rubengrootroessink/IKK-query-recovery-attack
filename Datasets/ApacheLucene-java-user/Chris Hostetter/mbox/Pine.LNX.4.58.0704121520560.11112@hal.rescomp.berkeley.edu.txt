: But not which terms have an odd IDF value because of those deleted
: documents.  How much does the IDF value contribute to the "score" in
: search?

all idf's are affected equally, because the 'numDocs" value used is
allways the same ... it really shouldn't affect the scores from a query,
it just makes it hard to compare the scores you get from one index reader
with the scores you get from a new index reader after deleting and
readding a bunch of documents.
