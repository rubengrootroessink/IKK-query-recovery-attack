: Hello everyone,
: 
: I'm seeing the tutorial about Dutch WebSearcher in this URL:
: http://peterpuwang.googlepages.com/NutchGuideForDummies.htm

I'm not sure what "Dutch" is, but your question seemed to be about "Nutch" 
:) ... if you have additional questions, you'll probably want to email the
nutch-user@lucene list, and not the java-user@lucene list ... "Nutch" and 
"Lucene Java" are two very different projects, with very different user 
communities.
