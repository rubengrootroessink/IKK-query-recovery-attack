First off: i've changed the reply to be the java-user@lucene list ... that
is the appropriate place to ask questions about using the Lucene APIs.

Second: once you have a test index built, and you can do some test
searches to verify it contains what you think it does (take a look at Luke
to be sure) read up on the IndexReader.terms method and the TermEnum class
-- it's the easiest way to get a list of every term in your index.  Then
takes a look at IndexReader.termDocs and the TermDocs class -- that's how
you can get a list of every document that matches a particular term

:
: Hi, I want to create a back-of-book type index for Eclipse help (not
: available by default). This index will list all indexed terms such that the
: indexed term may be clicked and the original document displayed (as in MS
: style help systems).
:
: Where should I begin? The first thing I suppose would be, how do I access
: the indexed terms (using Lucene's API) and have them e.g. display on a HTML
: page with hyperlinks to the original doc.
:
: Any help appreciated.
