DATE: 29 May 2007

: For instance, the SegmentTermDocs class implements the TermDocs interface.
: However, there is no information about this SegmentTermDocs class in the
: javadoc.

SegmentTermDocs is a package protected class, so it's javadocs are not
exposed (it cannot be directly used by clients, so there is no reason to
advertise it's existence in the javadocs.)
