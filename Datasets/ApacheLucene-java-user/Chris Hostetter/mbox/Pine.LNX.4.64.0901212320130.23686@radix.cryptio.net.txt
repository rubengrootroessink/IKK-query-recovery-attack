SUBJECT: Re: why would Explanation be *ALWAYS* null?
DATE: 22 Jan 2009


: even mention that possibility. When I debug through the call, I find the 
: "explanation" in this code inside class MarkupContainsQuery (which is 
: the code that gets called):
	...
: 			// TODO SY - implement
: >>>>>>>>>		return null;
: 		}

that's definitely not good ... but (unless i'm a *LOT* more tired then 
i think) it's also not in the Lucene code base.

: This seems, um, bad, esp. as I did nothing to *decide* the type of my 
: query, but merely created it from the user-entered string like this:
: 
: 	Query query = _parser.parse(queryString);
: 	Query rewrite = query.rewrite(_reader);
: 
: And the field _parser was created like this: 
: 
: 	Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
: 	QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("contents", analyzer);
: 	_parser XMLFragmentParser(parser);

I don't really understand that code ... it doesn't seem to be legal java. 
is that last line suppose to be an assignment to a _parser variable from 
a constructor to some class named XMLFragmentParser ?

where did you get XMLFragmentParser from?  I'm seeing mentions here that 
seem like they might be applicable, but i'm not fiding any code...

: So -- what's the right thing to do? 

I'd file a bug with whoever provided you the XMLFragmentParser and 
MarkupContainsQuery classes.
