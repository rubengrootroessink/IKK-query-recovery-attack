I've never given this much thought, but i know that merging indexes can be
done with IndexReaders, and I know i've seen a FilterIndexReader class
which lets you proxy to another IndexReader but "filter out" some data by
overriding methods and using FilterTermDocs, FilterTermEnum and
FilterTermPositions ... would it be possibe to subclass FilterIndexReader
with an instance that checked the docFreq of each term and ignored it if
it was less then N ... then just merge your old index into a new (epty)
index using this FilteredIndexReader...

	?
