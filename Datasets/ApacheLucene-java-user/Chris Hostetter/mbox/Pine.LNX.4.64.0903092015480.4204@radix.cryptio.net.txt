: yes, it works... but the NORM_TABLE(normalization) in Similarity cannot 
: be eliminated...

the norm table is used to encode the values generated based on your 
lengthNorm function and document/field boosts -- so make lengthNorm return 
"1", and don't uses index time boosts (or better yet: use the "omitNorms" 
option on your fields)
