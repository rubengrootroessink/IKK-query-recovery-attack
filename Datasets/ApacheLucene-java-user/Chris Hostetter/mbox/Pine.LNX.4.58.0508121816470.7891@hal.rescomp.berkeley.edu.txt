SUBJECT: Re: Query that doesn't match a term more than once
DATE: 13 Aug 2005


: Programatically you can use PhrasePrefixQuery - see Lucene's test
: case code for examples of how it's used, but it is a bit of work to
: set up.

That's only needed if you assume that the field contains tokenized text.
if the whole name is indexed as a single Term, then a regular prefix query
should work -- in fact, telling QueryParser to use an Analyzer that
doesn't do any tokenizing should work too.

: In short, not easily, but it is possible with PhrasePrefixQuery
: programatically.  QueryParser does not support this at all currently.
