: I *think* (and I'm remembering things folks wrote, haven't done this myself)
: that the empty string for the Term matches all terms. If not, you might have

not quite ... a token containing the empty string matches documents that
contain that token -- not common for simple indexes, but it has it's uses.

what you want to do is create a bitset for every document that has a value
in that field, and then invert the BitSet.
