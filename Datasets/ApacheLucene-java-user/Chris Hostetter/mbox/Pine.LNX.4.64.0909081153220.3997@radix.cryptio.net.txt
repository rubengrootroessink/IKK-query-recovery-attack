: I'm coming to the same conclusion - there must be >1 threads accessing this index at
the same time.  Better go figure it out  ...  :-)

careful about your assumptions ... you could get this same type of 
exception even with only one thread, the stream that's being closed isn't 
internal to Lucene, it's the InputStreamReader you supplied as the value 
of some Field.  it's possibly you just have a simple bug where you are 
closing hte reader before you pass it to Lucene, or maybe you are 
mistakenly adding the saame field twice (or in two different documents)
