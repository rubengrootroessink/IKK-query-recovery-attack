:    I was recently looking thru the lucene in action book and came across the
: scoring formula. I was wondering if the formula has changed since the book
: was written?

no, but the book has some mistakes, and the scoring formula is one of
them...

:   Also was wondering if someone can breifly explain what the IDF(t) term in
: the formula means? In the book it says that it's the inverse document
: frequency of the term but doesn't explain beyond that?

1) google is your friend.
2) it's pretty much exactly what it sounds like ... it's the inverse of
the document frequency for that term .. the more frequent the term is,
the more documents it appears in, the lower the value is.
