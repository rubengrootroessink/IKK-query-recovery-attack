SUBJECT: Re: Analyzer.getPositionIncrementGap question
DATE: 26 Oct 2006


:   getPositionIncrementGap, but there appears to no way to set non
: constant gap. say, gap between "value1" and "value2" is 10, but gap
: between "value2" and "value3" is 100.

by default, non of hte analyzers do anything special in
getPositionIncrementGap -- that's up to you to control in any subclass or
wrapper Analyzer you might write -- at which point the question becomes
what is the general behavior you want? .. you describe a sinle instance
case: gap of 10 after "value1" gap of 100 afer "value2" ... are "value1"
and "value2" magic constants?  what should the gap be if other values are
specified?

your Analyzer can keep track of whatever state it wants to decide what it
will return the next time getPositionIncrimentGap is called ... which in
your case might simply be remembering the last value it was asked to
tokenize and loking that value up in a Map to get the gap to be returned.

: I am reposting this question. Could somebody help?

...reposting after 12.5 hours is a little quick ... you have to give
people a chance to do things other then read Lucene email, like Eat and
Sleep.
