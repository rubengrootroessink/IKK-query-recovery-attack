: I'd want both clauses, so I'd have to write a Parser to make sure
: queries would get split up into the two different indices, right?
: Something to take "contents:germany title:medicine", send the
: "contents:germany" query to the IndexSearcher operating over the
: existing index, and the "title:medicine" query to the IndexSearcher
: operating over my new index. The Searchers get their results, I
: return the fileIDs in both.
:
: Or is that just nuts?

In my opinion: yes.  But I'm not the one that has to do the work, and i'm
not in a position to judge how much work is involved compared to the
amount of work needed to rebuild your index.
