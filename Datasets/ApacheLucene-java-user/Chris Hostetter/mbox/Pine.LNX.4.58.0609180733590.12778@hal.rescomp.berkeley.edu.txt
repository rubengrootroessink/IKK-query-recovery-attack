1) you should fix your clock.

2) ...

:     I've been looking through the documentation in the official
: web-site, and the Javadoc belongs to v2.1, that I could not find
: anywhere, anyone has a clue about where to find it or when will it be
: officially released?

the javadocs on the website are for the current HEAD of in the source
control repository ... they represent the hypothetical 2.1 release if it
were released *now*.  There is no current plan for if/when 2.1 will be
released.
