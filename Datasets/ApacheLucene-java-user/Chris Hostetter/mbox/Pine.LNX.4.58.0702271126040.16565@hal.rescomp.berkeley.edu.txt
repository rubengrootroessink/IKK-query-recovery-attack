ditto ... if you aren't going to be using Lucene for anything more then
lookups by username finding yourself an extremely fast database that
doens't have the overhead of building a completley normalized index may be
a better way to go.

likewise if all you *really* need is counts per user withint buckets of
time, a 10 line app thta tails your log file and incriments in memory
counters flushing them to disk every few minutes would probably work to...
