: How does sorting and ranking working together in
: Lucene?  Are they mutually exclusive?  If the search
: result is ranked first, then sorting may not have much
: value. If sorting is done first, then ranking doesnt
: have any meaning?

Scoring (which is what i think you mean by ranking) is orthogonal to
sorting.  When you do a search, and get back a list of matches, you can
get the score of any matching doc regardless of wether or not you Sort by
a specific field -- or if you sort by a special SortComparator (which
can use any arbitrary logic it wants to detemine an ordering of the
results).
