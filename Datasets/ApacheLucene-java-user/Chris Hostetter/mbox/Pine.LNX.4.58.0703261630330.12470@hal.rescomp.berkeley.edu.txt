SUBJECT: Re: Virtually merge two indexes?
DATE: 26 Mar 2007


: 1. When I use setBoost for document in index C, will that be counted in?

i don't know what "counted in" means .. are you asking how documents
boosts affect ParallelReader? ... because i have no idea.

: 2. Does index A allow any deletion at all? If index A has some
: deletions, I suppose index C should also delete those after
: optimizing? But which deletion takes precedence?

you can do whatever you want in whatever order you want, as long as you
can garuntee the ParallelReader conditions -- if it were me, i would play
it safe and only add/delete from A  just before optimizing and rebuilding
C (during that widow, nothing about your queries will be very safe, so
you'll probably be doing it offline anyway)

: 3. If index A use compound file format, I suppose index C should also
: be the same. When optimizing during creating the compound file, the
: ordering will not be changed?

nothing ever hcanges the relative order of documents, but adding or
optimizing docs can change the specific docIds by collapsing to fill in
the gaps from deletion during a segment merge ... i have no idea about
using Compound files.

: I am also interested to know any real production usage of ParallelReader.

i can't help you there ... my knowledge on this topic is purely
theoretically based on based list discussions.
