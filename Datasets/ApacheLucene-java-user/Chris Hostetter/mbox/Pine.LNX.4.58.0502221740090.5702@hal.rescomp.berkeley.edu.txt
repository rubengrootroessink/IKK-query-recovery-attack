Why have seperate fields?

Why not index the title into the "title" field twice, once with each term
lowercased and once with the case left alone. (Using an analyzer that
tokenizes "The Quick BrOwN fox" as "[the] [quick] [brown] [fox] [The]
[Quick] [BrOwN] [fox]")

Then at search time, depending on the value of of the checkbox, construct
your QueryParser using the appropriate Analyzer.

The only problem i can think of would be inflated scores for terms that
are naturally lowercased, because they would wind up getting added to the
index twice, but based on what i've seen of hte data you are working
with, i imageing that if you used UPPERCASE instead of lowercase you
could drasticly reduce the likelyhood of any problems with that.
