I've added a FAQ that may help you with this, "How do i get code written
for Lucene 1.4.x to work with Lucene 2.x?"

: Does anyone have sample code on how to build a dictionary?
:
: I found this article online and but it uses version 1.4.3 and it doesn't seem to work on
2.0.0:  http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/08/09/didyoumean.html?page=1
:
: Here's the code I have:
:
: indexReader = IndexReader.open(originalIndexDirectory);
: Dictionary dictionary = new LuceneDictionary(indexReader, "experience_desired");
: SpellChecker spellChckr = new SpellChecker(spellIndexDirectory);
: spellChckr.indexDictionary(dictionary);
: I'm getting a null pointer exception when I call indexDirectory().
: Here's how I index the field "experience_desired":
: doc.add(new Field("experience_desired", value, Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
: Is there another way I should do it so there is a way to build a dictionary on that field?
:
: Thanks
