: > imeediately? ... in the totally generic case, this isn't a safe

: This was implemented as an easy way to control the maximum search time

The only thing i can think of that would truely timeout *any* query is a
seperate Timer for each search.

: thing that sticks like a sore thumb is the use of exceptions to break
: the loop - IMHO the collect() method should simply return a boolean or
: int code that tells other parts of Lucene to stop collecting hits.

HitCollector is an abstract class, it would be pretty easy to add another
version of collect that doesn't return void and add Impl's for each that
call the other one by default (the way Analyzer.tokenStream use to work)
