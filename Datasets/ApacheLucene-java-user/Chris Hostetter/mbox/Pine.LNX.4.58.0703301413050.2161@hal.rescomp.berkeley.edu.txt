what i'm trying ot make sure you understand is that picking 0.3 as an
arbitrary number might make sense for soem queries, but not others ... the
scores are inherently not comparable between queries, if you can't
compare score(queryA) with score(queryB) then you also can't fairly
comparse score(queryA) with a constant N which you also compare to the
score(queryB).

with so many similar threads, i get confused as to what's already been
said sometimes, it doesn't look like i ever pointed out the FAQ on this
(assuming you haven't already seen it)...
