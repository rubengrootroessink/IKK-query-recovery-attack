: I want to be able to get the number of tokens in a certain field.
: 
: Is this possible? Where is this sort of information stored?

generally this info isn't actually recorded in the index -- it's used to 
compute a fieldNorm, and that is recorded.

You might be able to get this by turning on TermVectors, but that's not a 
feature i've played with so i'm not sure off hte top of my head how you 
would do it.
