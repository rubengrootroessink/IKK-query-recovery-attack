DATE: 26 May 2006


There is nothing special in lucene to help you do this ... it would have
to be done in your own code.

: If I have user info in 2 different sources (index)and want to search for
: fields on both, but the search should
: join the resulting records using a common field (user id for example). Is
: this possible?
