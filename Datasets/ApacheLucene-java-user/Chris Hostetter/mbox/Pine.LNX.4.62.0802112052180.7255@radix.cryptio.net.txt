SUBJECT: Re: update field boost
DATE: 12 Feb 2008


: It's clear that there is no easy way to do "in-place" doc update in the lucene
: index, but I think it should be theoretically possible to update the field and
: doc boostings in place, that is, without deleting and re-adding the doc and
: it's fields. Does anyone know how?

boosts are folded into the norm, which is mutable using 
IndexReader.setNorm
