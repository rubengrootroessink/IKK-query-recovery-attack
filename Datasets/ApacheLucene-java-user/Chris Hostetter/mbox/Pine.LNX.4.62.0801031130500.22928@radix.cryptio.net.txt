: Is there a mavenized Eclipse bundle that exposes the Lucene API?

there might be ... it depends on what a "mavenized Eclipse bundle" is.

(googling for those keywords turns up this exact question, and a bunch of 
threads/docs on building ecplise plugins with maven ... so i'm really not 
sure what we are talking about)
