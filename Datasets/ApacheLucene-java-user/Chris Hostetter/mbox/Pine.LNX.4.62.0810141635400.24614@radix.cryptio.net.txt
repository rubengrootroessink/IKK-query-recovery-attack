: Actually looking at this a little deeper maybe Lucene could/should 
: automatically be doing this "short" optimisation here?

At the moment it can't, the array's in StringIndex are public.

The other thing that would be a bit tricky is the initialization ... i 
can't think of any easy way to know in advance how many terms there are 
before iterating over all the terms, so you'd have to assume one and then 
if you're wrong copy to the other -- not sure how expensive thta copy 
would be.

It's a little more feasible for custom clients to do when they know in 
advance how many terms they've got -- but some of the existing 
FieldCacheImpl code could probably be refactoredto make it easier on 
people.
