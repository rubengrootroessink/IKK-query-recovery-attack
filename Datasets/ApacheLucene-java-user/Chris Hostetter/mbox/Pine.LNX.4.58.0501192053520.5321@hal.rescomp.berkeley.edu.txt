: Why IndexReader.lastModified(index) is depricated?

Did you read the javadocs?

   Synchronization of IndexReader and IndexWriter instances is no longer
   done via time stamps of the segments file since the time resolution
   depends on the hardware platform. Instead, a version number is
   maintained within the segments file, which is incremented everytime
   when the index is changed.

: It's always a good idea to know when the index changed last time, for

That's a good point, and you can still get that information using the same
underlying method IndexReader.lastModified did/does...

     directory.fileModified("segments");

...it's just no longer crucial that IndexReader have that information.
