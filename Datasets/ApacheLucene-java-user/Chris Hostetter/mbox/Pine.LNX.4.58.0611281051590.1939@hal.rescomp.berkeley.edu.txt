DATE: 28 Nov 2006


1) I don't really know anything about Syns2Index - but the errors you
cited don't seem to have anything to do with Lucene ...  your compiler
appears to be complaining about assert statements within the core java
system classes ... which is a little strainge.  you said you are psat the
HellowWorld stage ... have you tried compiling a HellowWorld app in this
current environment (ie: delete the lucene code youv'e got and put a
simple HelloWorld class in the same directory and compile it hte same
way) ???

2) the first link i saw when searching for Syns2Index to see what
it was is...
www.netlikon.de/docs/lucene-2.0.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/wordnet/Syns2Index.html

...which is how i discovered that Syns2Index is part of the wordnet
contrib and ships with Lucene ... so you shouldn't need to compile
anything ... just use the wordnet jar that comes with your lucene-2.0
distribution.

:
: I am trying to use Syns2Index utility to convert the WordNet into a Lucene index.  First
I downloaded the latest JDK and Lucene 2.0, but soon realized that both were too new for compiling
Syns2Index.java.  Next, got down to j2sdk1.4.2_13 and Lucene 1.4.3.  by deciphering error
messages.  (I am running XP SP2)
:
: I have copied the java\org\apache\lucene directory in the same folder as the Syns2Index.java
file.  I have a feeling that my classpath is most likely set right (or at least close), but
I get a huge amount of identical compile errors.
