1) you should take a look at the Luke tool to help make sense of exactly 
what is getting indexed and how your query is getting parsed -- or just 
write a simple java program to look at the tokens produced by your 
analyzer.

2) the FrenchAnalyzer doesn't by default do any accent normalization (so 
i'm not sure why your search for lumiere is even matching lumiére ... but 
you may want to make your own Analyzer wrapping the FrenchAnalyzer that 
also uses the ISOLatin1AccentFilter to deal with this.
