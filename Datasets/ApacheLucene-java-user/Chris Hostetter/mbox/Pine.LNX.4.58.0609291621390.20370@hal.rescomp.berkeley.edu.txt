Whatever you want it to be ... my point is merely that the existing Lucene
code for sorted searching involves a "Query" -- if you know you want to
start with a Filter, then you might be able to come up with a faster
mechanism for getting sorted results using the BitSet directly, collecting
however many of the sorted resutls you care about in a data structure of
your choosing.

but this is all just speculation.
