: in my search criteria i am using a criteria "apache tomcat" but it is
: giving me a parse exception.

if i understand you correctly, you're saying that when searchQuery is...

	"apache tomcat"

you get a parse error? .. is that by any chance because you are allways
attaching a "*" to the end of searchQuery in the makeWildcardQuery method,
so what you wind up passing to the QueryParser is...

	"apache tomcat"*

... ? ... that's not a legal query string.



:
: my searcher has this piece of code:
:
: searchQuery=makeWildcardQuery(searchQuery);
: masterQuery.add(MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(searchQuery,fields,analyzer),REQUIRED,PROHIBITED);
:
:
:
:
: private String makeWildcardQuery(String query)
:     {
:         String result = query.trim();
:
:         if (0 != result.length())
:         {
:             if (!result.endsWith("*"))
:             {
:                 result = result + "*";
:             }
:         }
:
:         return result;
:     }
