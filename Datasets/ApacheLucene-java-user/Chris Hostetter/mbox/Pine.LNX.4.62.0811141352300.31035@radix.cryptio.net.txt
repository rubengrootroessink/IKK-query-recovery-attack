: The application which uses the index expects this in same field. So, can't use
: two fields.

be carefully about termiology here ... there are 
"org.apache.lucene.document.Field" objects, and then there are "fields" or 
"field names"

you can index a Document containing multiple "Field" objects that 
have the same name but differnet contents (one indexed, and one stored), 
and then as far as your client is concerned there is only one "Field" when 
it does the search.
