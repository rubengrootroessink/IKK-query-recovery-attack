: In tests for our implementation (25 concurrent connections generating
: search/sort requests), we've seen performance in terms of requests/second
: drop by a factor of 10, compared to similar tests executing only search

In case it's not clear from Yonik's response: reuse the same
IndexReader/IndexSearcher as much as possible.  The biggest factor in
sorting tends to be initializing the FieldCache -- which is keyed off of
the IndexReader.  If you aren't reusing the same IndexReader for all of
your concurrent connections your requests/second will be seriously
sub-optimal.
