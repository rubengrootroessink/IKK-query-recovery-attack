:   i am recieving the following stack trace:
:
:   JVMDUMP013I Processed Dump Event "uncaught", detail "java/lang/OutOfMemoryError".
: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
:         at org.apache.lucene.index.TermInfosReader.readIndex(TermInfosReader.java:82)

is it possible that parts of your application are eating up all of the
heap in your JVM before this exception is encountered?  Possibly by
opening a the index many times without closing it?

More specifically, if you write a 4 line app that does nothing by open
your index and then close it again, do you get an OOM? ...

	public class Main {
	  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
	    Searcher s = new IndexSearcher("/your/index/path");
	    s.close();
	  }
	}
