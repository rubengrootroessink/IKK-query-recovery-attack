DATE: 5 Oct 2006


: The query you want is
: name:[A TO C] name:[G TO K]
: (each clause being SHOULD, or put another way, an implicit "OR" in between.
:
: The problem may be how you analyze the name field... is it tokenized at all?
: If so, you might be matching on first, last, and middle names, and the
: combination of everything may match most of your documents.

also keep in mind that "C" is lexigraphicaly less then "Chris" so Chris
doesn't fall in the range [A TO C].
