: I'm storing a field in an index with that option
: (Field.Index.UN_TOKENZIED).

the key to understanding your problem, is to realize that...

	UN_TOKENIZED == Not Analyzed


...personally, i think name of the constant is missleading.


: The String that is being stored is: NORTH SAFETY PRODUCT (all uppercase)

: When I try a wildcard query against that field, it only produces results
: if the query term is capitalized.

that's because the term you've put in the index in capitalized.
