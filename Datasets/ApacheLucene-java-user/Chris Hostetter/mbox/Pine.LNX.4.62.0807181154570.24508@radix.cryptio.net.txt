SUBJECT: Re: MultiSearcher and TopFieldDocCollector
DATE: 18 Jul 2008


: The idea was to override TopFieldDocCollector to do the sorting etc. and only
: load the full document for those we need to display. But, I haven't found an
: easy way to use TopFieldDocCollector (FieldSortedHitQueue etc.) with
: MultiSearcher.

I don't understand this statement ... i mean, i haven't ever used 
MultiSearcher, but it has a search(Weight,Filter,HitCollector) ... what 
exactly is the problem you are facing?
