I haven't profiled either of thse suggestions but:

1) have you tried constructing a BooleanQuery of all 10-20 terms? Is the
   total time to execute the search, and access each Hit slower then your
   termDocs approach?

2) have you tried sorting your terms first, then opening a TermDocs on the
   first one, and seeking to each of the remaining terms?  it seems like
   that would be faster then opening a new TermDocs for each Term.

: The problem is that this doesn't work very fast either.  This is not an
: academic debate as I've put the system in a profiler and Lucene is the
: top bottleneck (by far).

The tricky thing about profiling code: something is allways the bottleneck.
