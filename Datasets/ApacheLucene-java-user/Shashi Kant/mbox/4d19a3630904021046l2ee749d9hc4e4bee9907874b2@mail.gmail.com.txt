SUBJECT: LuSQL download link error?
DATE: 2 Apr 2009

Hi all, I have been trying to get the latest version of LuSQL from the
NRC.ca website but get 404s on the download links. I have written to the
webmaster, but anyone have the jar handy? Could I download from somewhere
else? or could you email it to me?

thanks,
Shashi
