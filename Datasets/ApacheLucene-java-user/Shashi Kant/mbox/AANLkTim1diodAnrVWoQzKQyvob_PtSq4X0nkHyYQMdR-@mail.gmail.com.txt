SUBJECT: Span Query/Slop distance
DATE: 26 Aug 2010

Hello, I am familiar with the SpanQuery construct and set an upper Slop limit.

1. But when I get the hit results, is there any way I can access the
actual slop and the span text itself in that particular hit.
2. Also it is possible to have multiple matches within the same
document. So how do I access the span text and the corresponding slop
for the multiple matches with the same doc?


Thanks,
Shashi
