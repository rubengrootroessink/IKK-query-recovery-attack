Thanks Omar, I have looked at Prefuse. 
What has been your experience with it given it is still in beta? any "gotchas" we should look
out for?

shashi

Hi all,

Apologies for being slightly off-topic, we are looking at novel visualization approaches for
rendering results from Lucene queries. I was wondering if you have any recommendations for
visualization toolkits (Java) for displaying heat-maps, dendrograms, cluster maps etc. (preferably
free/OSS)

Thanks in advance!
Shashi
