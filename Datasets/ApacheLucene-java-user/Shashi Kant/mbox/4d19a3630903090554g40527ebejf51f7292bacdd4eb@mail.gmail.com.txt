SUBJECT: Re: Using Lucene for user query parsing
DATE: 9 Mar 2009

The BoW approach is simple and highly effective IMO. If you want to get a
bit fancy, you could also use a MultiField query in the combined index.

Another brute-force approach would be to hit all 3 indexes and see which
ones come back with the highest score(s).
