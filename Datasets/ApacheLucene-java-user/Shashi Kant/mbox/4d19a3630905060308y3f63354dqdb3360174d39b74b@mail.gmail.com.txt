SUBJECT: Lucene index on iPhone
DATE: 6 May 2009

Hi all,

I am working on an iPhone application where the Lucene index needs to
reside on-device (for multiple reasons). Has anyone figured out a way
to do that?
As you might know the iPhone contains SQLite - could an index be
embedded inside SQLite? or could it be resident separately as a file?

Thanks,
Shashi
