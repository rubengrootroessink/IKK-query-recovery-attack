SUBJECT: Re: Lucene query with long strings
DATE: 24 Mar 2010

Add the common terms such as "University", "School", "Medicine",
"Institute" etc. to stopwords list, so you are left with Stanford,
"Palo Alto" etc.

Then use Ahmet's suggestion of using a booleanquery
.setMinimumNumberShouldMatch() to (say) 75% of the query string
length.

Finally, if you wish to be very precise, you can loop through the hits
collector and use a string comparison algorithm like Jaro-Winkler,
Levenstein etc. for a second-level filter.

I cannot use Phrase query because of variability in the way affiliation is constructed)
