I suspect what you are looking for is "Latent Semantics" - it can
algorithmically infer that "iPod~iPhone" or "Apple~Steve Jobs". Google for
"Latent Semantic Indexing" or "Latent Semantic Analysis" - you can apply
some of those approaches using the TermVectors in Lucene index.
Ontologies such as WordNet are very generic, hence if you have a domain
specific corpus, you would need to generate some kind of Latent Semantic
Index to extract the relations therein.
