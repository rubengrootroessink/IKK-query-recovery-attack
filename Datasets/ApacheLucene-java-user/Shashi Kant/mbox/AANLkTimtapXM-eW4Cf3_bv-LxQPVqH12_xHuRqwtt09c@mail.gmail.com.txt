SUBJECT: Is Lucene a "document oriented database"?
DATE: 31 May 2010

There seems to be considerable buzz on the internets about document
oriented dbs such as MongoDB, CouchDB etc. I am at a loss as to what
are the principal differences between Lucene and the "DODBs". I could
very use Lucene as any of the above (schema-free, Document oriented)
and perform similar queries, *with* the added benefit of text search.

I fail to see what benefits such DoDBs bring, or is it old wine in new bottles?

Thanks
Shashi
