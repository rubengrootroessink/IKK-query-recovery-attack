SUBJECT: Does highlighter highlight phrases only?
DATE: 29 Jun 2005

Hi,

I'm working with the highlighter and phrase queries and I'm seeing it 
highlight not
the phrase, but also the individual terms. So if the phrase query
is "heavy doses", we get that string highlighted, but also individual
occurrences of "heavy" and "doses".

I can't tell if that's because I'm doing something wrong or if that's
just the way it works.

Anybody know the answer to this one?

Thanks,

Fred Toth
