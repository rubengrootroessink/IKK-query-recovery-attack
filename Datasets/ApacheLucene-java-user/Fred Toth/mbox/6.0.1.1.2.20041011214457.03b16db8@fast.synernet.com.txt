SUBJECT: Re: single quote unicode character
DATE: 12 Oct 2004

Hi Chris,

Getting unicode to pass cleanly through to the browser can
be tricky. A couple of questions:

What do you see instead of the incorrect character?

What happens when you tell your browser to display UTF-8?
(In IE, it's in View->Encoding->Unicode) Does your character
display properly?

Are your pages tagged with charset=utf-8? If not, the browser
will default to non-unicode.

Are you using any view technology? Velocity, for example, has
configuration settings for UTF-8 that control both how its templates
are read from disk and how it encodes final output.

Hope this helps. If not, let us know more about how you're getting
from the index to the page.

Thanks,

Fred
