Hi Sergiu,

My searches take place in tomcat, in a struts action, in a single method
Abbreviated code:

         IndexReader reader = null;
         IndexSearcher searcher = null;
         reader = IndexReader.open(indexName);
           searcher = new IndexSearcher(reader);
         // code to do a search and extract hits, works fine.
         searcher.close();
           reader.close();

I have a command-line indexer that is a minor modification of the
IndexHTML.java that comes with Lucene. It does this:

         writer = new IndexWriter(index, new StandardAnalyzer(), create);
         // add docs

(with the create flag set true). It is here that I get a failure, "can't 
delete _b9.cfs"
or similar. This happens when tomcat is completely idle (we're still 
testing and
not live), so all readers and searchers should be closed, as least as far as
java is concerned. But windows will not allow the indexer to delete the old 
index.

I restarted tomcat and the problem cleared. It's as if the JVM on windows 
doesn't
get the file closes quite right.

I've seen numerous references on this list to similar behavior, but it's 
not clear
what the fix might be.

Many thanks,

Fred
