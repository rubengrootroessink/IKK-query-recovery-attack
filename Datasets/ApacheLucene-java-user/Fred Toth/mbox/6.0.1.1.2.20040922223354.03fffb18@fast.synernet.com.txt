SUBJECT: demo HTML parser question
DATE: 23 Sep 2004

Hi,

I've been working with the HTML parser demo that comes with
Lucene and I'm trying to understand why it's multi-threaded,
and, more importantly, how to exit gracefully on errors.

I've discovered if I throw an exception in the front-end static
code (main(), etc.), the JVM hangs instead of exiting. Presumably
this is because there are threads hanging around doing something.
But I'm not sure what!

Any pointers? I just want to exit gracefully on an error such as
a required meta tag is missing or similar.

Thanks,

Fred
