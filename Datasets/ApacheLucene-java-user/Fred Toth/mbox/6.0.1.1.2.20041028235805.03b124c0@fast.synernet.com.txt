SUBJECT: Re: Faster highlighting with TermPositionVectors
DATE: 29 Oct 2004

Hi,

We are very interested in highlighting, but haven't gotten around
to reviewing the state of the highlighting mechanisms.

Could someone possibly give me the "big picture" on highlighting?
What code is available?
How does it work?
What are the current issues?

Many thanks,

Fred
