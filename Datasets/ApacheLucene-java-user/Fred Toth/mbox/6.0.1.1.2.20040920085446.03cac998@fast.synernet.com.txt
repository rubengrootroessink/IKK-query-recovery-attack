SUBJECT: Re: indexes won't close on windows
DATE: 20 Sep 2004

Hi Otis,

I understand about reusing readers and searchers, but I was
working on the "do the simplest thing that can possibly work" theory
for starters, in part because I wanted to be sure that I could recreate
the index safely as needed.

I should emphasize that I developed for weeks on linux without ever
seeing this problem, but in less than 24 hours after installing on the
customer's windows box, I hit the error.

So is a close() not really a close()? Is Lucene actually hanging on to
open files? Or is this a JVM on windows bug? (I'm using the latest 1.4.2
from Sun.)

As I mentioned, this has turned up off and on in the mail archives. Is
there no well-understood fix or work-around? I'll get a stack trace
set up for the next time it happens.

Thanks,

Fred
