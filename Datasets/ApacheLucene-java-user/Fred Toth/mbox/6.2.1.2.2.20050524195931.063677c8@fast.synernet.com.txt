SUBJECT: Term offset support not in current release?
DATE: 25 May 2005

Hi,

Just checking, but it appears that the support for storing
term offsets is available only in the current svn version, yes?
Is there any reasonable way to patch this stuff into the current
release? I suspect not, since the API for Field appears to have
changed considerably to support this.

Just making sure I'm not missing anything.

Thanks,

Fred Toth
