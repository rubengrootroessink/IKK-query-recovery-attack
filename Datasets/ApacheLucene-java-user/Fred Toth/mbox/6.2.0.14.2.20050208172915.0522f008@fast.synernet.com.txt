SUBJECT: Good example scientific lucene sites?
DATE: 8 Feb 2005

Hi,

I'm going to be demonstrating some of our work with lucene to
a prospective customer this week, and I'm wondering if
any of you have suggestions for other relevant sites that
use lucene.

In particular, I'm interested in scientific or technical sites,
perhaps with use of the highlighter, and perhaps extra work
on relevancy ranking.

I'm happy to poke around on the "powered by lucene" page,
but if anyone can save me some time, I'd appreciate it.

Many thanks,

Fred
