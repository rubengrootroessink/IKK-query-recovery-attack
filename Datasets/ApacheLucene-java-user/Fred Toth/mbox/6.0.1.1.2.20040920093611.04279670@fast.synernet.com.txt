SUBJECT: Re: indexes won't close on windows
DATE: 20 Sep 2004

Hi Sergiu,

Thanks for your suggestions. I will try using just the IndexSearcher(String...)
and see if that makes a difference in the problem. I can confirm that
I am doing a proper close() and that I'm checking for exceptions. Again,
the problem is not with the search function, but with the command-line
indexer. It is not run at startup, but on demand when the index needs
to be recreated.

Thanks,

Fred
