SUBJECT: Using Lucene to apply LSI
DATE: 28 Mar 2007


                    Hi,

I have a research project where I want to implement LSI technique. The scenario is something
as follows.

Search
the news sites for the locally event based news. Cluster the similar
news items together. For example hurricane in New York city.

We want to apply basic LSI as follows

   -Key word extraction
   -Filter using stop list
   -Stemming
   -Option: Synonym detection
   - Frequency Matrix
   - SVD Decomposition

  -Cluster related News items

The input data will be from the web based news sites such as Yahoo, google etc.

How can we use Lucene to achieve this. Please provide me the steps.

Thanks.
