Wait.... there already is a ChainedFilter in the Lucene Sandbox.   
Here's a test case I wrote for it for Lucene in Action (the test case  
is in the sandbox also):

   public void testAND() throws Exception {
     ChainedFilter chain = new ChainedFilter(
       new Filter[] {dateFilter, bobFilter}, ChainedFilter.AND);

     Hits hits = searcher.search(query, chain);
     assertEquals("AND matches just bob", MAX / 2, hits.length());
     assertEquals("bob", hits.doc(0).get("owner"));
   }

(you'll need to see the setUp method to make sense of the asserts,  
though).

ChainedFilter.java?view=markup>

The test cases are here:

contributions/miscellaneous/src/test/org/apache/lucene/misc/ 
ChainedFilterTest.java?view=markup>

It's obviously a bit more complicated than a simple AND, though, but  
does that simple case as well.
