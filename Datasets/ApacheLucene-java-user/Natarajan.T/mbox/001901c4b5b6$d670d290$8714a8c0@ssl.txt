Hi FFI,

 

I am indexing multiple documents like (word,excel,html,ppt,pdf) at the
time of indexing there is no problem.....

 

My search results contents(description) comes with small Boxes(this is
happening only word documents)

 

I think this is happening because of some special characters
like(bullets and symbols....)

 

How can I rectify this problem???

 

Regards,

Natarajan.
