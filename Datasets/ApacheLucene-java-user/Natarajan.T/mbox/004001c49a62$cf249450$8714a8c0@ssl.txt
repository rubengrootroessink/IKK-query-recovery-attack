Thanks for your response.....

For example search keyword is like below...

Language "what is java"

Token 1:  language
Token 2: what is java(like google)

Hi,

Not sure if this is what you need but I created a lastname filter which
in Dutch means potential double last names like:"van der Vaart". In
order to process these I created a finite state machine that queried
these last names. Since I only needed the filter on 'index' time and I
never use it for querieying, this may not be what you are looking for.
It should be simple to index 'what is java' as a single token and to
search for that same token. However, you will need to create a list of
accepted 'tokens'. If this is what you need let me know, I will make the
code available...

cheers,
Aad Nales

What exactly you mean by implement? Are you trying to
extend the current behavior or only trying find out
the usage?
Thanks,
