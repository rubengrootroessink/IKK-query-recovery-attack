You might be looking at implementing something like

public class NonScoringQueryDecorator extends Query {

   private Query decorated;

   public NonScoringQueryDecorator(Query decorated) {
     this.decorated = decorated;
   }

   protected Weight createWeight(Searcher searcher) throws IOException {
     Weight decoratedWeight = this.decorated.createWeight(searcher);
     return new Weight() {
       public Scorer scorer(IndexReader reader) throws IOException {
         return new Scorer(){
           public float score() throws IOException {
             return 1f;
           }
         };
       }
     };
   }


Feel free to post it as an issue in the Jira when it's implemented.
