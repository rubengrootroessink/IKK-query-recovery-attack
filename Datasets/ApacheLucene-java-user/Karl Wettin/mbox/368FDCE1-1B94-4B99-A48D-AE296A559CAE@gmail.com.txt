It is a TokenStream you filter, not the Query. In your case the  
TokenStream is produced by the QueryParser invoking  
analyzer.tokenStream(field, new StringReader(input)). So what you have  
to do is to replace the analyzer with your own implementation.

Try this (dry coded) snippet instead:

StandardAnalyzer objAnalyzer = new StandardAnalyzer() {
   public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
     return new ISOLatin1AccentFilter(super.tokenStream(fieldName,  
reader));
   }
}

Looking at the code you also probably want to reuse your Analyzer,  
IndexSearcher and IndexReader and not create a new instance each time  
you place a query.  You can read more about thar and many other things
