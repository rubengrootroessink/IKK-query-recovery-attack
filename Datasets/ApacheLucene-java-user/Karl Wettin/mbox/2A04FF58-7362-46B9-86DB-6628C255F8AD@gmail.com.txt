SUBJECT: Token payload attribute partitioning
DATE: 21 Jun 2008

How do you handle token payload that represent multiple values? I  
simply don't do it even though there are cases where I would like to  
see it. I also find that my token filters that update payload feels  
sort of quick and dirty, that it use a lot of that static scope I so  
much dread for anything but ad hoc solutions.

I would feel much better if there was some sort of partitioner with  
pluggable CRUD strategies. PayloadMap or something.

But I'm not sure, perhaps the idea with the Payload class (rather than  
just a byte[]) is to extend it and do stuff I did not think of?
