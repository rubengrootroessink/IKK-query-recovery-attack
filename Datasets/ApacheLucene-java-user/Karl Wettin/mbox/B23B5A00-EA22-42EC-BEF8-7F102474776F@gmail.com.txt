You probably need to make a large list of words. I would try to learn  
from the users that do swear, perhaps even trust my users to report  
each other. I would probably also look at storing in what context the  
word is used, perhaps by adding the surrounding words (ngrams,  
shingles, markov chains). Compare "go to hell" and "when hell frezes  
over". The first is rather derogatory while the second doen't have to  
be bad at all.

I'm thinking Hidden Markov Models and Neural Networks.
