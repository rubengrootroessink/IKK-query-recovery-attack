I think the main reason is that the time saved by not deserializing  
data from the store at some point point fades to the time complexity  
of executing a binary searches for document numbers associated to a  
term. I've never seen it act slower than RAMDirectory though.

Perhaps the binary search could be made more efficient by adding more  
indices (maps) but would probably consume a lot more memory.
