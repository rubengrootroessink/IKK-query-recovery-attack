SUBJECT: Re: SpanFirstQuery is not taking wildcard characters (like *) as a logical operator for the preffix
DATE: 28 Nov 2008

There has been several discussions on this list on how to create an  
"auto complete" feature. What solution fits best for you depends on  
your needs and the behavior of your users, i.e. what sort of documents  
it is your index contains and what part of the documents your users  
are searching for.

I think think the most common solution recommended is to use ngrams.  
This is however probably only interesting if you want to "auto  
complete" on small texts such as titles, subject lines, et c.

Personally I prefere training a trie with common user queries (that  
leads to hits users clicks on). This does however require that the  
system have enough user load. See LUCENE-625 for such a trie.
