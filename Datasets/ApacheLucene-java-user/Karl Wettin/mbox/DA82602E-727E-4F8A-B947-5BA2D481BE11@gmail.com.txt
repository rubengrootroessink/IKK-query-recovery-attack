SUBJECT: Re: Whitespace/Standard Analyzer and punctuation
DATE: 30 Sep 2009

You could look in to modifying the standard tokenizer lexer code to  
handle punctuation (there is a patch in the isssue tracker for the old  
javacc grammer to handle punctuation) and there is also the Gate NLP  
project which has a fairly nice sentence splitter you might find  
useful. Add a whole bunch of position increment between your sentences  
and limit your searches to how much distance you allow for a hit.

I hope this helps.
