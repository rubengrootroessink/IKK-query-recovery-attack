I'm not really sure I understand your question.

Are you looking for the IndexWriter.deleteDocument method?
<http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_2_0/api/org/apache/lucene/index/ 
IndexWriter.html#updateDocument(org.apache.lucene.index.Term,% 
20org.apache.lucene.document.Document)>

Are you looking for a delta, what has been changed in the filesystem  
since your last update? If you have no way of checking this, what  
about iterating all files and searching for their filename? Of course  
you will need to index the file name too.

I hope this helps.
