SUBJECT: IndexReader#docFreq(Term)
DATE: 31 Aug 2007

I was running in to some problems that turned out to be a non- 
documented feature. Here is a javadoc suggestion:

-  /** Returns the number of documents containing the term <code>t</ 
code>.
+  /** Returns the number of documents, including deleted, containing  
the term <code>t</code>.
    * @throws IOException if there is a low-level IO error
    */
   public abstract int docFreq(Term t) throws IOException;


I understand why, but wonder wether or not this feature is actually  
used by something, if I need to mimic the behaviour in LUCENE-550 in  
order to ensure compabillity?
