There is no built in feature for your request, I think it needs to be  
handled by post processing of the collected documents. I recently  
implemented that for an application:

(Perhaps it is possible to implement in a better way using a function  
query.)

It collects lots of documents and expose them to the consumer via a  
facade that lazily load documents from the IndexReader as they are  
requested. A Set<MyPrimaryKey> keeps track of if the entity already is  
a member of the results but with a greater score.

This means I must estimate the number of total hits (and how many  
documents to collect in order to collect enough entities as requested  
by the client) with the mean number of documents collected per entity  
in an average query.
