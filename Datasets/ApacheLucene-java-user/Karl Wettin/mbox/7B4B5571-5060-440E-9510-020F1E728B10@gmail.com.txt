I'm just guessing now.

Afaik the files are not removed until open readers are closed. But  
perhaps they are. In that case any open file deleted on most modern FS  
will be deleted but still accessable from the file handler that keeps  
the file open. In the case of an FS that does not handle this an  
exception will be thrown and the old files will then, according to my  
guess, be deleted the next time you open the index and there is no lock.

My question to you is if there is a problem with the current behaviour  
or if you're just curios?
