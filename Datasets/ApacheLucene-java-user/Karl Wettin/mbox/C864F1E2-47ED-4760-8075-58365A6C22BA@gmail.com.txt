No. I recommend you go to the data sources and build your merged index  
from scratch. Otherwise you would have to extract the data from the  
inverted index or get them via the term vectors (if you made them  
available at index time). TermVectorAccessor in trunk/contrib/ 
miscellaneous can help you with that. Last option is if you stored all  
the source data in your documents and you know what analyzer you used  
to tokenize it with.
