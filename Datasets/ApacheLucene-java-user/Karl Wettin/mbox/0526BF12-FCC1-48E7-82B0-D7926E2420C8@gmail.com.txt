If it works it works.

You might want to make sure it is a thread safe operation.

A possible solution that might require more work is to catching  
exceptions and return the results from the working indicies only. You  
would not have to replace the query and the application will keep  
trying to connect to that remote searcher that is temporarily out of  
reach.
