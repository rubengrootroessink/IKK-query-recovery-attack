SUBJECT: SpanNearQuery scoring
DATE: 23 May 2008

Everything (scores, explainations and not hitting breakpoints while  
debugging) seems to point at that SpanNearQuery doesn't use the  
scoring of the inner spans. Is this true? If so, is it intentional? It  
messes with BoostingTermQuery, SpanFuzzyTermQuery, et c.
