Lucene makes no distinction between languages. All data is discrete  
chunks of characters, also known as tokens. Tokens are repsresented  
in fields, and the combination of a token in a specific field is  
known as a term. What tokens your index end up containing depends on  
the analyzer strategy you will be using. An analyzer could be  
language sensitive, it could also be something completely different.

You need to define what your search engine is supposed to do in order  
to get an answer that makes sense.


Lucene in action is a pretty good book, even though it covers 1.4 or  
so. The SVN contains a demo application. There is also the Wiki and  
this forum.
