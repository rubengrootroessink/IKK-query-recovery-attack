Hi Lebiram,

contrib/misc contains a couple of tools that might be of help.

If you want to create an identical index but without norms use  
FieldNormModifier in contrib/miscellaneous.

Not impossible, just time consuming. The easiest way is to reconstruct  
the token stream of each field using the term frequency vector. If you  
haven't stored it there is a class called TermVectorAccessor in  
contrib/miscellaneous that allows you to visit the term vector even  
though it is not store, i.e. it will construct it be enumerating the  
inverted index.

Remember that if you reconstruct a token stream via the term vector no  
payloads will be available. If you use payloads it would be a simple  
thing to patch TermVectorAccessor in order to set the payloads in the  
tokens. Feel free to post such a patch in the Jira, it would be a nice  
addition to that code.
