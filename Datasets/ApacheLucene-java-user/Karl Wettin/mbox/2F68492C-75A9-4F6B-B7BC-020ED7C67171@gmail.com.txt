Related, I've been considering filesystem based filters on SSD. That  
ought to be rather fast, consume no memory and be as simple as a  
RandomAccessFile. I didn't spend to much time on it, gave up when I  
couldn't figure out when it made sense to close the file. Perhaps it  
would be nice with a close method in DocSetIterator.
