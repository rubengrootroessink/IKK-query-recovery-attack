Google don't summarize, they highlight parts that match the query. See 
previous reponses.

If you really want to summarize there are a number of more and less 
scientific ways to figure out what's important and what's not.

Very simple algorithmic solutions usually involve ranking top senstances 
by looking at distribution of terms in sentances, paragraphs and the 
whole document. I implemented something like this a couple of years back 
that worked fairly well.
