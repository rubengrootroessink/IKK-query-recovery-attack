SUBJECT: Re: Cosine Similarity between two documents, using different zone weights
DATE: 15 Jul 2008

I'm not sure what it is you say you want to do. If what you want to do  
is to measure distance between two documents then the easiet way is to  
extract the feature vectors (document TermFreqVector) from those two  
documents and measure the distance using something like the Tanimoto  
coefficient.

You want to do this for all the pairs in the index? Consider Hadoop.

You might get more and better help by asking in Mahout: http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/
