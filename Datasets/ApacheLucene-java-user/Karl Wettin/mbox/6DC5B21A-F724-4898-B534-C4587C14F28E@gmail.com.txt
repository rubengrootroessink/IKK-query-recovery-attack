SUBJECT: Re: InstantiatedIndex Memory required
DATE: 13 May 2009

Hi Ravichandra,

this is a question better fitted the java-users maillinglist. On this  
list we talk about the development of the Lucene API rather than how  
to use it.

To answer your question, there is no simple formula that says how much  
RAM an InstantiatedIndex will consume given the FSDirectory or  
RAMDirectory size. Your index is however probably way too large for  
when InstantiatedIndex is considerably faster than RAMDirecotry. There  
is a diagram in the Javadocs that shows the speed on a Reuters index  
as it grows in size:

http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/store/instantiated/package-summary.html#package_description

As milage varies on term saturation you should still try benchmarking  
and see if there is anything to be gained. Try increasing Xmx to  
whatever you have, you can also take a look at -XX:+AggressiveHeap.
