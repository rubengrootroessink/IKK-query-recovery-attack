I'm sorry, I still have a hard time understanding what you are asking.

Is this the Lucene folder you are speaking of? Do you want to merge  
it with another index? Then take a look at the addIndexes methods in  
IndexWriter.

Or does this folder of yours simply contain files you have created an  
index of? You want to drop files in this folder and then figure out  
what files has been added since the last time you updated the index?  
Can you use the file timestamps? Index the filenames and search for  
them?
