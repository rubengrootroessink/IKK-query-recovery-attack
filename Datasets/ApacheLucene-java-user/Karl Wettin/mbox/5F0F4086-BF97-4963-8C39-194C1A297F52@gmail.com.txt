Did you setAllowLeadingWildcard(true)?

   /**
    * Set to <code>true</code> to allow leading wildcard characters.
    * <p>
    * When set, <code>*</code> or <code>?</code> are allowed as
    * the first character of a PrefixQuery and WildcardQuery.
    * Note that this can produce very slow
    * queries on big indexes.
    * <p>
    * Default: false.
    */
   public void setAllowLeadingWildcard(boolean allowLeadingWildcard) {
