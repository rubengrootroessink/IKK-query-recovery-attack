This is why I recommended you to use a filter created from your  
database for use in queries that require read/unread clauses, rather  
than reindexing your documents. As the read/unread flag is updated you  
just update the filter and don't touch the index more than looking up  
what document number a specific email is  represented by in the index.

Using a filter will also have the side effect of making your queries a  
lot speedier compared to a TermQuery.
