You want updates that show up in the reader/searcher without latency?  
I believe LUCENE-1313 is an attempt at that.

What sort of operations do you use the matrix for? How large can it  
grow? Can you give an example of what the matrix might contain?

What was the reason to solve your problem using Lucene? Is there some  
specific feature that made something easier or faster than the  
solutions you discarded?
