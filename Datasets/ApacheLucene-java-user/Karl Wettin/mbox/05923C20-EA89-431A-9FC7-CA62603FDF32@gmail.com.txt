SUBJECT: Re: Applying SpellChecker to a phrase
DATE: 8 Dec 2007

You might want to take a look at the TokenPhraseSuggester in  
LUCENE-626. It is more or less a FuzzySpanQuery, built from a matrix  
of tokens, but places one search for each possible query out of the  
matrix (with some optional parameters to minimze the query) to find a  
score and the hits for each possible match.

In my test cases this can end up beeing thousands or tens of thousands  
of queries to find the most plausable spelling. So rather than  
applying these queries to the main index, one wants to do it against a  
small a priori index.

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-626

TokenPhraseSuggester is quite well documented in code and there is  
some about it in the package level java docs too:
