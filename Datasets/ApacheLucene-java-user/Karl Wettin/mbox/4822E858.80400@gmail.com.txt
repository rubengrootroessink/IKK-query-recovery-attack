Do you use a filter or a term query to restrict the search? Filters 
usually speed things up a lot.

FieldSelector


What is your current problem? Do you want to optimize for reponse speed 
or for hardware resources? I think you want a single index. I also think 
you want to benchmark all sort of strategies so you will see what 
affects what.

We can only help you with basic conceptual things. I don't even know if 
the things I've mentioned exists for Lucene.Net. Look here:
