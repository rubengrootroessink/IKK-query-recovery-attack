It is because

accepts a term text value and you try feed it with an unparsed query  
string. The respose is negative as there is no term in the document  
with the term text value 'foo*'.

One way to solve your problem is to enumerate the terms of the vector  
and see if it.startsWith("foo");


You should probably explain what it is you try to achive by doing this.
