Hi,

you should probably ask your self why your performance is bad before  
looking at solving it by scaling hardware. I.e. what are your  
application needs, how so you solve you needs at index/query time and  
how can you replace this with something better? If you tell us a bit  
more about your corpora and your need we might be able to help you.

But in response to your query, RAMDirectory loads index to memory and  
is thus usually faster than FSDirectory. But a small (or the often  
requested parts of a large) FSDirectory will however be handled by the  
OS level file chache so you might not win anything by switching. You  
simply have to bechmark your index in RAMDirectory and comare it with  
FSDirectory. Perhaps you want to take a look at the benchmark contrib.
