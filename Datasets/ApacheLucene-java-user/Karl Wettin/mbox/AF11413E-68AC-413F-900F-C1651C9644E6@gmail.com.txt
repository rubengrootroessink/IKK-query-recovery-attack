There are many uses for shingles.

I've used them to find common phrases in text, which is my  
understanding of what you try to achieve. It works rather well, is a  
very simple solution and easy on resources compared to real semantic  
analysis.

You'll be getting a lot of shingles such as "there is" and "we are",  
but using a stop word lists to filter out any shingle contaning one or  
many of the stop words should do the trick (I did that in post  
processing, keeping all shingles in my index). It will probably  
require bit of manual work, depending on your corpora, to get a really  
clean list of common phrases that makes sense. Just create a list and  
inspect it with your eyes an try to find patterns in the phrases you  
want to get rid of. You might also want to look for punctuation in  
your text to avoid creating shingles of text that is in diffrent  
sentences. There is a pretty good sentence extraction tool in Gate you  
can use.
