Close means flush, but also releasing the write lock. What to  
usereally  depends on how your service is implemented. Perhaps you  
create and close a new IndexWriter for each command, perhaps you keep  
a writer open at all time, perhaps you have some background thread  
flushing and closing after inactivity.

I hope this helps.
