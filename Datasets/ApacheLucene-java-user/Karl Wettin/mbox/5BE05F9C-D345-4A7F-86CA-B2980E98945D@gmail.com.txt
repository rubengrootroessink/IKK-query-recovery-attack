SUBJECT: Scoring filters
DATE: 10 Jun 2008

Each of my filters represent single boosting term queries. But when  
using the filter instead o the boosting term query I loose the score  
(not sure this is true) and payload boost (if any), both essential for  
the quality of my results. If I was to add payloads to the bits that  
are set, what is the best or simplest way to get the score back in?  
How about wrapping each filter in a query?

Are there any obvious problems with this strategy that I've missed?
