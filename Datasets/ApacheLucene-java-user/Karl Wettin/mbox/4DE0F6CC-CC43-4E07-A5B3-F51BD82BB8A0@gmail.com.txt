SUBJECT: Re: Help needed bubbling up relevant records with most recent date
DATE: 2 Oct 2009

Use a span near query to add boost for the phrases. If you only want  
to add boost for exact phrases (0 slop) you might want to consider  
using shingles.

In order to add greater score for a date closer in time you can choose  
between a range of solutions depending on your needs. Using a function  
query is probably the easiest way, but using payloads or field boost  
might also work.

I'm not sure about how safe it is but think the most efficient way for  
your requirements (as I understand them) is to add documents ordered  
by date, adding the closest to current date now. This will produce the  
same score for the documents matching the same phrase but will return  
the document with the lowest document number first. Or is it the other  
way around? This will however probably mean that you'll need to  
rebuild your complete index every time you add a new document. If you  
can do that nightly or your corpus is static it shouldn't be a  
problem. I never did this so please correct me if I'm wrong or confirm  
if I'm right.
