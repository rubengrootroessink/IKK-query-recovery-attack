Pass an InstantiatedIndexReader to the constructor of an IndexSearcher.

Yes. An InstantiatedIndexReader is always current. You will probably  
still have to reconstruct your searcher. I never really looked in to  
what happends if you don't.

Recommended use is that you consider an InstantiatedIndex immutable,  
mainly because it is lockless.
