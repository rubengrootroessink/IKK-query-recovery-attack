Documents are not deleted until you optimize the index. Perhaps they  
are deleted at merge time too? Until that point documents deleted are  
marked in a seperate file.

Is there a specific problem behind your question? There might be  
alternative solutions.

Generally I'd suggest getting the source code and follow it to see  
what happends. If you need documentation then there are some links here:
