You need to tell us a bit more about your application: what it does,  
what the index contains, what parts you don't want users to access, et  
c.

Could you distribute an index that only contains the data the users  
are allowed to see? If not, why?

My guess is that it will be hard. Anyone could reconstruct the  
documents from the index files. If you came up with some encryption of  
the index then you would have to distribute the key in the source code  
and that could be extracted using a decompiler, even if you  
obusticated the code. An obfusticated index could also be broken using  
decompiler. And if you allow users to place queries and see the  
results then it's probably possible to reconstruct the raw data that  
way.
