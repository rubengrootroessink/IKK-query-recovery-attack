If you insert the documents in the same order with the same settings  
and both indices are optimized, then the files ought to be  
identitical. I'm however not sure.

The instantiated index contrib module contains a test that assert two  
index readers are identical. You could use this to be really sure, but  
it it a rather long running process for a large index:

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/trunk/contrib/instantiated/src/test/org/apache/lucene/store/instantiated/TestIndicesEquals.java


Perhaps you should explain why you need to do this.
