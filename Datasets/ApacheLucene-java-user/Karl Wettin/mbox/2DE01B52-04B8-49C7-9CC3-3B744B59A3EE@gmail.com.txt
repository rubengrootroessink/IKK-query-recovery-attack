My favorite solution for this is a stand alone trie, and such a  
solution is available in LUCENE-625.

Another way is to create an ngram-index.

It is usually a good idea to create an "a priori" corpus with a  
limited set of data. I prefere common user queries rather than items  
in the index. Especially if your corpus is large and you have a lot  
of server load.

Try LUCENE-550 as a priori index. My guess is that it would  
outperform a RAMDirectory 20x at 25,000 title-sized (40 chars avg)  
documents.
