Is this the specific use case, that you want to handle composite words  
as in javaFieldAndClassNames? There is no native support for that in  
Lucene to my knowledge, but it should not be too hard to implement a  
TokenStream that tokenize such composite words in to single tokens.  
You probably want to keep the original token too though.

Another alternative is creating an ngram index.

Finally you might want to look at the  
org.apache.lucene.analysis.compound package in contrib/analyzers.
