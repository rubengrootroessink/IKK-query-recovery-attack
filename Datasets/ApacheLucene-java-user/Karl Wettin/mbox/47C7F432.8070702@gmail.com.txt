I can't recall where I picked it up, but something like this:

Score terms by count and distribution. A term occuring 20 times in the 
same paragraph is not as important as a term occuring 20 times over 10 
paragraphs. Similar terms affect each others score (I used ngrams and I 
also detected abbreviations). Be sure to remove stop words using some 
term reduction algorithm. Language detection makes sense. Rank sentances 
by length normalized term score. The top n sentances is your summary. If 
enough of these sentances are parts of the same paragraph and the 
paragraph is small enough, that is your summary instead.

I hope this helps.
