GeoLucene and LocalLucene are both branches of Lucene hacked to handle  
geo-positioning problems. You might want to take a look at them if  
that is features you are looking for. I suppose the code in the book  
is mearly an example to show how to implement a custom sort, but I  
didn't read it so I'm just guessing here.
