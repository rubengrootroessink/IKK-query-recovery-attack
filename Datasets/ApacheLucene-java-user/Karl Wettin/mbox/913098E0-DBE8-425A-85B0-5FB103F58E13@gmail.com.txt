The only such limitation in Lucene I'm aware of is Integer.MAX_VALUE  
documents. This might also be true for number of terms.

I'm not sure if I got this right but it sounds like your index is  
mounted over network? Can you tell us some more details about that?  
What speeds do you see if you put the index on local disc?
