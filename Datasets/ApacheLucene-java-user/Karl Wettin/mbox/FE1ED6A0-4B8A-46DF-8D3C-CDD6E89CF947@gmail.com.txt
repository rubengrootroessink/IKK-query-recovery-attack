Easiest way out would be to add the document to a temporary index and  
extract the term frequency vector. I would recommend using MemoryIndex.

You could also tokenize the document and pass the data to a  
TermVectorMapper. You could consider replacing the fields of the  
document with CachedTokenStreams if you got the RAM to spare and  
don't want to waste CPU analyzing the document twice. I welcome  
TermVectorMappingChachedTokenStreamFactory. Even cooler would be to  
pass code down the IndexWriter.addDocument using a command pattern or  
something, allowing one to extend the document at the time of the  
analysis.
