100 hits, does that explicitly mean 100 documents or could it be 4  
documents with 25 payloads each?

It is "not possible" to implement a query that search for payloads.

Are you aware of how facets usually are implemented with Lucene? There  
is a lot about it in the mail archives and Solr does it out of the box.

You probably want a second field indexed with your type  
classifications, and perhaps one field per type containing something  
like size for sort/search/store.
