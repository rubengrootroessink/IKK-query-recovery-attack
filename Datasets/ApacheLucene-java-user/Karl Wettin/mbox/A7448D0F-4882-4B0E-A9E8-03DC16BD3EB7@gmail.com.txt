Hi people,

I have an application in which the users are allowed to make changes  
to the database, changes visible only to that user. I.e. they don't  
modify the original data, they create a clone of the original. When  
the user request the instance I retrieve the modified clone rather  
than the original.

Now I'd like to make the user changes instantly available when  
searching too. What might be a good solution to that problem?

I'm thinking a decorator with deletions on top of the original reader,  
merged with the clone reader using a MultiReader. But this would still  
require a new Searcher per user that added modifications to the  
database. Worth mentioning is that my index is rather small, some 50  
000 documents with ~15 numeric and text fields of various size and  
resolution. A user would typically have made 20 changes, but could in  
a few instances be several hundred or even thousands of changes.

So far I haven't done anything but considering wether it's doable or  
not.
