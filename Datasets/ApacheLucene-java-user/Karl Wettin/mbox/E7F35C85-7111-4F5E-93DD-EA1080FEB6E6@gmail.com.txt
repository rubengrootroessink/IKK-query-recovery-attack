SUBJECT: IndexWriter cache swetspots
DATE: 14 May 2008

I have an index with several million documents that each contains  
between a few hundred terms and up to about a million terms. To me it  
feels like there would be a rather big difference between the swetspot  
setting for the cache size when adding very large and very small  
documents.

What are the other factors I have to consider when benchmarking this?  
Number of threads? Initial index size?


The things is that I don't know what good the cache does in the first  
place nor what it does. Perhaps this is all in vain, but I'm sort of  
hoping it's possible to automatically find and set the cache sweetspot  
by sampling miscellaneous data in realtime.

Does this make sense?
