I'm not sure if I do these things backwards or what, but in this case 
the resolution of the 8 bit float of norms is not enough for me.

So I patched the norms float table in Similarity to handle the boost 
values I assign my documents. Discretized 100f-250f in 60 bags and 
cought up with the default table in 16 more bags.

But to me it seem as this only works if I also turn off length 
normalization for all the other fields in my index, as they will affect 
the value of the norm?

I could store it in the payloads of my tokens too, but I really don't 
want payloads on all of them.

Now I'm thinking it would be nice to store a full float in an optional 
document boost file. Perhaps with variable bytesize. But that would take 
a lot of effort to update all related code.

Is there an easier way out here? Perhaps variable byte size per norms 
and field? Document payloads? I don't know. Help much appreciated.
