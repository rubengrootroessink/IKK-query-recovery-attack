Start by getting the source code if you don't have it. It should not  
be a big deal, but it might take some refactoring or copy-paste of  
methods.

If I recall right, this is what you would do:

Open an index writer. Make sure your words already are not a part of  
the index. I'm not sure if the word is indexed or not, you have to  
check that out. Then for each word, use the document factory methods  
of the spell checker and and add the output to the index writer. Close  
the writer and freshen the searcher.
