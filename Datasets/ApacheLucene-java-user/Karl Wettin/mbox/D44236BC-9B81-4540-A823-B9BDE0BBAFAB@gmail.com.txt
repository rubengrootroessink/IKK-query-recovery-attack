Very few plans in this project, but feel free to search the issue  
tracker for spell checker related patches.

Similar as I suggested that you can create shinles in an alternative  
field from your souce data token streams in order to search for the  
typos, you could instread add the shingles to your Lucene contrib  
spell checker dictionary.

Lets say the text you index is "a b c d". Your standard text analysis  
creates the tokens "a", "b", "c" and "d".  Create shingles: "ab", "bc"  
and "cd" and add these as words in the spellchecker suggesting the  
decomposed versions:  "ab" => "a b", "bc" => "b c" and "cd" => "c d".

Try to limit what shingles you add to the dictionary or you will  
probably end up with a huge dictionary.

Please report back with performace of such implementation if you get  
around to it. It could be a great contribution.
