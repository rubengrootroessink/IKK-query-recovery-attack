You are confusing terms with phrases. Wildcards works on term level  
and you try to use wildcards to indicate position increment in a  
phrase. I think you are looking for a sloppy PhraseQuery or  
SpanNearQuery.

It could be solved in a way similar as you propose it should work, for  
instance by not tokenizing the title and use a RegexQuery. This is  
however a rather expensive solution.
