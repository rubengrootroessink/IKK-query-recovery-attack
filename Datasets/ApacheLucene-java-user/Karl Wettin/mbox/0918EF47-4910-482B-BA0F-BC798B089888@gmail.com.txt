Yes.

Stored fields is meta data bound to a document, for instance the  
primary key of the object the Lucene document represents. Note that I  
call this meta data, it is not the data Lucene looks at when searching.

In order to collect a list of documents matching a query Lucene  
navigates an inverted index of string tokens. Usually each word in a  
string is made in to a token, but there are many other strategies. (A  
token is known as a term when associated with a specific field name.)

You might want to take a look at this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index

There is a third way Lucene stores data, the so called term vector  
view. This is a cache of the terms available in a document, available  
as it is very expensive for an inverted index to extract the terms  
available in a document.
