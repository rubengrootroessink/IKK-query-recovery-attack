Sometimes my documents contains two million terms, sometimes they  
contain a few hundred. It is often so that a few hundred thousand  
documents in a row have aproximatly the same amount of terms. I belive  
that my cache size sweet spot is variable over time and depends on a  
number of factors that could be simulated rather easy: number of  
threads, size of index to merge the cache to, term saturation in cache  
and size of documents about to be added. Are there any other things I  
should look at?
