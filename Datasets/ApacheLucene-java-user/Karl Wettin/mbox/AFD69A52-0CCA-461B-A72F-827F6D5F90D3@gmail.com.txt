AFAIK the score would suffer from splitting up the index as tf/idf  
then only represent a part of the index, i.e. two identical docments  
in two indices would end up with different scores as the index meta  
data is different. I have no clue how large the impact could be nor if  
there are good and bad ways to split an index.

One solution I can think of is to share complete index over all nodes  
but restrict the results from each node to a subset of the index using  
a filter. This should produce the right score but will probably be a  
bit slower than splitting the index.

Perhaps it would be possible to split the index for searching but use  
an alternative source for scoring.
