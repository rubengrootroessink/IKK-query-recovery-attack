Then you simply add a LowercaseFilter to the chain in the Analyzer:

public final class WhitespaceAnalyzer extends Analyzer {
   public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
-    return new WhitespaceTokenizer(reader);
+    TokenStream ts = new WhitespaceTokenizer(reader);
+    ts = new LowercaseFilter(ts);
+    return ts;
   }

That sounds like an XY-problem to me:

What I really was asking about is what problem it is you are trying to  
solve by indexing and searching for these sort of tokens.
