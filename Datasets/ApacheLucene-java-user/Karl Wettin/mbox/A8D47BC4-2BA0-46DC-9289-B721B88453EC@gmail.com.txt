Lucene will probably only be helpful if you know what you are looking  
for, e.g. that you search for a given person, a given street and given  
time intervals.

Is this what you want to do?

If you instead are looking for a way to really extract any person,  
street and time interval that a document is associated with you  
probably want to look for a natural language processing project that  
can do something like semantic part of speech tagging for you.
