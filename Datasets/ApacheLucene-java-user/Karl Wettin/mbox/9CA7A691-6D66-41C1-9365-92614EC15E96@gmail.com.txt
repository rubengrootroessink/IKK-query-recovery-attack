There was some discussion about this here on the forums some year(s?)  
ago. The major problem back then was the lack of floaing points.  
Also, as Lucene moves towards Java 1.5 the possible compabillity with  
J2ME moves further away.

Before asking too much you should tell us some about your project.  
How large is the corpus, what features do you require, et c? I.e. do  
you really need Lucene, is it perhaps sufficient with something  
simple as a trie-pattern?
