A filter is a bitset, one bit per document in the index, used to tell  
Lucene to exclude these documents when processing the query. Generally  
it will only speed up your query if you can reuse the filter as it  
probably was created using the query it replaced.

This is what http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/ 
ImproveSearchingSpeed says about filters:
	
Consider using filters.
It can be much more efficient to restrict results to a part of the  
index using a cached bit set filter rather than using a query clause.  
This is especially true for restrictions that match a great number of  
documents of a large index. Filters are typically used to restrict the  
results to a category but could in many cases be used to replace any  
query clause. One difference between using a Query and a Filter is  
that the Query has an impact on the score while a Filter does not.
