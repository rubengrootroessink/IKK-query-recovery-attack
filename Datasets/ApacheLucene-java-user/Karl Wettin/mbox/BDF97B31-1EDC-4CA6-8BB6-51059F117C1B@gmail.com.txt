Are you looking for the term frequency vector?

<http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_2_0/api/org/apache/lucene/index/ 
IndexReader.html#getTermFreqVector(int,%20java.lang.String)>

If you are using 2.3 the TermVectorMapper might save you a couple of  
clock ticks sorting.


Or is this something you want to do prior to adding the document to  
the index?
