I belive that the offsets are just meta data stored with the term 
vectors, used by the highlighter et c. Phrase and span queries use term 
position in the stream (positionIncrement) for sloppy matching and scoring.

So if you don't store the term vectors with offsets for some reason you 
really don't have to bother about them.
