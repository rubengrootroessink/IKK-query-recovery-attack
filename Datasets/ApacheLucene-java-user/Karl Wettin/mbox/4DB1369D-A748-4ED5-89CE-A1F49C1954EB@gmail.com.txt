No extra token, just payloads. I think. Really didn't think that much  
about it yet.

Something like that. Maybe it could be nice if it allowed for terms in  
diffrent places of the index to be part of the same synonym dimension  
for some extra boost the more the query matches tokens in the same  
dimension. But I'm not completely sure about that either.


This brings me to another thing: isn't there a layer of code missing  
that partition and read payload data? I already use payloads for  
position boosts and would have to hack a bit extra to combine that.
