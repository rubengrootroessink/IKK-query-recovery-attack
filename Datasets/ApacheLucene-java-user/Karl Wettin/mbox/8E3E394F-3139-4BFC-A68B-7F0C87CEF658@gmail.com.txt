It would probably be very expensive to analyze each query token and  
decompose it using some word list or index.

If "apple computer" is a phrase that is common in your query, then you  
can create a new field with chained tokens: "think diffrent apple  
computer" -> "thinkdiffrent diffrentapple applecomputer". This would  
at least allow you to search for such typos. You might want to set  
some threadholds like min/max token size and such in your TokenFilter.
