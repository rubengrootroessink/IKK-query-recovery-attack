SUBJECT: multi word synonyms
DATE: 17 May 2008

As far as I know Lucene only handle single word synonyms at index  
time. My life would be much simpler if it was possible to add synonyms  
that spanned over multiple tokens, such as "lucene in action"="lia". I  
have a couple of workarounds that are OK but it really isn't the same  
thing when it comes down to the scoring.

The thing that does the best job at scoring was to assemble several  
permutations of the same document. But it doesn't feel good. I have  
cases where that means several hundred documents, and I have to do  
post processing to filter out the "duplicate" hits. It can turn out to  
be rather expensive. And I'm sure it mess with the scoring in several  
ways I did not notice yet.

I've also considering creating some multi dimensional term position  
space, but I'd say that could take a lot of time to implement.

Are there any good solutions to this?
