Not sure I understand your question, but I'll give it a go.

As far as I know, storing data in a document will not affect search  
speed. However, loading large amounts of data to a Document will of  
course consume resources. Therefor it is possible to pass a  
FieldSelector to the IndexReader when you retrieve a Document,  
allowing you to define what fields to ignore, load, lazy load, et c.

I hope this helps.
