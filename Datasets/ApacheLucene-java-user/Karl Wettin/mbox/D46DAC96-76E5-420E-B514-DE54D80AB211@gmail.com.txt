DATE: 4 Jul 2008

Please show us a couple of examples from the "various type of search"  
you want to be able to handle. The information you supply says nothing  
about your use cases.

In what way do you want to use phrase queries on email addresses? Do  
you want to tokenize parts of a single email address? Or do you want  
to place phrase queries on fields that contains multiple indexed  
single token email addresses? Perhaps a combination? Something else?
