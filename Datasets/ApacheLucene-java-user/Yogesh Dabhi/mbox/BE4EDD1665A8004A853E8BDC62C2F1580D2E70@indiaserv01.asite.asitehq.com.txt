Hi,

 

My application is cluster in jobss application servers & lucene
directory was shared.

 

Is it  work ReentrantReaderWriterLock around the process of re-opening
your
IndexReader and re-creating your IndexSearcher  in given environment  or


Is there  any alternate way for it

 

Please reply 

 

Thanks & Regards

Yogesh
