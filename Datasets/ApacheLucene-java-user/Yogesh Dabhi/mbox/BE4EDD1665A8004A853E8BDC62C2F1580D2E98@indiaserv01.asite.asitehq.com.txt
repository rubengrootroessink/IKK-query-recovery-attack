SUBJECT: Locking Issue  with Concurrency
DATE: 20 Apr 2011

 

Three Instance of My application & they access common lucene directory

 

Instance1 jdk64 ,64 os

Instance2 jdk64 ,64 os

Instance3 jdk32 ,32 os

 

When I access folder from Instance1 I got bellow error

 

An unexpected network error occurred

 

I see the index folder there is one .lock file

 

But for other two Instances its working fine 

 

Before locking all thing working fine

 

is there a way to handle such error

 

 

 

Thanks & Regards

Yogesh
