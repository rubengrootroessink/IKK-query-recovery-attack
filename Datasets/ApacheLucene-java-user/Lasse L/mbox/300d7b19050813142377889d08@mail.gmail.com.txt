SUBJECT: Re: Query that doesn't match a term more than once
DATE: 13 Aug 2005

However leaving the name as a single term would make me miss a hit
like "john doe johnson" -- which is unacceptable.

Is there a way I could boost the queryresults that match better?
Will the score rise if a query is matched more than once? "j*" in
"john johnson"?

It wouldn't matter that much that I get the extra matches if only I'd
get the best ones on top.
