SUBJECT: Re: Max score of two fields
DATE: 14 Nov 2005

I forgot to mention that I never have to search in the old_name alone.
I either search in current_name alone or current_name OR old_name.

Realizing that, lead me to the simple solution of duplicating whatever
I put into a current field into the old fields too. So the info in the
fields with old_ prefix is actually both old and current. That saves
me the boolean query that skewed the ratings.

Thank you for your time
