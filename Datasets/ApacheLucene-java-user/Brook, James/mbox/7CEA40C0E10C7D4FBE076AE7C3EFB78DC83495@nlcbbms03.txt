Hi PA,

How about this? I think it's what they use for Sherlock.

Apple Information Access Toolkit (AIAT)
http://www.devworld.apple.com/dev/aiat/

I have an Objective C WebObjects 4.5 application running on Mac OS X Server
1.2 that uses it to directly search the blobs of an OpenBase database.

I believe that it is written in C++, but it can easily be wrapped.

Regards
James Brook

Hello,

I was wandering if anybody knows of a Lucene port to straight C or 
Objective C...?!?

I need something equivalent to Lucene (but native if possible) on Mac OS 
X...

Thanks for any pointers!-)

PA.
