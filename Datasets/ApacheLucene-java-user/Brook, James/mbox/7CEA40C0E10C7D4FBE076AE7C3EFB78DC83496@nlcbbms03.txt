It looks like it's available for FTP download as an 'SDK' on this page
http://developer.apple.com/sdk/

I have no idea whether this is up-to-date or compatible with the latest OS
X.

Well, that's basically the first incarnation of Lucene :-) And in fact I 
was thinking to use it. However it seems to be missing from the latest 
osx... If you know otherwise, where is it hidden then?

Wow... I briefly used AIAT myself... but as I said, I cannot find it 
anymore.
