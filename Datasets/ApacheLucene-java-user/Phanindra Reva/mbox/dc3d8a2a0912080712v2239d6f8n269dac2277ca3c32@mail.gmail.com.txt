SUBJECT: question related to Indexing
DATE: 8 Dec 2009

Hello All,
              I am a newbie using Lucene. To be brief, I am just
wondering whether is there a point where we get the access to the
org.apache.lucene.document.Document (which is being indexed at the
moment)  after the analysing part is completed but exactly before it
is added to the index. My whole aim is to modify all the field names
present in the document before its being added to the index, but I
need those field names un-edited during the analysis part.
   If it seems strange.. please don't mind.
Thanks.
