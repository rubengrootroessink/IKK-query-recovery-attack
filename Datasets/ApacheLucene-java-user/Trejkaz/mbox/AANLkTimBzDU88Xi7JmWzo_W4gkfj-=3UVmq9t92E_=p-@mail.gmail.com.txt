This doesn't really answer the question, but I think it will help...

The features you want to look for:
1. A StAX-like "pull parsing" API - this makes it easier to implement
Reader since Reader is also a pull API.
2. Doesn't try to store the entire HTML file in memory in any form -
this makes it not bomb on gigantic HTML files, which do occur in
reality.

A specific counterexample which fails to satisfy both of these rules
is HTMLParser (htmlparser.sf.net), but be cautious of any library
which doesn't satisfy both.
