We have been using:  -myField:*

You would need to use setAllowLeadingWildcard on the QueryParser and
it wouldn't exactly be fast, but it works for us.

The suggestion to use a magic token is a good idea, though I would put
it in a separate field called "has" or something... so you can do:

    has:title   (same results as title:* but quicker to run)

The crappy thing is that to actually detect if there are any tokens in
the field you need to make a TokenStream which can be used to read the
first token and then rewind again.  I'm not sure if there is such a
thing in Lucene at the moment.  We had to write it ourselves but we
were on a considerably older version at the time.
