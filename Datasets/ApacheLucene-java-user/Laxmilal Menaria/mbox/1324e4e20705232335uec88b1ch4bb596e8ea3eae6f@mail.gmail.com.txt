DATE: 24 May 2007

Hello everyone,

I am getting Lock obtain timed exception while Searching in Index.

My Steps: I have created a Lucene Index at first week of may 2007, after
that I have nothing changed in index folder. Just I am searching. Searcher
code have only MultiSearcher. BUT now I am getting "Lock obtain timed out
exception", I saw in temp folder there was one lock file exists "
lucene-22e0ad3c019e26a6e2991b0e6ed97e1c-commit.lock<exists@MinalyzerLite.MDS\lucene-22e0ad3c019e26a6e2991b0e6ed97e1c-commit.lock>
"

Is MultiSearcher created lock file? or any other issue ?

Please suggest me..

I am using Lucene 2.0.
