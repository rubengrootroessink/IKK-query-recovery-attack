Hello everyone,

I am getting the following exception while searching:

Lock obtain timed out: java.io.IOException: Lock obtain timed out:
Lock@C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\lucene-22e0ad3c019e26a6e2991b0e6ed97e1c-commit.lock

I have implemented MultiSearcher only, No other methods are updating/adding
the docs in index, so how it is going ?

Thanks in advance,
Laxmilal
