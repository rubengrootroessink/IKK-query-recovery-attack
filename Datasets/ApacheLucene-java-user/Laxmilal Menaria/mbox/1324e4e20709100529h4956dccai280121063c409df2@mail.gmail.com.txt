SUBJECT: Searching Exact Word from Index
DATE: 10 Sep 2007

 Hello Everyone,

I want to search 'abc-d' as exact keyword not 'abc d'. KeywordAnalyzer can
be used for this purpose. StandradAnalyzer create different tokens for
'abc-d' as 'abc' and 'd'.
But I can not use this, becuase I am indexing the content of a text file. It
will search whole content as a single keyword.
But I want to search any word from the content.

Please let me now how it is possible..

Using : Java Lucene 2.2
