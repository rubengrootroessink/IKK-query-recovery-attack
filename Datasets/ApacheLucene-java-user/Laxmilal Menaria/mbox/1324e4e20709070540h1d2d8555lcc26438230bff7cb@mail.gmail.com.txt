SUBJECT: Indexing Speed using Lucene 2.2
DATE: 7 Sep 2007

Hello everyone,

I have indexed a mysql database using Lucene2.0. It was taking less than 2
minutes for 14000 records. Then I indexed the same data using Lucene2.2. It
took about 4 minutes. I got affected indexing speed on using Lucene2.2. The
indexing code is same. I just updated the lucenejar.

What can be done to improve the indexing speed. Please let me know asap...
