SUBJECT: How to get hits by multiple indexes using MultiSearcher...
DATE: 23 Apr 2007

Hi everyone,

I am using muitisearcher on multiple indexes, this will returns all the hits
on specific search query.  but I wants to know how many hits by  which index
folder.

i.e. I have created multiple Indexes i.e. Index1, Index2 and index3.  and
Now open multisearcher on that.
.
.
objIndexSearcher[0] = New IndexSearcher("c:\Index1")
objIndexSearcher[1] = New IndexSearcher("c:\Index2")
objIndexSearcher[2] = New IndexSearcher("c:\Index3")
.
.
objMultiSearcher = New MultiSearcher(objIndexSearcher)
.
.
hits = objMultiSearcher.search(lucQuery)

this will return all the hits which matches the query. But I wants to show
how many hits come by Index1, how many hits come by Index2...so how it is
possible ? please suggest me.

Thanks in advance,
-Laxmilal Menaria
