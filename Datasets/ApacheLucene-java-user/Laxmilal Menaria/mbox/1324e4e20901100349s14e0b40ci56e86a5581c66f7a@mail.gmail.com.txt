SUBJECT: While indexing with Lucene 2.4 search is not working ?
DATE: 10 Jan 2009

 Hi,

I have build an application which is using Lucene2.2. Now I upgraded to
Lucene2.4.

  I faced one problem. I am not able to search the documents while indexing
is running. Same code is running with lucene2.2
So is there any change due to new format which don't allow to search in
indexes while indexwriter is open.

Please let me know.


Thanks,
Laxmilal menaria
