DATE: 30 May 2007

Hello everyone,

I have created a Lucene Index of Students Database, this database have 5
fields i.e. Name, Address, Class, PhoneNo and ScholarNo.
Now I have opened Searcher and query "Name:Menaria" , Its return 100
results. Now I wants the All unique "Class"  names which is return in Hits
objects, How can I get unique Class list without using Loop.

Please suggest me..
