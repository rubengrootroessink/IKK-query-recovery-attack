Waits of several hours on a 4Gb index sounds very unlikely.  Are you
sure there isn't something else going on that is blocking things?
What version of lucene?  Decent, error-free, hardware?

As for optimize, I'd skip it altogether, or schedule it occasionally
when there is no or low activity on the index.
