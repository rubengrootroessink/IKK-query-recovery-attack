Hi


It's not quite that simple.  Other things being equal, results that
match all keywords are likely to come first but there are other
factors such as term frequency and the length of the document.

Searcher.explain() will give you the gory details.  Luke will let you
see what is in your index.  A google for relevancy or scoring will
give you more info.  DefaultSimilarity is the default scoring
implementation.
