SUBJECT: Re: Problem  in deleteing the documents
DATE: 10 Jan 2002

If you read the javadoc for IndexReader.delete() you will
see that deleted documents don't disappear immediately,
unless you call optimize(), but will disappear as the index
gets modified further.

IndexReader.isDeleted(i) says whether a particular document
has been deleted.
