Sorry, can't give you any Compass info but from posts to this list it
appears to be fairly well used.  And there is a good argument that you
shouldn't worry about performance in advance.

Just do as you say: store the group ids with each article e.g.

id: article1
text: some text about something
groupid: 100 200 300

id: article2
text: some other text about something else
groupid: 400

Then you can add a groupid: nnn clause to your query.  As ever, you'll
need to make sure that you use a suitable analyzer at indexing and
search time.
