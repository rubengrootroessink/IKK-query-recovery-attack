What exactly is the problem?  Are you concerned about the time that
your code snippet takes to run, or how much memory it uses?

If you have a query that matches many documents then iterating through
all of them, as your code does, is inevitably going to take time.  See
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveSearchingSpeed for
suggestions.

It is unclear why your code snippet would use a lot of memory.  Are
you maybe storing all the titles in memory?
