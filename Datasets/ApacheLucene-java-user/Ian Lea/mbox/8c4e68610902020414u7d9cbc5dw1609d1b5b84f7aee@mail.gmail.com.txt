SUBJECT: Re: How to extract Document object after the search?
DATE: 2 Feb 2009

Hi


That quote is from the javadoc for
HitCollector/TopDocCollector.collect().  You missed out the bit saying
"This is called in an inner search loop".

If, as your subject implies, you want to get at the Document object
AFTER the search, those methods are fine.  Just don't use them for any
more documents than you need, and not inside the collect() method.

If you really need to get at document data inside the inner search
loop I think you'll have to accept the performance hit or look into
advanced stuff like payloads.
