Hi


My guess is that one big index would be more efficient since the total
IO read and write load would be less.  The big reason for creating
smaller intermediate indexes is that you could spread their creation
over multiple jobs/disks/servers.

There is lots of good advice in
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveIndexingSpeed

As to a performance penalty, there are too many variables to hazard a
guess.  Try it out in your application on your hardware.
