It is possible. Lucene neither knows nor cares where the information
comes from in the first place.

How about
  Document htmld = getDocFromHtml();
  writer.addDocument(htmld);
  Document dbd = getDocumentFromDB();
  writer.addDocument(dbd);

where getDocumentFromDB() will read whatever info you want
from your database and load it into a Lucene Document.

StandardAnalyzer used StandardTokenizer and the javadocs for that say
"This should be a good tokenizer for most European-language documents"
but I've no personal experience of using if for any languages other
than English.
