Can't you simply sort by descending score (your score, not lucene's)?
Seems to me that would give you what you are asking for.

The setBoost() method is unlikely to work consistently because it only
infuences the score rather than setting it.  If your John Mickeal doc
happens to have a higher lucene score, because of the normal
idf/tf/etc stuff, then the setBoost() with a higher value for John
Smith may well not be enough to force John Smith to the top.

I don't know enough about function queries to help you much there but
FieldScoreQuery might work.  I can't see any sign of class
FunctionQuery in the 3.0.0 core package so am not clear what that is.
