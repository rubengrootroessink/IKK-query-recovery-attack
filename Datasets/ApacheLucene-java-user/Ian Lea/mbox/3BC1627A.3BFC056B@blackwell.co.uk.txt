If wanted to store an index on a read-only medium then would need to
be able to turn off lock file usage altogether, or specify an alternate
directory that wasn't part of the index tree.  Not something I've
ever needed to do, but someone might want to sometime.

Could the lock creation code check for write access to the index
directory and just skip the locks if can't create the file?  If
the index is read-only then nothing is going to be updating it
anyway.
