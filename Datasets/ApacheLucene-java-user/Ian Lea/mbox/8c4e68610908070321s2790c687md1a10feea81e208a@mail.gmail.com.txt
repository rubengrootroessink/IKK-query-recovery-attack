SUBJECT: Re: Why does this search succeed with web app, but not Luke?
DATE: 7 Aug 2009

It is a good general assumption that Luke is correct.

Can you confirm that you are using StandardAnalyzer everywhere, for
indexing and searching?  This sort of issue is often caused by using
different analyzers.

What does Luke show as the indexed terms for path?  In a little index
I've just created with StandardAnalyzer and file paths Luke is showing
xxx.yyy as a term and not xxx.  The opposite to what you have.

There was a thread yesterday about acronyms which might be relevant.
As might writing a tiny self-contained program that indexes a few
paths and displays the terms that have been indexed and runs a few
searches.
