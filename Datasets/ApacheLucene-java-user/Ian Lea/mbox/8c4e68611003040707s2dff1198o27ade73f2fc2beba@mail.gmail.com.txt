SUBJECT: Re: how to use DuplicateFilter to get unique documents based on a	fieldName
DATE: 4 Mar 2010

If the field you want to use for deduping is ISBN, create a
DuplicateFilter using whatever your ISBN field name is as the field
name and pass that to one of the search methods that takes a filter.

If your index is large I'd be worried about performance and would look
at deduping at indexing time i.e. have one lucene document per ISBN.
