Hi


Document.setBoost(float boost) where boost is either your score as is,
or a value based on that score, might do the trick for you.

Other boosting and custom score options include BoostingQuery,
BoostingTermQuery and CustomScoreQuery.


A google search for "lucene boosting" throws up lots of hits.
