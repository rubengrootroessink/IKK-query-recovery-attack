SUBJECT: Re: Lucene performance: is search time linear to the index size?
DATE: 17 Jun 2009

It depends on lots of things, but the time to execute a search would not
typically grow linearly with the number of documents.  But the time to
retrieve data from all the hits might, if the number of hits is growing in
line with the number of documents.  Are you doing that by any chance, as
opposed to getting data for the top n hits, regardless of the number of
hits?
