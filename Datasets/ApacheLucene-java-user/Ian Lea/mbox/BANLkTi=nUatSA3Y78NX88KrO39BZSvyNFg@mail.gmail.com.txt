SUBJECT: Re: Rewriting an index without losing 'hidden' data
DATE: 8 Apr 2011

Unfortunately you just can't do this.  Might be possible if all fields
were stored but evidently they are not in your index.  For unstored
fields, the Document object will not contain the data that was passed
in when the doc was originally added.

I believe there might be a way of recreating some of the missing data
via TermFreqVector but that has always sounded dodgy and lossy to me.

The safest way is to reindex, however painful it might be.  Maybe you
could take the opportunity to upgrade lucene at the same time!

so I wrote a utility to add the field by rewriting the index - but this seemed to lose some
of the fields (indexed, but not stored?).  In fact, it shrunk a 12Gb index down to 4.2Gb
- clearly not what I wanted.  :-)
