SUBJECT: Re: PhraseQuery: NullPointerException
DATE: 8 Feb 2002

1.2-rc3 seems to generate NPE if one or more of the words in
the search phrase are not present in the index.
Works as expected, no NPE, with 1.2-rc2.

If change method seek() in org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentTermPositions from

  final void seek(TermInfo ti) throws IOException {
    super.seek(ti);
    proxStream.seek(ti.proxPointer);
  }

to

  final void seek(TermInfo ti) throws IOException {
    super.seek(ti);
    if (ti != null) {
	proxStream.seek(ti.proxPointer);
    }
  }

the NPE goes away.  But I don't know what is going on here so
this may well not be the correct solution.
