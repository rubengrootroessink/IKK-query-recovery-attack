Please don't cross-post to multiple lists.

Look back through the lucene user email archive and you'll find people
talking about this or use your favourite search engine to find hits
for something like "lucene pdf highlighting".

If you don't find an answer, post again to the most appropriate list
only, with the specific problem.
Is the problem with searching?  Highlighting text? Generating a PDF?
Highlighting within a generated PDF?
