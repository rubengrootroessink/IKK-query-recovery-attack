Hi


The simplest way is to flatten your data into lucene documents that
hold all relevant info for user/job combinations.  That will let you
search easily across whichever fields you want.

Your documents could look like this:

firstname: whatever
lastname: whatever
jobtitle: somejob
startdate: whenever
enddate: whenever

and searches could be something like lastname:whatever jobtitle:somejob.
