SUBJECT: Re: How further reward documents matching more query terms?
DATE: 29 Jan 2010

I presume that quote is from the javadocs for Similarity.

You can write your own Similarity class that extends DefaultSimilarity
and provides an implementation of public float coord(int overlap, int
maxOverlap) that does what you want, maybe by scaling up the value
returned, if I've understood the description properly.

Tell lucene to use your class by calling
Similarity.setDefault(Similarity similarity).

Warning: in my limited experience of trying to tweak lucene's scoring
I almost always make things worse rather than better.  YMMV.  Good
luck.
