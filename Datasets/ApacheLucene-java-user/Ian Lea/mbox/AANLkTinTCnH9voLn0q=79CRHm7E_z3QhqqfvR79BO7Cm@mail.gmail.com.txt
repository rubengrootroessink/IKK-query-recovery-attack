Yes, you can do that.  Make a Query for the 30 papers and use that
with your main query in a BooleanQuery if doing it programatically.
Or with so few documents and papers to match, just in a long string
via QueryParser.  See
http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_2/queryparsersyntax.html for details
on query parser syntax - that is also the answer to your other
question.

If performance is a concern and you will be reusing the same set of
pubmed ids you should look at filters, specifically QueryWrapperFilter
and CachingWrapperFilter.
