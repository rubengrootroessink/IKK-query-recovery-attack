Hard to say - there are many factors involved in searching.  I'd just
use the easiest queries that were fast enough.  If you want a better
answer more info would be useful.  For starters:

What version of lucene.
How big is the index.
How many hits.
Exactly what do the queries look like (q.toString()).
How are you constructing the filters.
Are the filters cached.

And don't forget to ignore the times of the first few searches on a
new Searcher.

I was expecting smaller search time with ConstantScoreQuery with TermsFilter, but it has turned
out otherwise.
