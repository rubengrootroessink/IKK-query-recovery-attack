SUBJECT: Re: Lucene Questions about query and highlighter~^^
DATE: 9 Feb 2011

http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/queryparsersyntax.html should have
answers to your query formulation questions.  You might also like to
consider building the queries yourself programatically and using Span
queries.  They are good for specifying slop and order and so on. There
is useful info on the Lucid Imagination site - google "lucid
imagination span query".

Sorry, can't help you with highlighting except to say there was a
recent thread on it. Or you could post again with something more
specific than "there is something wrong".
