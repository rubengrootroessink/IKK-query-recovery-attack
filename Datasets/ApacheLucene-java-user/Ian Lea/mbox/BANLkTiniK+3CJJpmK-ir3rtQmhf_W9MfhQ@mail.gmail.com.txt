30Gb isn't that big by lucene standards.  Have you considered or tried
just having one large index?  If necessary you could restrict searches
to particular "indexes", or groups thereof, by a field in the combined
index, preferably used as a filter.  If the slow searches have to
search across 63 separate indexes it is perhaps not surprising that
they are slow.  What do you do about sharing or caching
searcher/reader instances?  There are lots of useful tips on
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveSearchingSpeed.

40 fields isn't that many - should be fine.

On sharding/scaling/etc,

looks well worth a read.
