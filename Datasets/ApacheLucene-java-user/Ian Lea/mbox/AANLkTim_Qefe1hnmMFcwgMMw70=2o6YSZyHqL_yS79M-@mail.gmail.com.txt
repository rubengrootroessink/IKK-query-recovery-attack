OK, so it looks like we're down to a more general "why is searching
slow" question.

The number of docs is not very large by lucene standards.

Work through http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveSearchingSpeed.

If that still doesn't help, pick a slow query and post again with:

. the output of query.toString()
. the number of docs matched
. how long it took first time on new searcher, and second and third
and ... tenth
. ummm... anything else you think might be relevant.

Good luck.
