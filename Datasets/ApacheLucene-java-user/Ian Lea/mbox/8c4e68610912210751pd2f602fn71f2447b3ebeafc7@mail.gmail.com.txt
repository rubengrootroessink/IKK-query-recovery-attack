SUBJECT: Re: Lucene' results paging
DATE: 21 Dec 2009

Hi


The standard approach to paging is just to do the search again and
pick out the docs you want, along the lines you outline.  You cannot
pass start/end info to any search methods.

When you set max doc to, say, 10, lucene will find the 10 highest
scoring docs and return them.  There is no point in passing a number
higher than you need.  So if you are displaying 10 hits per page, call
search(query, 10) for the first page, ..., 20 for the second and pick
out the last 10, and so on.

An alternative approach is for you to cache the search results
yourself.  That way you can avoid any subsequent searches.  But that
has it's own overhead and complexity, and most people most of the time
don't get much past the first page.
