Doing your own sorting is certainly an acceptable thing to do, and for
low numbers of hits might even be "the right way".  There are also
some tips and tricks that you can use to reduce Lucene's memory usage
for sorting such as using NumericField or splitting the sortable
field(s) into chunks, e.g. indexing year/month/day/hh/mm as separate
fields.
