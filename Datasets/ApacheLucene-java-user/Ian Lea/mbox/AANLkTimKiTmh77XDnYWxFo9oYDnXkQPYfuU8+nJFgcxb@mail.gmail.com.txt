Sounds like a good plan to me. Unless you've got evidence of
inefficiency, don't worry about it.

Don't have any problems with indexing it, however I have no idea how to re-index it if they
change during the execution of this code; one of my ideas is adding some events to this objects
(if you change any parameters -> reindex it ). However I'm not sure about its efficiency?
