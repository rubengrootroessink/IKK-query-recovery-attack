Are the email and phone numbers stored as is, or analyzed?  Does it
work if you remove the date filter?  Are the hex encoded strings the
same length and in the right sequence?

Posting a complete standalone test case or program, as small as you
can make it while demonstrating the problem, can make it easier for
people to spot problems.
