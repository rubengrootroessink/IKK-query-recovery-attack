Of course.  See IndexReader and IndexWriter deleteXXX methods.

Of course.

If the created date is an indexed field you could do this with one of
the methods that takes a query - RangeQuery in your case from, say, 0
TO 20100101, dependent obviously on your data.  It the date field is
not indexed you could loop through all docs checking the date and
zapping the old ones by docNum
