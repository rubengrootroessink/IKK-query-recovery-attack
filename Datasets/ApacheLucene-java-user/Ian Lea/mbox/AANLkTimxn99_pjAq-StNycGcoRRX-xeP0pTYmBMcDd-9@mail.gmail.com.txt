Care to define huge?  There often isn't a "best" solution but in this
case I think I'd vote for the index-per-year approach.

btw with recent versions of lucene you don't need to call optimize()
very often, if at all, although you might want to run it at the
beginning of each year against the previous year's index, now static.
