Not that I know of.

and whether fields have been added or removed.

No!

like so:

Yes.  Of course you won't be able to compare unstored fields.

> Is there a better way to create Fields and/or Documents for this type of thing?

Hash or CRC as Shashi suggested, but you'll still need compare old and
new hash values.
