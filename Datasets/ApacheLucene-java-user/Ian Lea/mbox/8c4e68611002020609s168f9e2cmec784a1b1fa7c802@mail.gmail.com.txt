SUBJECT: Re: How to use search index while indexing
DATE: 2 Feb 2010

I'm not sure that I understand the question.  Can you not use a
searcher based on the reader returned by IndexWriter.getReader() to
determine if the doc is already in the index?

Or just use IndexWriter.updateDocument to save or replace as appropriate.
