SUBJECT: Re: combining MultiFieldQueryParserparser with FuzzyQuery
DATE: 19 Oct 2010

I don't think you can do that directly with MultiFieldQueryParser, but
as Erick said in a similar thread a short while ago "You can create
your own BooleanQuery and just add clauses as you need to".

FuzzyQuery fq1 = new FuzzyQuery(whatever ...);
FuzzyQuery fq2 = new FuzzyQuery(whatever-else ...);
...
BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
bq.add(fq1, ...);
bq.add(fq2, ...);
...
