Lucene will index and store the fields that you tell it to when a
document is written to the index.

In lucene 2.4 doc.getFields() returns a List of all the fields in a
document and probably in 2.3.2 as well.  See the javadoc.  That will
tell you the fields that have been stored but I think not necessarily
those that have been indexed i.e. made searchable.

Luke can tell you pretty much everything about an index.
