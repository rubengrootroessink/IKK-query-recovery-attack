Basic wildcard support (i.e. ignoring things like left wildcards)
comes pretty much "out of the box".  Attached is a copy of the
program I was playing with before sending the earlier message.
It uses StandardAnalyzer and the static QueryParser.parse()
method so doesn't work with left wildcards.  I haven't tried
? rather than *.


Hope this helps.
