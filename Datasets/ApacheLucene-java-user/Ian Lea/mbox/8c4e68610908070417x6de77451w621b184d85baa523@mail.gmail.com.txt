It's not clear to me what you mean by reading the index every time.
If you mean that you open a new searcher for every search, then no,
it's not good.

If you mean that every search or paging request gets passed to lucene
then that is standard practice and is fine.

See http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveSearchingSpeed for loads
of good advice.
