This is all getting very complicated!

Adrian - have you looked any further into why your original two term
query was too slow?  My experience is that simple queries are usually
extremely fast.  Standard questions: have you warmed up the searcher?
How large is the index?  How many occurrences of your first or second
terms?  Anything odd about them?  See also
