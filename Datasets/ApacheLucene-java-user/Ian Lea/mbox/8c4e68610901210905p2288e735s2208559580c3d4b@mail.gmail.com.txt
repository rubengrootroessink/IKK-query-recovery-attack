Not for that amount of difference.  You may be sure that you are not
indexing multiple copies, but I'm not.  Convince me - create 2 new
indexes via the 2 methods, from scratch, and count the number of docs.
 And verify the size of the indexes.  Does the multi GB one contain
deleted docs?  Has it been optimized?

All I need to know is that searching is extremely fast.  Have you
taken note of Erick's suggestions and comments?

What version of lucene are you using?
