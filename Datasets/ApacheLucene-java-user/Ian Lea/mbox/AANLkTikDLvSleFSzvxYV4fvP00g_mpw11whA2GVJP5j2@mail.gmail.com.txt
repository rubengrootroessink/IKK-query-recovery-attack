SUBJECT: Re: Searching for a strict prefix
DATE: 24 May 2010

StandardAnalyzer should work fine, mark the field as indexed, no need
to store it unless you want to retrieve it for display.

Query via QueryParser using "tagname: updateC*" or programatically via
PrefixQuery.


Although I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "strict prefix".  If
you mean that the prefix should match exactly on case, punctuation
etc. maybe use KeywordAnalyzer instead.
