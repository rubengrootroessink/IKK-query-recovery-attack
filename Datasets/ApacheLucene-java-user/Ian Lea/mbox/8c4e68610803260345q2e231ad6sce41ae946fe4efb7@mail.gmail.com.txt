Hi


The bottom line is that reading fields from docs is expensive.
FieldCache will, I believe, load fields for all documents but only
once - so the second and subsequent times it will be fast.  Even
without using a cache it is likely that things will speed up because
of caching by the OS.

If you've got plenty of memory vs index size you could look at
RAMDirectory or MMapDirectory.  Or how about some solid state disks?
Someone recently posted some very impressive performance stats.

Another approach we've used is to implement our own simple in-memory
cache of field values.  Read values from cache if present otherwise
read from lucene and cache. This works for us on an index of 3.5
million+ docs.  It helps a lot that we only update the index once a
day so only open new readers once a day and the cache has plenty of
time to fill up.
