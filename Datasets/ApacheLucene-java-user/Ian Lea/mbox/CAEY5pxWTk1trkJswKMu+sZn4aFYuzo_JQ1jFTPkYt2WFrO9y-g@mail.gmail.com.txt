SUBJECT: Re: Memory leak with Lucene Search ?
DATE: 12 Jul 2011

Lucene does not cache results.  Operating systems do cache things and
on unix anyway (no idea about windows) some speedups over time can
reasonably be attributed to disk caching by the OS.

Have you profiled your app to find out exactly what is using the
memory? Do you just use the one searcher or are you opening new ones
from time to time?  If the latter, are you closing the old ones?
