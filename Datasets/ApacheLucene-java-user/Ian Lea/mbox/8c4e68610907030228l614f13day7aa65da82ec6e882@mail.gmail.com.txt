I think you should warm as much as possible: queries, filters, sorts,
whatever.  And I think that the warmup searches should match stuff
that is available in the index.  You'll get warming of internal lucene
structures and also OS disk IO cache.  Taking the last n queries
executed on the previous searcher can work well.
