SUBJECT: Re: segment count
DATE: 30 May 2002

Lucene doesn't store one document per segment.  See
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=lucene-user&m=102079295608850&w=2
for detail on the files created.

On "is this the right way ..."?, here is an extract from the javadoc

   1. Create Document's by adding Field's.
   2. Create an IndexWriter and add documents to to it with addDocument();
   3. Call QueryParser.parse() to build a query from a string; and
   4. Create an IndexSearcher and pass the query to it's search() method.
