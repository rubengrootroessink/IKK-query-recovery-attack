> What are the typical scenarios when the index will go corrupt?

Dodgy disks.

> E.g. can a simple JVM crash during indexing will cause it?

No.  See the javadocs for IndexWriter.

> What are the best way to minimalize the possibility of corrupt index?

Don't use dodgy disks.

> Copy the directory before indexing / then flipping the pointers?

Yes, that's good.  Or just make sure you've got a backup, or can
easily recreate your index from scratch.
