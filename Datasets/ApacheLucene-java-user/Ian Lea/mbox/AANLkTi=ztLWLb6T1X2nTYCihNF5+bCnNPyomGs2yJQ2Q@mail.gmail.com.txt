SUBJECT: Re: Boost a field in fuzzy query
DATE: 14 Mar 2011

You could build the query up in your program, or that part of it anyway.

BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
FuzzyQuery fq = new FuzzyQuery(...);
fq.setBoost(123f);
bq.add(fq);
...

This might be a bug in MultiFieldQueryParser - you could provide a
test case or, better, a patch.
See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENENET-147.  Lucene.Net,
but the comment there says "would probably mean Lucene Java also
suffers from the same bug".

Presumably you've read the "not very scalable" warning in the javadocs
for FuzzyQuery.

And you don't say what version of lucene you are using.  If not the
latest, try that.
