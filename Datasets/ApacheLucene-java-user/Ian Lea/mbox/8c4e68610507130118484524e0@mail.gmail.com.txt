Something like this?

IndexWriter iw = whatever
ResultSet rs = whatever

while (rs.next()) {
   Document ldoc = new Document();
   ldoc.add(Field.Text("f1", rs.getString("f1"));
   ldoc.add(Field.Unstored("f2", rs.getString("f2"));
   ldoc.add(Field.Keyword("f3", rs.getString("f3"));
   ...
   iw.addDocument(ldoc);
}

rs.close();
iw.close();


On the IDE front, most people seem to use Eclipse nowadays.
