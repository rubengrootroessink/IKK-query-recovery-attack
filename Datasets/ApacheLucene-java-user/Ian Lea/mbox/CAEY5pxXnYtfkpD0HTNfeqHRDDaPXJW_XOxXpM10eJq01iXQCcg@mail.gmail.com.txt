well worth a read.

Too many variables to say.

Surely searchers are read only, by definition.

Sounds impossible.

Not clear what you are asking here, but you can pass whatever you like
as the max doc count to the assorted search methods, and do whatever
you want with the results.  Storing all docs from search results on a
massive index doesn't sound a very clever idea.

No idea.
