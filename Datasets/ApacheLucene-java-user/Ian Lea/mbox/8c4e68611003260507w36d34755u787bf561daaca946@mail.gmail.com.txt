Odd.  Query.toString() and back to Query via parser are not guaranteed
to be consistent but it looks pretty straightforward in this case.

Maybe Searcher.explain would give a clue.  Or post a minimal
self-contained program or test case that demonstrates this.  Or try a
later version of lucene.

The search results between the two queries are now in different orders while the number of
results are the same. I have one caveat with my change, I still use QueryParser for part of
it so that I can easily handle quoting.

To verify, I do a toString on the two different queries and they are the same. That output
is:

it has to do with the QueryParser usage in my "New Way", but I'm not sure how that would effect
the ordering.
