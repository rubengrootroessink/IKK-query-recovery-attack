Absolutely, as long as your ids will sort as you expect.

I'm not clear what you mean by XDF-123 but if you've got

AAA-123
AAA-124
...
ABC-123
ABC-234
etc.

then you'll be fine.  If they don't sort so neatly you can use the
TermRangeQuery constructor that takes a Collator but note the
performance warning in the javadocs.

of ids (represented as XDF-123) and I would like to do a search for all the ids (might be
in the range of 10000) and for each matching id I want to get the corresponding data that
is stored in the index (for example the document contains id and string value).  I am using
a custom collector to collect that string value for each match.  Is it ok to use a TermRangeQuery
for the ids rather than creating a massive query string?
