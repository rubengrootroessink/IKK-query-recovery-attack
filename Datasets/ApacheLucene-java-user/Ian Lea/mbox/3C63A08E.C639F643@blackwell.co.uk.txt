I think that is correct.  Tomcat 3.whatever understands 

<!DOCTYPE web-app
    PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.2//EN"
    "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_2.dtd">

without recourse to any external sites, and Tomcat 4.whatever understands

<!DOCTYPE web-app
    PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
    "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd">

but Tomcat 3 doesn't.  So just edit web.xml and replace 3 with 2, twice.



Perhaps that should be noted in the demo docs if it isn't already.
