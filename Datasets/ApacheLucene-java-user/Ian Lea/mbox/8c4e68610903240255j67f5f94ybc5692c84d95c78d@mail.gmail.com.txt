SUBJECT: Re: Can you create a RAM index from a file index
DATE: 24 Mar 2009

Hi


You can load an existing index into a RAMDirectory using one of the
constructors that takes an existing index.  I believe that a RAM index
will be the same size as a file based index.

MMapDirectory is another possibility.
