What does Luke show as being indexed for that field?  Other useful
tips at http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#Why_am_I_getting_no_hits_.2BAC8_incorrect_hits.3F

If that field is numeric you could use a NumericField - gets rid of
problems with leading zeros.

If by "I just want to get everything which has 341 in it" you mean you
want to match aaa341bbb and 0000341 and 341, see related thread on
this list from yesterday.  Or
org.apache.lucene.search.regex.RegexQuery.
