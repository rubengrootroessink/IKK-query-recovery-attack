It's not so much that the hits or queries are cached (they aren't) but
that some lucene internal structures are loaded from disk.  And if you
are sorting, the field cache is also loaded.  So it usually doesn't
matter exactly what queries you use.  One strategy is to keep a list
of the last n queries and execute them.  Another is just to pick some
arbitrary queries that you know are representative of real queries
e.g. if people search on title and sort on date then use a query that
does that.
