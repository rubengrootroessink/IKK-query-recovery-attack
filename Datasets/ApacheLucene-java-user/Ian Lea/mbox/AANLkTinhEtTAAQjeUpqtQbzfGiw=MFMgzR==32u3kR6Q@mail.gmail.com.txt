SUBJECT: Re: Options for multiple filters
DATE: 5 Nov 2010

What is your chosen version?  At first glance I'd say your two
examples should be the same but I know there is lots going on behind
the scenes that I don't know about.  Is one giving you correct results
and the other not?

As for BooleanFilter - no idea.  FWIW I use QueryWrapperFilter,
CachingWrapperFilter and ChainedFilter.  Works for me.
