Have you tried query time boosting of title queries? title:lucene^4
content:lucene.  Might be easier than fiddling with sweetspot
arguments, although I see from the javadocs that "A per field min/max
can be specified if different fields have different sweet spots".  Not
sure if that is relevant to you or not.

it's hard to set the correct parameters for SweetSpotSimilarity. For example we want the title
of a page to always have the highest boost than its content no matter how long it is.
