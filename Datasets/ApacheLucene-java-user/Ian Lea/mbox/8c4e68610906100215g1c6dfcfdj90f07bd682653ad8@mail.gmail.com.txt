I'd recommend using your favourite queueing service to pass all
updates to a central process, the one and only process that updates
the index.  If you don't already have a favourite queueing service,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service#Provider_implementations
lists several JMS implementations.

what happens when two or more nodes update the same thing.  Anyone have any insight?
