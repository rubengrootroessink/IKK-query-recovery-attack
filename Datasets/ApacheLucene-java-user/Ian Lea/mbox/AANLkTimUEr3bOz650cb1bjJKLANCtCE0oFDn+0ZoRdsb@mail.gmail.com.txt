SUBJECT: Re: Recent Content - Lucene vs. DB SELECT / DB Triggers / Memcached
DATE: 4 Mar 2011

I'd go for lucene.  The near realtime search stuff should minimise
delays in making content visible and if you can do the last X since
whenever with a NumericRangeQuery, perhaps in conjunction with a
custom Collector, that will be fast too.
