Are you sure that it isn't working?  If you use the same analyzer at
both indexing and query time you should end up with consistent
results.

Read up on exactly what your analyzer is doing by looking at the javadocs.

Google will find you lots of info on analysis, or get hold of a copy
of Lucene In Action 2nd edition to learn all about lucene.  And use
Luke to see what is being indexed.
