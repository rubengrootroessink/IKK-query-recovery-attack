DATE: 8 Nov 2001

For what it is worth I've got an index with 1.6 million
small entries, taking up 350Mb of disk space, and have
a long running server process handling search requests
against the index and memory usage is stable at 95Mb.
It has handled 425000+ mostly simple searches so far.
The index is optimized and the process reuses an IndexReader.
