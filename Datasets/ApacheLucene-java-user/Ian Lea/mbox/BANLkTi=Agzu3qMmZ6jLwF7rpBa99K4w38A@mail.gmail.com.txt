You can add multiple values for a field to a single document.

Document doc = new Document();
String[] paths = whatever.split(",");
for (String p : paths) {
  doc.add(new Field("path", p, whatever ...);
}


For searching, assuming you only want to be able to wildcard on path
delimiters, you could index

/Top/My Prods/Book Prods/Text Books
/Top/My Prods/Book Prods
/Top/My Prods
/Top

which would let you search on any of them.

You'll want to pick or build an analyzer that behaves as you want wrt
case matching and not splitting on the /.  Sometime it can be easier
to replace a character e.g. / to _.  I think there is a lucene class
that can do that, maybe MappingCharFilter, if you don't want to do it
yourself.  You will of course need to be consistent and do the same
processing at index and search time.
