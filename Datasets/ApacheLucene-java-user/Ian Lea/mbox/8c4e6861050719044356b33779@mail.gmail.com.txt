Have you tried Erik's suggestion from last week?
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200507.mbox/%3cFCE3C9A0-2707-4303-9F33-175015F02EE3@ehatchersolutions.com%3e

There is certainly some case confusion in your examples there. 
Personally, I tend to just lowercase all text on indexing and
searching.

keywordAnalyzer, but wild card search is not coming up. Is there anything which I need to
do in addition or, wild card search is not possible with keyword field.
