Are you asking how to get lucene.apache.org out of
http://lucene.apache.org/ or how to get apache.org out of
lucene.apache.org?  The getHost() method of java.net.URL will give you
the former. Or use a regexp.  I don't know an easy way to do the
latter, but depending on your requirements you could split
lucene.apache.org into tokens "lucene.apache.org" and "apache.org" and
"org" and index all of them.  You probably want to use an analyzer
that doesn't split on the . character.
