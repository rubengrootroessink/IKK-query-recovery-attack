Well, lucene is blazingly quick and sometimes things take less time
than one might expect, but your combination of large and very large is
not encouraging.  It doesn't sounds like the new API method would
necessarily need an exact reply - could you run something in the
background out of peak hours that built the XML response or at least
saved numbers for it to be built quickly when requested?  Depending on
the volatility of your indexes, the background job could be somewhat
intelligent and only update the figures for indexes that have had
significant activity.  Defining significant activity is left as an
exercise for the reader ...

Good luck.
