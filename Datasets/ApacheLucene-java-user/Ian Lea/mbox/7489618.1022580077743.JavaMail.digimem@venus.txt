How about if you search for "resloc:ccsa*" i.e. all lower case? 

If using QueryParser.parse() with a standard analyzer the search term
does not get converted to lower case if it contains a trailing
wildcard.

Running code like this

   Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(); 
   Query query = QueryParser.parse(s, KEYFIELD, analyzer);
   System.out.println(s + "(" + query.toString(KEYFIELD) + ")");

with s set to various values gives something like this

   CCsa  (ccsa)         // OK
   CCsa* (CCsa*)        // Suspect
   ccsa* (ccsa*)        // OK


Tested against rc5 and latest from CVS.
