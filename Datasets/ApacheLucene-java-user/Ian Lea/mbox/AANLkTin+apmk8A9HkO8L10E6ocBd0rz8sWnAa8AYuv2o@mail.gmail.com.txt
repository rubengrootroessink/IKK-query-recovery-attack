DATE: 9 Feb 2011

Have you considered using stemming instead?  Sounds like that might
make most of your problems go away and achieve the same result.

I'm not aware of a utility method to remove stop words from a string
but there are ways of passing data through analyzers/tokenizers and
grabbing the output. StandardAnalyzer stores the stop words in
STOP_WORDS_SET and you might be able to use that directly, or pass in
your own set of stop works which you would obviously have access to.

If you stick with your split/word by word approach, watch out for
punctuation.and Mixed Case and other complications.
