OK, yes, if you do need to "specify certain fields as required, and
others as prohibited" then you'll need to build and populate that
array.  There is also a parse method that doesn't require the array if
you just want to search all the fields.

I hope that the 2_3_1 links don't indicate that you are using that version.
