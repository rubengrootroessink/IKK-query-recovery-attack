SUBJECT: Re: best way to iterate through all docs from a query
DATE: 19 Nov 2009

First queries are often slow and subsequent ones faster.  Search the
list for warming - I think there was something on it in the last
couple of days.  Or read the "When measuring performance, disregard
the first query" bit of
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveSearchingSpeed

A good number to pass to the Collector is however many docs you are
going to be interested in.  If you are just going to display the first
10, pass 10.
