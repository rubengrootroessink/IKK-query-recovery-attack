SUBJECT: Re: Filter to retrieve random documents without specific terms ?
DATE: 29 Mar 2011

Here are a couple of ideas.

Plan A.

Think of a number, say 10, retrieve n * 10 docids in your search and
then loop round java.util.Random.nextInt(n * 10) until you've got
enough.

Plan B.

Reverse your MUST NOT search to get a list of docids that you don't
want, then loop round Random.nextInt(indexreader.numDocs()), selecting
those that are not deleted (!indexreader.isDeleted(docid)) and are not
in your exclusion list.


I'm sure there are other ways, probably better.
