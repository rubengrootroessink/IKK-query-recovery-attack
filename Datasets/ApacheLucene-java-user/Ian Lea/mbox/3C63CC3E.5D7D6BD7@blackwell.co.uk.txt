SUBJECT: Lucene Build Instructions
DATE: 8 Feb 2002

Today I built lucene-1.2-rc3 from the source distribution
for the first time.  On the whole it was easy enough but
a couple of points:


BUILD.txt says "Install JDK 1.3".  Might it be better to say
"Install JDK 1.3 or later"?. Lots of people are probably
running 1.4 already.

BUILD.txt makes no mention of javaCC.  You find out soon
enough when run ant, but would be better to have it
mentioned up front.  Also I couldn't get the .ant.properties
method mentioned in build.xml to work (probably finger
trouble) but copying javaCC.zip to the lucene-1.2-rc3-src/lib/
directory worked fine.



Also, by default the code as compiled from source and as
distributed in the binary download doesn't have line numbers
in stack trace dumps.  This may be deliberate in which case
fine, but the line numbers do help in tracking down
problems.
