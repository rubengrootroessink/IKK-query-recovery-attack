Left wildcards seem to work if you explicitly use a
WildcardQuery e.g. 

	Term t = new Term("id", "*ucene");
	Query query = new WildcardQuery(t);


but if use QueryParser with an analyzer e.g.

	Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
	Query query = QueryParser.parse("*ucene", "id", analyzer);

get an exception:

org.apache.lucene.queryParser.ParseException: 
Lexical error at line 1, column 1.  Encountered: "*" (42), after : ""
  at org.apache.lucene.queryParser.QueryParser.parse(Unknown Source)


Tested on RC5.  Haven't tried other ways of building a query.  In my
simple tests terms with left and right wildcards like "*lucene*"
worked too, even if the whole word was included.
