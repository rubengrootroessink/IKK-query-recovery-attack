Looks like PorterStemFilter converts "Lowe's" to low.  Not very surprising.

Options include

.  Drop the stemming

.  Index stemmed and non-stemmed variants and search both, maybe
boosting the non-stemmed variant.

If you really want exact matches only, you may also/instead want
untokenized fields.  Apostrophes etc can be a problem.  Look into what
analyzers do and use Luke to see what is indexed.
