Sounds like you need to call setDefaultOperator(AND_OPERATOR).  See
the javadocs for MultiFieldQueryParser constructors.  They give
examples.

Personally I tend to get confused with all the Should/Must/And/Or
combinations with searches on multiple terms across multiple fields
and wherever possible prefer to add a simple "keywords" or "contents"
field to docs and just dump all the generally searchable terms in
there.
