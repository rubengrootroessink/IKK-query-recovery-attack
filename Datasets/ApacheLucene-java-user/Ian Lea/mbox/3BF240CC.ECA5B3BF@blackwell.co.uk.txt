SUBJECT: Re: Is NEAR supported?
DATE: 14 Nov 2001

See PhraseQuery.setSlop();

Extract from javadoc:

 "Sets the number of other words permitted between words in query
phrase.
  If zero, then this is an exact phrase search. For larger values this
  works like a WITHIN or NEAR operator.".


There was also some stuff on this topic on the list not very long ago.
