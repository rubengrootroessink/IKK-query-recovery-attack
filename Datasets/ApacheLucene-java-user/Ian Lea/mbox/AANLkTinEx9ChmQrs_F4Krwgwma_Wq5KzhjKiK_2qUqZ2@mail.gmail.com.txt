Depending on what exactly you mean by "subset" and "index pool", then yes.

If you've got one lucene index containing docs

docno: 1
category: computers
text: some words about computers

docno: 2
category: computers
text: some more words about computers

docno: 3
category: finance
text: some words about finance

then a search for "text:words" will match all 3 whereas a search for
"category:computers text:words" will only match 2.


If this isn't what you are asking about I suggest you provide more detail.
