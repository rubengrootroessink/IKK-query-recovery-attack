See what Searcher.explain() says for each hit. I don't think that word
order will matter with the query you give.  There are several factors
in scoring - see oal.search.Similarity or google lucene scoring.

Or have a play with Luke: invaluable for investigating things with
lucene and will tell you everything about your index.
