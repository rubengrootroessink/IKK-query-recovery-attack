SUBJECT: Re: index enforcing query terms to appear within the same sentence
DATE: 4 Mar 2011

You can use multi valued fields if you play with the position
increment gap.  See e.g.
http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Problem-searching-in-the-same-sentence-td1501269.html

A google search for "lucene indexing sentences" or similar finds that, and more.


Different docs can have different fields/different numbers of fields,
but the position gap approach is probably better.
