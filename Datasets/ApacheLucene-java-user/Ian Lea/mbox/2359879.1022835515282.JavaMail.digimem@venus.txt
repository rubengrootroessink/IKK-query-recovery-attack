I don't know if you have to call close() to make all modifications visible
or not.  Sounds likely.  You do not have to call optimize.  Having
one writer and one or more readers concurrently is fine.  You can
(should) call IndexReader.lastModified() to find out if the index
has been modified since the IndexReader was opened.

No idea.  I'm just a lucene user and have never needed to know about
that sort of stuff.
