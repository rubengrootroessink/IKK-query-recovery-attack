Tokenizing and then passing through the query parser sounds reasonable
to me.  You could build the query yourself, but that will be a bit
more work.  You could also combine a non-wildcard search with a
wildcard search, boosting the first one.  So that "John Doe" would
score higher than "Johnny Doncaster".
