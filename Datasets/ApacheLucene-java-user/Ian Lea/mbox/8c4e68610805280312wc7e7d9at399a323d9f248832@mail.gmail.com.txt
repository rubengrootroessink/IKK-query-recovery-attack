Hi


Maybe you could use the pagerank score, possibly modified, as document
boost at indexing time.  From the javadocs for
Document.setBoost(boost)

"Sets a boost factor for hits on any field of this document. This
value will be multiplied into the score of all hits on this document"

so will give you P * R rather than P + R.  Should be quick, though.
