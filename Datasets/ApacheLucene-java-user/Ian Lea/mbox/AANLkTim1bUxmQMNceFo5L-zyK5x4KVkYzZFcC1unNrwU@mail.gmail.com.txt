Lucene counts the number of matched docs.  A particular document will
count as 1 whether it is matched by 1 search term or many search
terms.

I don't believe it is possible to count what you are asking for using
standard calls.  It might be possible with a custom collector that
somehow had access to the values passed to the coord() method of the
Similarity in use for a search.  Sounds hairy, maybe impossible.
