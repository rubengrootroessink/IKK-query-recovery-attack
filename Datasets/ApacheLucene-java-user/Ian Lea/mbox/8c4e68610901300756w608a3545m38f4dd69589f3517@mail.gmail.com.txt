That answer is fine, but there are others.  We store denormalized data
in lucene, as you are doing, for display on web pages because we can
get it out of lucene much faster then we can get it out of the various
tables in the database.  The database is not as fast as it might be,
quite possibly slower than yours.  And yes, there is overhead in terms
of space and time in having 2 copies of the data but space is cheap
and there aren't that many writes and they happen offline so we don't
really care if they take a bit longer.  We don't store everything in
lucene by any means - just what is returned for product searches.

Overall I don't think there is a single best practice recommendation.
As so often, it depends on your setup, requirements and preferences.
