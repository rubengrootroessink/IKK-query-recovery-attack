SUBJECT: Re: Does {Filter}ing is faster than {Query}ing in Lucene?
DATE: 24 Jun 2011

Generalisation is risky, particularly wrt performance, but I'd say
yes, particularly if you can cache and reuse the filter e.g. with
CachingWrapperFilter.  See
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/FilteringOptions.  Not very up to
date but I'd expect the conclusions to stand.

this means that if I do not need scoring or sort documents by document field value I should
preferFiltering over Querying from performance point of view?
