http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexReader.html
says, for delete:

"Deletes the document numbered docNum. Once a document is deleted it will not appear in TermDocs
or TermPostitions enumerations. Attempts to read its field with the document(int) method will
result in an error. The presence of this document may still be reflected in the docFreq(org.apache.lucene.index.Term)
statistic, though this will be corrected eventually as the index is further modified."

This is from the delete(int) method rather than delete(Term) but I would
expect that it still holds true.

If you want the deleted documents to really disappear for good, now, optimize
the index.
