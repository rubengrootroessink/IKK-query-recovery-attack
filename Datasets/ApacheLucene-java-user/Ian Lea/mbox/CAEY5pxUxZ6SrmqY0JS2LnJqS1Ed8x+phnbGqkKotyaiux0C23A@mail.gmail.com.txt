I think that passing an empty set or null to StandardAnalyzer should
do what you want.  There are useful tips at
http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#Why_am_I_getting_no_hits_.2BAC8_incorrect_hits.3F.

My guess would be that you aren't using a no-stop-words version of
StandardAnalyzer at both index and query time.
