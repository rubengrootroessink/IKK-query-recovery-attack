SUBJECT: Re: Using analyzer while constructing Lucene queries
DATE: 13 Jan 2009

If you are building queries manually, bypassing analysis, you just
need to make sure that you know what you are doing.  As a trivial
example, if you are indexing with an analyzer that downcases
everything then you need to pass lowercase terms to TermQuery.

You can still use an analyzer where appropriate e.g. to parse a string
into a Query that you add to a BooleanQuery.
