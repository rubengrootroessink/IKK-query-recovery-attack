Hi,
Sorry abt the extremely delayed response.
Consider a situation in which i have indexed the terms under two different
fields (say FIELD_TEXT and FIELD_SYNONYM).
What if I wanted to support queries like
"jaguar NEAR london", when i have indexed a document with
"panthers in zoos around London". So given that Lucene doesn't support 
cross-field proximity, this can't be done easily?

Thanks much.
