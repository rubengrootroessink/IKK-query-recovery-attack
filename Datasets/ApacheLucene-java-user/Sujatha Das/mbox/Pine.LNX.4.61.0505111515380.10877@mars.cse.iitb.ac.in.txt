Hi,
I couldn't find documentation on these issues,
so a url as response should be just fine.

The inverted index must look like
FIELD-1
term -> (doc,offset)pairs

Is this correct?

Say I am trying to index the documents in a corpus under two
different fields. For instance, I want to store with
every word, the term text and its stem, what does the inverted index look
like now?

FIELD1	  FIELD2 
term_text [term_stem] -> (doc,offset)pairs


Or somehow a mapping between term_text and term_stem is stored 
separately is it w/o changing much in the inverted index?

This is probably a very basic question, but any explanation would be
of much use to me. Thanks.
