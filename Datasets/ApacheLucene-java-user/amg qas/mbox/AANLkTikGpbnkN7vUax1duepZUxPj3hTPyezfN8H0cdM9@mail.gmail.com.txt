SUBJECT: Re: Filter documents on a field value while searching the index
DATE: 22 Jan 2011

Hi Eric,

Thanks for the answer.. This does works for me in most cases..

I am actually new to lucene and still getting acquainted to the
various features exposed by it.
When I looked at the API of IndexSearcher I thought that it is the
purpose of the filter class
to filter the returned result set.

So :
  public TopDocs search(Weight weight, Filter filter, int nDocs)
throws IOException {

So my thinking was that there should be some Filter available in
lucene which would filter out
the resultset on match on a field.

I think the reason this functionality is not there in Lucene is
because searching a subset of the
index will be much faster - and this can be specified in BooleanQuery.

However what if I have a use case where I want to score documents on
all the fields but filter
them later on on certian fields ? How shoudl I handle this in Lucene ?
