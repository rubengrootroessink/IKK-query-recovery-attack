Hi Joe,

It might be possible when you append the restriction before parsing the
user query with the QueryParser, but I'm not sure. I recommend first
parsing the query, and then constructing a BooleanQuery with the parsed
user query and the e-mail term both as must. Another approach would be
to use a QueryFilter. Using a QueryFilter might be the best solution
here because the filter is cached, and hence applies very fast on
subsequent searches.

Kind regards,
Daan

I hoped i havent to sanitize the user input cause the email address 
query is ANDed by the
application, after the user finished his input.

(user_query) AND (email_query)

So is it possible to produce a user_query which will ignore the ANDed 
(email_query)?
