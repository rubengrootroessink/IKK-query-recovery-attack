SUBJECT: usage of parallelreader
DATE: 15 Dec 2005

Hi all,

 

Within our application it is possible for users to add reactions for
files. It is a requirement that a search returns a file if the query
matches the contents or a reaction. I think it would be best to use to
different indexes, one for the file and another one for the reactions.
Searching could then be done via ParallelReader. If I understand that
class correctly I have to ensure that the documents in the two indexes
stay in the same order. If I'm not mistaken, updating a document must
thus be done by first deleting the to-update document from both indexes,
and then adding it back to both indexes. If this is correct, then it
would be much easier to implement this scenario using one index and
maybe use the Document update contrib

Could anyone please enlighten me?
