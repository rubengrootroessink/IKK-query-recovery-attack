DATE: 19 Jan 2006

what articles you have read? i work in automatic query expansion and automatic thesaurus generation,
and i use lucene for my tests, but, by now, i don't have excellent results. In a few days
i will have results based in this method:

Concept Based Query Expansion (1993) 
Yonggang Qiu Department of Computer Science Swiss Federal Institute of...
Proceedings of SIGIR-93, 16th ACM International Conference on Research and Development in
Information Retrieval
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/qiu93concept.html

are you interested?

Asunto: information theory based expanded query term boosting
