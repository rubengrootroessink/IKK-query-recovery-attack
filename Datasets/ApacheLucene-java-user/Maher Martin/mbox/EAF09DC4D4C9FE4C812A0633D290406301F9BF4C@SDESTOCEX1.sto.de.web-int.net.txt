Thanks Mark for the tip. I've tried out JCIFS and it's just what the
doctor ordered. I've used NTLM SSO to authenticate the User against the
NTFS file server and then I can filter out the search results returned
based on the user's access rights.

I've completed the authentication and authorization components and now I
have to concentrate on the Lucene side of things (indexing & searching).
I should have a better idea of the performance impact after completing
these. 

If anyone is interested in my solution I'd be glad to share it with the
list once it's complete.
