SUBJECT: DBSight:  Using Java, not Velocity
DATE: 12 Jun 2007

Hi,
   
  Is anyone using DBSight to index a database?  If so, is there a way to just implement some
Java code within my application to do a search, rather than using the Velocity templates in
a browser?  I'd like to use the DBSight web-based admin tool to index my database, but then
call my keyword searches through code...
   
  Thanks,
   
  Lindsey
