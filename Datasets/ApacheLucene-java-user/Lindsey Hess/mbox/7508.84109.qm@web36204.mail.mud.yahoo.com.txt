Hi,

I'm new to Lucene...very new.  I'd like to use Lucene to index a MySQL database (six tables,
actually), and then use it to search the database in lieu of using SQL.  I can't seem to find
any sample code to do this, so I was hoping that someone could share some or point me in the
right direction.

Thanks,

Lindsey
