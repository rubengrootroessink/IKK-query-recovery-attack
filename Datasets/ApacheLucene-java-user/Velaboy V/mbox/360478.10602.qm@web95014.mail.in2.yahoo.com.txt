SUBJECT: How can i restrict search to only some documents.
DATE: 13 May 2009

Hi,

I am new to Lucene.

I have a document repository laid out like this:
\docsdir
   \doc1dir\
   \doc2dir\
   \doc3dir\
    ...

Every docNdir contains several files (xml).

While searching, i want to restrict the search Only to a set of documents (this is because
the user who is searching has rights on only some documents).

What is the best way to go about this?
(I haven't even thought of how index will be created yet...).

Regards,
velaboy
