Found the problem and the solution raises questions.  The problem arose 
from the contents field, which was reader-valued.  The reader is a pipe, 
which became closed and thus the fault.

This raises questions about reader-valued fields:
    * Do they have a life-cycle?
    * Can reader-valued fields be used in situations different from where 
they were created?
    * What causes them to close?
    * Can they be used multiple times, like a String?
    * Can they be reset for re-use?
