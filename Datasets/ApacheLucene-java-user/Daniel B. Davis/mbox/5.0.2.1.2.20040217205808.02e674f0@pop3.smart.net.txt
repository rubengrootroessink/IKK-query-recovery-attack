What would that do?  Each separate index would need to be searched for 
eligible documents.  The idea is to find all qualifying documents held at 
the site, then to prefer certain ones by displaying them before others.  I 
understand Lucene does this naturally using the score achieved by the 
search process. I understand that 'boost' affects that score, and thus, the 
display order. Is this incorrect or inaccurate?  What is gained by a 
separate index?  One separate index? A separate index for each 
sponsor?  What if the same document has multiple sponsors?  In #1 and #2 of 
the original discussion, the maximum sponsored value could be used to set 
the boost, but at different times.
