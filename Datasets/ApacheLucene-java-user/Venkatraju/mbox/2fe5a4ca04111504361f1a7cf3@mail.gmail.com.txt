SUBJECT: Lucene scalability, performance
DATE: 15 Nov 2004

Hi,

I plan to use Lucene in a project. The data to be indexed could get
pretty large (few GBs, with average document size ~ 10-30KB). I have
seen the numbers on the Benchmarks page - but I wanted to hear if
others had something to add. Any tips/hints on keeping the searches
fast enough with such large indexes? Any caveats that I must be wary
of?

Also, has someone evaluated Swih-E vs. Lucene in terms of performance
and scalability?

Thanks in advance.
Venkat
