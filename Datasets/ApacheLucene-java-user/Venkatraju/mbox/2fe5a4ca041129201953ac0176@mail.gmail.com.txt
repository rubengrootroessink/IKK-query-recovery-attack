SUBJECT: Need for periodic full indexing?
DATE: 30 Nov 2004

Hi,

I am using Lucene in a project that will have about 1000 new/updated documents
added everyday. The plan is to build a full index once and then
add/delete documents
incrementally multiple times a day (and optimize the index). Given
this, is there
a need to build the full index periodically, say once a month? Are there any
reasons to do this:
- will it improve performance in any way?
- is this good for stability - any problems like index corruption etc.?

Any thing else that may be of importance in such cases - would like to hear
from people using Lucene in such scenarios.

Regards,
Venkat
