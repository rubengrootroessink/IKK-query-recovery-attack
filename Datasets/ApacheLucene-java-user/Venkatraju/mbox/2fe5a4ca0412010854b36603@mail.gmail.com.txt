SUBJECT: Proximity in ranking, summary generation
DATE: 1 Dec 2004

Hi,

This is actually 2 somewhat related questions:
- In regular multi term queries, does the default ranking function of
Lucene take into account proximity of the search terms? As far as I
know, proximity data is used only in phrase searches. Is this correct?
If so, does someone have pointers/sample implementation of how
proximity data can be used to supplement tfidf in ranking documents?

- Is there a way to get the term offset or byte offset of the best
match(es) in the document? I am looking to use this information for
summary generation/highlighting.

Thanks,
Venkat
