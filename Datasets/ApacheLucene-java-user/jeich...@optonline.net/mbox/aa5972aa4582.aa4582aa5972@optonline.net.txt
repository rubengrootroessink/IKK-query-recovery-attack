I was thinking that perhaps I can pre-stem words before sticking them in a search field in
the database perhaps using Lucene stemming code, then try to use the Natural Language Search
found in MySql 4.1.1.   I am confident the MySql product can't keep up with Lucene yet, but
at least they hvae improved it some.  Not even sure if my hosting company will upgrade to
4.1.1 though.  Still looking for a lot of solutions to make Lucene sit in synch more nicely
with MySql as the main database...aka an easy to use way of handling
