SUBJECT: swapping Lucene's on RAM drive
DATE: 10 Jun 2008

I have not been able to find much information about this, hence this 
question.

Currently I use Lucene through Compass with the data stored in RAM. The 
indexed information is updated daily and therefore I create a new 
Compass/Lucene combination every day, let it load the new data and then 
swap the active search engine (simply assigning a 'global' variable). 
So, all in memory.

I'm not confident what this will do with the memory. In my setupo each 
Compass/Lucene engine gets a separate ram store based on a different id 
per engine:

    ...setSetting(CompassEnvironment.CONNECTION, "ram://" + id)

And this seems to be working okay. However:
1. Is this the correct way to have 2 engines running next to each other 
(while the second one is loading the new data)?
2. After the engines are swapped, is the RAM store of the now not used 
engine automatically cleaned up? If not, how do I?

Thanks for any help!

Tom
