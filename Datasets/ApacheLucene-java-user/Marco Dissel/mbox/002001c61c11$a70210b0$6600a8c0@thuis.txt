Hello

I'm using Lucene for searching in a CRM application. For example when searching for a company
name i want to show similair company names:
search for: "Microsoft International" would return (in this order):
-microsoft international
-microsoft benelux
-microsoft
Currently it would also return companynames that holds "International" but terms that are
heavily used in the index shouldn't be returned..

I need something like a 'reversed top terms value' that is used in the Similarity, but what
should i change for this? and als during indexing?

Thanks
Marco
