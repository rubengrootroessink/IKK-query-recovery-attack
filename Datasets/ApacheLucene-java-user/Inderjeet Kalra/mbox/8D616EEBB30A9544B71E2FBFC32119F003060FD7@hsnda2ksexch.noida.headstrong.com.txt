SUBJECT: Database searching using Lucene....
DATE: 27 Nov 2006

Hi,

I need some inputs on the database searching using lucene. 

Lucene directly supports the document searching but I am unable to find
out the easy and the fastest way for database searching. 


Which option would be better - SPs or Lucene search engine in terms of
implementation, performance and security...if anyone has already done
analysis on the same, can you please provide me the comparison matrix or
benchmarks for the same ?

 

Thanks in advance

 

Regards

Inderjeet
