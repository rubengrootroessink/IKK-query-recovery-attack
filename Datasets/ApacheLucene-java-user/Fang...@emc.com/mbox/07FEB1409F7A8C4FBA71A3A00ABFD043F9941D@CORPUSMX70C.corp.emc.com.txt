Hi,

What do you mean untokenized field?

Are you using different analyzer for different field? If yes, I think
you just use the same analyzer (PerfieldAnalyzer, I guess) for query.

Subject: How to search both Tokenized and Untokenized fields


Hi,

I've been trying to find a way which allows executing a query that
contains
both Tokenized and Untokenized fields on Lucene's index, without having
to
parse the query. I've been able to execute a query which only uses
Tokenized
fields as follows:

   QueryParser queryParser = new QueryParser( DEFAULT_FIELD, analyzer);
   Query query = queryParser.parse(queryString);
   Hits hits = indexSearcher.search(query);

This works fine for Tokenized fields but I'm not sure how to execute a
query
("queryString") which contains both tokenized and untokenized fields.

Any suggestion is very much appreciated.

Rokham
