Hi Grant,
	Thanks for your help.

BoostingTermQuery uses reader.termPositions(term) to get the term
position. In the Term, we cannot put any payload value to find the
result documents. What I want is

Find out all documents which have a specific payload value in a specific
term. We does not care about the value of the term. 

The reason is we don't want to store the binary information as a value
so that we probably can accelerate the query performance by using
payload. I am not sure this is a good reason to do in this way.

Thanks,

Li

Have a look at the BoostingTermQuery.  If you need more than that, you  
could create some new queries using that as a model.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1001.  Note, however,  
that the patch there is not going to work.  If you can help out on it,  
that would be great.
