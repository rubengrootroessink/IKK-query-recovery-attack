SUBJECT: the impact of thousands of field in a single document
DATE: 18 Feb 2009

Hi,

Due to requirement, we need to construct a Lucene document with tens of
thousands of Field. Did anyone try this? What's the performance penalty
comparing with one single field to store all tokens for both indexing
and searching?

Thanks,
Li
