Hi Andreas,
	I am very interested in the multiple index file index/search.
Can you kindly help me on following questions?
1) Why you use multi index files? How much is the performance gain for
both indexing and searching? Someone reported that there no big
performance difference except the number if indices is huge, like 1000.
2) Are these index files located in a single machine or distributed into
multiple machines? 
3) How do you distribute the document into several index files?

Thanks a lot,
Li

Searching on multiple index files is incredible fast.  We have 10
different
index folders with different sizes.  All folders together have a size of
7
GB.  Results come back usual within less than 50 ms.  Getting results
out of
the index i.e. reading documents is expensive and you will have to spent
time here to get a good performance.  You will need to look into
- Topdocs
- Extracting results in an ordered way, i.e. sort by index and within an
index by document id.  This will help to minimize disk head jumps and
gave
me a tremendous boost.
- Extracting only what you need (using a special read filter I do not
recall
the name right now and I do not have access to my sources at the moment
of
writing this)
