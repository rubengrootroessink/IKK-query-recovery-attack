DATE: 29 Dec 2010

I am writing a text editor and have to provide  a certain search
functionality .

The  use case is for single user. A single  document is potentially very
large and numerous such documents may be open and unflushed at any given
time. Think many files of an IDE, except the files are larger. The user is
free to change, say, variables names across documents which may be separate
files opened simultaneously in a variety of tabs (say)  and being edited
with no guarantee that the user has flushed or saved any of it.
