Hi Steve,

thanks for your reply , i know farsi is written and read right-to-left.
i am using RangeOuery class and it's rewrite(IndexReader reader) method
decides if the word is in range or not by compareTo method and this decision
is made by using unicodes.

while searching for "د-ژ" range the lowerTerm is "د" and  the upperTerm is
"ژ". 
And while comparing for the result "ساب ووفر" also takes the first letter as
س and does the comparison for this letter.

 د=U+62F
 ژ = U+698
 and the first letter of "ساب ووفر " is  س = U+633

Esra,
