SUBJECT: Help with indexing and query strategy
DATE: 27 Jan 2006

I'm having some trouble coming up with a good search strategy for geographical data. e.g.,
given:
 
[1] city: London, United Kingdom
[2] city: London, Ontario, Canada
[3] city: Ontario, California, United States
[4] state: Ontario, Canada
[5] city: Vancouver, Washington, United States
[6] city: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
[7] city: Washington, DC, United States
[8] state: Washington, United States
 
and also given the following synonyms:
 
Ontario = ON
California = CA
Washington = WA
Canada = CA
United States = US = America = United States of America
United Kingdom = UK = Great Britain = England
 
for the following queries, I want the listed number of hits '()' from matching '[]':
 
i. Ontario (2) [3, 4]
ii. London (2) [1, 2]
iii. Ontario, Canada (1) [4]
iv. Ontario, California (1) [3]
v. Ontario, CA (2) [3, 4]
vi. Ontario, US (1) [3]
vii. Vancouver (2) [5, 6]
viii. Washington (2) [7, 8]
ix. Washington, DC (1) [7]
x. Vancouver, CA (1) [6]
xi. Vancouver, WA (1) [5]
 
How do I index and store the input (assume that I know the mechanics so I'm not looking for
specific java syntax or how to generate synonyms during analysis) so that I get the desired
results. My current attempt indexes strings like "London Ontario Canada", "London ON Canada",
"London Ontario CA", "London ON CA" -- i.e. every combination of entity name and corresponding
code -- in a content field and creates a type field containing "city" (or "state" or "country"
as appropriate to identify the type of entity being indexed) and uses a phrase query with
a slop of 1 which works really well except e.g. "Ontario CA" for which I'd like 2 hits, but
given the above data gives 3 hits (from 2, 3 and 4, and the problem will only get worse as
I add more cities in Ontario since each results in a hit). The slop of 1 is required since
not all countries customarily use states, and I need to support the user optionally dropping
the state as in the above example of "Ontario, CA" where we don't know if the user intended
the "CA" to represent the state of California or the country of Canada, while "London, UK"
would be unambiguous.
 
The major problem as I see it is that at parse time I don't know if the user is searching
for a city, state or country, and I don't want to force them to specify that.
 
Does anyone have any good ideas to help me solve this problem?
 
Thanks.
