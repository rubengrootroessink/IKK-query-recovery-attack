That's good enough for me. At this point, going with a reasonably stable
branch rather than using my code appears to be the more conservative
option considering our release timeframe (which allows for extensive
testing).

Thanks for the help (and the excellent book).

Trunk of Lucene is very stable, more so than 1.4.3 I've heard.

Is 1.9 release close?  Hard to even say.  It could be.  No substantial
changes to the trunk before 1.9 is officially released are planned that
I know of.
