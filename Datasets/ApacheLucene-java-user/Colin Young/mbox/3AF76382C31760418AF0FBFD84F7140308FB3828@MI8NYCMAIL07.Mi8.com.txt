SUBJECT: OT: how do I connect to the SVN repository to grab the latest source?
DATE: 4 Jan 2006

Normally I wouldn't post this here, but I haven't been able to find any
info about how I would go about downloading the latest source from the
SVN repository. I've got a bit of experience with CVS, but I can't even
figure out where to start with SVN.
 
If anyone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it (we
could do it offline to avoid polluting this list any further).
 
Thanks
 
Colin Young
