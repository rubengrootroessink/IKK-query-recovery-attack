I have thought about that. I couldn't figure out a way to make it work.
Fortunately, I have managed to solve the problem (excepting prefix or
wildcard searches) which is very close to what Rajesh suggested (also
see my response to his response).

Thanks for taking a look.

Have you considered evaluating doc-score thresholds for limiting your
results?  Since the perfect answers to these situations lie in the
constant tweaking and twiddling of analysis and tokenization, one way
I've found to help is to evaluate result scores.  In your "Ontario CA"
example, limiting results to two vs. three vs. four is not necessarily
so important as getting the first results accurate.

Without seeing your test code, I'm guessing that a search for "Ontario
CA"
returns [3] and [4] ahead of any other results.  You could try looking
at the score for each returned hit, and based on some threshold (80-20
rule,
maybe) display what's returned.

Just a thought.
