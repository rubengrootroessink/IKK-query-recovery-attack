SUBJECT: How to index a lot of fields (without FileNotFoundException: Too many open files)
DATE: 27 Apr 2007

Hello,

What would be the best strategy to support an index with thousands or even hundreds of thousands
of individual field names?

I have client applications that create a lot of key/value type data. I use the key as document
field name so I end up with _a lot_ of .f<m> files and
eventually the my application breaks with: FileNotFoundException: Too many open files.

I searched this list and it seems like others had this problem before, but I could not find
a solution.

>From what I read in the Lucene docs, these .f<m> files store the normalization factor
for the corresponding field. What exactly is this used for and more importantly, can this
be disabled so that the files are not created in the first place?

Any advice is appreciated.

Thanks,
Rico.
