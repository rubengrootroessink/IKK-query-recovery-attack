Thanks for you reply.

We are still using Lucene v1.4.3 and I'm not sure if upgrading is an option. Is there another
way of disabling length normalization/document boosts to get rid of those files?

Thanks,
Rico

field norms are primarily used for length normalization, but they also
store field and document boosts ... more info can be found in the scoring
and Similarity docs.

if you don't care about these things, there is an omitNorms option on the
Field class that can be used to not only reduce the number of open
files you need, but also make your index smaller on disk, and reduce your
memory usage. (i believe it was added in 1.9)
