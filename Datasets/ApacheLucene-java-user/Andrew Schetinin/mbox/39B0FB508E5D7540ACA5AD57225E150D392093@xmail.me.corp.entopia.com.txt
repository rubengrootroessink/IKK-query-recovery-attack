Hi,

Sure not. We created another IndexWriter class and modified its function
addIndexes (if I remember the function name correctly) so it will not
call to optimize at the end - that's all.
Having unique segment names was necessary because the segment file name
is used inside the file itself, and cannot be changed on the fly. 

Best Regards,

Andrew

Hi,
Just curious about this:

You just copy your uniquely-named segments in the index directory and
manually modify the "segments" file to list all copied segments?

Thanks,
Otis
