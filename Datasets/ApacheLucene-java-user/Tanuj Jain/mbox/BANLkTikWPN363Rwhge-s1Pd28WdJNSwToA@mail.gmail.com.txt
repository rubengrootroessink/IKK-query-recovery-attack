SUBJECT: lucene 3.1 contrib packages source code download
DATE: 28 Apr 2011

Hi,
Can anyone please tell where I could download *packages
org.apache.lucene.analysis.* *so that I could use them in lucene 3.1
version.
I have *deprecated version* for the above mentioned package. Please tell
from where I could get the contrib packages *source code* for lucene 3.1.
Is there any official website for that? If any please tell.

:)
