Hi,

In the documents which contain the volunteer information :

Doc1 :
volunteer krish
volunteer john
volunteer Raj
...

Doc2 :
volunteer krish
volunteer Raj
volunteer Ganesh

Doc3 :
volunteer krish
volunteer Raj

The documents having ONLY krish and Raj as the volunteers need to be found.
As in above snapshot of docs, the doc3 alone qualifies in the result and not
the first two. Using boolean query I could find the three documents. 

Can you please suggest me some pointers as to how this can be achieved.

-- Regards
Ba3
