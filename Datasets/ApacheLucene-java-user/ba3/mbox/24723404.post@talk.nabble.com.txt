DATE: 29 Jul 2009


Hi Steve,

I went through the article. Thanks for the link. The span query mentions the
position i.e n positions from the terms. The problem was like this :

Lucene was <some more text> made by Doug <some more text> cutting

If Doug is found between the words Lucene and cutting then it is a hit.
[there can be any number of positions which is unknown]. If the number of
positions are known then the spans could be used.

I came across qsol where in the paragraphseperator and sentence seperator
can be specified and string can be searched within the paragraph. 

Can you give your comments.
