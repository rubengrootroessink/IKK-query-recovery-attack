SUBJECT: Multiline Regex with Lucene
DATE: 26 Jul 2009


I was trying to do a regex search with the lucene and
JavaUtilRegexCapabilities.
The code used is :
RegexQuery query = new RegexQuery(new
Term("contents","(?m)hello.*(\r[^#]*)This is to be searched.*(\r[^#]*)#"));
query.setRegexImplementation(new JavaUtilRegexCapabilities());

I verified the regex in : http://www.gskinner.com/RegExr/  [with the multi
line checked]
In lucene though there are no hits. Can you please point me in the right
direction

Regex :
hello.*(\r[^#]*)This is to be searched.*(\r[^#]*)#

Content :
hello world
This is to be searched
#
Test line should not be selected
hello
This should not work
some other lines
#
Not to be selected
hello world
Some lines
This is to be searched
Some lines
#
hello earth
some lines
#
