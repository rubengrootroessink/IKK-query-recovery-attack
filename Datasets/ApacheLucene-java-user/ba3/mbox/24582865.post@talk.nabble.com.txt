SUBJECT: Range query and a proximity search
DATE: 21 Jul 2009


Hi,

Iam having around 100 documents which had undergone revisions. Want to find
out the documents which have undergone more than 40 revisions. The documents
are all text based and the first few lines in the document contain the
revision details. For eg: 


revision 35 
This is a document regarding environmental study of .....
...........
..........

There has been 45 instances in past year when the breach had happened
.......
...........
..........

The volunteers had to spend close to 15 hours to resolve the issue
..........
.........
...........




I tried using :

1)	A query string String q = "contents: revision AND [40 TO 50]" but, the
problem was that if the revision number is 30 and the document had a number
47 in its content then the document is considered as a match. Changing the
string to : "contents:\‚Äùrevision AND [40 TO 50]\"~5" for specifying the
proximity search turned up as run time error.

2) 2)	Using a multiphrase query query.add(new Term("contents","revision"));
query.add(new Term("contents","[40 TO 50]")); did not give the result.

In both cases, splitting the range as "revision AND 41" or "revision AND 42"
or .... yielded proper results.
Can you please suggest me some pointers as to how a range query combined
with proximity be done.
