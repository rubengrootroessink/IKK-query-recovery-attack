SUBJECT: Matching query terms
DATE: 23 Mar 2009

I want to know for each term in a query if it matched the result or not.
What is the best way to implement this?
Highlighter seems to be able to do the trick only that I don't need to
'highlight' any text. After knowing if terms in the query matched I want
do do something else based on this.
