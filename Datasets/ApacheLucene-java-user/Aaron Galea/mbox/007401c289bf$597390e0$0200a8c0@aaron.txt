SUBJECT: Re: Indexing synonyms
DATE: 11 Nov 2002

Hi guys,

Wordnet for English is available for public and can be downloaded from
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/ . If you want to use Java, Wordnet for
java exists at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwordnet but you still need
to use the dictionary database from the former site.

Storing synonyms in the index will definitely increase the number of matches
and it is not that sophisticated but I need a quick but functional solution
with the hope that a likely match between a user question and a stored group
of questions is returned at the top of the list. Surely you can't depend on
this and a question reformulation algorithm is needed to filter through
them. For example the question reformulation algorithm must identify that a
user question like : "What tourist attractions are there in Reims?" and a
stored question like "What could I see in Reims?" are asking the same thing.
But yes you are right this is not a good solution to expand terms in the
index but I am pressured on time. If you want something more sophisticated
is to expand terms depending on the word sense but this requires the
expensive process of building a word sense disambiguation. This will solve
the problem mentioned by Joshua " like 'minute' (time period) and 'minute'
(very small)". However this is no easy task and time consuming!!! Perhaps in
my case doing a query expansion is the best idea and will solve all the
hassle but I am still thinking which way to go.

Regarding the question how things will be stored in the index it is as you
say Otis:
Document1:
   word: word1
         word1synonym1
         word1synonym2
         word1synonym3
But not sure whether I understood your question.

regards
Aaron
