SUBJECT: Searching with Multiple Queries
DATE: 15 Nov 2002

Hi everyone,

I have indexed my documents using a hierarchical indexing by adding a directory field that
is indexible but non-tokenized as suggested in the FAQ. Now I want to do a search first using
a prefix query and then apply Phrase query on the returning results. Is this possible? Can
it be applied at one go? Not sure whether MultiFieldQueryParser can be used this way. Any
suggestions???

Thanks 
Aaron
