Hi 

I am indexing a document but for a strange reason the word "Mayo" is never indexed. The thing
is that in this large document this term appears only once. However if i remove all text from
this document and leave only the paragraph that contains "Mayo", this word will get indexed.
I can't see anything wrong with my code and now I am wondering whether there is an option
in lucene that if a term has a low occurance it will get ignored. Is this is so?

regards 
Aaron
