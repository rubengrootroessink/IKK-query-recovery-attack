Hi Yonik,
Thanks very much for your suggestion. The query boost works great for
keyword matching. But in my case, I need to rank the results by date and
title. For example, title:foo^2 abstract:foo^1.5 date:2004^3 will only boost
the document with date=2004. What I need is boosting the "distance" from the
specified date which means 2003 will have a better ranking than 2002,
2002>2001, etc. 
I implemented a customized ScoreDocComparator class which works fine for one
field. But I met some trouble when trying to combine other fields together.
I'm still looking at FunctionQuery. Don't know if I can figure out
something. 
Any suggestions? Thanks.

Yang

Hi Yang,

Boosting works at query time as well as index time.
If you are using the QueryParser, specify boosts like so:
title:foo^2 abstract:foo^1.5 date:mydate^3

If you are building queries pragmatically, then use the Query.setBoost()
method.

That will boost relative to how a non-boosted query would score, but
keep in mind that you still have tf/idf factors in the score.  If you
need to get rid of the tf/idf factors, either write your own
ScoreDocComparator, or use a FunctionQuery.
