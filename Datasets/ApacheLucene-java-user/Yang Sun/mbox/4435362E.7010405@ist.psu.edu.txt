Hi,

Just wondering if there is anyway to search two indexes with relations 
like in the relational database. For example, in index1 there are fields 
"pid" and "content". in index2 there are fields "cid", "record", and 
"pid". I want to search keyword1 in content and keyword2 in record and  
they should also have the same pid. Is there anyway to do this? Or is 
there any relational database can be integrated with lucene?

Thanks,
Yang
