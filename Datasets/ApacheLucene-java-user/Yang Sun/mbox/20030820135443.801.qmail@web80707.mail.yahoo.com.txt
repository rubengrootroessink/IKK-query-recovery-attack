SUBJECT: Re: Question on Lucene when indexing big pdf files
DATE: 20 Aug 2003

Hi,
    When I use luke to look at my index, it seems all right. The content in the index is well,
all the contents are extracted from the pdf file. I copy the pdf file content (namely "content"
field), and search the keyword, but I can not found the keyword either. I think there is nothing
wrong with the pdfbox program.

    Would you please help me to test this situation. I have three pdf file(totally 100k),
after I index them,  I will get useless results when I ues "cisco" as the keyword. If you
would like to help me, I will send you my test source files and the three pdf files to you.
I will be very appreciate for your help.

When you use luke to look at your index does it show the correct contents
for those documents?
