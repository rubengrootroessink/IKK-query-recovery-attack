SUBJECT: Zilverline release candidate 1.0-rc3 available
DATE: 7 Jun 2004

All,

I've just released a new candidate (*1.0-rc3*) that now supports 
plugins. You can create your own extractors
for various file formats. I've provided Extractors for Text, PDF, Word, 
and HTML.

It's also possible to specify your own handlers for archives. Say you 
have a RAR archive, and you have a program on your system that can 
extract the content from it, then you can specify that zilverline should 
use this program.

Zilverline is an free search engine based on lucene that's ready to 
roll, and can be simply dropped in a Servlet
Engine. It runs out of the box, and supports PDF, WORD, HTM, TXT, and 
CHM, and can  index zip, rar, and many other formats.
Both on Windows and Linux. 

Please take look at http://www.zilverline.org, and have a swing at it.

cheers,

   Michael Franken
