SUBJECT: Zilverline Search Engine version 1.2.0 released
DATE: 14 Apr 2005

All,

I've just released Zilverline version 1.2.0.

This version is fully webbased, all settings, collections, preferences 
can be set via the web interface. You don't need to edit any config
files anymore. Also I'm adding Powerpoint and Excel Extractors.

The source will be made available as well very soon.

Zilverline is protected by a Collaborative Source License. You can read
more on this type of licensing at http://www.zilverline.org

Zilverline is a search engine based on lucene that's ready to
roll, and can be simply dropped in a Servlet Engine. It runs out of the
box, and supports PDF, WORD, HTM, TXT, RTF, Excel, Powerpoint and CHM, 
and can  index zip, rar, and many other formats. Both on Windows and Linux.

Zilverline supports plugins. You can create your own extractors
for various file formats. I've provided Extractors for RTF, Text, PDF,
Word, Excel, Powerpoint and HTML.

Zilverline supports collections. A collection is a set of files and
directories in a directory. A collection can be indexed, and searched.
The results of the search can be retrieved from local disk or remotely,
if you run a webserver on your machine. Files inside zip, rar and chm
files are extracted, indexed and can be cached. The cache can be mapped
to sit behind your webserver as well.

It's also possible to specify your own handlers for archives. Say you
have a RAR archive, and you have a program on your system that can
extract the content from it, then you can specify that Zilverline should
use this program.


Please take look at http://www.zilverline.org, and have a swing at it.

cheers,

   Michael Franken
