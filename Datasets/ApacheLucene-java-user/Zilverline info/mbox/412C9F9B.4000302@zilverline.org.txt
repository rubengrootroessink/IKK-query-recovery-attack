SUBJECT: lucene 1.4 in maven repository
DATE: 25 Aug 2004

Hi,

Can anyone tell me why there is no lucene 1.4 jar in the maven 
repository @ http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/lucene/jars/ ? Who makes them 
available? It would be very convenient to be able to get the latest 
version from there (or anywhere else)

regards,

  Michael Franken
