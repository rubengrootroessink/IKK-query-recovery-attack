Hi,

I am having some problems with the score of lucene. 
I am trying to get the results displayed according to hits.score and it is giving the results
correctly. 
However I do not want the frequency factor to be used for the computation of the score. 

Is it possible to get the score which does not have the frequency factor in it ? 


Regards,
Niraj
