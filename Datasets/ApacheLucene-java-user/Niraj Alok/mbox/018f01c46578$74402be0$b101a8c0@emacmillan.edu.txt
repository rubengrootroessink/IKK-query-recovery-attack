Hi Don,

After months of struggling with lucene and finally achieving the complex
relevancy desired, the client would kill me if i now make that relevancy all
lost.

I am trying to do it with the way Franck suggested by sorting the words the
user has entered, but otherwise, isn't this a bug of lucene ?

Regards,
Niraj
