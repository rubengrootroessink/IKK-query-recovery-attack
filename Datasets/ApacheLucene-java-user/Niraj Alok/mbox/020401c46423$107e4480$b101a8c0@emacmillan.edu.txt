SUBJECT: boolean operators and score
DATE: 7 Jul 2004

Hi Guys,

Finally I have sorted the problem of hits score thanks to the great help of
Franck.

I have hit another problem with the boolean operators now.
When I search for "Winston and churchill" i get a set of perfectly
acceptable results.
But when I change the order, "churchill and winston" the results are the
same but the order of the results changes.

Is it possible to have the same order (hits.score) irrespective of which
term is given before or after?


Regards,
Niraj
