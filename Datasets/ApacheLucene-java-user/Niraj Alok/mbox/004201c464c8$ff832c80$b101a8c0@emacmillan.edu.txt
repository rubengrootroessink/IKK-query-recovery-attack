If i do it by sorting the input before sending it to lucene, it could become
unmanageable to handle and could also throw unexpected results for the user.

e.g . if i type: winston churchill and world war and germany

i could split the string by "and" and get the sorted string as (churchill
winston) and (germany) and (war world) .
this would obviously make the hits.score throw up unexpected results.

isnt there any other solution which comes from lucene itself ? i am using
1.4 final
