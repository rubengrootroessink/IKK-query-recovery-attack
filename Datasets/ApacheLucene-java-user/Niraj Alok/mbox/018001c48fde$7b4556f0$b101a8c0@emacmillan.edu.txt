I was also thinking on the same lines.
Actually the original code was written by some one else who has left and so
I have to own this.

At almost all the places, it is Field.Text and at some few places its
Field.UnIndexed.
I looked at the javadocs and found that there is Field.UnStored also.

The problem is I am not too sure which one to change to what. It would be
really enlightening if you could point the differences
between those three and what would I need to change in my search code.

If I make some of them Field.Unstored, I can see from the javadocs that it
will be indexed and tokenized but not stored. If it is not stored, how can I
use it while searching? Basically what is meant by indexed and stored,
indexed and not stored and not indexed and stored?

Niraj
