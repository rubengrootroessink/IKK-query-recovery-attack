SUBJECT: Unable to optimize index: cannot delete deletable.new
DATE: 30 Jan 2006

I have a periodic process that runs as a timer task that periodically
optimizes my search index.  However, I am having difficulties with this
process failing:
java.io.IOException: Cannot overwrite: C:\04950_04959\deleteable.new
	at
org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.createOutput(FSDirectory.java:317)
	at
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.writeDeleteableFiles(IndexWriter.jav
a:789)
	at
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.deleteSegments(IndexWriter.java:741)
	at
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.access$2(IndexWriter.java:728)
	at
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter$4.doBody(IndexWriter.java:699)
	at org.apache.lucene.store.Lock$With.run(Lock.java:109)

	at
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.optimize(IndexWriter.java:517)
	at
org.apache.lucene.index.IndexModifier.optimize(IndexModifier.java:328)

Why would there be difficulty deleting the deleatable.new file?  It just
seems a bit strange.  Why is this failing and what should I do to
recover?  It is as simple as simply trying again?  I have several
indices that haven't been optimized in three days, despite attempts to
optimize it ever few hours.

I am running on Win2003, web edition, under Java 1.4.2_08.
