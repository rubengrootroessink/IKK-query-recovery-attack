SUBJECT: Boost One Term Query
DATE: 29 Nov 2007


Boosting a one term query does not have an affect on the score.

For example:
apple

Has the same score as:
apple^3

But repeating the term will up the score
apple apple apple

I expected the score to go up when boosting a one term query.  Is that a
wrong expectation?

Thanks!
