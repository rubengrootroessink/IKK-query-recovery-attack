Hi Scott,

I met the same situation as you(index 100M documents). If the computer
has only one CPU and one disk, ParallelMultiSearcher is slower than 
MultiSearcher.

I wrote an email "Who has sample code of remote multiple servers
multiple indexes searching" yesterday. If you have any suggestion,
please let me know.

Best regards.

or using something custom), take top N results from each searcher, merge those, and take top
N from the merged result set.
