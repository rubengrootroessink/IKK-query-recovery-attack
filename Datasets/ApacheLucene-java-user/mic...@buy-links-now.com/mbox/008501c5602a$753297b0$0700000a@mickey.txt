I would go with "Information Retrieval: Algorithms and Heuristics" by
Grossman (a bit expensive, but worth the money
http://www.fetchbook.info/compare.do?search=0134638379).

It's out of print, and is rather out of date... for example, the chapter in
indexing is neat for the early 90s but not necessarily relevant when disk is
fast and cheap.

There's a web page at http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~rbaeza/iradsbook/irbook.html
with a table of contents and some code from the book.
