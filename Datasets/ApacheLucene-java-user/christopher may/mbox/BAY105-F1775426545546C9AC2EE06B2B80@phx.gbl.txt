   I think the easiest way to put it is my first cell will be a term. The 
following cells are then the summary or definition to the term and so on and 
so on. My search needs to find the term by letter since my page has that 
option and then return in two separate columns on the results page the Term 
sided by its definition. Thanks hope you can help.
