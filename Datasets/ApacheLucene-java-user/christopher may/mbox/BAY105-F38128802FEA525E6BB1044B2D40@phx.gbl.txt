I am using text files in my index. What can be used as the new line 
character ? Say I have
A batch of apples <Title> Apples . So the doc is returned as Apples and the 
summary is A batch of apples. If I want to then on the next line of the file 
put A state out west <Title>Arizona. This all blends together. What is my 
default line separator ? Or new line character. Thanks all
