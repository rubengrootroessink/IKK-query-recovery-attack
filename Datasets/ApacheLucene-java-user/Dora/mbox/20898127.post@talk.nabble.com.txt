SUBJECT: RE: Indexing accented characters, then searching by any form
DATE: 8 Dec 2008


It seems that the index and search process does not work in the same way:

The "tokenStream" method is called at time of search while for indexing the
"resusableTokenStream" is called.

Overriding resusableTokenStream (like I did for tokenStream) fixed the
problem.
