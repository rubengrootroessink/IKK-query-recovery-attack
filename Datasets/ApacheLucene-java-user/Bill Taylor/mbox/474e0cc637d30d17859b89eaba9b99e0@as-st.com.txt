SUBJECT: A question about query syntax, has it changed?
DATE: 3 Oct 2006

I am indexing individual pages of books.

I get no results from the query

accurate AND book:"first title"

Each lucene document which represents one page of one book gets a field 
"book" which is indexed, stored, and not tokenized to store the title 
of the book.

The word "accurate" appears on page one of the book "first title" as 
well as in some other books.  I can find "accurate" alone, in which 
case, it shows up from the other books as well.  But if I try to 
restrict the search to the book named "first title," I get no hits.

Am I using the wrong query syntax?  I am using lucene 2.0 and the 
documentation says the query syntax is for 1.9.

When I stepped through the query, the query parser created two things 
to search for, but did not find anything.

It also did not find anything when I looked for

book:"first title"

or

book:(+"first title")

Luke says that there are 50 occurrences of "first title" in the book: 
field, which is the same number as there are pages in the document, so 
I suspect I am creating the index properly but not searching it 
properly.

I got the expected number of responses to

page:1

but when I asked for page:[1 3]

it appeared to find far too many pages.
