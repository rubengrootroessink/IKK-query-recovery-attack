When I googled "java spell check open source" I found

http://jazzy.sourceforge.net/

I have looked at it.

Are you thinking of doing a spell check on the queries people type?  It 
might be better simply to check each word and see if it is found in the 
index.  That will be a lot less work than adapting the spell checker to 
Lucene.
