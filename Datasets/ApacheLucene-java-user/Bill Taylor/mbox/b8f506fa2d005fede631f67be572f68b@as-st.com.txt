IN THEORY, EJB containers are better able than Tomcat to spread 
incoming requests over a multitude of servers.  There was considerable 
discussion some time ago about index search speed on a single 
processor.   I do not remember the details, but there was some 
information about how fast a search might be expected to go with one 
processor.

If that is fast enough, Tomcat should suffice.

My search application has a few short documents so my experience is not 
relevant.
