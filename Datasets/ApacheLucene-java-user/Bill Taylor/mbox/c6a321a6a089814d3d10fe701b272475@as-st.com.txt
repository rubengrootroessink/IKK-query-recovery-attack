It is not THAT hard to write a custom analyzer, that is what I did.  I 
found that there is a bug in the setup, however, in that there are two 
incompatible definitions of Token.  The generated file 
<xx>Tokenizer.java refers to the wrong definition of Token so I ahve to 
patch it before it will compile.

Other than that, doing a custom analyzer is pretty simple.
