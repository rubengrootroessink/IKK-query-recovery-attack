SUBJECT: How many documents in the biggest Lucene index to date?
DATE: 26 Jan 2007

I have used Lucene to index a small collection - only a few hundred  
documents.  I have a potential client who wants to index a collection  
which will start at about a million documents and could easily grow  
to two million.

Has anyone used Lucene with an index that large?

Thank you very much.

Bill Taylor
