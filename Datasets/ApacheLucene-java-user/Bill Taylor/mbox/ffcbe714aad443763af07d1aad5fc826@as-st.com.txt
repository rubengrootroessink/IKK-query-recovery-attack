DATE: 29 Aug 2006

i gave each of my documents a special field named date and I put in a 
normalized Lucene date with a precision of one day.  This date is 
yyyymmdd so that it can be sorted.  having done that, however, I am 
unsure how to ask Lucene to sort on that date, but I'll figure it out 
in time or someone will tell me.
