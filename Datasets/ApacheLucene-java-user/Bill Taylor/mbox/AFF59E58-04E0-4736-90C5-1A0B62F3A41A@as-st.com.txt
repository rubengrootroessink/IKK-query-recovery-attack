SUBJECT: Is the new version of the Lucene book available in any form?
DATE: 26 Jan 2007

I notice that the Lucene book offered by Amazon was published in  
2004.  I saw some mail on the subject of a new edition.

Is the new edition available in any form?

I promise to buy the new edition as soon as it comes out even if I  
get some of the material early.  I wrote a book which was published  
by the MIT Press; I know how long it takes to get a book out.

Failing that, how should I learn more about the internals of Lucene?   
My client has a large code base in C++.  The system has its own index  
which is not all that fast.  One way to improve performance would be  
to convert to the C version of Lucene.

Has anyone build a multi-million document index with the C version?   
Where should I go to start learning about it?

Thanks.

Bill Taylor
