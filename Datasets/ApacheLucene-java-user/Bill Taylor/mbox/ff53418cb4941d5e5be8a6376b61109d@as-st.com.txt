SUBJECT: is there a simple way to make a list of all words in an index?
DATE: 5 Aug 2006

I note that Luke is able to create and display a list of all words in 
the dictionary in descending order of frequency, but I would like to be 
able to get a simple list of all words in the dictionary, preferably in 
a file.  I can clearly modify Luke to do this, but i hoped that someone 
else had already done something similar.

thank you.

Bill Taylor
