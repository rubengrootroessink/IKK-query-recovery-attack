If I use the generated parse exception, I get the message that the 
ParseException which is thrown by next() is incompatible with the 
throws statement in the generated code.  If I get rid of it and use the 
older one, it turns out that generateException cannot generate a 
ParseException because it passes a generated Token instead of the 
Lucene Token.

It appears that the JavaCC I am using is generating code which is a bit 
ahead of Lucene.


So I simply generated a new token of hte roper Lucene type for the 
error message and everything compiled.  Now I have to tell the query 
parser to use the same analyzer and all will be well.

Thanks.

The good news is that Lucene is unbelievably wonderful.  The bad news 
is that Lucene is unbelievably wonderful.

Thanks again.
