None of the criteria you mention justifies the use of a full-text search 
solution. If I were you (but I'm not), I'd stick to a relational 
database for this project. Even if there's a small field or two with 
searchable text data, the database itself could cope with this (Oracle 
Text, MySQL full-text search etc...).

My 2 cents,
Kurt.
