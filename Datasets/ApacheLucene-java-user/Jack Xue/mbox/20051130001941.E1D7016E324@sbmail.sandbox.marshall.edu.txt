SUBJECT: Looking for Similarity Subclass Examples
DATE: 30 Nov 2005

Hello list,

I am working on boosting query performance by writing my own Similarity
Class (Rewrite tf(), idf(), boost(), lengthNorm()). I've gone through the
defaultSimilarity class. Does anyone know other examples of Similarity Class
Implementation and point me to that direction? 

Thanks.

Jack Xue
