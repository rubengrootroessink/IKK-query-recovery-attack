SUBJECT: Better way for use lucene search in ejb
DATE: 24 Dec 2006

I try to use lucene search in j2ee server (generic). 

Problem - improve performance.

- Server works with java 1.4.
- Many ( > 100) call for each client. 
- Index less then 10000 documents.
- Index changed very rare.
- can't use MBean as JBoss.
- can't use java 1.5

1. If use RemoteSearchable and RMI call - degradation of performance.
2. JCA Connector lucenerar - create IndexReader for each client and don't use connection pool.

I think better way use RAMDirectory as singleton object in connector.

What is the best way to use lucene search in ejb and improve performance?

Thanks so much for any help you can give me.
Alex.
