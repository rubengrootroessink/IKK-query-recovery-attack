So indeed the fabrication of the snippet would have to traverse the 200 
pages of plain text per hit. I don't think that pulling the records from 
the database would be the issue..  But I'm somewhat intriqued by the 
options of leaving out the database altogether (for the presentation of 
the hits that is) and store this plain text representation of the pdf in 
Lucene. My worries: how does size (the extra size I would need to store 
the plain text) effect Lucene operations.. Is the order of  N.N or like 
N.ln(N)?
