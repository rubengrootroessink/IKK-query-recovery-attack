SUBJECT: Find version of Lucene library
DATE: 8 Mar 2005

Hi guys,
 
Just a quick query - is there any way that I can determine at runtime the
version of Lucene that I am using?  I'm upgrading a system from v1.3 to
v1.4.3 and I would like to be able to print out the version at startup so
that I can be sure that I have got my paths all correct and haven't done
anything stupid like replaced the wrong JAR!
 
Thanks
 
Paul
