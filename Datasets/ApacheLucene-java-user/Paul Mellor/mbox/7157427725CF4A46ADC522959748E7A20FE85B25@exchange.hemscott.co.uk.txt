Ok, I will change my reindex method to delete all documents and then re-add
them all, rather than using an IndexWriter to write a completely new index.

Thanks for the help on this everyone.

On Windows one cannot delete a file while it is still open.  So, no, on 
Windows one cannot remove an index entirely while an IndexReader or 
Searcher is still open on it, since it is simply impossible to remove 
all the files in the index.

We might attempt to patch this by keeping a list of such files and 
attempt to delete them later (as is done when updating an index).  But 
this could cause problems, as a new index will eventually try to use 
these same file names again, and it would then conflict with the open 
IndexReader.  This is not a problem when updating an existing index, 
since filenames (except for a few which are not kept open, like 
"segments") are never reused in the lifetime of an index.  So, in order 
for such a fix to work we would need to switch to globally unique 
segment names, e.g., long random strings, rather than increasing integers.

In the meantime, the safe way to rebuild an index from scratch while 
other processes are reading it is simply to delete all of its documents, 
then start adding new ones.
