I am very grateful for all your reply and very sorry for my late response.
You can see that I posted my message twice, because I didn't see it after I
posted first and thought it wouldn't appear in the list. So these days I
didn't check my gmail box.  I have figured out that problem. The index was a
mixture of two kinds of index types  that were comprised of  .cfs and
(.tis,.tii.and so on).

The api is open source, I can distribute it to you. I am glad You understand
Chinese. How I should deliver it to you?  Because the api includes a Chinese
