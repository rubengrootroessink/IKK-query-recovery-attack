SUBJECT: Consult some information about adding index while searching
DATE: 27 Jul 2006

I met this problem: when searching,  I add documents to index. Although I
instantiates a new IndexSearcher,  I can't retrieve the newly added
documents. I have to close the program and enter the program, then it will
be ok.

The platform is win xp. Is it the fault of xp?

Thank you in advance.
