Yes, it is. If you study the standard tokenizer
grammar, the dash is allowed inthe NUM, ALPHANUM
token type and your is an ALPHANUM. So, it's OK.

When you escape the dash from the QueryParser, you
insert a character which breaks the token for
the analyzer. If you want to use this analyzer
to have the token types and patterns it provides
(and you badly need the dash in alphanums) don't
use the query parser, build the queries by the APIs.
