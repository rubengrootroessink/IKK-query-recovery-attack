Actually, what I've written was not an analyzer, but a NotTokenizingTokenizer,
as I have a very specia analyzer (different needs for different
field catgories) and this is used in that (the code is far from the
phase of any kind of optimization, but you can see the logic):

---
package hu.emnl.lucene.analyzer;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.Reader;

import org.apache.lucene.analysis.Token;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.Tokenizer;

public class NotTokenizingTokenizer extends Tokenizer {

	public NotTokenizingTokenizer() {
		super();
	}

	public NotTokenizingTokenizer(Reader input) {
		super(input);
	}

	public Token next() throws IOException {
		Token t = null;
		int c = input.read();
		if (c >= 0) {
			StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();  
			do {
				sb.append((char) c);
				c = input.read();
			} while (c >= 0);
			t = new Token(new String(sb), 0, sb.length());
		}
		return t;
	}
}
