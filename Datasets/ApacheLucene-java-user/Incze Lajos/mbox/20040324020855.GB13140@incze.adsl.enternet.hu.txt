I've implemented suche an analyzer but it's only partial solution
if your keyword field contains spaces, as the QP would split
the query, e.g.:

NOTTOKNIZED:(term with spaces*)

would give you no hit even with an not tokenized field
"term with spaces and other useful things". The full solution
would be to be able to tell the QP not to split at spaces,
either by 'do not split till apos' syntax, or by the good ol'
backslash: do\ not\ notice\ these\ spaces.
