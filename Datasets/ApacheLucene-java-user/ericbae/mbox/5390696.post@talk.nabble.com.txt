SUBJECT: Accessing "term frequency information" for documents
DATE: 19 Jul 2006


Hello.

What I want to access through Lucene is this.

I search for documents by inserting a particular query and for each result
that is returned, I want to view its term frequency information.

For example, if documents A and B are returned, is there a easy way to check
which words appear in A and B and how many times they appear?

thank you for your help in advance.
