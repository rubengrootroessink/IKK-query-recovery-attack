SUBJECT: graphically representing an index
DATE: 31 Aug 2006

Hi all,
I'm a newbie with Lucene and I'm looking to implement the following:
I want to index posts from a forum, and, rather than proposing a search
on the contents, graphically represent the contents of the index. More
precisely, I would like to have a list of the most popular words, with a
number next to each indicating how often they occur. 
The icing on the cake would be to be able to click on such a word and
get a subset of the posts including that word. 
Can Lucene be used for this? Has anyone already implemented it? Any
links?
I've dug around a bit without any success, but my apologies if this has
already been dealt with
