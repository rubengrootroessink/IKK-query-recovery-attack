DATE: 1 Sep 2006

Hi Andzej,
Thanks for the tip, it does what I want. You are right, though, it's of limited use for helping
the user access data. But I'm sure it will come in handy for my own analysis.
Best,
Ariel

See http://www.getopt.org/luke for an example of such functionality. 
However, I must disappoint you - the most frequent words in a corpus are 
quite probably also most useless words. For English these are: the, a, 
to, for, by, in, can, I, ...
 So, you will need to eliminate them from the top of the list to get any 
useful results.
