Hello LUCENE Gurus,

	I am very new user of lucene:)) I am building web
portal, my all
date is in oracle tables, and web page is generated by
servlets. In that
datebase I have one table(different articles) with 4
fields. I want in
search page, made with lucene, enter a date and to get
all articles made on
that date. The problem is I dont know is it possible
to make such kind of
indexing? If yes, could you give me guidelines how to
make it? Thank you
very much.

with best regards
paulius
