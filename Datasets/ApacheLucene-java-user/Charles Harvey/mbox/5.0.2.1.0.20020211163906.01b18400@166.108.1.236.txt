SUBJECT: Searching multiple fields in one Index of Documents
DATE: 12 Feb 2002

I have a working installation of Lucene running against indexes created by 
a database query.
Each Document in the Index contains fifteen or twenty fields. I am 
currently searching only one field (that contains concatenated database 
columns) because I cannot figure out how to search multiple fields. So:

How can I use Lucene to search more than one field in an Index of Documents?

eg:
field CATEGORY is(or contains) 'bar'
AND
field BODY contains 'foo'
