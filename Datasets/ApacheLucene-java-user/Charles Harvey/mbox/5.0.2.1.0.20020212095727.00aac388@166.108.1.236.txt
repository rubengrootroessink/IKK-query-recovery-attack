SUBJECT: Re: Searching multiple fields in one Index of Documents
DATE: 12 Feb 2002

Good idea, I had not though to delimit any of the params. I can operate in 
that fashion, but it present a few problems:
All fields would have to be concatenated.
Date (Search by date < or >) would have to be pulled out to java
All IS queries would have to be pulled by java.

This means that I would have to get the entire result set back based only 
on the actual word query, and then sort through the documents turning those 
params into date object, etc - performing an entire extra set of search and 
elimination operations... doubtlessly slowing the whole efficient process 
down to a crawl.

However, if it is the only way...

I looked at the MultiSearcher, but that only seemed to possess the ability 
to search multiple indexes, not fields. I also look at the multi-term 
query, but the constructor for that only takes one term, not an array of 
terms, and I don't see that a term can be constructed that contains 
multiple terms !? I'm a bit lost as to why it should be called multi 
anything in the first place.
