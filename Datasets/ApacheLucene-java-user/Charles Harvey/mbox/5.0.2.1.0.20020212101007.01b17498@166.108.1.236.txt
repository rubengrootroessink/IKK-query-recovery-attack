DATE: 12 Feb 2002

Isn't it standard that if the user wants all words to match they will use 
the AND keyword?  (Lucene supports this) If you want all words to match all 
of the time, why not just split the query with a StringTokenizer and put it 
back together with the + ? That should only be five or ten lines of code...

Or, of course, you could add a checkbox for the user that was labeled 
'match all words' and do the above only in the condition of that box being 
checked..
