SUBJECT: SegmentTermPositions throwing nullpointer
DATE: 1 Mar 2002

We are having some bizarre instances where SegmentTermPositions is
throwing
nullpointers. It only happens on certain queries, but it happens across
different indexes using the same query terms, always quoted. Seems to be

obscure multi word terms in quotes that make this happen.

"randi cohen"  and "wacky tobaccy" threw on a sun box but did not throw
on
a pc.

"java.lang.null exception pointer" threw on a pc

Any ideas, anyone? I looked at the class and noticed that no
nullpointers
were thrown on purpose. I'm not familiar with the lucene code, so I'm
not
too sure what is happening in this process, and the lovely Unknown
Source
doesn't help out too much...
