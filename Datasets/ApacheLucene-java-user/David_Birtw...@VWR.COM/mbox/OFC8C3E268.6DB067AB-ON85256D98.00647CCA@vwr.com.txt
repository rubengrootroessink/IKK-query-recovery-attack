Hi Scott/Eugene,

I don't think that the limitation of 32 required/prohibited clauses is
related to the BooleanQuery maxClauseCount.

The default maxClauseCount of Boolean query is set to 1024.  This
restriction is to prevent a wildcard term expansion from creating a query
with thousands of clauses.  The limitation of 32 required/prohibited
clauses is a different limitation and I believe has more to do with the way
queries are processed at a low level.

Eugene, can you group your terms so that you have less than 32
required/prohibited clauses?  For example, instead of a query that is "-red
-blue -yellow -green", you could do "-(red blue yellow green)" and reduce
your required/prohibited clause count from 4 to 1.

Hi Eugene,

Yes.  Doug (Cutting) added this to eliminate OutOfMemory errors that
apparently some people were having.  Unfortunately, it causes
backward-compatibility issues if you were used to using version 1.2.
So, you'll need to add a call like this:

BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount(Integer.MAX_VALUE);

(Of course, you can set the parameter to whatever you want, but
unrestricted works best for me.)
