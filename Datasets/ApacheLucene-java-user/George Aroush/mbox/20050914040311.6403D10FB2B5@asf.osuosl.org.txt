Hi Jeff,

Yes, I am here but *very* busy -- I expect things to cool off in a week or
so at which time I intend to pickup the 1.9 port as well as the moving of
DotLucene from SourceForg.Net to it's incubated home at Apache.

If you have cycles and you can help, let me know as I am currently the only
one who is doing all the work.

Regards,

-- George

Mayday, mayday....

Has anyone had recent contact with George Aroush? He's presently managing
the C# port of Lucene.

Thanks,
Jeff Rodenburg
