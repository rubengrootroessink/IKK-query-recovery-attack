SUBJECT: RE: Can a Lucene field be renamed in a Lucene index?
DATE: 30 Aug 2007

Just read the thread.  Unfortunately, it doesn't offer a solution.

Is it possible to write a tool that will read the source index, and write it
to an output index with the field renamed?  No, the raw-text is not stored
in the Lucene index.

Thanks.
