Thanks for the reply Otis.

I looked at the CHANGES.txt file and saw quit a bit of changes.  For my port
from Java to C#, I can't rely on the trunk code as it is (to my knowledge)
changes on a monthly basic if not weekly.  What I need is an official
release so that I can use it as the port point.

Regards,

-- George Aroush

I'd have to check CHANGES.txt, but I don't think that many bugs have been
fixed and not that many new features added that anyone is itching for a new
release.
