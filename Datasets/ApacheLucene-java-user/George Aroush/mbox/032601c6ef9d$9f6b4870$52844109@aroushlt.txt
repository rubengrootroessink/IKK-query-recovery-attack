Hi folks,

Sorry for reposting this question (see original email below) and this time
to both mailing list.

If anyone can tell me what is the plan for Lucene 2.0.1 release, I would
appreciate it very much.

As some of you may know, I am the porter of Lucene to Lucene.Net knowing
when 2.0.1 will be released will help me plan things out.

Regards,
