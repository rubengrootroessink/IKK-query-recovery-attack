SUBJECT: Converting SQL statement to Lucene query
DATE: 7 Jun 2006

Hi folks,

Has anyone done or do you know of an API library that will take SQL
statement and convert them to Lucene Query?  I know not every SQL statement
can become a Lucene Query but that's OK as long as the library will
highlight them.

Thanks!

-- George
