SUBJECT: Re: Link map over results? or term freq
DATE: 16 Oct 2008

I guess a link map (as I understand it) is a collection of hyperlinks of
words/phrases where the dominant ones are bolder color and larger font.
Its relatively new schema, some sites are using. 

For example, someone searches for a person and a link map would show
them all the most frequent terms in the results they got back. Sort of
like latent relationships.

Does that help?

I thought this could be done using term frequency vectors in Lucene, but
I've never used TFV's before. And can then be limited to just a set of
results.

HTH,
Darren
