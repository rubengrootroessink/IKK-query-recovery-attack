Hi gang,
   I am trying to trace the 2.4 API to create an InstantiatedIndex, but
its rather difficult to connect directory,reader,search,index etc just
reading the javadocs. 

    I have a (POI - plain old index) directory already and want to
create a faster InstantiatedIndex and IndexSearcher to query it like
before. What's the proper order to do this? 

Also, if anyone has any empirical data on the performance or reliability
of InstantiatedIndex, I'd be curious.

Thanks for the tips!
Darren
