SUBJECT: How to search for "-2" in field?
DATE: 11 Dec 2008

Hi,
  This might be a dumb question, but I have a simple field like this

field: 0 -2 Word

that is indexed,tokenized and stored. I've tried various ways in Lucene
(using Luke) to search for "-2 Word" and none of them work, the query is
re-written improperly. I escaped the -2 to "\-2 Word" and it still
doesn't work. I've used all the analyzers.


What's the trick here?

Thanks,
Darren
