SUBJECT: # of fields, performance
DATE: 2 Dec 2008

Hi,
  I saw this question asked before without a clear answer. Pardons if I
missed it in the archive elsewhere. 

Is there a serious degradation of performance when using high number of
fields per document? Like 100's? Is the impact more on the write than
the read?

What are the performance characteristics with a high number of fields
and is anyone using indexes this way?

thank you for any thoughts.

Darren
