SUBJECT: Indexing Scalability, Multiwriter?
DATE: 10 Oct 2008

Hi gang,
  Wondering how folks have address scaled up indexing. I saw old threads
about using clustered webapp with JNDI singleton index writer due to the
Lucene single writer limitation. Is this limitation lifted in 3 maybe?
Is there a best strategy for parallel writing to an index by many
threads? 

thanks for any tips! You guys rock.
Darren
