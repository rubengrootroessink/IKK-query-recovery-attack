SUBJECT: Strict Ordering of Boosted results?
DATE: 26 Jul 2008

Hi,
  I've looked around a bit and couldn't find an answer to this. I want
to impose a strict ordering on results from a single query where there
multiple boosted terms in the query. 

Let's say I have a field called 'word:'. If my query is

word: termA^10.0   word: termB^2.0

I want ALL termA results (ordered by score) to come before ANY termB
results (also ordered by score). Is there a way to do this in the query
syntax? Or is this simple multiple queries?

thank you,
Darren
