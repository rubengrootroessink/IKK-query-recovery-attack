SUBJECT: "Read timed out" behind firewall - Ports closed? Loopback?
DATE: 26 Aug 2009

When running lucene, on a machine with a firewall, I got the following
error message, which I think it must be related to the firewall. In
fact, when I shut down the firewall, the error dissapears. It must be
something relating to the ports I have open. Lucene says it is running
in port 8875. Is this the only port to open? is it a UDP or TCP port ?
Could it also be related to the loopback?
