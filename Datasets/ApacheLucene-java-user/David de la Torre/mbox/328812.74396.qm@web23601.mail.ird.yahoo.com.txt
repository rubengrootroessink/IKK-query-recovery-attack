Dear Simon. Firstly thank you very much for your answer. I've been trying to debug this problem
for a while and I am a bit at a loss.

I am using lucene as search engine as included in a document management system called KnowledgeTree
(http://wiki.knowledgetree.com/Troubleshooting_the_Document_Indexer)

The authors of KnowledgeTree write that: 

"KnowledgeTree uses a Java-based document indexing service that stores metadata in a Lucene
based search library.
When the document indexer is not running, metadata of documents
cannot be placed in the search library, thereby excluding it from
search results".
So it seems to me that the error could come from this "indexer" from KT or from java/lucene.
The only application I have running on Java at the moment is named KtLucene, which I call 
on the console with: ">java -jar ktlucene.jar&"

I guess that the error comes therefore from KtLucene. And I supose that KTlucene calls Lucene
at a certain moment. Am I wrong? What I still don't know is if the error comes from lucene
itself or from the application - KTlucene. 

>From your answer it seems that you believe that lucene is not the source of the problem.
I have to believe that it must come from KTlucene - the application -. If this is the case,
I will address the issue to the mailing lists of KnoledgeTree.
Thanks again for your help.

David,

I can not follow you. What kind of Lucene applicaiton are you talking
about. Afaik lucene does not use xmlRPC anywhere and we do not have
any dependency on it (Do I miss something?). There is a RemoteSearcher
/ RemoteSearchable in core (until 2.4.1) and now in contrib/remote
which uses RMI and the default port is 1099. But your stacktrace seems
to be something else.

If this has anything to do with lucene-core / contrib you will get
help if you can elaborate your problem further. If this is related to
some other app/project using lucene you might be better asking the
projects mailing-list.
