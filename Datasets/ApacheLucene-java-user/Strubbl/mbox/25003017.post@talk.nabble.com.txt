SUBJECT: filter special chars
DATE: 17 Aug 2009


hi, is there any way to filter special chars like this one: "Ø" out of my
fields I want to index?
until now I tested it with the StopFilter("Ø"). But it doesn't work. When I
search the index with Luke for this symbol I still get results.

Can anyone help please?
