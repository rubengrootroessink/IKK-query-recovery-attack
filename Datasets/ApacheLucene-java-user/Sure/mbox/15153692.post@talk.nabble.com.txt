Hi All,
We are having an index with the fields, HEADING and WRITER.
HEADING is having the high boost factor and WRITER is having a low boost.

Let the data is as follows:

HEADING                                          WRITER

Sachin Tendulkar scored century           XYZ
Australia won the series                      Sachin Tendulkar

Here if we search for "Sachin Tendulkar" in the index, as HEADING is having
high boost, that will be displayed first. But here we want to display the
document with WRITER as "Sachin Tendulkar", if it exact match. If we search
for the word "Sachin", what is working now should remain.

How can we do this?

Regards,
Suresh N.
