SUBJECT: Needs TermFreqeuency from the index
DATE: 6 Nov 2007


Hi All,
We are trying to fetch the TermFreq from the lucene index, using
IndexReader.getTermFreqVectors().

But the problem here is, if none of the fields in the index is Vectorized,
then the above function call returns null. In my index, none of the fields
are vectorized. Without re-creating the index, is it possible to get the
TermFreqVector ?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Suresh N.
