SUBJECT: Ontologies in Lucene???
DATE: 1 Jun 2006

Are there any plans to incorporate new advances in ontology-based information retrieval into
Lucene?

For example, Hobona et al. (2006) present a 3D portal that uses the WordNet linguistic ontology
to search Z39.50 servers. Another successfull implementation of ontology-supported search
is presented by Bucher et al. (2006).

Perhaps some of the ontology-based reasoning in WordNet, Cyc or OpenCyc could be leveraged
in Lucene.
