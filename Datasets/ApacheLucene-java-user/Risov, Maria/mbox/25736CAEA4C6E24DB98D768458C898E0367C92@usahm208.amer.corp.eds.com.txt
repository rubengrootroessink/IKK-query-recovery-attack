Chris,
Thanks so much both for the pointer and the sanity check!

Oddly enough, I read the same Syns2Index piece of documentation as you
suggested very early in the search process.  What I did get wrong was
the actual download package, not realizing that *.java and *.class files
would not be packaged together.  (Typical newbie problem!).  By that
time, I already had the Syns2Index.java file, but downloaded from a
different site (http://www.tropo.com/techno/java/lucene/wordnet.html )
and did not catch that they were not of the same version.  So this time,
I found the Syns2Index.class that came with the latest Lucene package
(http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/ ), made sure it ran
with the corresponding Lucene library...and it worked!  I am still not
sure what happened to my Java environment, but it may takes some time to
figure out.  For the rest of my project, I successfully use the
Lucene.Net port and C#, but it was great to get my feet wet in the Java
case.

Thanks again!

-marie

1) I don't really know anything about Syns2Index - but the errors you
cited don't seem to have anything to do with Lucene ...  your compiler
appears to be complaining about assert statements within the core java
system classes ... which is a little strainge.  you said you are psat
the HellowWorld stage ... have you tried compiling a HellowWorld app in
this current environment (ie: delete the lucene code youv'e got and put
a simple HelloWorld class in the same directory and compile it hte same
way) ???

2) the first link i saw when searching for Syns2Index to see what it was
is...
www.netlikon.de/docs/lucene-2.0.0/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/wordnet/Syn
s2Index.html

...which is how i discovered that Syns2Index is part of the wordnet
contrib and ships with Lucene ... so you shouldn't need to compile
anything ... just use the wordnet jar that comes with your lucene-2.0
distribution.

: I am trying to use Syns2Index utility to convert the WordNet into a
Lucene index.  First I downloaded the latest JDK and Lucene 2.0, but
soon realized that both were too new for compiling Syns2Index.java.
Next, got down to j2sdk1.4.2_13 and Lucene 1.4.3.  by deciphering error
messages.  (I am running XP SP2)
:
: I have copied the java\org\apache\lucene directory in the same folder
as the Syns2Index.java file.  I have a feeling that my classpath is most
likely set right (or at least close), but I get a huge amount of
identical compile errors.
