SUBJECT: Syns2Index utility: version of Lucene and Java
DATE: 27 Nov 2006

I am trying to use Syns2Index utility to convert the WordNet into a Lucene index.  First I
downloaded the latest JDK and Lucene 2.0, but soon realized that both were too new for compiling
Syns2Index.java.  Next, got down to j2sdk1.4.2_13 and Lucene 1.4.3.  by deciphering error
messages.  (I am running XP SP2)

I have copied the java\org\apache\lucene directory in the same folder as the Syns2Index.java
file.  I have a feeling that my classpath is most likely set right (or at least close), but
I get a huge amount of identical compile errors.

Command used:

D:\InfringeDetector\JavaLucene>javac -classpath "D:\Project\JavaLucene;
C:\j2sdk1.4.2_13" D:\Project\JavaLucene\org\apache\lucene\wordnet\Syns2
Index.java

Compile results (posting just a few from the bottom of my screen):

I have to admit that I am fairly new to Java, but past the HelloWorld setups.  I have been
banging my head against the wall and Google for 10 hours.   Please help!!!
