Hi,

A couple of newbie questions. I've searched the
archives and read the Javadoc but I'm still having
trouble figuring these out. 

1. What's the best way to index and handle queries
like the following: 

Find me all users with (a CS degree and a GPA > 3.0)
or (a Math degree and a GPA > 3.5).

2. What are the best practices for using Lucene in a
clustered J2EE environment? A standalone index/search
server or storing the index in the database or
something else ?

Thank you in advance,
PJ
