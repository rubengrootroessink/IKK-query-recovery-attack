SUBJECT: Getting search score in percentage
DATE: 29 Apr 2009


Hi Experts,

We are in a procees of changing our existing fuzzy search engine to lucene, 
but we are facing a roadblock 
here ie, in our existing system we are showing the search score in
percenetage but lucene provides the search score in numbers which is derived
from some internal logic. Can anybody give some tips for converting the
lucene score to percentage or is there any way to retrive the score as
percentage from lucene search. 

Thanks in advance.
