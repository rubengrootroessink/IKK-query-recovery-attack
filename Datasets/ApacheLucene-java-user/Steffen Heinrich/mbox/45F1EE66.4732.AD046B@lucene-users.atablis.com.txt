Hi Colin,

I'm still _very_ new to lucene, but isn't that what the un-tokenized 
indexing is for?
Like in 1.9.1
doc.add(Field.Keyword("filename", "pagefile.sys"));

in 2.0.1
doc.add(new Field("filename", "pagefile.sys", Field.Store.YES, 
Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED));

Maybe this will work as desired?

Cheers, Steffen
