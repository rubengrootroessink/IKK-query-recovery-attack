Wow, this way of data mining is way over my top! I wouldn't know 
where to begin. 

This search is only meant to be used in an ajax-driven web 
application.
And the basic idea is to give the user incentive and turn him to 
something new, something he didn't think of before.
I just generalized on the concept in a mail to Erick under the same 
subject. There is also a link to a working implementation that served 
as my model.

In the wikipedia article on tries I found the following sentence 
drawing my attention:
"Tries are also well suited for implementing approximate matching 
algorithms, including those used in spell checking software."

Do you have any information about how this can be done?

Cheers,
Steffen
