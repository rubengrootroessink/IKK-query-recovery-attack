SUBJECT: Re: Changing the MergeFactor - should I reindex?
DATE: 30 Jun 2006

Thanks Otis.

When two segments are merged into one, are they merged contiguously,
so that the individual .del files for the individual segments will no
longer be needed?  Or are the .del files merged into a single larger
.del file for the new segment?

.del file, I believe the .del file simply keeps track of documents that have been deleted
(and should thus not show up in search results).  Thus, I think you can let the file grow,
although at some point it may make sense to optimize everything - I'm not sure how much reader.isDeleted(docNum)
calls affect performance when the number of documents gets large.... but you'll find out :)
 And when you do, all you'll need to do is optimize the index on the indexing server and push
it to the search server.
