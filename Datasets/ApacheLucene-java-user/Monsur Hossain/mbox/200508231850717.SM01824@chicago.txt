Hey all.  We just relaunched our search feature over here at Xanga.com; the
Blogs, Metros and Blogrings sections are powered by Lucene.NET!  You can
check it out here:

http://search.xanga.com/

This is only the beginning of what we want to do with search and Lucene.  I
want to thank everyone on this list for all the help over the months.  Its
great to see a project like Lucene thriving!

Monsur
