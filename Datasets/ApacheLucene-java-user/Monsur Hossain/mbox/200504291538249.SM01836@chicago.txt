Thanks Chuck, this is all really helpful.  That explicit close() is what
allows the files stored up in "deletable" to eventually be deleted.  I'm
wary of relying on the GC to clean up my work, so I think I'll use that
reference counting system you mentioned.  That way I can be guaranteed that
at some point, my IndexSearcher is in fact closed.  (In my tests, when I
left it up to the GC, these open file handles stuck around for hours).

Thanks,
Monsur
