SUBJECT: Re: preloading / "warming up" the index
DATE: 1 Jun 2006

When Lucene first issues a query, it caches a hash of sort values (one
value per document, plus a bit more if you are sorting on strings),
which takes a while.  Therefore, when our application first starts up,
we issue one query per sort type.  As I understand, it doesn't matter
what the query is or how complicated it is.
