We have the same issue and solve this through code.  As you're
generating the list of IDs for the SQL query, also generate a hash
that maps the ID to its position.  When reading back the data from the
database, read the position hash, and insert the item into the
appropriate position in an array.  Yeah, you're doing the sorting
yourself, but in our case, we're only returning 10 items per page, so
its not a huge performance hit.
