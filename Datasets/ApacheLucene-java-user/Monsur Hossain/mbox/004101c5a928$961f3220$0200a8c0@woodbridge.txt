Otis, we've been continually impressed with the performance of Lucene.
We've been ever increasing the load we are putting on it (from our small
help section, to our slightly larger metros, to our big groups, and then
our gigantic weblogs), and it has meet each of these challenges
wonderfully.  

We are currently indexing only a few weeks worth of data (about a 6.5
gig index)..  I think we can increase that even more and over the next
few weeks I'm going to play with it to find an optimal index size.  At
some point beyond that, we might consider partitioning the index into
chunks so that we can allow users to search beyond just the recent
posts.
