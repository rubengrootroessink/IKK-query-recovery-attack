when deleting by unindexed fields, you need to traverse the entire index,
and introspect each document:

IndexReader reader = IndexUtils.getIndexReader(index);
int max = reader.maxDoc();

for (int i = 0; i < max; i++) {
  if (!reader.isDeleted(i)) {
    Document doc = reader.document(i);
    if (meetsCriteria) {
      reader.delete(i);
    }
  }
}
reader.close();
