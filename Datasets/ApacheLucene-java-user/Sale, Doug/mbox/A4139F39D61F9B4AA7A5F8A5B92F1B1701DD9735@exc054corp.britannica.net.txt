this would indeed be useful, it's something i've considered doing as well.  i'm assuming a
read-only implementation (perhaps with some static method for creating a JAR from an existing
Directory); not a concurrently indexed and searched impl.

does anybody know of such code, or of any limitations that would prevent such code from being
implemented?  would performance suffer over a FSDirectory?

Subject: Index files in jar
 
Hello,

I have a set of index files that I'd like to distribute with my Java 
application. The only way this seems practical is to place the index files 
in a jar file. I tried this, but the search choked when I told IndexSearcher 
the index path inside the jar file ( and placed the jar file path in the 
CLASSPATH ).

Any ideas on wrapping my index files inside a jar file?

Thanks in advance for any help.

-Tom
