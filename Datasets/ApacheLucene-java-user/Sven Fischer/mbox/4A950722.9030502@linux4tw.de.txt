SUBJECT: how to down-weight synonyms
DATE: 26 Aug 2009

Hi,
I implemented a synonym search by using the chapter 4.6's example from 
the Lucene in Action book.
Now I want to extend the example in that way, that synonyms are boosted 
less that the original word the user searched for. Is there a way to do 
it? If it is, I would like to get any help on how to implement that feature.

can anyone help please?


Thanks
Sven
