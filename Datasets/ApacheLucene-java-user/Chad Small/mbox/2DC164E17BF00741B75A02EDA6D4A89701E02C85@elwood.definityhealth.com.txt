SUBJECT: RE: Query syntax on Keyword field question
DATE: 23 Mar 2004

I have since learned that using the TermQuery instead of the MultiFieldQueryParser works for
the keyword field in question below (HW-NCI_TOPICS).
 
apiQuery = new BooleanQuery();
apiQuery.add(new TermQuery(new Term("category", "HW-NCI_TOPICS")), true, false);
 
This finds a match.
 
I found a message that talked about having to use the the Query API when searching Keyword
fields in the index.  Is this true?
 
Is there not a way to get the MultiFieldQueryParser to find a match on this keyword?
 
thanks,
chad.

	Hello,
	
	How can I format a query to get a hit?
	
	I'm using the StandardAnalyzer() at both index and search time.
	
	If I'm indexing a field like this:
	
	luceneDocument.add(Field.Keyword("category","HW-NCI_TOPICS"));
	
	I've tried the following with no success:
	
	//      String searchArgs = "HW\\-NCI_TOPICS";
	//      String searchArgs = "HW\\-NCI_TOPICS".toLowerCase();
	//      String searchArgs = "+HW+NCI+TOPICS";
	      //this works with .Text field
	//      String searchArgs = "+hw+nci+topics";
	//      String searchArgs = "hw nci topics";
	
	thanks,
	chad.
