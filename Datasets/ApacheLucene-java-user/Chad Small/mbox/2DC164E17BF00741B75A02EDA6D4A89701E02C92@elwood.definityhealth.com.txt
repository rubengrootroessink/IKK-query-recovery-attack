thanks.  I was in the process of getting javacc3.2 setup.  I'll have to hunt for 2.x.

	Just get lucenes sources, change the line and recompile.
	The difficult part is to get a copy of JavaCC 2 (3 won't do), but I think
	this can be found in the archives.

	Sure. If \ isn't a token char, it end's the token.
	So you will have to look for a different way of implementing the
	analyzer. Shouldn't be that difficult since you have only one token.
	
	Maybe it should be the job of the query parser to remove the escape character
	(would make more sense to me at least) but that would be another change
	of the query parser...
