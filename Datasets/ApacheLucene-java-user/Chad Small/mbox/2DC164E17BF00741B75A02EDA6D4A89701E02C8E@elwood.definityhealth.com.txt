DATE: 24 Mar 2004

Thanks-you Erik and Incze.  I now understand the issue and I'm trying to create a "KeywordAnalyzer"
as suggested from you book excerpt, Erik:
 
http://issues.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=6727
 
However, not being all that familiar with the Analyzer framework, I'm not sure how to implement
the "KeywordAnalyzer" even though it might be "trivial" :)  Any hints, code, or messages to
look at?
 
<<from message link above>>
Ok, here is the section from Lucene in Action.  I'll leave the 
development of KeywordAnalyzer as an exercise for the reader (although 
its implementation is trivial, one of the simplest analyzers possible - 
only emit one token of the entire contents).  I hope this helps.

Erik

	I've implemented suche an analyzer but it's only partial solution
	if your keyword field contains spaces, as the QP would split
	the query, e.g.:
	
	NOTTOKNIZED:(term with spaces*)
	
	would give you no hit even with an not tokenized field
	"term with spaces and other useful things". The full solution
	would be to be able to tell the QP not to split at spaces,
	either by 'do not split till apos' syntax, or by the good ol'
	backslash: do\ not\ notice\ these\ spaces.
