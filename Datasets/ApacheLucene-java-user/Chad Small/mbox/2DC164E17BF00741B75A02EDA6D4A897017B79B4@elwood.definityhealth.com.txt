Do you mind sharing how you implemented your SpanishAnalyzer using Snowball?

Sorry I can't help with your question.  I am trying to implement Snowball Spanish or a Spanish
Analyzer in Lucene.

thanks,
chad.

Hello

I use the Snowball jar for implement my SpanishAnalyzer. I found that the
words finished in 'bol' are not stripped.
For example:

In spanish for say basketball, you can say basquet or basquetbol. But for
SpanishStemmer are different words.
Idem with voley and voleybol.

Not idem with futbol (football), we not say fut for futbol. But 'fut' donÂ´t
exist in spanish.

you think that I are correct?

you can change this?

Ernesto.
