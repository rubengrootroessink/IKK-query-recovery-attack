Ahh, without the bin on the javacc.home - 3.2 seems to work for me to.

	I'm getting this with 3.2:
	
	javacc-check:
	BUILD FAILED
	file:D:/applications/lucene-1.3-final/build.xml:97:
	      ##################################################################
	      JavaCC not found.
	      JavaCC Home: /applications/javacc-3.2/bin
	      JavaCC JAR: D:\applications\javacc-3.2\bin\bin\lib\javacc.jar
	      Please download and install JavaCC from:
	      <http://javacc.dev.java.net>
	      Then, create a build.properties file either in your home
	      directory, or within the Lucene directory and set the javacc.home
	      property to the path where JavaCC is installed. For example,
	      if you installed JavaCC in /usr/local/java/javacc-3.2, then set the
	      javacc.home property to:
	      javacc.home=/usr/local/java/javacc-3.2
	      If you get an error like the one below, then you have not installed
	      things correctly. Please check all your paths and try again.
	      java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.javacc.parser.Main
	      ##################################################################
	
	even though I put a build.properties file in my root lucene directory with this in it:
	javacc.home=/applications/javacc-3.2/bin
	
	hmm?

	        JavaCC 3.2 works for me.
