SUBJECT: How to order search results by Field value?
DATE: 25 Mar 2004

Was there any conclusion to message:
 
http://issues.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=6762
 
Regarding "Ordering by a Field"?  I have a similar need and didn't see the resolusion in that
thread.  Is it a current patch to the 1.3-final, I could see one?  
 
My other option, I guess, is just to code a comparator on a collection build off of the Hits.
 
thanks,
chad.
