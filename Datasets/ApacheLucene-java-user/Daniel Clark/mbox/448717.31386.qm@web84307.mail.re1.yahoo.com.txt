SUBJECT: Looking for Lucene Job Opportunity
DATE: 26 Apr 2007

I am an independent contractor that really enjoyed working with Lucene on two past contracts.
 The success of Lucene on those programs saved my clients millions of dollars because they
didn't have to purchase commercial software.  One client is currently converting their Google
search to Lucene.  Please, contact me at dclark_lucene@verizon.net if you are aware of any
Lucene developer positions or looking for Lucene developers.  I live in the DC Metro area
and am willing to travel up to 25%.
