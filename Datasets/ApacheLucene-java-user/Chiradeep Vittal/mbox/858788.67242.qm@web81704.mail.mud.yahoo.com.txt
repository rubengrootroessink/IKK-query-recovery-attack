Perhaps the number (dates?) are being indexed in a separate field? Lucene will only search
the default field with the queries you have shown. If, for instance the year was being stored
in the "year" field, then your query should be 
report AND year:2003

Thanks for your help !

Wow, I never expected that many replies. Cool !

I did try to print out the query before and after it gets processed by QueryParser and let
say my query is "2003", before and after it will be "2003". If I put "report 2003" the query
will be, before and after getting into the parser, "report 2003". Problem is that documents
are indexed with "2003" or so Luke says but they are never found by our search engine. So
even if I search "report AND 2003" I will only get results for the "report" token and nothing
for "2003" even if there are 7 documents found by Luke, using the StandardAnalyzer (which
is the one we're using). I would restart a new search engine from scratch, not refactoring
Java to Lucene but using Lucene from the start, but it would require so many modification
elsewhere....
