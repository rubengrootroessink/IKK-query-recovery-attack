Term Frequency in Lucene parlance = number of occurences of the term within a single document.
If you're looking for "how many documents have term x" where x is unknown, see SimpleFacets
in Solr

See TermFreqVector, HitCollector, perhaps TopDocs, perhaps
TermEnum. Make sure you create your index such that frequencies
are stored (see the FAQ).
