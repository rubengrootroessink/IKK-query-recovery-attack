SUBJECT: RE: Does highlighter highlight phrases only?
DATE: 30 Jun 2005

FYI, I made an update to this (I'm the author) to handle span queries.  I
uploaded the updated code to the same bugzilla link.  The code doesn't treat
span queries like phrases - it just highlights the terms individually (if
someone can find a way to highlight it as a phrase, feel free to update it).
