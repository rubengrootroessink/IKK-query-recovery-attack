Happy festivus everyone,


So I have my fancy new stemmed synonym based Lucene index. Let's say I have
the following synonym defined:

radiation -> radiotherapy (and the reverse)

The search results rank all results exactly the same. Is there a way to
Boost the actual search term a little higher than the synonym(s)?


TIA,
Frank
