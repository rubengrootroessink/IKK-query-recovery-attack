To be clear, if someone searches for "radiation" I want content exactly with
"radiation" to rank higher than content with "radiotherapy". But if someone
searches for "radiotherapy", I want content with that to rank higher than
content with "radiation". Will Payloads do this for me?

I would try it but I'm having trouble figuring out how to do the search. For
the search, I'm currently using a MultiFieldQueryParser, so like this:

    SnowballAnalyzer sba = new SnowballAnalyzer("English",
StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS);
    QueryParser qp = new MultiFieldQueryParser( new String[] {"field1",
"field2", "field3"}, sba );
    try {
      Query query = qp.parse(strSearchTerms);
    } catch ( Throwable th) {
       ...
    }

However, the payload example in the presentation requires a
BoostingTermQuery, like this:

    Query query = new BoostingTermQuery( new Term(“field”, “searchterm”));

Is there a way to make the two work together?


Thanks!
Frank
