I agree it's a Java issue. I'm just using the standard Java 1.5 compiler. 

Thank the gods for Eclipse. It suggested the following fixes which compile
for me (note the "<token>" terms added):

import org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenStream;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenFilter;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.Token;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Stack;

public class SynonymFilter extends TokenFilter {
  public static final String TOKEN_TYPE_SYNONYM = "SYNONYM";

  private Stack<Token> synonymStack;
  private SynonymEngine engine;

  public SynonymFilter(TokenStream in, SynonymEngine engine) {
    super(in);
    synonymStack = new Stack<Token>();
    this.engine = engine;
  }
...


Cheers!
Frank
