SUBJECT: Re: Linear search using reader vs. scorer implementation
DATE: 8 Aug 2006

Hi Mathias

I delved a bit further in the lucene docs and the book "Lucene in
action" (Ch 6.1, pp194-201): an alternative approach may be the use of
a custom sort with a dedicated implementation of the
SortComparatorSource, taking as arguments the array of vectors for
which a "distance" needs to be calculated.

As a custom sort operates on a single field, the three Lire vectors
should be encoded in a single fields as well (as far as I understand
the API).

The query could then be the MatchAllDocsQuery query (or for example a
keyword query for having a subset) combined with other filters which
limit the result to sort on even further.

I do not know the impact on performance though, this is still pure
theoretical and based on my (currently limited) understanding of
Lucene and Lire.

Best regards
