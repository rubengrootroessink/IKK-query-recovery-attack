SUBJECT: Re: Document Clustering
DATE: 8 Feb 2005

I would like to be able to analyze my document collection (~1200 
documents) and discover good "buckets" of categories for them.  I'm 
pretty sure this is termed Document Clustering .. finding the emergent 
clumps the documents fall naturally into judging from their term 
vectors.

Looking at the discussion that flared roughly a year ago (last message 
2003-11-12) with the subject Document Clustering, it seems Lucene 
should be able to help with this.  Has anyone had success with this 
recently?

Last year it was suggested Carrot2 could help, and it would even 
produce good labels for the clusters.  Has this proven to be true?  Our 
goal is to use clustering to build a nifty graphic interface, probably 
using Flash.

Thanks for any pointers.

Owen
