Bingo!  I used the InputStreamReader and that fixed the index.  Boy, 
tough to catch all the holes through which unicode leaks occur!

So you got a utf8 encoded text file. But how do you read the file into 
Java? The default encoding of Java is likely to be something other than 
utf8. Make sure you specify the encoding like:

   InputStreamReader( new FileInputStream(filename), "UTF-8");

However, it matters how you have read in the files in your Java 
application. Did you use InputStreamReader with the default platform 
encoding (probably 8859-1), or did you specify UTF-8 explicitly?

By default Luke uses the standard platform-specific font "dialog". On 
Windows this font doesn't support Unicode glyphs, so you will see just 
blanks (or rectangles). In the upcoming release you will be able to 
select the display font.
