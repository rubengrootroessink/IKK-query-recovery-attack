SUBJECT: Out of memory error
DATE: 13 Jul 2006

I am indexing different document formats with lucene 1.9. One of the pdf 
file I am indexing is 300MG. Whenever the index writer hits that file it 
stops the indexing with "Out of Memory" exception. I am using the pdf 
box library to index. I have set the following merge factors in my code.

writer.setMergeFactor(1000);
writer.setMaxMergeDocs(9999999);
writer.setMaxBufferedDocs(1000);
writer.setMaxFieldLength(Integer.MAX_VALUE);

I would like any help and suggestions.

thanks,
suba suresh.
