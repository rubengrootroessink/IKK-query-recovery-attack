SUBJECT: How to combine multiple fields to a single field for indexing
DATE: 23 Aug 2006

In "Lucene In Action" book it says it is better practice to combine two 
fields into one field and index it than use the MultiFieldQueryParser. 
Do I initially index both the fields and then index them again together? 
When I index them together do I index the fieldnames or values? Can 
someone give me an example of how to do it?

thanks,
suba suresh.
