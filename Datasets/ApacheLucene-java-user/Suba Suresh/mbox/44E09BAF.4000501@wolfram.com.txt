SUBJECT: Indexing existing email archives
DATE: 14 Aug 2006

I was looking at "http://www.tropo.com/techno/java/lucene/imap.html" and 
my understanding is it is used to retrieve and index the emails that is 
on the email server. I have some stored emails in folders in my local 
disk and huge list of email archives in another system. Is there a way I 
could index them?

I have to have this working in next couple of days. Any help and 
suggestions are appreciated.

thanks,
suba suresh.
