This is a good point. I was thinking byte arrays, but indeed terms are
Strings, not byte arrays.

Well, it really depends what is your bottleneck. In my application, where
there is barely a handful of numeric fields, this slow encoding is shadowed
by the much slower process of indexing the document itself. Not to mention
that what usually really matters is the speed of the search or sort, not the
speed of the one-time indexing.
