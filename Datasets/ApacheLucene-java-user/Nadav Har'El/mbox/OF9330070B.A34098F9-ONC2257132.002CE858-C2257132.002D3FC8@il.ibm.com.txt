Indeed, WhiteSpaceAnalyzer only breaks up the text on white space, doing
nothing about the case. You should probably StandardAnalyzer which in
addition to breaking up the text on white spaces, also breaks it up in
other logical places (like punctuation, but not in every case), and
more importantly for you, it indexes the text in lowercase.
You should use StandardAnalyzer both during indexing, and during query,
for this to work.
