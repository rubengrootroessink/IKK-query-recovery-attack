I disagree, and frankly, am very surprised that "exact total term matches" is
actually a requirement (I never tried it, so you may be absolutely right, I
just hope you aren't).

Let me give you just one example where id fields containing multiple words,
and the ability for a delete query to match several documents, are useful.

Consider an application for indexing emails with attachments. The email text,
and each document attachment, is indexed as a separate document. When an
email is deleted, we also need to delete its attachments. How shall we do
this? One simple implementation is to have an "id" field for each document;
The email text document will have a unique id, and the attachment document
will have two ids: its own unique id, and the containing email's id. When
we need to remove an email and all its attachments, we just remove all
documents that match the email's id - and this will include the main text
and the attachments.

By the way, the method is called "deleteDocuments" - doesn't that imply
that it's perfectly acceptable to delete many documents with one term?
