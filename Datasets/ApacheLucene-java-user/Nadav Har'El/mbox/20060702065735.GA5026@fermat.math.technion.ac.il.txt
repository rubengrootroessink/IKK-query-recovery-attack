The best thing for you to do without changing Lucene is to use the

	search(Query query, HitCollector results)

method. The collect() in the HitCollector you'll write will do what you
want it to do, and finally call collect() of a TopFieldDocCollector
object that you'll creat. TopFieldDocCollector collects the top-ranking
documents using a given Sort (see its documentation).

This will give you a "TopDocs", not a "Hits" object. But when you know
in advance how many results you want (which is almost always the case),
this is enough for you.

I raised the idea of having a search() method which returns a Hits and
calls a HitCollector, but was convinced that TopDocs+HitCollector is
actually better. See:

Maybe this should be in the FAQ.
