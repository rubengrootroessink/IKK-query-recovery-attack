SUBJECT: NO_NORMS and TOKENIZED?
DATE: 23 Jan 2007

Hi,

When adding a field to a document, Field.Index gives me four options: NO,
NO_NORMS, TOKENIZED and UN_TOKENIZED.

NO_NORMS means, according to the documentation "index the field's value
without an Analyzer, and disable the storing of norms."

What can I do if I want to index the field's value *with* an Analyzer, but
still disable the storing of norms (because the field length should not be
considered in scoring)? Can't I do that? Was this intentional, or is this
an oversight and a fifth option should be added?

Thanks,
Nadav.
