I don't know about the actual numbers, but one trick I've used in the past
to get really fast indexing was to create several independent indexes in
parallel. Simply, if you have, say, 4 CPUs and perhaps even several physical
disks, run 4 indexing processes each indexing a 1/4 of the files and creating
a separate index (on separate disks on separate IO channels, if possible).

At the end, you have 4 indexes which you can actually search together without
any real need to merge them, unless query performance is very important to
you as well.

You need just the counts? And you want to do just whole-field matching, not
word matching? In that case, Lucene might be an overkill for you. Or, if you
do use Lucene, make sure to use "keyword" (untokenized) fields, not
"tokenized" fields.
