SUBJECT: Indexing only newly created files
DATE: 3 May 2010

Dear all,
I am using lucene 3.0 to index the pdf reports that I generate
dynamically. I index the pdf file name (without extension), file path
and its absolute path as fields. I search with the file name without
extension; it retrieves a list, as usually 2 or more files are present
in the same name in different sub directories. As I create the index
for the first time it updates, assuming 100 pdf files in different
directories, the files meta info. If again I do indexing, while my
report generator scheduler has the produced 500 more pdf files
totaling to 600 files in different directories, I wish to index only
the new files to the index. But presently itâ€™s doing the whole thing
again (600 files). How to implement this functionality? Think of the
thousands of pdf files created on each run.

P.S: I cannot keep the meta-info of generated pdf files in the java
memory, as it exceeds thousands in a single run, and update the index
looping this list.

new IndexWriter(FSDirectory.open(this.indexDir), new StandardAnalyzer(
					Version.LUCENE_CURRENT), true,
					IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.LIMITED);

is the boolean parameter is for this purpose? Please guide me.
