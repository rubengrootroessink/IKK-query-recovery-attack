SUBJECT: Re: Indexing only newly created files
DATE: 3 May 2010

dear,
Thanks for you reply Mr. simon, I found it very useful.
I have another doubt, I create the index in a clustered environment (2
physical systems and 2 virtual). A shared system among the nodes is
where this index will be created. The scheduler runs in another remote
system which will create and save the pdfs to a remote file server. Is
it advisable to create a local index and add it the main index shared
by the nodes? Or create a local index and copy it to the nodes?

Thanks
Vijay
