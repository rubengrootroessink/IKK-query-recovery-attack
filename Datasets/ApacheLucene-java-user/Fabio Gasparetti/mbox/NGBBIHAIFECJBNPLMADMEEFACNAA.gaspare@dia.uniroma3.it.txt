SUBJECT: selective-field and score
DATE: 30 Jan 2004

I'd like to have the query score of one particular document,
without cycling all the results.
I've used a "id" field so I can select the doc, then I execute:

QueryParser.parse("("+queryString+") AND id:"+id, "text", analyzer);

But in this way, the obtained score from hits is always 1.
If the id field is dropped, I've the correct score,
but I'm not able to directly select the doc I want.
