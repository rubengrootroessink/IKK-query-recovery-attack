SUBJECT: Not able to search on UN_TOKENIZED fields
DATE: 5 Apr 2007

Hey,

I was just wondering if you are supposed to be able to search on  
UN_TOKENIZED fields?  It seems like you can from the docs, but I have  
been unsuccessful.  I want to do exact string matching on a certain  
field without analyzer interference.

Thanks,
Ryan
