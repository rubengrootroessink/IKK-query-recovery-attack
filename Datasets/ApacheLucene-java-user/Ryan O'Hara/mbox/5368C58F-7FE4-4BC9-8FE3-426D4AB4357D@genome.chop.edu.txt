SUBJECT: Can Field types affect search speed?
DATE: 26 Jul 2006

Currently, I have field "DOC" which is indexed, but not stored and  
not compressed.  This is the field that users query.  I also have a  
field "SYM" which is indexed and stored, but not compressed.  For  
every document returned in a query, I need its symbol.  Can field  
types (indexed vs. not indexed, compressed vs. not compressed, etc.)  
affect search speed?  If so, are my settings the optimal settings for  
my purposes, or is there a better combination of field settings?

On another note, does anyone know how to return the field values  
only, rather than the whole document?  This, I believe, would speed  
things up, but I haven't been able to find how to do it.

Thanks for the time and help,

Ryan
