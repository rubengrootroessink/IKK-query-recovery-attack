SUBJECT: SpellChecker::suggestSimilar() Question
DATE: 25 Jan 2007

It seems that the suggestions returned by SpellChecker::suggestSimilar 
(queryText, num_sug, reader, field, bool) are randomly chosen, then  
sorted.  By altering num_sug (10, 5, 3,2,1), I received the following  
suggestions for "gnetics":

suggestion0: genetics
suggestion1: ginetics
suggestion2: inetics
suggestion3: gynetics
suggestion4: netics
suggestion5: kinetics
suggestion6: magnetics
suggestion7: cinetics
suggestion8: kenetics
suggestion9: kynetics

suggestion0: genetics
suggestion1: kenetics
suggestion2: epigenetics
suggestion3: innogenetics
suggestion4: oncogenetics

suggestion0: genetics
suggestion1: epigenetics
suggestion2: innogenetics

suggestion0: magnetics
suggestion1: gnetin

suggestion0: magnetics

Is there anyway to sort the suggestions prior, so that grabbing only  
one suggestion would give you the best suggestion, in this case  
"genetics"?

Thanks in advance,
Ryan
