SUBJECT: Fastest Method for Searching (need all results)
DATE: 21 Jul 2006

My index contains approximately 5 millions documents.  During a  
search, I need to grab the value of a field for every document in the  
result set.  I am currently using a HitCollector to search.  Below is  
my code:

searcher.search(query, new HitCollector(){
                         public void collect(int doc, float score){
                                 if(searcher.doc(doc).get("SYM") !=  
null){
                                     addSymbolsToHash(searcher.doc 
(doc).get("SYM").split("ENDOFSYM"));
                                 }
                         }
                     });

This is fairly fast for small and medium-sized result sets.  However,  
it gets slow as the result set grows.  I read this on HitCollector's  
API page:

"For good search performance, implementations of this method should  
not call Searcher.doc(int) or Reader.document(int) on every document  
number encountered. Doing so can slow searches by an order of  
magnitude or more."

Along with this implementation, I've also tried using FieldCache.   
This faired better with large-sized result sets, but worse with small  
and medium-sized result sets.  Anyone have any ideas of what the best  
approach might be?

Thanks a lot,
Ryan
