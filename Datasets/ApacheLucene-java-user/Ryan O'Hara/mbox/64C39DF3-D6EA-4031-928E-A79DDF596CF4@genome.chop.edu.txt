You can find the list in StopAnalyzer.java:

public static final String[] ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS = {
     "a", "an", "and", "are", "as", "at", "be", "but", "by",
     "for", "if", "in", "into", "is", "it",
     "no", "not", "of", "on", "or", "such",
     "that", "the", "their", "then", "there", "these",
     "they", "this", "to", "was", "will", "with"
   };

To include additional words, you can use one of the 4 constructors  
that allow you to set the stop word list:

StopAnalyzer(File stopwordsFile)
           Builds an analyzer with the stop words from the given file.
StopAnalyzer(Reader stopwords)
           Builds an analyzer with the stop words from the given reader.
StopAnalyzer(Set stopWords)
           Builds an analyzer with the stop words from the given set.
StopAnalyzer(String[] stopWords)
           Builds an analyzer which removes words in the provided array.


Good luck,
Ryan
