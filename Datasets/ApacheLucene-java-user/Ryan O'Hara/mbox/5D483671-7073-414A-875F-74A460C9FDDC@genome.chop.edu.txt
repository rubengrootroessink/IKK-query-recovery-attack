SUBJECT: Memory Allocation
DATE: 5 Jan 2007

I just started using SpellChecker and I have encountered a java heap  
space exception,  which may or may not be related to using  
SpellChecker.  I was wondering if there is a way to allocate the  
amount of memory Lucene uses during a search?

Thanks,
Ryan
