Another alternative is storing the indexes in the Google Datastore, I think Compass already
supports that (though I have not used it).

Also, I have successfully run Lucene on GAE using GaeVFS (http://code.google.com/p/gaevfs/)
to store the index in the Datastore.
(I developed a Lucene Directory implementation on top of GaeVFS that's available at http://sf.net/contrail).
