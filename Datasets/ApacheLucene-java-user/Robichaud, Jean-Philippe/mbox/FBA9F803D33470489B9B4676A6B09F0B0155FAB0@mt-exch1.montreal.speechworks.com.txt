It may be simpler and more effective to use the Hits object and keep the
number of time each host was actually "returned" to the user and skip it if
the limit has been reach.  This way, if your users just look at the 10-20
highest hits, you will save you a lot of processing time, especially if your
index is huge...

Here is some pseudo code stripped from a class I once wrote


Hits hits = iSearcher.search(myQuery);
IntHash hostFreqCount = new IntHash();

int i=0;
int j=0;

while(i < hist.length) {
 j=0;
 for(; (i<hits.length && j < 10); i++,j++) {

  Document doc = iSearcher.doc(hits.doc(i));
  String host_id = doc.get("host_id");
  hostFreqCount.inc(host_id);

   if(hostFreqCount.get(host_id) > 3) continue;

  ///  show the hit to the use...  

 }
}

 
Hope it helped !

Thanks Tony and Erik for the replies. The trick is we don't know the
hosts that will be returned in advance, we just don't want more than 3
from any one host. It's not unlike searching on Google where you might
see a link that says "More results from foo.com". We essentially want
to discard any results > 3 for any one host. In some of our searches
we might get high scores on 20 or 30 documents, but we don't want to
show page after page from the same host, we'd rather limit it to 3
from each for more diversity.

I may have to use a brute force approach using HitCollector as Tony
suggests. I was hoping to avoid the HitCollector, but there may be no
other way right now.

Many thanks,
-Jay
