SUBJECT: SimilarityDelegator examples ?
DATE: 10 Jun 2005

Hi Everyone, 

 

 I've been using Lucene a lot and I would like to know how the
SimilarityDelegator should be used.  I would like to override only the
lengthNorm member of the DefaultSimilarity and I understand that this is
exactly the purpose of SimilarityDelegator ?  Am I right? Does this class
have another usage?  A simple code example would be fine!

 

Thanks, 

 

Jp
