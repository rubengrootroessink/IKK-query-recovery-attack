Hi Guys, 
	It is somewhat difficult to suggest something useful without more
details.  If you a pretty sure of the quality of the query, then here is my
suggestion:

Index the documents with an extra field called "last_word" that will
contains the last word in the document.  So from your example below :


Document 1: content=ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA, last_word=CAMERA
Document 2: content=ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA BATTERY ACCESSORIES,
last_word=ACCESSORIES
Document 3: content=ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA 0PTICS,last_word=OPTICS
Document 4: content=ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA
ACCESSORIES,last_words=ACCESSORIES
Document 5: content=ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA CABEL
ACCESSORIES,last_words=ACCESSORIES
Document 6: content=ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA OPTICS CABEL
ACCESSORIES,last_words=ACCESSORIES
Document 7: content=ELECTRONICS  DIGITAL CAMERA APPERAL
ACCESSORIES,last_words=ACCESSORIES


Then, when the query looks like: "Digital Camera Optics", you can rewrite
the query: "digital camera optics +last_word:optics"
If this query returned nothing, then search without the term
last_word:optics and sort the results by score and be length...  

Does that help ?

Jp

Hi Guys

The process is correct ,
but It is Impossible to have the optional terms.

The Documents we Index is in millions with similar word trailers .


Any other Ideas , Please advise....

You can ask the user to provide mandatory terms and optional terms and
then combine the queries in a

mandatory : digital camera optics
optional: battery cable

an then create the query: +digital  +camera +optics battery cable

Hope it helps even if I don't know if I undestood your problem correctly.
