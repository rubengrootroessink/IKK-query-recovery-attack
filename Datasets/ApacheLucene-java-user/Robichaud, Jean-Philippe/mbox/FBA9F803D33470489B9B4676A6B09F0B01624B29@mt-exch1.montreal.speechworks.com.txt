SUBJECT: Writting a custom query/indexSearcher
DATE: 18 Jul 2005

Hi everyone.

 

I need a special query type that looks like a phrase query but with special
logic inside (like allowing inversions of certain terms only and not of
others, special score manipulation on certain 'events', ...)  I wonder what
approach I should take?  How does someone build a custom query ?  With
scorers and everything

 

Any help appreciated !!

 

Jp
