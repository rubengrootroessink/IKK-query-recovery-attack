Hi Everyone, 

I've been searching the archive without success to answer this one: is it
possible to specify one similarity class per field, just like we can do with
an analyzer ?  I know I can change the similarity of the searcher, but that
restrict me to break some complex queries into different chunk and sum the
score "by hand" rather than having the fast internal implementation do the
job.  What I would really like is to have something like
PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper but for similarity...  Is this possible ?

Jp
