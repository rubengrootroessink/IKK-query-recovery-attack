The way we do it: we re-index everything periodically in a temporary 
directory and then rename the temporary directory. That way the index 
remains accessible at all times and its currency is simply determined by 
the interval I run the re-indexing in.

On an entry-level Sun I can index about 23 documents per second and 
these are real-life HTML pages. Thus in less than one hour you would be 
finished with a complete index run and save yourself all kinds of 
trouble with crashes during indexing etc.

On my 2 GHz Linux workstation it's even faster: more than 2000 documents 
per minute, so you'd be done in half an hour.

BTW, we're not using the supplied JavaCC-based HTML parser, instead we 
got htmlparser.sourceforge.net, which is a joy to use and pretty fast.
