The way I did it: I'm indexing HTML documents, so before Lucene can do 
anything I need to run a HTML parser. This parser, while scanning the 
tags, builds two text strings at the same time: one that contains the 
document content for indexing and one that contains it for summarizing.

There are relevant differences between those two strings, for example in 
handling of headlines and punctuation. Lucene then gets to index the 
first string and the second is given to a summarizer. The summary it 
returns is added to a Lucene field.

This way I can do summarizing and indexing in one pass.
