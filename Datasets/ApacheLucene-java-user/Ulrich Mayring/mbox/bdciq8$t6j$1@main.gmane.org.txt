I'm not sure what you mean with install directions, Lucene is just a JAR 
file and you use it like any other Java class library. There's also the 
WAR file with a few demos, which you can just drop into Tomcat.

Perhaps you were trying to build it? I just downloaded the binary 
distribution and used it.
