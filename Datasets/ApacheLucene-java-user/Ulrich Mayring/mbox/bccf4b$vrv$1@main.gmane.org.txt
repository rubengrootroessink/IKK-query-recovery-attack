SUBJECT: How to get field contents
DATE: 13 Jun 2003

Hello,

I'd like to build a list with all values from a certain field that occur 
in an index. Looking at the API, there's a method getFieldNames(), but I 
already know the field name, I want to get a list of all the values. 
Also, I can enumerate fields by giving Terms, but a Term means I have to 
have the field name and value.

Can this be done?

Kind regards,

Ulrich
