Well, but if I browse my index I see all the terms stored in the 
original form. I use this code:

doc.add(Field.Text("title","Workers HowTo");
...
// Build and execute Query, so that only the above document is found
Document d = hits.doc(0);
Field field = d.get("title");
System.out.println(field.name() + "," + field.stringValue());

This outputs "title,Workers HowTo" - the untokenized, unanalyzed form.

So, what's wrong here?

cheers,

Ulrich
