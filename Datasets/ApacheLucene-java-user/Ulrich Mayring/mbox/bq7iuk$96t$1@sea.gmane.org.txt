Not very large, but growing daily ;-)

At this point 289 German and 272 English documents (some are not 
translated yet). There are many more files on our website, but only 
these were deemed to contain useful content for the search engine. For 
example our homepage, sitemap and password-protected pages are not 
indexed at all.

The Indexer takes 79 seconds for a full index run on the production 
machine and 36 seconds on the dev machine (identical hardware, but no 
load). We don't bother with incremental indexing, Lucene is pretty fast :)
