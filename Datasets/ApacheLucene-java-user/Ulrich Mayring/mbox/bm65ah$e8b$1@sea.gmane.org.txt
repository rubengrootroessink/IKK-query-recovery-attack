SUBJECT: Dash Confusion in QueryParser - Bug? Feature?
DATE: 10 Oct 2003

Hello,

when I search for "MS-Word" I get all the documents that contain exactly 
that word, which is good. If, however, I search for MS-Word (without the 
quotes), then the MultiFieldQueryParser restructures the query to "MS 
-Word" and I consequently get all documents that contain "MS" and not 
"Word".

Why does the MultiFieldQueryParser insert the extra blank here? Are 
there use cases, where this would make sense? Or is it a bug?

Ulrich
