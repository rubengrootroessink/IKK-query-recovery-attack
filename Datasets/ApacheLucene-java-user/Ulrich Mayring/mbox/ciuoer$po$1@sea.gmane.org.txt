Ok, I did all that and identified a basic case:

If the user searches for "007001 handle", the MultiFieldQueryParser, 
which searches in the fields "title" and "contents", changes that query to:

(title:007001 +title:handl) (contents:007001 +contents:handl)

So, actually it has nothing to do with the wildcard, the problem comes 
from the + modifier - where does it originate? Obviously, this way I can 
never find a document without the term "handle", but with the number 007001.

Kind regards,

Ulrich
