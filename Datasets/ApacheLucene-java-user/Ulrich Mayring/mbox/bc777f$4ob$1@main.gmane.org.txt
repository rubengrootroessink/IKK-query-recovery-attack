Ok, gotcha, I can only get back those fields, whose content is actually 
stored in the index.

Ok, is there a way to retrieve the content of the whole index? If I can 
print it out, it becomes much easier to understand what is going on.

Ok, so I would only do this when searching in time fields or url fields 
or such. In the light of your explanations I think that the title field 
should be tokenized and indexed just like the contents.

Thank you very much for your help,
