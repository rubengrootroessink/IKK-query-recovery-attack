Experience ;-)

If my DB Server is overloaded and everyone knows that, people will not 
come with some less-than-important ideas for additional searches and 
stuff. And if they come I can turn them back. However, once the DB 
server actually has capacity again, flocks of people will demand 
(rightly so) that their wishes be realized now: "Cool, now you can run 
my report every minute instead of every hour."

Not in as far as load increase is concerned. But there are some 
differences you'll have to consider:

SQL vs. Lucene Query Language
Users/Groups/Permissions vs. nothing
Transactions vs. nothing
Vanilla indexing vs. powerful, flexible, customizable indexing
All kinds of APIs vs. Java API
need to write a replicator vs. need to write an indexer

cheers,

Ulrich
