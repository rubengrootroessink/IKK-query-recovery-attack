SUBJECT: Where to get stopword lists?
DATE: 6 Jun 2003

Hello,

does anyone know of good stopword lists for use with Lucene? I'm 
interested in English and German lists.

The default lists aren't very complete, for example the English list 
doesn't contain words like "every", "because" or "until" and the German 
list misses "dem" and "des" (definite articles).

Kind regards,

Ulrich
