Ok, I cleared this up, there was some invisible magic going on in the 
code, sorry for the inconvenience. Anyway:

field1:foo field2:bar AND field3:true

turns into

field1:foo +field2:bar +field3:true


If I lose the "AND" and use a "+" instead, then everything works as 
expected. Now, is this a bug or a feature that I haven't quite grasped? :)
