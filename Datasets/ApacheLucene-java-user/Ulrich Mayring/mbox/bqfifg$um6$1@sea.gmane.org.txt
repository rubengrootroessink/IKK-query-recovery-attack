the same problem right now handling email. i'm not interested in the rules you use as much

The tools... well, Java ;-)

The search engine is a custom Java application, which uses Lucene. The 
heuristics are not very general at this point, they are tailored to our 
domain. So what you are hinting at (a generic rules description language 
to customize to the local domain) seems appropriate. Our rules are 
things like "anything within <h1>...</h1> is an important sentence and 
we add a full-stop at the end".
