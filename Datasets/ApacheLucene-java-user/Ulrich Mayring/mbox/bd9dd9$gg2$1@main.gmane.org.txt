This is a good approach if the number of total documents doesn't grow 
too much. There's obviously a limit to full index runs at some point.

You need to find out where you lose most of the time:

a) in data access (like your database could be too slow, in my case I am 
scanning the local filesystem)
b) in parsing (probably not an issue when reading from a DB, but in my 
case it is, I have HTML files)
c) in indexing

I haven't gone to the trouble to find that out for my app, because it is 
fast enough the way it is.

However, what I wonder: if you have your data in a database anyway, why 
not use the database's indexing features? It seems like Lucene is an 
additional layer on top of your data, which you don't really need.

cheers,

Ulrich
