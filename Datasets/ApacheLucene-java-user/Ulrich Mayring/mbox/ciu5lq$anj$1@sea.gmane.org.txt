But it's OR ;-)

Using AND explicitly I get different results and using OR explicitly I 
get the same results as documented.

Ok, I didn't know that, but it makes sense. Perhaps the phenomenon on 
the live pages is different from my local test installation. I was just 
looking for a comparable case on our live pages, but the real problem is 
in pages that I'm just developing locally and which look similar to the 
number/handle example.

Will do, thank you very much. However, how do I get at the analyzed form 
of my terms?
