SUBJECT: Lotka's law and Lucene
DATE: 22 Nov 2005

20% of contributors does 80% of work. That's how Lotka describes the  
productivity of scientific authors back in 1926. An analysis on open  
source software development show this is equally applicable  
(http://www.javarants.com/B1823453972/C1460559707/E20051119163857/index.html).  
Lucene is used as an example in the analysis. Let's give dnaber an  
applause as he tops the productivity chart.
