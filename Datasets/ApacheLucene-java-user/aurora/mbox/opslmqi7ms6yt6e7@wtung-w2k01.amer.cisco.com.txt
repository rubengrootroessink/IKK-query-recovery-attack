SUBJECT: Re: which HTML parser is better?
DATE: 3 Feb 2005

For all parser suggestion I think there is one important attribute. Some  
parsers returns data provide that the input HTML is sensible. Some parsers  
is designed to be most flexible as tolerant as it can be. If the input is  
clean and controlled the former class is sufficient. Even some regular  
expression may be sufficient. (I that's the original poster wants). If you  
are building a web crawler you need something really tolerant.

Once I have prototyped a nice and fast parser. Later I have to abandon it  
because it failed to parse about 15% documents (problem handling nested  
quotes like onclick="alert('hi')").
