SUBJECT: ANNOUNCE: MindRetrieve 0.4 - Search the web you have seen
DATE: 31 Jan 2005

I am pleased to announce that MindRetrieve 0.4.0 has been released.

MindRetrieve is a desktop search tool to help users to search and organize  
the web they have seen. Download it from http://mindretrieve.berlios.de/.

Everyday we read a large amount of information from the world wide web.  
The truth is most of them does not register. We often search for similar  
topics time after time. It is time consuming. Often after much work we  
find that we are looking at the same old documents like a déjà vu.  
MindRetrieve is here to help you to find information buried deep in your  
memory.

MindRetrieve is a lightweight, cross-platform, open source application  
available under the BSD license. It has been tested on Windows and Linux  
with the latest versions of Firefox, Opera and IE. Mac support is planned.

Finally I would like to thanks the Lucene and PyLucene team for making  
such wonderful software available. Also thanks for all the help you have  
provided in these discussion groups.
