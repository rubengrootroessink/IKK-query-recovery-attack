OK I have changed the process to not doing optimize() at all. So far so  
good. The number of files hover from 10 to 40 during the indexing of  
10,000 files. Seems Lucene is doing some kind of self maintenance to keep  
things in order.

Is it right to say optimize() is a totally optional operation? I probably  
get the impression it is a natural step to end an incremental update from  
the IndexHTML example. Since it replicates the whole index it might be an  
overkill for many applications to do daily.
