SUBJECT: create a single or multiple index?
DATE: 11 Aug 2005

I have two sources of data, let's say one is a set of articles and one is  
 from forum messages. I'd like see the opinion on whether to create one  
single index or separate index for each kind of document.

The user interface is not yet finalized. The search result may be  
presented as separated set or they may be interleaved. The user may even  
be able to set a preference.

I think it is easier to create and maintain separate index. Documents are  
coming from difference source at different rate. in this case the  
IndexWriter don't have to aware of the other. They can even reindex  
independently. On the other hand it maybe easier for the search to be done  
on a single index.

Is there any experience on this issue?
