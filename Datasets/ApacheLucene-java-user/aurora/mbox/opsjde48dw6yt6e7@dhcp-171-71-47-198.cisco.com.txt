SUBJECT: how often to optimize?
DATE: 21 Dec 2004

Right now I am incrementally adding about 100 documents to the index a day  
and then optimize after that. I find that optimize essentially rebuilding  
the entire index into a single file. So the size of disk write is  
proportion to the total index size, not to the size of documents  
incrementally added.

So my question is would it be an overkill to optimize everyday? Is there  
any guideline on how often to optimize? Every 1000 documents or more?  
Every week? Is there any concern if there are a lot of documents added  
without optimizing?

Thanks.
