SUBJECT: Re: auto-generate uid?
DATE: 22 Nov 2004

Just to clarify. I have a Field 'uid' those value is an unique integer. I  
use it as a key to the document stored externally. I don't mean Lucene's  
internal document number.

I was wonder if there is a method to query the highest value of a field,  
perhaps something like:

   IndexReader.maxTerm('uid')
