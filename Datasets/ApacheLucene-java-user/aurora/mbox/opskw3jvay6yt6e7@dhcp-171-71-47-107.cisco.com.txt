SUBJECT: Lucene and multiple languages
DATE: 20 Jan 2005

I'm trying to build some web search tool that could work for multiple  
languages. I understand that Lucene is shipped with StandardAnalyzer plus  
a German and Russian analyzers and some more in the sandbox. And that  
indexing and searching should use the same analyzer.

Now let's said I have an index with documents in multiple languages and  
analyzed by an assortment of analyzers. When user enter a query, what  
analyzer should be used? Should the user be asked for the language  
upfront? What to expect when the analyzer and the document doesn't match?  
Let's said the query is parsed using StandardAnalyzer. Would it match any  
documents done in German analyzer at all. Or would it end up in poor  
result?

Also is there a good way to find out the languages used in a web page?  
There is a 'content-langage' header in http and a 'lang' attribute in  
HTML. Looks like people don't really use them. How can we recognize the  
language?

Even more interesting is multiple languages used in one document, let's  
say half English and half French. Is there a good way to deal with those  
cases?

Thanks for any guidance.
