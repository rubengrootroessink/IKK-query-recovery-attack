SUBJECT: O'Reilly on Native XML Databases
DATE: 7 Apr 2005

I was reading an interesting article on O'Reilly about Native XML  
Databases.

   http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/03/30/native.html

My initial reaction is someone is trying to take on relational database  
again and this time it is a resurrection of hierarchical database.

But as I read on, I find that the domain of native XML database is mainly  
in managing and querying documents. Thus it is more akin to a full text  
search engine that a relational database.

It has some examples on structured queries I find very interesting. I'm  
sure we come across situations where we want to search for documents  
between certain dates that comes from certain website that contains  
certain word. Sometimes these meta data are derived and does not even  
appears in the document.

I wonder what's the best use of Lucene in these situations.

1. Lucene alone is good enough, by structuring the meta data and query  
carefully and by using org.apache.lucene.search.Filter.

2. A combination of relational database and full-text search (as suggested  
in the article).

3. Get one of these native XML database. They are really providing value  
over a full-text search engine.

Just like to get a big picture understanding :)
