SUBJECT: Re: bookkeeping documents cause problem in Sort
DATE: 17 Feb 2005

I found the answer. FieldCacheImpl is trying to look for a sample of the  
term to be sorted to determine the sort type. It run into problem in a  
specical case when the is only a few book keeping documents but no actual  
document with a date term.

I don't seem to remember a problem when the index is completely empty.  
There is probably code to check for empty index but it failed when the is  
actually some documents but they don't have the field to be sorted.
