SUBJECT: Adding documents in batch, how often?
DATE: 18 Feb 2005


I believe the common wisdom for adding documents is to do them in a large  
batch rather than adding individually. I'm wondering to what extend this  
is significant? What would be the difference between adding 100 documents  
a day to adding 10 documents 10 times a day? Is there a lot of house  
keeping going on for IndexWriter.close()?
