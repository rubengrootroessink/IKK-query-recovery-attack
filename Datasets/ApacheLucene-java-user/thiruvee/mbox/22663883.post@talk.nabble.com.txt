SUBJECT: First request for search is taking longer time and subequent requests are very fast
DATE: 23 Mar 2009


Hi 

I am using Lucene 2.4 in our project.
I am using FSdirectory to store the index.
when ever index is updated the first search is very slow.
I am using the combination of CustomScoreQuery and DisjunctionMaxQuery for
searching.
This slowness I observed even when the server (tomcat/websphere) is idle for
quite a long time.

I tried to using RAMDirectory instead of FSDirectory, the response time was
improved, but still the difference the between first search and subsequent
search is there.

Any help regarding this would be highly appreciated.

Thanks
Ravi
