1.5 million in 2.5 minutes gives me 100 microseconds per iteration. (
correct me if I messed up the math. ) I'd be willing to bet the
Long.parseLong() is a significant part of that time because it iterates
through each character. You should profile your code, a simple
-Xrunhprof:cpu=samples should suffice. If the parse is a significant
percentage of total run time, > 30% or so. You can save iterations in
the parse by encoding and decoding using a very high radix, probably 36,
so it would be alphanumeric.
