SUBJECT: Navigate though terms in a document
DATE: 24 Feb 2005

Hi all,
I'm using lucene to store and index documents in a corpus for an
university project and i need to implement the search for concordates
of a given term, this means to find x terms before and after the given
term in each document (for a variable x). I found the method
TermPositions(Term t) for the IndexReader class which gives a
TermPositions used to navigate inside a document, but i didn't
understand what exactly nextPosition() gives out and how to use that
result to find the closer terms (ie using the position for giving back
the term at position position+1, -1, +2, -2, etc.).
Is there some sort of "term navigator"?

Thanks,
Mauro.
