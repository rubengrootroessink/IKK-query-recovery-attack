What about implementing a scoring policy that computes the score based
only on which word position the term is matched? 

If the match occurred in the first word position, the score should be
highest, if in the second word position it would be least highest etc..
Finally for matches that share the same word position, alphabetic
sorting order will break ties.

In this scenario I expect exact or prefix matches only and don't care
how many times a term is matched or its inverse document frequency.

Current parser supports relaxed phrase syntax:

arches

So for query "x y"~10 doc with "x a y" would score higher than doc with
"x a b y". You can control the effect of the distance, programmatically,
providing your own similarity class, especially sloppyFreq(int
distance);

(Doesn't help you much if you already knew all this but just looking for
how to extend the query parser...)

Current query parser (and syntax) does not support this, but see
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/spans/Sp
anQuery.html

and all its sub-classes, especially SpanFirst and SpanNear - with both
scoring takes into account the distance between terms.
