SUBJECT: upgrade to lucene 1.3rc1 to 1.3 final
DATE: 6 Feb 2004

Hi,
Trying to upgrade the lucene1.3rc1 to 1.3 final, I got lots of problem on
the write.lock. Is there any option to set it compatiable with 1.3rc with
"write.lock" created in each index directory. With multiple applications
accessing multiple indices, I really got the problem to make them work
together with the new default write.lock option.
If not, can anyone give me a hint on which files are best to rollback for
1.3 final.
Thx.

Regards,
hui
