SUBJECT: BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses
DATE: 29 Mar 2004

Hi,
I have a range query for the date like [20011201 To 20040201], it works fine
for Lucene API 1.3 RC1. When I upgrade to 1.3 final, I got
"BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses" exception sometimes no matter the index is
created by 1.3RC1 or 1.3 final. Check on the email archive, it seems related
with maxClauseCount. Is increasing maxClauseCount the only way to avoid this
issue in 1.3 final? The dev mail list has some discussion on the future plan
on this.

Regards,
Hui
