SUBJECT: score for MultipleSearcher
DATE: 8 Oct 2003

Hi,
When I use the Mutliple index seach on one large index and one small index,
look like sometimes the documents from the small index get higher score
compared the documents from the big index. But when I look at the score
formular, this actaully should not happen. Both indices were created by
Lucene API 1.3rc.
Any idea aobut this?

Regards,
Hui
