Hi,

The MultiSearcher 1.3 final keeps throwing exception when rewriting query.

java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException
org.apache.lucene.search.Query:combine:139
org.apache.lucene.search.MultiSearcher:rewrite:203

I still use the Query object before the rewriting, so the search seems
working fine.

Does anyone know how to avoid this problem?  Thx. I have to call "rewrite"
in order to avoid the cached searcher's I/O problem.

Regards,
Hui
