SUBJECT: using previous lucene lock with 1.3 final
DATE: 20 Feb 2004

Hi,
To use latest release 1.3 and make the existing application based on Lucene
1.3 RC1 to be back compatible, did little change on makeLock  method of
FSDirectory.java so the lock file for each index is going to still stay in
the same directory with the "write.lock" name. Just add one flag
"traditionalLock", by set the default value to true, the lock file is going
to be created as 1.3RC1. It seems works fine with 1.3 final release.
Does anyone foresee some potential issues here?

Regards,
Hui
