SUBJECT: index on SAN (storage area network)
DATE: 13 May 2004

Hi,
I am getting "not a directory" error when doing search after I moved the
index from local to a SAN box. FSDirectory does not recognize the index
directory as a directory. Any idea? I use JDK142 and Lucene 1.3 final.

Creating the index works fine.

Regards,
hui
