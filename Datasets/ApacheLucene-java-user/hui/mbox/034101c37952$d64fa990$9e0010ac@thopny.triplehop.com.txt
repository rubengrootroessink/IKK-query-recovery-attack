SUBJECT: too many files within one index
DATE: 12 Sep 2003

Hi,
I am using Lucene 1.3 rc released on March.20, 2003.
For some reason, the files in the index directory increase very very quickly
for some documents and reach over 3000 files within half hour and even can
not optimize the index.Then it grows up to 33000 files within one index.
In most of other testing cases, it normally never reach 1000 even without
optimization.

Any idea about this?

regards,
Hui
