SUBJECT: exact the same score from different documents
DATE: 14 May 2004

Hi,

I am getting the exactly same score like 0. 04809519 for different size
documents for some queries and this happens quite frequently. Based on the
score formula, it seems this should rarely happen. Or I misunderstand the
formula?

Regards,
Hui
