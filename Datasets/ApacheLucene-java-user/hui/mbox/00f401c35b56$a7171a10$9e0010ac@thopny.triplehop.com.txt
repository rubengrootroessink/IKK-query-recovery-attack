DATE: 5 Aug 2003

I tried this before with 1.3rc1. The query parser still uses "OR" rather
than "AND" as default even after I set the operator to AND.
I found this issue had been reported before but no answer for it.

Any idea to solve the issue?

QueryParser, at least in Lucene's CVS, supports an attribute to toggle
this capability.

   QueryParser.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND)
