I got same problem when upgrading from 1.2 to 1.3RC1. Upgrading to JDK1.3.1
up solved the problem. It may work for you too.

$ java -version
java version "1.3.0_02"

$ uname -a
SunOS qadyn1i.looksmart.com 5.8 Generic_108528-20 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-250

I entered a bug into BugZilla, but curiously it doesn't allow me to enter a
bug against 1.3-final -- so I chose "unspecified". Bug 27174. This is my
first bug post, so please let me know if you need more detail.

I've attached the source to this message as well.

thanks,
Michael
