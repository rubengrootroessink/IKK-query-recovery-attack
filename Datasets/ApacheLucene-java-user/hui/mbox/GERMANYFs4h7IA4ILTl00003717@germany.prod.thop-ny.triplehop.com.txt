Not yet. For the compound file format, when the files get bigger, if I add
few new files frequently, the bigger files has to be updated. Will that
affect lot on the search and produce heavier disk I/O compared with the
traditional index format? It seems OS cache makes quite difference when the
files not changed differently.

Hui

Have you tried using the compound file format introduced in 1.3?
