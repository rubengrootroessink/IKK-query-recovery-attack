Hi,
I did the testing on searching/indexing larger documents for the two index
formats. The indexing application indices the 66k documents incrementally up
to 10 times. At the same time, the search program wakes every 20 minutes to
open the index and do the search.

For the indexing, when indexing on the 9th 66k document, the compound index
case need 500 seconds more but it could be the machine is running other
schedule jobs. (I run the non-compound index case immediately after compound
index case; the first 66k for non-compound index also needs 300-400 seconds
more). So the index speed difference is within 10%.
There is no too much difference on the search itself. But for the compound
index case, the opening index reaches around 1 second twice. I saw this
happened for non-compound index format before, but it looks like compound
index format has higher frequency on this issue.


Regards,
Hui

Thanks for performing this benchmark!

It looks like the compound format is around 7% slower when indexing.  To 
my thinking that's acceptable, given the dramatic reduction in file 
handles.  If folks really need maximal indexing performance, then they 
can explicitly disable the compound format.

Would anyone object to making compound format the default for Lucene 
1.4?  This is an incompatible change, but I don't think it should break 
applications.
