Anoterh similar issue. If we could have a parameter to control the max
number of the files within the index, that is going to avoid the problem of
running of the file handler issue.
When the file number within one index reaches the limit, optimization is
going to be called.
Right now, if the file number within one index out of the limit of your
window system, you lost the index.
Thank you for the consideration.

Regards,
hui

Sure, that's reasonable, so this would be something like:

private static final int DEFAULT_MERGE_FACTOR =
 
Integer.parseInt(System.getProperty("org.apache.lucene.mergeFactor","10"));

In IndexWriter.java.

What other candidates are there for this treatment?
