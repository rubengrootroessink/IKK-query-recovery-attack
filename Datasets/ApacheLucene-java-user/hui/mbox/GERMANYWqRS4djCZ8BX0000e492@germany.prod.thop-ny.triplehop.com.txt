Thank you very much for the suggestion, Otis.
I did write a test program to check whether the directory is a directory.
But I did not test it within the web application. It is related with tomcat
security or the SAN setup. I need to figure out.

Regards,
Hui

My guess would be that you just have a wrong path to the index
directory somewhere.  You can add your own checks to your own code,
before you create IndexSearcher/Reader.

Something like:
if (new File(/path/to/your/index/dir).isDirectory()) - ok, else not ok
;)
