Hi Steve,

MyLevel3Field?

Well, the hierarchical structure needs to be maintained. As hundreds of 
Level_X entities can be found on levels 2 and 3, I need to be able to 
tell for instance which Level_3 entities belong to which common Level_2 
entity. Throwing all Level_3 entities in a field of their own would 
remove this information, as far as I can see.

I was also thinking about adding Payloads at some point, but the main 
caveat here is that the Payload data cannot be tested for equality at 
search time. E.g. if I have a term T1 and add a payload that states this 
term belongs to Level_3:200;Level_2:65;Level_1:44 and I have a term T2 
with Level_3:200;Level_2:66;Level_1:44 I cannot state at search time 
that I would like the number for Level_2 entities to be the same. I 
could say Level_2 has to be 65, but I don't now that beforehand of 
course. Or am I overlooking something here?

I guess my initial pseudo-XML construct might have been misleading, my 
apologies. To be more precise, it is like this:

<!ELEMENT MyField (Level_1+) >
<!ELEMENT Level_1 (Level_2+) >
<!ELEMENT Level_2 (Level_3+) >
<!ELEMENT Level_3 (Terms+) >
<!ELEMENT Terms (#PCDATA) >

What I am adding to Lucene is a single Field MyField. I preprocess the 
input string so that it looks like "Term1 Term2 endOfLevel_3 Term3 Term4 
endOfLevel_3 Term4 Term5 endOfLevel_3 endOfLevel_2 Term8 Term9 
endOfLevel_3 ...". Note the appearance of Level_2.

I use a custom Filter to switch the position increment as needed and as 
indicated by the marker tokens. The marker tokens themselves don't get 
indexed.

Cheers
Rene
