SUBJECT: Re: "Deleting" documents without deleting them
DATE: 16 Mar 2010

Hi Daniel,

Unless you have only a few documents and a small index, I don't think 
never calling optimize is going to be a means you should rely upon.

What about if you reindexed the documents you are deleting, adding a 
field <excludeFromSearch> with the value "true"? This would imply that 
either

1) all fields are stored, so you may retrieve them from the original doc 
and add them to the new one plus the exclusion field
2) or if a lot of fields are only indexed you'd need access to the 
original source. (With limitations it is also possible to reconstruct a 
field from indexed data only, but not generally recommendable)

During search, just add "NOT excludeFromSearch:true" to the query.

If you need to keep track of which versions belong together, you may 
need to think about how you uniquely identify documents, how this 
changes between versions, and if the update dates might be of any help.

Cheers
Rene
