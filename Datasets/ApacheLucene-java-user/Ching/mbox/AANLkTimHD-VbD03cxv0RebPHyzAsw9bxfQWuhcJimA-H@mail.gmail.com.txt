SUBJECT: Indexing is hung or doesn't complete

Hi All,

Can anyone help with this issue? I have about 2000 pdf files that I use
PDFBox to extract its text, then index them using for loop. The indexing
stopped after the fdt file reaches at 7,061 KB in size. There is no error,
the indexing simply stopped.  Thanks in advance for any help.

Ching
