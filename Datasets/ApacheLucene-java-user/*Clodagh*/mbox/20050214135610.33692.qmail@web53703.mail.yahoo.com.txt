DATE: 14 Feb 2005


hi

is it possible to show a tf idf score beside each hit 

Eg i type in a word as a query for example the word
"free" and each file with the word free is named but i
would like the tf idf score to appear beside it?

like this

0. file1.txt tf idf score = 2.16543

is it possible??
