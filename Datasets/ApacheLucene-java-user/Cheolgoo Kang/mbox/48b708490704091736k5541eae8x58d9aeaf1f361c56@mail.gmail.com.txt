Thanks Otis,

I've already made some modification to get the number of deleted docs
in IndexWriter.docCount() and using it. It's works great but the
problem is not being aware of deletes within IndexWriter itself. I
have to re-open the IndexWriter to get the updated number of deletes.
Haha! (It's fine cause my index is almost read-only.)

Anyway, I think it's name or functionality of a method should be
consistent through IndexReader, IndexWriter, IndexModifier, etc.
That's just what I've asked before.

aware of deletes, but will that help you?
