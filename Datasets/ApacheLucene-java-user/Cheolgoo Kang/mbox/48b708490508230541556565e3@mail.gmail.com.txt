SUBJECT: Re: Why is delete() part of IndexREADER?
DATE: 23 Aug 2005

It's because of Lucene's index structure. IndexWriter creates a new
segment(one Lucene index is composed of several segments) when a
document added and doesn't care about old indexes already exist. So,
IndexWriter should not have delete() operation for old indexes. And
so, the IndexReader have control of read and delete over all the
documents indexed before.
