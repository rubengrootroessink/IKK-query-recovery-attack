SUBJECT: Why is the constructor of TopFieldDocs not public?
DATE: 24 Feb 2009

I'm subclassing MultiSearcher and writing a customized searcher on my own.

The search( Weight, Filter, int, Sort ) method on MultiSearcher should
return TopFieldDocs, but I cannot instantiate one cause TopFieldDocs
constructor is declared as package-private. (TopFieldDocs itself is
public!)

Is there any reason the constructor of TopFieldDocs has no modifier declaration?
