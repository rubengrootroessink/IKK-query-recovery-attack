Keywords.setKeyword(String) could've been able to stack all the
keywords set by the digester. So, setKeyword(String) method should be
written like below using java.util.List:

    public static class KeyWords
    {
        private String lineNum;
        private List<String> kw = new LinkedList<String>();

        public void setLineNum(String newLineNum)
        {
            lineNum = newLineNum;
        }
        public String getLineNum()
        {
            return lineNum;
        }

        public void setKeyWord(String newKW)
        {
            kw.add( newKW );
        }
        public List<String> getKeyWordList()
        {
            return kw;
        }
    }

So, you have to change the IndexKeyWords.addKeywords(Keywords) method
to handle the 'list' of keywords read from xml file. It'll solve the
'reading several elements from xml file' problem.

And make sure you care about those keywords with two or more words.
StandardAnalyzer will split all the words in one keyword if they are
separated by whitespace. Then you'll have to use PhraseQuery or span
queries to search a exact phrase like "controlled hypertension".
