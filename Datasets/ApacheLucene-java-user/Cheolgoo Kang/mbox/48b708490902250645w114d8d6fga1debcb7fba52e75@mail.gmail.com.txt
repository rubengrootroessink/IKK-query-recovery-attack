SUBJECT: Re: Why is the constructor of TopFieldDocs not public?
DATE: 25 Feb 2009

Here are two package-private issues I've met. But I could find
workarounds on these issues easily.

o.a.l.search.FieldDocSortedHitQueue
o.a.l.search.HitQueue

I think any of package-private methods of those two class should be public.
