The number(aka doc-id) is given by lucene and is it's an internal sequential
integer. This number is usually retrieved from Hits.id(int) of your search.

Hits myHits = myIndexSearcher.search( myQuery );
for ( int i=0; i<myHits.length(); i++ ) {
  Document doc = myHits.doc( myHits.id( i ) );
  // myHits.id( i ) retrieves the i-th doc-id and
  // myHits.doc( myHits.id( i ) ) returns the desired i-th document
  // in the result myHits.
}
