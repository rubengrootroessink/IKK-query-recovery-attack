I think it's possible to make a field encrypted by an symmetric encryption
algorithms just the same as the compressed field and algorithms such like
DES can be used with little performance loss.

If the ability to block reverse engineering is critical, you should use PKI
and would result more and more performance loss than those symmectic
methods.
