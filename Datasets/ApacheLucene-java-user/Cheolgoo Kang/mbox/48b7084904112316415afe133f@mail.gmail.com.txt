No, you cannot add additional data (or modify) to previously added document.
It's easy to delete the old one from the index and add a new document with
additional data included.

Usually you search using IndexSearcher and it's resulting Hits has the doc-id
(the number) in that index. And the Document contains the list of
(stored) fields.
