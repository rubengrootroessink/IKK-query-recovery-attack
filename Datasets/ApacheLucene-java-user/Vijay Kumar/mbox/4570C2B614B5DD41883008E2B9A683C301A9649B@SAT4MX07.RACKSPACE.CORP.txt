SUBJECT: Problem compiling with JBoss portal server
DATE: 14 Sep 2007

Hello all, 

 

I ran into an issue "can not resolve symbol" while compiling my class
that uses MultiFieldQueryParser class. It turns out that the version of
Jboss portal 2.6 Beta 1 that we are using includes a portal-cms.sar that
has the older version of lucene.jar, This version does not have the
MultiFieldQueryParser constructor that takes 3 params. 

 

Problem should be fixed with moving to a newer version of the Jboss
portal or replacing the lucene.jar with the newer version of lucene.jar
in the portal-cms.sar/lib folder. 

 

Vijay Kumar,
