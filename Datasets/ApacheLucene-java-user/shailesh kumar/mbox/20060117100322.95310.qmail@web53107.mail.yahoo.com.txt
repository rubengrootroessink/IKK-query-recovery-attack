   This question is based on the file format document. http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/fileformats.html
 
 The following is my understanding. Is this correct
 
 1) The .frq file is the most important file and that is where we get the mapping of terms
to documents.
 
 2) The .prx file is used for answering queries like find docs that contain  Term A and Term
B kind of queries.
 
 3) The .tvx, .tvd and the .tvf files will not be created by default. you need to set the
storeTermVector as true. I am not able to appreciate the usefulness of the the information
stored in tv[x,d,f] files.
