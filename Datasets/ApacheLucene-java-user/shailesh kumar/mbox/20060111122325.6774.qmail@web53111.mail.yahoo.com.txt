Does Lucene use a BTree kind of structure for storing the index (atleast in the memory)  .?
or is it just a list. Based on the file format in the index directory ( where in the terms
are are lexicographically sorted in one of the files ) I   am not sure if BTree is used. (
Because constructing a Btree from a lexicographicaly sorted list    will be difficult. )
