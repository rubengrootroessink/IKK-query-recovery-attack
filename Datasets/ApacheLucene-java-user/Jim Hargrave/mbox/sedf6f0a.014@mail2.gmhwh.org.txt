SUBJECT: Re: String similarity search vs. typcial IR application...

Probably shouldn't have added that last bit. Our app isn't a DNA searcher. But DASG+Lev does
look interesting.
 
Our app is a linguistic application. We want to search for sentences which have many ngrams
in common and rank them based on the score below. Similar to the TELLTALE system (do a google
search TELLTALE + ngrams) - but we are not interested in IR per se - we want to compute a
score based on pure string similarity. Sentences are docs, ngrams are terms.

AFAIK Lucene is not able to look DNA strings up effectively. You would 
use DASG+Lev (see my previous post - 05/30/2003 1916CEST).

dice's coefficient: 2C/Q+D, where C is the number of terms (n-grams) in common, Q is the number
of unique query terms and D is the number of unique document terms. Our documents will be
sentences.
