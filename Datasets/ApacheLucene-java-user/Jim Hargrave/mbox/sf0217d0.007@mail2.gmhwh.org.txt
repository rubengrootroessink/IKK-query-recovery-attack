SUBJECT: Re: Geting exact term positions for each document inside acollect method...
DATE: 2 Jul 2003

Our application indexes and retreieves sentences from a large database. Our terms are overlapping
characters (n-grams). In order to calculate our custom score we need to know the (relative)
position of each n-gram in the matched sentences. I'm currently using a boolen query (each
n-ngram in a big 'OR' statement). I will investigate customizing the query as you suggest.


Basically we are using Lucene as a Translation Memeory tool! Pretty cool. Lucene is wonderful
and I think we can use it in many of our linguistic projects (Terminlogy, concordance, TM
etc.).

 I've seen the methods in IndexReader, but how can I access them inside my collect method?
Are there other methods I am missing? 

No, this information is not available to the hit collector.

Why do you need this?  If it is only for summaries, then you're probably 
better off re-tokenizing those few documents that you wish to summarize. 
  If it is for query evaluation, then you're probably better off writing 
a new class of query (which is non-trivial).
