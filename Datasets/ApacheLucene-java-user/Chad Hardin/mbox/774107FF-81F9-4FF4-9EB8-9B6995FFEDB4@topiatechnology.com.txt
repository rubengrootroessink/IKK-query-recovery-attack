Thank you Erick, that was what I anticipated would be necessary.

There's still the issue of the queries from MoreLikeThis not  
returning results for terms I had expected ("bikes").

For example, I have these four very short documents:

"bikes are a handy tool for getting from diffrent locations on the  
earth, Ireally like bikes"
"Bikes can be really fast"
"bikes can be dangerous"
"I like bikes because they are fun"


I expected the query from MoreLikeThis to say that these short  
documents are similar because they all have "Bikes", but it doesn't.

Is there some reason for this to be so?  Perhaps because the  
documents are so short?

I then loaded some large (5K+) documents and I noticed that  
MoreLikeThis's query started to return similar documents, but explain 
() said they were similar because of words like "from" and "can" rather
than the text I expected to be used for similarity in the documents.
