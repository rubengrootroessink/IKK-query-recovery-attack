SUBJECT: More like this returning similarities that are too generic
DATE: 7 Aug 2006

hi all,

I'm new to lucene but I'm loving it!  I'm writing a prototype that  
links documents together based upon similarities.  Obviously the  
first thing I did was use MoreLikeThis.  However, it seems to be  
finding matches based upon words that are too common, in this case  
the words "from" and "can" and seems to be missing matches using the   
terms I would expect (in this case documents about "bikes").

I seems I need a more custom tailored Filter that only passes through  
more less-common words.  Does something like this already exist?

Thanks,

Chad
