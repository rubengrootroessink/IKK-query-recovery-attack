Hi Erick,


Thanks for your fast reply.

I will try to explain what I mean with image stuff. An image in 
xml-documents is usually an url to the location where the image is 
stored. Additionally, such an image tag contains information like 
offset, width and height. I am thinking about storing the images (binary 
data) and meta-information (offset, width, height) in one field instead 
of using these tagging information as values for a field in the index.

I guess, your last statement "Lucene doesn't index binary data..." 
indicates that this isn't possible...


Regards,

Bernd
