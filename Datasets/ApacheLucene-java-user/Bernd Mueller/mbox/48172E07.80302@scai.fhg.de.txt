SUBJECT: several indices
DATE: 29 Apr 2008

Hello,


I want to provide in the same web-interface the possibility to chose 
between different corpora. Is it possible to load several indices and to 
have somehow a "multi-index"?

Maybe one of you guys could send me some information about the issue here.


Thanks and regards,

Bernd
