SUBJECT: RE: indexing images of a document
DATE: 10 Jun 2008

Hi Steve,


Actually it is not about searching the binary data. I just wanna have the
whole document (together with the "image stuff") to be stored in the
index. So when I got a hit of a search on a document that I can extract
the document with its images (and the images' meta information).

Nice would be some data structure to be stored in the "image"-field of the
document (maybe a HashSet?). So I could extract the found documents with
all their image information from the index for easy visualization purpose
of the search results.


Regards,

Bernd
