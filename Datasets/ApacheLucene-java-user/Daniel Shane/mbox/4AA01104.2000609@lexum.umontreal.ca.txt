SUBJECT: TokenStream API, Quick Question.
DATE: 3 Sep 2009

Does a TokenStream have to return always the same number of attributes 
with the same underlying classes for all the tokens it generates?

I mean, during the tokenization phase, can the first "token" have a Term 
and Offset Attribute and the second "token" only a Type Attribute or 
does this mean that the first token has to have an empty Type attribute 
as well?

I'm just not sure,
Daniel Shane
