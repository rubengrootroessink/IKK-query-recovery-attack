Humm... there is something I dont catch..

When you open up an index writer, you batch up add and deletes. Now if 
you create a signature for the document, as long as you add it works, 
but what happens if you delete stuff from the index using a query as 
well as adding?

Does Solr also remember the deletions as well?
