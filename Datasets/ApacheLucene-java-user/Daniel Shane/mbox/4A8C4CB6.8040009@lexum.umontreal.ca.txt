SUBJECT: Re: Is there a way to check for field "uniqueness" when indexing?
DATE: 19 Aug 2009

But in that case, I assume Solr does a commit per document added.

Lets say I wanted to index a collection of 1 million pages, would it 
take much longer if I comited at each insertion rather than comiting at 
the end?
