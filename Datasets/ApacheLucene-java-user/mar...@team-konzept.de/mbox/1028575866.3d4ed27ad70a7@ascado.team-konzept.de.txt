SUBJECT: is it possible to merge Hits?
DATE: 5 Aug 2002

don't know if i am thinking in the rigth direction here. What i would like to do
is search an index with respect to two different fields of the documents and
then merge the hits together so that the resulting Hits are sorted by the score.
Is that the way to do it, or do i have to use multiple indices?

Best regards,
Markus Krogemann
