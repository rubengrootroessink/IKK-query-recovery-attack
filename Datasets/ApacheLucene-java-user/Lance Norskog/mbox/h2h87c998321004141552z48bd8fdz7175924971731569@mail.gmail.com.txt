SUBJECT: Utility program to extract a segment
DATE: 14 Apr 2010

Is there a program available that makes a new index with one or more
segments from an existing index? (The immediate use case for this is
doing forensics on corrupted indexes.)

The user interface would be:
extract -segments _ab,_g9 oldindex newindex

This would copy the files for segments _ab and _g9 into a new
directory and generate a segments.gen for just those two segments. Is
this all that's needed?
