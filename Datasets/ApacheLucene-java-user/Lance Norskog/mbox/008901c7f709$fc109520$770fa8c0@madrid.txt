SUBJECT: UTF-8/unicode input in querying in Lucene
DATE: 14 Sep 2007

Hi-
 
The page http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html does not
mention that \uNNNN Unicode syntax is supported.
For example, \u0048\u0045\u004c\u004c\u004f is HELLO.
 
Please add this to the page, it took experimentation to discover it.
 
Thanks,
 
Lance Norskog
