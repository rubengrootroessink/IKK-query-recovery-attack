SUBJECT: Re: What is the best Analyzer and Parser for this type of question?
DATE: 16 Nov 2010

First, to understand what your query looks like, go to 
admin/analysis.jsp. It lets you see what happens to your queries when 
they go in. Then, do the query with debugQuery=true. This will add some 
complex junk to the end of the XML page that describes in painful detail 
exactly how each document was scored.

After all that- you might have a problem with the PrnP etc. stuff 
getting chopped up in weird ways. I don't know how people handle this in 
chemistry/bio search.
