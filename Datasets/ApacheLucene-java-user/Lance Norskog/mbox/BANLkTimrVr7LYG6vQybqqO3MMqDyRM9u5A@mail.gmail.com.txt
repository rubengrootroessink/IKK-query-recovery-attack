The RAMDirectory uses Java memory, an FSDirectory does not. Holding
Java memory makes garbage collection work harder. The operating system
is very very good at managing disk buffers, and does a better job
using spare memory than Java does.

For real-world sites, RAMDirectory is almost always useless. Maybe the
Instantiated index stuff is more what you want?
