Hi
    I'm writing a web application which will index files using
textmining to extract text and lucene to store it. I do have the
following implementation questions:

1) Only one user can write to an index at each time. How are you people
dealing with this ? Maybe some kind of connection pooling ?

2) OutOfMemory issues - I've read about many on the list, which
workarounds are you using?

Thanks in advance
