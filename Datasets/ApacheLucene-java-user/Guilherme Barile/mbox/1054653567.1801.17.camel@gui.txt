SUBJECT: Simple searching ?
DATE: 3 Jun 2003

Hi
	I'm still getting started with lucene, and I can't search my index (It
exists). I also couldn't find any docs regarding searching, so, if you
could tell me at least this bit is right :

searcher = new IndexSearcher(IndexReader.open(this.indexDir));
hits = searcher.search(QueryParser.parse(query, "content", analyzer));

Do I need anything else ? (The variables and objects are declared, query
is a string)

thanks in advance

gui
