Hello
    I'm building a web application that uses lucene, the problem I'm
facing is that only one user may write to the index each time, and I
simply can't imagine a way to deal with this. Anyone ever did something
like this ? Should I write a non-web app to add documents to the index ?

Thanks in advance for any ideas :)
