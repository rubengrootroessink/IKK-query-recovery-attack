If you're trying to get all documents, why not

IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(this.indexDir);
Document doc;
	
for (int i = 0; i < reader.maxDoc(); i++) {
	try {
		doc = reader.document(i);
		System.out.println(i + " " + doc.get("source"));
	}
	catch (Exception e) {
		System.out.println("Error getting doc " + i);
	}
}

this is just a simple example (i'm a newbie, but using this to list all
documents on a certain index)
you could add another loop inside the for so you could get all the
fields in a document (in this case I'm only getting the field named
"source") there are methods on the indexreader object for that.
