Hi Guys,

I am wondering how I can go about doing a Fuzzy Phrase search using
Lucene.NET 2.9.2 - I've tired looking around everywhere but there doesn't
really seem to be any resources related to this anywhere.

I found this stackoverflow
link<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2589086/lucene-fuzzy-match-on-phrase-instead-of-single-word>-
but hoping that you might be able to help more ?

Thanks,

Andy
