SUBJECT: document retrieval 100 times slower after finishing some heavy disk operation
DATE: 28 Jun 2008

Hi,
 
I ran into a very strange situation regarding document retrieval slowness and want to get
some advice urgently.
 
I have 2 FSDirectory indexes each with size about 500M. I have 2 parallel search threads fetching 200
documents from these 2 indexes which usually take less then 16ms. However, everytime afer
some heavy disk operations (such as copy 1G size of a file into that disk) , the document
retrieval slows down to couple seconds immediately, even well after this disk operation being
finished for a long time. It appears Lucene could never resume to it's original speed and
I have to restart by application inorder to get it normal. 
 
Anybody has encountered similiar problems?
