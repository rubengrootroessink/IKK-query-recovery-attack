SUBJECT: multiple field searcher
DATE: 3 Aug 2007

I have Search Terms: T1, T2... Tn. Also I have document fields of F1 F2... Fm.

I want to search the match documents across F1 to Fm fields,i.e., all of the T1, T2, ...Tn
need to be matched, but can be in the combination of T1, T2, ... Tn field. 

I check the MultiFieldQueryParser, it doesn't appear to support this. How can I do that? 
Thanks
