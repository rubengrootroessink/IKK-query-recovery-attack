SUBJECT: Analyzer.getPositionIncrementGap question
DATE: 26 Oct 2006

I have multiple values want to add to the same FIELD, and I also want to add non-zero but NON
CONSTANT position increment gap among those values.  e.g., gap between "value1" and "value2"
is 10, but gap between "value2" and "value3" is 100. is there any how can I achieve that?
   
  d.add(new Field ("fld", "value1");
  d.add(new Field ("fld", "value2");
  d.add(new Field ("fld", "value3");
  indexWriter.addDocument(d);
