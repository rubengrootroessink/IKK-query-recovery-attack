SUBJECT: Lucene scoring question (how to boost leading terms match)
DATE: 3 Oct 2006

Hi,
   
  I have a question about the lucene scoring. In my following example, how can I ensure the
doc1 has the higher score than doc2, if I search for "A*". In another words, I want to boost
the docs which match their leading terms. 
   
  doc1: Aterm  Bterm  Cterm
  doc2: Bterm  Aterm  Cterm
