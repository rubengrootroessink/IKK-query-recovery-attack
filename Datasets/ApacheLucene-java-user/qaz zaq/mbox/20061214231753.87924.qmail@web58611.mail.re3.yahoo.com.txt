Thanks Erick,
Using termdocs/termenum should work. One of my concerns is the performance: the search results
could reach 100K, so the performance may be impacted.  One of the alternative I am thinking
 is to collapse the data during indexing time, but I haven't decided to go that way.

you need to search for all documents with the title you care about, decide
which one to keep and remove all the others.

You'll probably need a TermDocs/TermEnum to go through all the items in your
index to create the list of documents to remove.
