SUBJECT: two beginner questions (indexing; custom result ordering)
DATE: 6 Dec 2002


(note: running on Solaris 9, Java 1.4, TomCat 4.04, Cocoon 2.0.3, Lucene 
1.2)

I'm learning how to use Lucene within my Cocoon application, and have
two questions...need pointers to RTFMs, examples, etc

Q1: I have a base document that lists links to XML files within the 
cocoon directory
      structure on the server.  Using a slightly modified version of the 
Cocoon/Lucene
      example setup, I can create an index of these files, query the 
index, and
      retrieve & transform the files into HTML docs using my stylesheets.
      What I would like to do is include in my base document a link that 
points
      to an XML file elsewhere on the Web, include the link in the 
index, and
      retreive and transform the link contents like I do with the local 
documents.
     How can I do this?  

Q2: are there examples of how to order the query result set by my own
      sort specification (including boost factor)?  if SearchBean can do
      this, please point to some examples of how to use it.

Thanks!!

Harry Foxwell
