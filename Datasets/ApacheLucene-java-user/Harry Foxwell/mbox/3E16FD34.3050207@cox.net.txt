SUBJECT: xml element query
DATE: 4 Jan 2003

in an xml document, say

   <A>
          <B>
          <C>foo</C>
          </B>
   </A>

Lucene syntax allows me to search for term 'C:foo'

Is there a way to  specify query for 'foo'  in one of
the parents of C?  Something like
  B:foo, B:C:foo, B/C:foo, or something like that idea
(but of course these don't work).
