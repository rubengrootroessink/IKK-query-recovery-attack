The question I'd have is, how would you handle interleaving of hits from
different segments?  Meaning, if you have a priority queue with 10 slots, 10
hits from one segment, and 10 hits from another segment, how do you determine
which his win and which fall out the bottom of the queue?

Yes.  That post is from last spring; since then, a prototype of the Lucy
pluggable IndexReader design has been implemented in KinoSearch, so you could
write such a component today.
