I'm about to.  The predecessor to the indexing benchmarker tests I  
recently published results for was enormously helpful while  
streamlining the indexing process.  Now that I'm considering  
modifications to search logic and file format which may have a  
substantial impact on search-time performance, I'll need a search  
benchmarker to complement the indexing benchmarker.  I'll be writing  
a both a Perl/KinoSearch and a Java Lucene version, and they will use  
the Reuters corpus.
