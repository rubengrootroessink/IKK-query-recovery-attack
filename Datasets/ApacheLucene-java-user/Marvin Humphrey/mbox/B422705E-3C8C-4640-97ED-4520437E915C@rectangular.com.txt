Yonik, I disagree on one point.  I recommend against omitting norms  
for title fields.

Without norms, the titles "Duke Ellington" and "Duke Ellington meets  
Count Basie" will contribute equally to their respective document  
scores on a search for "Duke Ellington".  For most applications,  
exact title matches should win, so that's not optimal.

KinoSearch adopted a default tf() truncation scheme where all fields  
were normalized as if they contained a minimum of 100 tokens.  That  
achieved the desired outcome of stopping very short documents from  
scoring inappropriately high, but even with a boost assigned to a  
title field, I've found that I can't get really good IR precision  
without going back to a non-truncating tf() for title.
