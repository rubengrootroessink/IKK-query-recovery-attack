Well, there's no fundamental technical limitation that makes it so  
that global field defs can't be purged -- especially after  
optimization.  I just don't have a system in place that makes it  
possible.  There'd probably be a few bugs if you tried shrinking a  
Schema now, but a few tests should find them and they're killable.

In KS, the DocWriter class writes stored fields.  Since the field  
defs have global semantics, you don't need to know anything about the  
contents of the serialized document -- no conflict resolutions.  It's  
just a blob with a certain number of bytes.

My plan is to enable subclassing of DocWriter/DocReader.  That should  
make it possible to scratch a number of itches:

   * multiple values per field
   * different field values for display and searching
   * lazy loading
   * arbitrary data
   * arbitrary compression algo choice
   * complete document recovery
   * ...
