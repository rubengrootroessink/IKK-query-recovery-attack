How fast is Lua's method dispatch, compared to Java's?  That has a  
huge impact on performance, since *everything* is a method in Lucene  
-- down to writeByte().

There have been several attempts at pure dynamic language ports of  
Lucene, including Plucene (Perl), Lupy (Python), and the original pure- 
Ruby implementation of Ferret.  All of those have proven unacceptably  
slow.  The ports which have achieved good performance, including  
CLucene (C++), Lucene.NET, the latter-day Ferret (C/Ruby), and  
KinoSearch (C/Perl) (and possibly others, I haven't reviewed them all)  
all get close to the metal.  None rely on hash-based method dispatch  
for inner-loop code, and all manipulate primitive types directly.
