Ah.  KinoSearch's implementation inadvertently differs: lengthNorm takes only
the number of tokens.  It didn't occur to me that the problem had been solved
that way.

A while ago, I changed lengthNorm to use either the number of tokens or 100,
whichever was greater.  That had the intended effect, which was to downgrade 
the type of "stub" documents Lucene tends to boost.  However, it had the
undesirable effect of no longer boosting exact title matches.  

The answer is to use Lucene's default lengthNorm for title and the modified
lengthNorm for bodytext.  Wasn't sure how to do that in Lucene; now I know.
