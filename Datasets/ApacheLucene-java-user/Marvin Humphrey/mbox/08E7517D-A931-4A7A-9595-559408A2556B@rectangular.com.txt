SUBJECT: Error tolerant query parsing
DATE: 29 Jun 2005

Greetings,

Is it possible to have Lucene parse malformed queries?  For instance,  
is there a way to have this query...

art museums "new york city

... return results for ...

art museums "new york city"

... or is that just a parse error, end of story?

It's a DWIM* thing.
