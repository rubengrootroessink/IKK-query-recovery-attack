I believe that this will cause difficulties with prohibited terms.   
Say you have these two documents...

     Doc 1:
        title: a
        body:  foo
     Doc 2:
        title: b
        body:  bar

How many hits do you get for the query 'a -foo'?  The answer *should*  
be 0, since the presence of "foo" in the body should exclude doc 1.   
However, since the title matches against 'a -foo' ("a" is present,  
and "foo" is not), I believe you'll get a hit.

If you can solve that problem, and also return 1 hit for the query  
string "a +foo", let me know!
