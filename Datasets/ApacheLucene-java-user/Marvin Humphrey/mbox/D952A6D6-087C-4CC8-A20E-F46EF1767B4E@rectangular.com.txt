The thing I don't like about this is that it prevents validation of  
field names, which is something I use a lot  in KS (e.g. try to  
delete a term from a field that's not indexed, get an error, as the  
field name was probably misspelled).  I can see the use, it just  
means sacrificing a lot of type safety for the more common cases.   
The user base at large has to suffer with more frequent, hard-to- 
detect bugs for a feature only needed by a few users.

About your app in particular -- how do you handle identical XML tag  
names that mean totally different things when nested inside different  
elements?
