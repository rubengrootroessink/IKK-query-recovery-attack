It's funny that you don't seem to include yourself in that group yet, Hoss. I
imagine it won't be long.  If you haven't read that Brin/Page paper from 1998
yet, you should check it out.

Enabling individual positions to be boosted is indeed one of the main targets
of the current discussion.  A slightly easier to understand application would
be boosting individual tokens according to relative font size. For instance,
we might assume that text between <h1> tags is more important than text
between <p> tags and boost it.  There's no good way to handle that right now.
