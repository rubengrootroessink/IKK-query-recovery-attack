Thanks, all.

The field cache and the bitsets both seem like good options until the  
collection grows too large, provided that the index does not need to  
be updated very frequently.  Then for large collections, there's  
statistical sampling.  Any of those options seems preferable to  
retrieving all docs all the time.
