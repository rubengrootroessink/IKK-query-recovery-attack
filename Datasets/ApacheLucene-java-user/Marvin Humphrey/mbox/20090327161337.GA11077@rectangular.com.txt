I had thought making SegmentReader public was at least under consideration as
part of the implementation for segment-centric sorted search, but I guess it
turned out not to be necessary.  Still, you have
IndexReader.getSequentialSubReaders().  That might be enough -- at least for
this part of the problem.  :)

Yes.  

SegReaders_To_Merge is overridden in certain parts of the test suite, but it's
not yet public.  However, control over merging policy will soon *have* to be
made public somehow in order to support real-time indexing, so working out an
API is on my near-term agenda.

Not enough to worry about, I believe.

This is an important concern, but I believe that design-wise, we have a
solution[1] -- on 32-bit systems, we only mmap sliding windows rather than
whole files.

Furthermore, mmap is called with the MAP_SHARED flag, so IndexReaders across
multiple processes hitting the same exact memory segment get to share it.
(This is more important under 64-bit systems, where we do map the whole file
straightaway.)

Launching an IndexReader is still plenty fast.

Actually, if you're not warming sort caches, launching a Lucene IndexReader
isn't obscenely expensive any more -- just expensive.  Right?

[1] At least on Unixen.  I believe we can support all of this using Windows
    MapViewOfFile and friends, and I had a crude prototype working before, but
    right now Windows is still using the old-school load-into-process-memory
    style.
