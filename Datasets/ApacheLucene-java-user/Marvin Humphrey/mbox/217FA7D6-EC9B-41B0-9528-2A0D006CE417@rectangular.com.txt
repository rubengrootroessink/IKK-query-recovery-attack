That has the advantage of providing instant feedback to people like  
Daniel who want to experiment.  It seems to me that the ability to  
setIndexIntervalMult() (?) at search-time would provide all the  
useful benefits of setIndexInterval() at write-time.  There's no  
significant disk-space issue involved.  The startup time to fill the  
cache isn't worth worrying about, either.

Coincidentally, I'm porting this exact section of TermInfosReader  
this morning.
