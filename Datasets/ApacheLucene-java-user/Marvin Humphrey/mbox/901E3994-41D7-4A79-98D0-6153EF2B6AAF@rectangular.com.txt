I agree with your assessment.  Conceptually, this is a stemming  
problem.  By extension, it's not a tokenizing problem, and the  
behavior of the StandardTokenizer is fine.

The most recent Perl/CPAN version of the Snowball stemming library  
added an option to strip leading l', d', etc in French.  I know this  
because until the most recent version, it didn't strip trailing 's in  
English, either, and I had to write some workarounds, just like  
you'll have to.

I'm curious: are there any cases in French where a string with an  
apostrophe in it ought to be split into two searchable tokens?  I  
know of no such cases in English: you never want to search for the ll  
in you'll, or the O in O'Reilly, etc.
