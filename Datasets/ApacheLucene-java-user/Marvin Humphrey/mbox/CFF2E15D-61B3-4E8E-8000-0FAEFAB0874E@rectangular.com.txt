Greets,

If you needed to know not just the total number of hits, but the  
number of hits in each "category", how would you handle that?

For instance, a search for "egg" would have to produce the 20 most  
relevant documents for "egg", but also a list like this:

     Holiday & Seasonal / Easter     75
     Books / Cooking                 52
     Miscellaneous                   44
     Kitchen Collectibles            43
     Hobbies / Crafts                17
     [...]

It seems to me that you'd have to retrieve each hit's stored fields  
and examine the contents of a "category" field.  That's a lot of  
overhead.  Is there another way?
