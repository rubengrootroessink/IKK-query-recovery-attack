:)

I haven't been feeding back my KinoSearch commits into the Lucy  
repository, true.  Not much has changed status-wise since this: <http://xrl.us/bgyu6

continues apace.  I just figured I wouldn't bring anything up here  
until I had some experimental Java bindings for you folks to play  
with.  Some of the stuff I'm working on with KS isn't compatible with  
Lucene, and it doesn't make sense to impede progress by imposing that  
constraint.  Better to finish it up, present a polished version and a  
coherent explanation of the design, then have Mike McCandless riff off  
of it -- that worked pretty well for indexing speed improvements in  
Lucene 2.3.
