Not much -- my example still stands.  We still can't distribute code of theirs
licensed under LGPL, but we could distribute any Apache-licensed code of
theirs.  

The only thing that changes is that if they're the sole authors, they can slap
whatever license they want on the original library.  Things get complicated if
they've ever accepted patches from anyone, though -- since then they have to
get permission from all contributors for relicensing.
