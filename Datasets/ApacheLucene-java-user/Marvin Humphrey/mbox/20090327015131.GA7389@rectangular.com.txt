Eep.  IndexReader's too big as it is.

Do you really need all that?  I think the crucial info is already available:

  * The number of docs in each segment.
  * The number of deletions in each segment, allowing you to calculate the
    deletion percentage.

I think it's reasonable to assume an average distribution of document sizes
across segments.  Sure, that'll be wrong at the long tail of the curve, but
most of the time it will be right -- and even when it's not, it won't cause
big problems.

Yeah, that's gonna be a bigger problem.  :(  It's cake to give Lucy's indexer
a reader, because opening readers is cheap.  But the Lucene heavy-IndexReader
model messes that up -- IndexWriter has traditionally been a fast class to
open.
