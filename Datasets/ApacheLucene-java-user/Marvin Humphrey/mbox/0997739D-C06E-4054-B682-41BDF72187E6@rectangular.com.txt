The problem is clearly in whatever parser you're using.  I used  
Reuters 21578 as a corpus for a benchmarking suite; since all I cared  
about was title and body, I wrote a quick-n-dirty regex-based parser  
in Perl that extracted the docs from the SGML out onto the file  
system.  You'll find it at <http://www.rectangular.com/svn/kinosearch/ 
trunk/t/benchmarks/extract_reuters.plx>.
