I haven't checked 1.4.3, but yes, I'm looking at the subversion  
trunk.  It's probably a recent addition.

You *can't* set it on the reader end.  If you could set it, the  
reader would get out of sync and break.  The value is set per-segment  
at write time, and the reader has to be able to adapt on the fly.
