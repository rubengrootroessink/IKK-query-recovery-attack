SUBJECT: Grouping over multiple fields
DATE: 25 Jul 2006

Hi All,

Can anybody help me out on this ..?

I have to search for a particular value over multiple fields and need to 
know if grouping is allowed over multiple fields 

eg.

<some query>    AND   ( AUTHOR_NAME:krish OR EMPLOYEE_NAME:krish )

Introducing paranthesis "(" is giving me lexical error 

Thanks and Regards
Krishnendra Nandi
