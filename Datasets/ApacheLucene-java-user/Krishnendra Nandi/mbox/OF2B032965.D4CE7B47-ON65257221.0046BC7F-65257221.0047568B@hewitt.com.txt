SUBJECT: Specific Query on multiple fields
DATE: 9 Nov 2006

Hi All,

How do we use a specific query on multiple fields ?

for eg.
I have to run a query "jakarta tomcat" (the string which i give in my 
textbox is with double quotes as I have to get the string 'jakarta tomcat' 
together)
on mutiple fields like "content" ,"title","examples" 

Also if I have a specific string query like "Jakarta:" How do i get that? 
would it not try to search a field with the name jakarta ? 
As far as I can see it ignores the ':' and tries to search only on 
jakarta.

All possible help is welcome.
Thanks and Regards
