SUBJECT: Urgent : Specific string query search
DATE: 16 Nov 2006

Hi all, 

I have a specific string query like "Jakarta:" How do i get that? I am 
using standardAnalyzer and it seems as if it is stripping ":" and it is 
simply searching for "Jakarta".
I have used WhiteSpaceAnalyzer also and its working fine for ":" but I 
think it has some other limitations. The limitations of WhiteSpaceAnalyzer 
which I have noticed are as follows:
1. It needs the search criteria in the proper case i.e for searching 
"Jakarta" I cant give "jakarta" as my search criteria.
2. WhiteSpaceAnalyzer is not supporting FIELD:TEXT kind of search.
e.g ISSUE_TITLE:test
where ISSUE_TITLE is the field in which test is to be searched. But 
standardAnalyzer supports this.

May be the limitations I am seeing is because of my code.

Can you please help me out as to how I can do a search like "Jakarta:". I 
would appreciate if could please send me the code snippet doing this kind 
of search.


Thanks & Regards
Krishnendra Nandi
