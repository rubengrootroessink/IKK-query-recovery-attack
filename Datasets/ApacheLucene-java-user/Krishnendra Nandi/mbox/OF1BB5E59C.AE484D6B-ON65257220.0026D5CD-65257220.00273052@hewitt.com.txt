Hi All,

in my search criteria i am using a criteria "apache tomcat" but it is 
giving me a parse exception.

my searcher has this piece of code:

searchQuery=makeWildcardQuery(searchQuery);
masterQuery.add(MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(searchQuery,fields,analyzer),REQUIRED,PROHIBITED);




private String makeWildcardQuery(String query)
    {
        String result = query.trim();

        if (0 != result.length())
        {
            if (!result.endsWith("*"))
            {
                result = result + "*";
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

Thanks and Regards
