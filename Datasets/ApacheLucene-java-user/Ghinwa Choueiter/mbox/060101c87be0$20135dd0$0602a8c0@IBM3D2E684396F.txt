SUBJECT: searching for "Nothing"
DATE: 1 Mar 2008

Hi,

I am trying to do a search as follows (this is a very simplified example):

I want to search for: (1) the little boy or (2) one little boy or (3) little boy

Can I write the query as:
"the OR one OR "" " AND "little" AND "boy"

note that what I mean by "" is "Nothing". 

thank you,
-Ghinwa

PS. I know that I can write the query as "the little boy" OR "one little boy" OR "little boy"
