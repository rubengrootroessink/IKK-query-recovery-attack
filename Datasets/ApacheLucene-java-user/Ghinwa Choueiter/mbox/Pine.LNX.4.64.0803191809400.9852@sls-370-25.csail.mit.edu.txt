SUBJECT: Re: Scoring a query with OR's
DATE: 19 Mar 2008

Hi,

I emailed a question earlier about the difference between OR and AND in a 
Boolean query. So in what I am trying to do, I need AND to behave like an 
OR ( or what I like to call "soft AND"), and I need OR to behave like a 
logic OR, meaning that I don't want to reward documents that have more of 
the OR operands. It is easy for me to fix the AND, but is there a 
straightforward way of fixing the OR?

Many thanks!
