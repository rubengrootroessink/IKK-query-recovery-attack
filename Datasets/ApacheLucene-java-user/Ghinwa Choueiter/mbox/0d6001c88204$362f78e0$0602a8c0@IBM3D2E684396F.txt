SUBJECT: Scoring a query with OR's
DATE: 9 Mar 2008

Hi,

I had a look at the scoring equation and read the scoring online document:
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/scoring.html#Scoring

It is clear to me how the scoring equation would work for a query that 
contains AND: 
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc//org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html

but what exactly happens when there are OR's, for eg.  (life OR place OR 
time)

The scoring equation can get a score for life, place, time separately, but 
what does it do with them then? Does it also add them.

Many thanks,
-Ghinwa
