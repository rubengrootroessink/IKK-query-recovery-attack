SUBJECT: MultiSearcherThread.hits(ParallelMultiSearcher.java:280)	nullPointerException
DATE: 10 Sep 2009

Hello every .
I have a problem with MultiSearcherThread.hits in ParallelMultiSearcher.java
. Some times when I want to search via paralleMultiSearcher,
the method MultiSearcherThread.hits() throws nullPointerException. this is
because docs somehow has become null.
but why this field is null. I've checked lucene code . this field never
becomes null except in the ParallelMultiSearcher when lucene wants to
aggregate all results ( in line 79) the
instruction of msta[i].join throws InterruptedException. then the ioe will
be null and because msta[i] hasn't finished its work yet so docs will be
null.
is this right? or is it possible the msta[i] be interrupted in this part of
code?

the exception is :
java.lang.NullPointerException
