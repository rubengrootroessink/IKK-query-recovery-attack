Hi Martin,


you might want to have a look at 

http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/08/09/didyoumean.html

This article discusses a solution that uses a separate index consisting of n-grams as a dictionary.
I haven't tried it myself yet, but I will give it a try in the near future.

Regards,

Martin

Hi everybody,

Has anyone tried to code a solution like Google's "Did you mean?" in 
Lucene?

I would be very happy to hear your ideas, approaches, suggestions.

Best,
Martin
