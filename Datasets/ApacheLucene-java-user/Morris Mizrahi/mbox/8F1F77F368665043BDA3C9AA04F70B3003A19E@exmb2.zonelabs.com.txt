SUBJECT: Zero hits for queries ending with a number
DATE: 13 Mar 2004

Hey everyone.

 

My document object for my lucene index has a "url" field.

I have created "url" as a Text field.  

The problem I am having is that searches with a "url" that end with a
number, e.g. "e:\k2_beta1", don't return any hits even though there is
data that should match this search criteria. If you have a "url" that
ends with a letter, e.g. "e:\k2_alpha", the search works fine and
returns the correct hits.

 

Here are some code snippets of my work:

IndexCreation:

writer = new IndexWriter("index", new StandardAnalyzer(), true);

  

create the "url" as a Text field:

            doc.add(Field.Text("url", url));

 

search code:

        Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();

        DateFilter filter = ((SearchForm) form).getDateFilter();

        Searcher searcher = new
IndexSearcher(IndexReader.open(indexPath));

        Query query = QueryParser.parse(terms, "contents", analyzer);

        Hits hits = searcher.search(query, filter);

 

I have tried changing the "url" field from Text to Keyword. 

This didn't work and also caused my searches for any "url" to fail. 

I am using lucene 1.2

 

I know I need the proper combinations of Analyzer and Field type. 

 

Any help would be appreciated.

 

Thanks.

 

        Morris
