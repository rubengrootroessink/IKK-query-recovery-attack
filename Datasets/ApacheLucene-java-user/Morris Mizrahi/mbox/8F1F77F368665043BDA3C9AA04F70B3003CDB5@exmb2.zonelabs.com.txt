SUBJECT: demo indexing problems on linux
DATE: 17 Jun 2004

Hey everyone.

 

I am using the Lucene 1.4rc3 demo classes.

 

When I run org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML on Linux the indexer works
fine when I am creating a new index (e.g. using -create -index option).
But when I run the indexer again (-index without the -create option) for
updates it does not properly update the index. 

 

I have used the demo classes on windows and the index creation and
updates work fine.

 

Does anyone know if there are any issues with the demo classes index
update on Linux?

 

Thanks for your help.
