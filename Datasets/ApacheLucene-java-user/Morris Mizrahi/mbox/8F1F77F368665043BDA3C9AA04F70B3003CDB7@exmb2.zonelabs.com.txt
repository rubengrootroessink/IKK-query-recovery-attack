Thanks for your response Daniel.

This is the process I have followed:
1) Run the indexer for the first time with the -create option and it
adds all of my files to the index.
2) Run the indexer later in the day when some files have been added but
none have been removed. When it runs here it removes files from the
index that are still there and adds some of the new files. 
In the end the index is missing some of the files that should be there.
I have about 21000 files and there is about 2000 that are missing from
the index.

I have been using LIMO to analyze my index.

Does anyone have any thoughts or ideas?

Thanks for any help.

             Morris

Morris,

what exactly happens when you run the update? Does it miss files that
have 
been modified? I just tried it on Linux and it works fine. Files that
have 
been modified (according to their file date) are deleted and then added 
again to the index.

 Daniel
