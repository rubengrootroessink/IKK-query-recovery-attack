SUBJECT: Re: Preserving original HTML file offsets for highlighting
DATE: 25 Jan 2011

Hi Uwe,

thanks for this hint. I'm not sure, how much of the Solr functionality do I
need to implement for using the HTTPStripCharFilter. I'm using Apache Tika
for HTML parsing. Furthermore I use the StandardAnalyzer to initialize my
IndexWriter. I don't use a Tokenizer - this would be the Solr approach?

At this point, I'm not sure, how to use the Solr within my application,
where I already use Lucene. Can I use i.e. just this one or few classes from
the Solr Core while indexing with Lucene IndexWriter? Or do I need to switch
my indexing and searching to the Solr way, just to get what I need
(highlighting of the hits within HTML files).

Thank you so much for your help:-)
Karo
