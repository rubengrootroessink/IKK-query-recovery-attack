Has anyone tried implimenting 3rd party open source
utilities to do this?  xpdf (www.foolabs.com/xpdf)
converts pdf to text and catdoc
(http://www.ice.ru/~vitus/catdoc/ver-0.9.html)
converts ms word to text.  Maybe these can be used to
create the plain text for the index...

I look forward to seeing PDF and Word indexing added
to this solution.

My Best;

J
