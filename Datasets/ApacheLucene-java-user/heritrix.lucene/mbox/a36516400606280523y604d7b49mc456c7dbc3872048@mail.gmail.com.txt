o o no
I mean the searching would be fast or not... But now i have tested. The
result that i found reveals that there would be no difference in terms of
searching speed.
But there is another thing that i want to ask. What if the index is changed
in between.

Will the indexReader give the results with updated index ???
OR
Will the IndexSearcher give the results with updated index ???
OR
no matter what we are using we'll have to re-initialize either ??

Thanks and Regards,
