SUBJECT: searching for the part of a term.
DATE: 23 Sep 2006

Hi All,

How can i make my search so that if i am looking for the term "counting" the
documents containing "accounting" must also come up.

Similarly if i am looking for term "workload", document s containing work
also come up as a search result.

Wildcard query seems to work in the first case, but if the index size is
very big, it throws TooManyClausesException.

Is there a way to resolve this issue, apart from indexing n-grams of each
term.


Regards,
