SUBJECT: Re: Searching is taking a lot...
DATE: 28 Jun 2006

Hi,
I think i have posted this question in some other thread...
When the resultSet is very big, Searching is taking a lot of time.
For returning responce of a query that finds approx 14 M results, first time
it is taking approx 17Sec.
But next time for the same query it is taking almost 2 seconds.
I am using Hits for getiing the results searching the result using
Searcher.search().
Is there anyother way of improving its speed.

Thanks and regards,
