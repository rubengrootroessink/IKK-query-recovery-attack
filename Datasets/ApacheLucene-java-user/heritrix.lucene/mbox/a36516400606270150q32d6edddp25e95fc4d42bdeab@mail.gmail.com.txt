SUBJECT: Understanding Boolean Queries..
DATE: 27 Jun 2006

Hi i am using lucene 1.9.1.

My query is :

(subject:cs OR author:ritchie)
I am creating one Boolean query for two TermQueries.
t1 = new Term("subject", "cs")
t2 = new Term("author","ritchie")

for this the BooleanQuery i created is:
BooleanQuery mergedQuery = new BooleanQuery();
mergedQuery.add(new TermQuery(t1),BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
mergedQuery.add(new TermQuery(t2),BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);


When i saw the final query using i found
+subject:cs author:ritchie

Now when i go for search using this query it gave me all "subject:cs"
results. But i was expecting that it will give me the union of two.
What's wrong with this???


With Regards....
