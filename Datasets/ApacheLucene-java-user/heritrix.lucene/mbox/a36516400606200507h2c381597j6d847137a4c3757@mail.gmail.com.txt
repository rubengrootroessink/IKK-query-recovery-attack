SUBJECT: addIndexes() is taking infinite time ...
DATE: 20 Jun 2006

Hi all,
I had five different indexes:
1 having 15469008 documents
2 having 7734504 documents
3 having 7734504 documents
4 having 7734504 documents
5 having 7734504 documents
Which sums to 46407024.
The constant values are
maxMergeFactor = 1000
maxBufferedDocs = 1000

I wrote a simple program which uses the addIndex method for adding indexes.
It has been more then 32 hours adding the indexes. My logs say upto now it
has finished only first two indexes. It is adding the third one.
I want to know what exactly happens while merging the indexes?? Why this
time grows exponentially ????
Can anybody explain this in brief.

Thanks in advance..
With Regards
