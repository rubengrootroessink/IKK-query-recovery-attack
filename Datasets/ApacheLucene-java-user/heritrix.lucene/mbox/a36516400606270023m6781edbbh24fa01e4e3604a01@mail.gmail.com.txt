SUBJECT: Re: Searching is taking a lot...
DATE: 27 Jun 2006

Hi,
First of all, thanks for your attention...
I think i've got the solution.
Actually earlier, everytime for each query i was creating a different
searcher object. Creating searcher object was not taking a lot. But
searching everytime using a new searcher was taking time. So For testing, i
made it a static one and reused the same. This gave me a lot of improvement.
Previously my query was taking approx 25 sec. But now most of the queries
are taking time between the 100 and 800 ms.
Here also i noticed that the query is taking time only first time. If you
fire the same query again it takes very very less.
Can anybody tell me the story behibd this.

With Regards.........
