Hi,
While i was searching forum for my problem for searching a substring, i got
few very good links.

http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/39753?search_string=Bitset%20filter;#39753
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/7813?search_string=substring;#7813
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/5931?search_string=substring;#5931

In first, WildcardTermEnum is used.
>>I tried with this but this takes a lot of time in searching.

The other solution i found was to create a tokenstream which splits a token
into multiple tokens, and then index those token. like : google into google,
oogle, ogle....
And then while searching make a prefix query , then search.
>>But here it seems to create a lot of tokens from one token resulting index
size multiple times bigger then if we index a single token.

Since the overhead in first is the speed of the system, i think adopting
second method will be better.

Is there any other solution for this problem?? Am i going in right
direction??

It'll be great to see your response...

Regards,
