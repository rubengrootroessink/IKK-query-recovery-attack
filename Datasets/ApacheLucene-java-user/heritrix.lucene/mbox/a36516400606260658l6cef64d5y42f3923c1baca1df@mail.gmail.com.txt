SUBJECT: Searching is taking a lot...
DATE: 26 Jun 2006

Hi,
I have created an index of 47 Million documents.
I have 1.28GB RAM.
When i am doing a search over this index it is taking on average 25 sec. Is
there a way so that i can get results in part of a second...
I hope there must be some ways..

Thanks and regards..
