Sorry, I meant to say:

This query assumes that _NO_ Documents expire before they become available,
which seems like a reasonable assumption.

I'm a newbie to Lucene, so someone please correct me if I say something
wrong or if there's an easier way.

Your search is looking exclusively for Documents that either become
available or expire in the given period.  What about something like
(untested):

+((dateAvailable:[01/01/0001 TO 03/01/2004]) AND
(dateExpired:[02/01/2004 TO 12/31/9999]))

This query assumes that Documents expire before they become available, which
seems like a reasonable assumption.

Newbie here. Or, at least it has been a couple of years....

I have a date ranges working, which seem to work well. But I have
a question about how to form a query.

I have a publication with a dateAvailable and a dateExpired. It is
viewable any time between these dates.

I want to supply a date range, looking for publications available in
the specified range. I thought I could do:

+((dateAvailable:[02/01/2004 TO 03/01/2004]) OR 
(dateExpired:[02/01/2004 TO 03/01/2004]))

But this does not work with this combination of dates:

dateAvailable=1/1/2004
searchStartDate=2/1/2004
searchEndDate=3/1/2004
dateExpired=6/1/2004

Neither the dateAvailable nor dateExpired are included within the user 
specified test
range, even though the publication is available during the entire 
specified range,
plus more.

Anyone figured out a way to do this without enumerating all the dates?  
Or, do I
just need more sleep.

Thanks for any help.

Frank
