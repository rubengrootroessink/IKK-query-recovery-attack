SUBJECT: Changing the Score of a Document.
DATE: 16 Jan 2008

Hi

I am sure that this topic has been once discusses on this forum, so, sorry
to ask again!

Let's suppose a Document d1 containing the five terms:
a
b
C
D


and a query (a AND b).

The document d1 is relevant and will be retrieved and typically, its score
will be a function tf*idf relative to the terms 'a' and 'b'.

I am interesting to score the document *not* according a and b, but
according the terms C and D.
How can we do that?

Thanks
Benjamin
