SUBJECT: Re: Problems compiling the java source codes of lucene search engine
DATE: 26 Sep 2002

Hi Otis,

Thanks, I have followed your suggestion about
installing Ant but I tried to test Ant by running
build.xml but in vain. Instead, it said the file
couldn't be found although I put the file in the bin
folder. can help me how to build ant successfully?
thanks..

Hmm.. I have jar files of Lucene: lucene-1.2.jar and
lucene-demos-1.2.jar. Not sure if u are refering to
those jar files needed to compile the source codes of
Lucene search engine..

if so, how come i can't compile the codes although i
already have jar files? does it mean that i must run
jar files?

thanks alot...

Best Regards,
Andre
