SUBJECT: Re: Detecting duplicates
DATE: 6 Mar 2011

I'm familiar with Deduplication however I do not wish to remove my 
duplicates and my needs are slightly different. I would like to mark the 
first document with signature 'xyz' as unique but the next one as a 
duplicate. This way I can filter out "duplicates" during searching using 
a filter query but still return the original document.

The only thing I know of at the moment is to use field collapsing but I 
tried the patch on 1.4.1 and it was terribly slow.
