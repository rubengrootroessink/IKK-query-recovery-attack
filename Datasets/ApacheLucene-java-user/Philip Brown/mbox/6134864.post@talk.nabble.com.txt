Yeah, they are more complex than the "exactish" match -- basically, there are
more fields involved -- combined sometimes with AND and sometimes with OR,
and sometimes negated field values, sometimes groupings, etc.  These other
field values are all single words (no spaces), and a search might involve a
wildcard on them.  Hope that helps.

Thanks.
