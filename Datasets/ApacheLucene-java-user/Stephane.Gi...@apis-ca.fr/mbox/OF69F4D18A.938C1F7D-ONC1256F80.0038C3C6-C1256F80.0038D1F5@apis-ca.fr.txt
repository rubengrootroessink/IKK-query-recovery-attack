For the type field I suggest using a TermQuery. Is the document type
from a list of defined types? i.e. is it stored as a keyword and hence
doesn't need parsing?

For the other fields I recommend trying out the
DistributingMultiFieldQueryParser class, which isn't in the main distro
yet but can be found here:

http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32674

It handles all the awkward bits of making sure all fields are searched
correctly. 

Then combine the two query objects in a BooleanQuery.
