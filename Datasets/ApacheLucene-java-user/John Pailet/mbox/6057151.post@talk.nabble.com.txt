SUBJECT: Re: Sorting based on a selling rate
DATE: 30 Aug 2006


Yes, that is exactly what I want to do !

My external system gives me sell rate/Top N Selling books matching the user
terms (query)

I don't know what is the best way:

Storing sell rate into lucene Fields of the documents... (multiple
combination) and sort by this field, 

or doing something like you said: "adding an optional clauses to your
query for each of your N productIds"... but I don't really know how to do
this...

Any sample code exemple ?

Thank you very much,

John
