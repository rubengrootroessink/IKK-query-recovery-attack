SUBJECT: Re: Sorting based on a selling rate
DATE: 29 Aug 2006


Hello,

Ok, for the sort object, but my problem is I don't know haox to retrieve (or
store) information of the sell rate of the products (the sell rate deponds
on the QUERY ! The sort is different for each queries.)

I imagine to connect to the DB and get sell rate of products for this
specific query... but connecting to DB at each query is not a right choice
;-)

any idea ?
