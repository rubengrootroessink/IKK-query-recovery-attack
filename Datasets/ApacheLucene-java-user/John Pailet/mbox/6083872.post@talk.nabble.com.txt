SUBJECT: Re: Sorting based on a selling rate
DATE: 31 Aug 2006


Putting selling rate in the index is OK for me, I also think that is a good
idea.

The problem is: I don't  know how to store the sell rate of the product that
depends on a specific query

Can you please give me your idea about how to store it in the Lucene
document ? (field/value)

Thank you very much,

John
