Try to use an analyzer like StandardAnalyzer in both direction: while
indexing and while searching.
I don't remember if one of the filter used by StandardAnalyzer modifies
the accented letters, if not, you will have to create one.

The idea is to transform every word to a normalized form (removing
common words, removing accents [ü => u], making the word lowercase)
before indexing the word and before searching the word. That way,
someone looking for ümlaut will have the same results than someone
looking for umlaut. (and knowing the lazyness of most of common users,
they will thank oyu to make that posisble :-)

It's quite easy to implement a subclass of
org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenFilter that will answer to your needs
and to use it in a subclass of org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer
with all the supplementary filters you need to add.
