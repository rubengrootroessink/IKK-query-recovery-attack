Hi,

A final method is not meant to be overridden.
Why do you want to inherit IndexReader as your first shot at Lucene and
java? Could it be that you've missed the factory method 'open' ?
If you are new both to java and to Lucene, I recommend that you get a book,
such as "Lucene in Action".

Good Luck,
Oren Shir
