gekkokid,

does 1.4.3 benefit from multi-threading?

Sorry for not being clear. My tests show that both version does not benefit
from multi threading, but it is possible that I'm CPU bound, as Yonik kindly
reminded me.

is 1.9 the version in the source repository?

1.9 is the version in source repository.

It is rather sad if 10 threads reach the CPU limit. I'll check it and get
back to you.

Thanks,
Oren Shir
