SUBJECT: what is the best way to sort by document ids
DATE: 1 Nov 2005

Hi,

My documents contain a field called SORT_ID, which contains an int that
increases with every document added to the index. I want my results to be
sorted by it.

Which approach will prove the best performance:

1) Zero pad SORT_ID field and sort by it as plain text.
2) Sort using SortField for an INT.
3) Trust that using INDEXORDER will always return the same order as SORT_ID,
and use that.


Thanks,
Oren Shir
