SUBJECT: Reverse sorting by index order
DATE: 3 Nov 2005

Hi,

If I understand correctly, when sorting by Sort.INDEXORDER the oldest
documents that were added to the index will be returned first. I want the
reverse, because I'm more interested in newer documents.

1) Is there a simple way?

2) Will going over the Hits object in reverse order be much more consuming?

Thanks,
Oren Shir
