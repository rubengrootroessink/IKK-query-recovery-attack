Hi Luke

It's a good idea, but we need to know instantly the fail over happens.
We obtain a new instance of the index searcher every night anyway to
obtain the latest index.  When the fail over happens, the index location
is in the same place, but was wandering if there was a way to find out
if the index has changed without the database hit the first search hits
lucene after the failover.

Hope this explains the scenario more clearly.

Steve

Hi Steve;

Not sure if this would work...

Each day you could get the value from IndexReader's  getCurrentVersion
and
store it somewhere (DB or serialize it). The next day when you grab the
value again you could compare it to the stored one, if they differ you
would
know it has been replaced.
