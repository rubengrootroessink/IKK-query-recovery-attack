Hi,

 

We have an index of around 100,000 documents.

 

When we do a search for

"The integration of ERP into a logistics curriculum: applying a systems"

 

We get an index out of bounds exception.

 

There is a bug within bugzilla that indicates this problem.

Bug number. 10052

 

 

However this bug states the fixes have been included within the latest
release, however, these changes are not within the latest binary
release.  

 

WE've decompiled the Queryparser.class and the changes do not seem to
appear.  

 

Does anyone know when this bug fix will be released??

 

Cheers

 

Steve
