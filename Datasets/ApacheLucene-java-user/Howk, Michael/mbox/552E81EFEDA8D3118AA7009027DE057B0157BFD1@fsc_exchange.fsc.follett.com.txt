SUBJECT: Wildcard Searching
DATE: 27 Feb 2002

We're really struggling with trying to understand why the WildcardQuery
seems to strip out the question mark by replacing it with a space. We're
using the daily build, and a StandardAnalyzer. We've got the text "The Round
Window" in our index. If we search on "roun*" the Lucene QueryParser returns
a hit. When we search on "roun?", we don't get any hits. We don't even know
how to make heads or tails of the WildcardQuery or WildcardTermEnum classes.

Also, Lucene returns the parsed version of each of our searches. When we
search by rou*d, Lucene parses it as rou*d (which is what we would expect).
But when we search by rou?d, Lucene parses it as "rou d". It seems to wrap
the term in quotes and replace the question mark with a space. Any ideas? Or
can someone give us an idea of how to understand WildcardQuery or
WildcardTermEnum?
