SUBJECT: Using the question mark to search a single character
DATE: 22 Feb 2002

We've finally bit the bullet and jumped from RC2 to the nightly build. Now,
when we do a search that contains a question mark, it seems to replace the
question mark with a space. We're using the StandardAnalyzer, and we've
tried to find "mary had a little lamb" by using "ma?y", "littl?", and
"litt?e". None of these searches return the record. What do we need to
change in order to allow the question mark to work again?
