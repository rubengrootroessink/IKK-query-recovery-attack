SUBJECT: Readers synchronization
DATE: 8 Jul 2008

According to SVN history on the next version this will be available:

LUCENE-1044: IndexWriter with autoCommit=true now commits (such
    that a reader can see the changes) far less often than it used to.
    Previously, every flush was also a commit.  You can always force a
    commit by calling IndexWriter.commit().  Furthermore, in 3.0,
    autoCommit will be hardwired to false (IndexWriter constructors
    that take an autoCommit argument have been deprecated) (Mike
    McCandless)

Does this mean that I won't need to reopen all the readers in order to see the index changes?

Thanks
