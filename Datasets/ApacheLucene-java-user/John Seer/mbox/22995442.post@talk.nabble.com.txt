SUBJECT: Different Analyzer for different fields in the same document
DATE: 10 Apr 2009


Hello,
There is any way that a single document fields can have different analyzers
for different fields?

I think one way of doing it to create custom analyzer which will do field
spastic analyzes..

Any other suggestions?
