SUBJECT: Multi Value field
DATE: 7 Jul 2009


Hello,

I  have 100k index with documents with one searchable field in it. That
field has multiple values for example

doc( search: X search : X Y search: X Y Z id:1)
doc( search: X Y K id:2)

I am using Standard Analyzer for building and searching, and having problem
with scores

if the term is "X Y" the document 2 is getting higher score then document 1.


Please can someone suggest way that doc 1 will score higher? 
Maybe I need to use some specific query type? 

Thanks
