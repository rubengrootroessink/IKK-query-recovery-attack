SUBJECT: Date Range support
DATE: 29 Jan 2004

Hi,

I'm trying to create an index which can also be searched with date ranges. My first attempt
using the Lucene date format ran in to trouble after my index grew and I couldn't search over
more than a few days.
I saw some other posts explaining why this happens and the suggestion seemed to be to use
strings of the format yyyyMMdd. Using that format worked great until I remembered that my
search needs to be able to support different timezones. Adding the hour to my field causes
the same problem above and my queries stop working when using a range of about 2 months.
I briefly looked at using the DateFilter but a good thread in the archive suggests this won't
work too well under my conditions (http://java2.5341.com/msg/5138.html). I'm looking to index
about 1000 documents for each day and my search ranges could be as narrow as one day or as
broad as a year.
At the moment I'm thinking of having two date fields, one formatted with yyyyMMdd and the
other yyyyMMddHHmm and so get Lucene to do me a rough match down to an accuracy of +1 day
either side of the range and then process the more detailed date outside of Lucene (to cope
with timezones).
I'm going to try it out, but if there is any simpler method I've missed I'd be happy to know.

Thanks
Tom.
