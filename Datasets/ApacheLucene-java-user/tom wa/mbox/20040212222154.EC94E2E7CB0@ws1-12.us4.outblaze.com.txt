(Sorry it's taken me a while to reply)

It wasn't slow, my timeout is far greater than the time it takes to come back with no hits.

A small example of a query would be (date: [200306081900 TO 200306201200]) AND (text: sometext)
and this will return zero hits. The index contains about 1000 items for each 24hr period and
the total number of documents was about 150k. I had the same results when using Lucene's built
in date format too. If you think it should be able to cope with what I am trying to do then
I'll take another look.

Thanks again.

Tom.
