hi!
i am using lucene1.2 in a file sharing system, my average file amount
is about 400 totalling about 50megs (small), when run on linux it is
fine using jdk1.4.1, however using jdk1.4.1 on windows i get an outof
memory error. i am using pdfbox 0.6.1, i have also tried 0.5.6, however
same problem. i am not sure where the problem lies,whether pdfbox or
lucene or something in jdk, but was wondering if anyone else had the
same experience.. or a solution
thanks
