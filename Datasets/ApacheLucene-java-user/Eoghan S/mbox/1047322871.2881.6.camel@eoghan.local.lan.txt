hi!
i am currently in my final year of a software engineering degree, for my
project i have built a distributed search engine and file sharing system
using Sun's JXTA technology and lucene. i am currently in the process of
writing my thesis and have been in search of detailed information on
lucene, such as the page ranking algorithm, etc. Any information or
links to same would be greatly appreciated.

thanks!!
