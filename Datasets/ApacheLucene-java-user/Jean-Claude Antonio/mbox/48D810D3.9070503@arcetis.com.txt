Hello,

If I had a file with the following content:
...
object.method();
...
I would like to be able to query for
object
method
object.method

My guess is that I should store not only "object.method", but also 
"object" and "method" as I cannot query *method.
Any other suggestion?

Kind regards,

JClaude
