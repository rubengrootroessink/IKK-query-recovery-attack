SUBJECT: Update document with fields which are not stored
DATE: 15 May 2008

Hello,

We are using lucene for a while, and we are happy with it. Now we want 
to optimize some space.
We are parsing versions of files and we want to keep track of history 
and also know which one is the newest we set a flag to it (field 
newest=true).
so when a new version comes along :
- we want to set the field "newest" of the current document to false.
To do so, we delete the document
and add a new document with the same fields
- then we add this new file with field newest=true

This work perfectly, but for this we need to have a content field as
new Field("content", content, Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED)
to be able to update the current document which stores the content.

We wish not to store the content as the size of the index gets big.

Is there a way to get the tokenized field value which is not stored?
Or it would be great if we could use a method like 
IndexWriter.updateDocuments(Query) but the only one is 
IndexWriter.updateDocuments(Term).

Any hint?

Best regards,

Jean-Claude
