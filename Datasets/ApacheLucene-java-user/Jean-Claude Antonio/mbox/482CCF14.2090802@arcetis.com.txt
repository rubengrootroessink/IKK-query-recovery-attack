SUBJECT: Re: Update document with fields which are not stored
DATE: 16 May 2008

Thanks Karl.
My apologies for the duplicate mail sent.

 >>Is Lucene your primary data store?
Almost, as most properties of my items can be queried. I would like to 
be able to "not" store these fields though, but the fact that I need to 
update my documents (delete + create), forces me to store them.
I do not store term vectors (I have never used them).
I will have a look at it + LUCENE-1016 if can help. And let you know.
Thanks for your help!
