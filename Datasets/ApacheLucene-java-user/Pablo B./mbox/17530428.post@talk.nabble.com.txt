SUBJECT: "No tvx file" error
DATE: 29 May 2008


Hello,

I am writing a code to convert all text files in subdirectories from a given
path to Arff file for weka. To do so, I am using lucene-1.4.3.jar. The call
to method writer.add(doc) outputs (only for some text files) the error
message "No tvx file", were writer is type IndexWriter and doc is type
Document.
If I change the name of the files that trigger this message, the error does
not occur on them but it is output for other files with which it worked
correctly. i am going crazy! 

In some forums I have read it is only a warning message, but I cannot ignore
it because it does not index those files, so later, in my own code, when I
call termFreqVector.getTerms() for the failing file, it returns a null
pointer exception, which does not make sense because the file has text in
it!

Any one can help?
Thank you in advanced,
Pablo.
