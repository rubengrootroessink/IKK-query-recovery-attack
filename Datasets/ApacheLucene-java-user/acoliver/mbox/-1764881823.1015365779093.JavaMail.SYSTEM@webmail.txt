Ahh.  As it stands Lucene is more of a *search api* then drop in indexing
application like htDig.  

Myself and some other developers will be working on adding application
extensions to Lucene (still in the planning stage): 
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/luceneplan.html

At current there is no easy way to just configure some file and attach some
plugins and hit go... 

Here are some contributed analyzers etc:

http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/contributions.html

So at the moment you actually have to write a Java application to search the
intranet and index it.  Lucene just provides the library for indexing and
searching hte index.  How you *get* the documents and *get* the data from
the documents is pretty much left in your hands.
