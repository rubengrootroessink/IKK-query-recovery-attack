You're going into a subdirectory of the webapps directory and creating your
index relative to that directory.  This causes the index to contain paths
like /luceneweb/../examples/index.jsp..  This is a moronic way to handle the
context/url problem, but it works well enough for this simple example.. 
Does that clear up what you're looking for?
