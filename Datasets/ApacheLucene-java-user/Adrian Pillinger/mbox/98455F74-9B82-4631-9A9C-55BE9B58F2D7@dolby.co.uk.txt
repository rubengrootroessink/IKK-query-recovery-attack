SUBJECT: Problem with ConstantScoreRangeQuery
DATE: 29 Oct 2007

I am programatically creating a query as follows.

     BooleanQuery query = new BooleanQuery();
     ConstantScoreRangeQuery range = new ConstantScoreRangeQuery 
("creationDate", "19500101", "20071029", false, false);
     query.add(range, Occur.MUST);

I am then executing the query which unexpectedly returns no results.

If I take the toString() of the boolean query I get

+creationDate:{19500101 TO 20071029}

Executing this in luke against the exact same index returns results  
as I expect.


Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?


The reason I am using a BooleanQuery is that I want to add extra  
clauses to this query once it is working.

Thanks
Adrian
