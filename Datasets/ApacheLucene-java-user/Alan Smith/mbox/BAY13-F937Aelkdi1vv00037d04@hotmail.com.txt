SUBJECT: Index Level Term Frequency
DATE: 6 Apr 2004

Hi,

Is there a way to get frequency of a term within the full index. There are a 
few methods in IndexReader to get the frequency of a term within a document 
and it seems reasonable that way because the index is per document. My 
application, however, needs to get the frequency of all terms in a 
particular field. Is this information stored somewhere in the index which 
can be retrieved easily rather than adding all the frequencies of that term 
in the documents it occurs in?

Thanks,
Alan
