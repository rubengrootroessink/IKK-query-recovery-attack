Hi

Ive just got a couple of questions which i cant quite work out...wondered if 
someone could help me with them:

1. What happens if i make a backup (copy) of an index while documents are 
being added? Can it cause problems, and if so is there a way to safely do 
this?

2. When I create a new IndexSearcher, what method does Lucene use to take a 
'snapshot' of the index (because if i add documents after the search object 
is created they dont appear in the search results)?

Many thanks

Al
