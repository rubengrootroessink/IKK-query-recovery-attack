Well, I read this (in the FAQ) that I should use only a single 
Searcher/Reader. And I really would like to but I ran into some FSDirectory 
IO synchronized{} bottleneck and hence (still) don't see any alternative to 
pooling multiple seachers (which waste a lot of memory).

Even LUCENE-997 doesn't produce relief here... :-\

But in general, since IndexSearcher is single-threaded I don't think that this 
a wise approach. No matter how large the index, no matter the IO system, no 
matter how many queries you want all this to go thru a single thread? How 
long since does a single thread plus synchronous IO scale?

However I yet didn't find any discussion on this topic so I'd be glad if 
somebody could give me a link.
