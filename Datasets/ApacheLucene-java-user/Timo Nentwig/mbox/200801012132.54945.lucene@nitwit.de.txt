Yes, it takes quite some time to build it and it's not changed but rebuilt 
from scratch.

I recently talked to a guy how stated that they'd solved their performance 
issues by breaking up the index into multiple sub-indices and searching them 
in parallel (probably using ParallelMultiSearcher)...hmm, well, I've had (and 
still have) my doubts but on the other hand what's the benefit of 
ParallelMultiSearcher if it doesn't scale better than searching a monolithic 
index?
