The ngram approach is probably more powerful regarding the quality of the 
search result (rememberin the "Al Jazeera" example in LIA) however it will 
blow up the index in size tremendously.

Can somebody estimate whether it's more promising to keep the index as small 
as possible and hold it completely in a RAMDirectory (or MMapDirectory, 
LUCENE-1035 whatever)? What is it that takes the time in 
FuzzyQuery.rewrite() - IO or CPU? Or both?
