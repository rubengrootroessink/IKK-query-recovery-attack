SUBJECT: Why exactly are fuzzy queries so slow?
DATE: 24 Nov 2007

Hi!

I search an 1.5 gig index and fuzzy queries are really slow; something like 
avg. ~500ms (IndexSearcher.search(Query, HitCollector)). 

When performing exact queries I archieve response times <25ms. What is it that 
makes fuzzy queries so slow? Increased index access due to more terms, i.e. 
disk IO?

And no, my fuzzy queries (fuzzy factor 0.8) don't blow up to a boolean query 
with 100s clauses but maybe something...less than 10.

Thanks
Timo

P.S. arent' there any "best practices" for lucene? Does everybody have to find 
out on his own (over and over again) and spend a lot of time reading and 
understanding lucene's code base?
