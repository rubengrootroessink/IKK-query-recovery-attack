SUBJECT: IndexSearcher.close() doesn't close Directory
DATE: 20 Apr 2008

Hi!

I advised Directory.close() (AspectJ) and noticed that it's not called at all 
for the following code:

final FSDirectory d = FSDirectory.getDirectory( path );
final IndexReader r = IndexReader.open( d );
final IndexSearcher s = new IndexSearcher( r );
...
s.close();
r.close();
d.close(); // Directory isn't closed by IndexSearcher nor by IndexReader

I think that should be mentioned in javadoc.
