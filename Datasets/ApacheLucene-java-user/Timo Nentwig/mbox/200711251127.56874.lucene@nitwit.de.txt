Well, javadoc: "prefixLength - length of common (non-fuzzy) prefix". So, this 
is some kind of "wildcard fuzzy" but not real fuzzy anymore. 

I understand the optimitation but right now I hardly can image a reasonable 
use-case. Who care whether the levenstein distance is a the beginnen, middle 
or end of word, .e.g when searching fuzzy for "philes" I want to 
find "files"...
