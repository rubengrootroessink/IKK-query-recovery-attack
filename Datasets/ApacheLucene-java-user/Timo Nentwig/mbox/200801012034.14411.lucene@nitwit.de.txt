Hmm? But it will be different instances anyway. And that's all you need to use 
it a key for a WeakHashMap. Maybe we are talking at cross-purposes...

I suggest to use reader.directory() instead of reader as key for the 
WeakHashMap. This way multiple IndexSearcher/IndexReacher instances would 
share the cache.
