SUBJECT: Sorting consumes hundreds of MBytes RAM
DATE: 13 Apr 2008

Hi!

I found that when sorting the search result -depending on the amount of data 
in the field to sort by - this can easily lead to FieldCacheImpl to allocate 
hundreds of MByte RAM.

How does this work internally? It seems as if all data for this field found in 
the entire index is read into memory (?).

And question #2: what am I going to do against it? Index  sharding?

Thanks,
Timo
