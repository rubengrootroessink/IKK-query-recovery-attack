Hi!

I do have different document types (Books, Magazines, Author whatever) in the 
index and a FieldSelector is document type specific (for Books LOAD isbn and 
title for Author name, ...). The document type can be determined by a field 
surprisingly called documentType.

How am I going to do this? Reading twice? First IndexReader.document() only 
the documentType and then choose proper FieldSelector and read again? 

Thanks,
timo
