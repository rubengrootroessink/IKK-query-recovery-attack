SUBJECT: @todo parallelize this one too
DATE: 5 May 2008

Hi!

Unfortunately the search method in ParallelMultiSearcher which is able to take 
an HitCollector isn't running in parallel and there' even an issue regarding 
this (LUCENE-990) with zero watchers or votes :-\

So this isn't something that's likely to be done in near future, is it?

And question #2: what's the problem parallizing this one actually? Naively I 
would simply run the queries in multiple threads and OR the resulting BitSets 
(well, which is a implementation detail and not part of the HitCollector 
API...). And I must admit that I don't know what this scorer.score(reader) in 
the corresponding method in IndexSearcher really does actually...
