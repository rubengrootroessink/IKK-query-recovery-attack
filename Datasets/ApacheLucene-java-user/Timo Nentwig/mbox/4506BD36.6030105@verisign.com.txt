SUBJECT: Storing fields without term positions
DATE: 12 Sep 2006

Hi everybody,

is it possible to store fields without term position (the .prx file) data? We store sort of
custom
data in the field and use it as some sort of a filter for queries, so we just don't need any
term
position data and it bloats the index' size nearly by factor 3.

Thanks
Timo
