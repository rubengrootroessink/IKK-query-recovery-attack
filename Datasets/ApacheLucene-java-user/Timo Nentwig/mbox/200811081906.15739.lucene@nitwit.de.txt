SUBJECT: How to combine filter in Lucene 2.4?
DATE: 8 Nov 2008

Hi!

Since Filter.bits() is deprecated and replaced by getDocIdSet() now I wonder 
how I am supposed to combine (AND) filters (for facets).

I worked around this issue by extending Filter and let getDocIdSet() return an 
OpenBitSet to ensure that this implementation is used everywhere and casting 
to OpenBitSet will work but this is really not clean code.

Thanks
Timo
