SUBJECT: CachingWrapperFilter: why cache per IndexReader?
DATE: 1 Jan 2008

Hi!

Is there are particular reason why CachingWrapperFilter caches per IndexReader 
and not per IndexReader.directory()? If there are multiple 
IndexSearcher/IndexReader instances (and only one Directory) cache will be 
built and held in memory redundantly. I don't see any sense in doing so (?).

Thanks for hints...
Timo
