SUBJECT: RE: Problem using RAMDirectory as a buffer
DATE: 22 Jun 2007


Nope, doesn't work.
I've tried:
....
ramWriter.addDocument(doc);
ramWriter.flush();
ramWriter.close();
fsWriter.addIndexes(new Directory[] {ramDir,});
....


Any other suggestions?

Thanks,
Tanya
PS As I said this is just a trivial test I created because it didn't work
for more complicated problem

You should close or flush the ramWriter before you add the ramDir to the
fsWriter, otherwise the docs won't get flushed to the ramDir.

But I share Daniel's opinion. IndexWriter has it's own buffer internally.
