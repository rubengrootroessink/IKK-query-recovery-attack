Hi,

 

I've just downloaded Lucene, tried demo and looked at the documentation. The
Indexing and Searching work great and fast but  I also need to display all
the actual "hits":  the lines from the files that match a particular query.
Does Lucene provide means to do it?

 

Thanks a lot,

 

Tanya
