Dear Suneetha,
visit http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html
for the syntax about query. But this is for basic html search. But I think if you want to
search through email's ToAddress field, You have a create an index which stores the toAddress
than only you can retereve the search for toAddress.

Hope this will help you

Regards
Ravi
