Dear Suneetha,
As far as I know the lucene is not case sensitive.

Are you storing the Domain also as a field in the index . If yes than you can refine your
query as "toAddress:abc* AND Domain:xyz.com"

Otherwise you can refine it using fuzzy search.
"toAddress:abc* AND toAddress:@xyz.com~"

Hope this will help You

Regards

Ravi

want to search through email's ToAddress field, You have a create an index which stores the
toAddress than only you can retereve the search for toAddress.
