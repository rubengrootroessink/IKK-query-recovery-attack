hi,
Yes You need Java Server/JSP engine to run webapplication demo .
If are using any jsp/servlet engine . Configure the luceneweb.war application with the demo
in the jsp engine.

Then create the index file for serach.
For that you have to add lucene-2.1.jar and lucene-demos-2.1.jar in your classpath.

the Index can be created by
java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index pathtostoreindex pathofyourdocumentstobeindexed


modify the path of index in the configuration.jsp in the luceneweb.jar 

This will make your search engine work

Hope this will help you
Reagrds
Ravi
