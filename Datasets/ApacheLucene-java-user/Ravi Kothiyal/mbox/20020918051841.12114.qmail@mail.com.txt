Hi Tim,

Thanks for your help. I had created the index but that was empty. Later on I populated it
with IndexFiles . I added a directory to the index. the location of directory is d:/xyz .
When i searched the files using luceneweb it shows result with null as hyperlink. It return
url and summary as null .  Later I found that it stores the document path also and i can get
that document path .

Can you please tell me how to store the document summary and url along with the document in
the index . It will be nice of you.

Regards
Ravi
