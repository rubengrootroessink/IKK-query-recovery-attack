SUBJECT: problems with HTML Parser
DATE: 14 Aug 2002

Has anyone noticed that the HTML Parser that comes with
Lucene joins terms together when parsing a file.
I used to think it was my PDFParser but after fixing that
I found out it was the HMTLParser.

I managed to find a replacement parser that doesn't join terms.

Just wondered if anyone had come across this problem??
