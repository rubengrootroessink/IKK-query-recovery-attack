SUBJECT: Re: Out of memory in lucene 1.4.1 when re-indexing  large number of documents
DATE: 10 Sep 2004

The Parser is pdfBox. pdf is about 25% of the over all indexing volume  
on the productive system. I also have word-docs and loads of hmtl 
resources to be indexed.
In my testing environment I merely have 5 pdf docs and still those 
permanent object hanging around, though.
Cheers,
Daniel
