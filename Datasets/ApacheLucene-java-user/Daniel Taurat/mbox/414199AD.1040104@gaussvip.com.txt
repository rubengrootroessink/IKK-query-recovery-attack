Well, it seems not to be files, it looks more like those SegmentTermEnum 
objects accumulating in memory.
#I've seen some discussion on these objects in the developer-newsgroup 
that had taken place some time ago.
I am afraid this is some kind of runaway caching I have to deal with.
Maybe not  correctly addressed in this newsgroup, after all...

Anyway: any idea if there is an API command to re-init caches?

Thanks,

Daniel
