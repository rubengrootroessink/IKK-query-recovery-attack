Damn. That's no good, then. What about doing it the opposite way:  
make a QueryFilter for each category (these could be cached between  
search sessions), and use those to filter the results from searching  
for the user's query? Would that actually be any faster than the  
original idea of constructing a boolean query for each category?

Not exactly fixed, but it probably won't change too often, and it  
will definitely be known at query time. So close enough.

Did you mean PriorityQueue?

Can you explain what you mean by that? I'm looking at the javadocs  
for FieldCache, but there's no indication of how to obtain one.
