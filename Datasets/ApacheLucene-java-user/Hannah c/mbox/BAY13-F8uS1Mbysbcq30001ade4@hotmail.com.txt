Hi,

I had a quick look at the sandbox but my problem is that I don't need a 
spanish stemmer. However there must be a replacement tokenizer that supports 
foreign characters to go along with the foreign language snowball stemmers. 
Does anyone know where I could find one?

In answer to Peters question -yes I'm also using "UTF-8" encoded XML 
documents as the source.
I also put below an example of what is happening when I tokenize the text 
using the StandardTokenizer below.

Thanks Hannah
