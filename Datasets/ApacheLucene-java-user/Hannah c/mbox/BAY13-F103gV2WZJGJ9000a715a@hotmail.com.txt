SUBJECT: Progress bar for Lucene
DATE: 28 Jul 2004


Hi,

Is there anything in lucene that would help with the implementation of a 
progress bar. Somewhere I could throw an event that says the search is 10%, 
20% complete etc.  Or is there already an implementation of a progress bar 
available for lucene.

Thanks for your help,
Hannah
