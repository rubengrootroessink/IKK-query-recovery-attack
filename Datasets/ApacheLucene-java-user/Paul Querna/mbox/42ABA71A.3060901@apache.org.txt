Not if we applied the patch I sent to dev@httpd on Friday.  It fixes 
mod_disk_cache's handling of Vary: to keep separate copies for each 
combo, instead of only a single copy.

Moin should be sending Cache-Control: Private in these cases, in 
addition to the Vary: Cookie header.  If they don't they will break with 
other upstream proxies that we have no control over.  Fixing it so httpd 
can cache fixes upstream proxies too, so it is the right thing to do.
