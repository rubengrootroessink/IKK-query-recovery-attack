SUBJECT: Re: Using lucene to search a bunch of keywords?
DATE: 23 Jul 2008

Heh, actually I'm using Perl but I've always associated text-search  
with Lucene, I'm not sure if it's the best solution or not. On the  
small side there are 1.6 million keywords, on the large side there are  
well over 100 million but I might find another way to break down the  
searches into smaller searches(send A-G server1, H-R to server2...etc).

Is there another search tool that might be better suited for  
this...the only thing I can relate this too is how AdWords works. A  
user enters a query in the Google search box and they search their  
database for people who've purchased those keywords to the appropriate  
ads.  What I'm doing is similar but without the payday. :-{

Currently I'm using a (huge) hash table and regular expressions  
($query =~ /$keyword/) going down the list from largest to smallest  
but I know this is not a long term solution especially if I have to  
load the large 100 million+ list in.

Thanks.
