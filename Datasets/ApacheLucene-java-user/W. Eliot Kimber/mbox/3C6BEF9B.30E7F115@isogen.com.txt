The PJ library from www.etymon.com provides a pretty complete and
easy-to-use API for getting info from PDF docs. It wouldn't be too hard
to write a PDF indexer for Lucene using this library. The main challenge
would be guessing word boundaries in strings where spaces have been
replaced with explicit shift values by the formatter.

Cheers,
