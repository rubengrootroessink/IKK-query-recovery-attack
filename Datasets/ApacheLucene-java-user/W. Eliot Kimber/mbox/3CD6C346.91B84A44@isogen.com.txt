SUBJECT: PDF4J Project: Gathering Feature Requests
DATE: 6 May 2002

I have set up the project PDF4J on SourceForge
(http://pdf4j.sourceforge.net). At this point we are simply gathering
requirements--we are not yet ready to start writing code.  Supporting
the needs of tools like Lucene is one of our key target use cases, so we
would be very interested to know what Lucene integrators would want from
a PDF access library.

Thanks,

Eliot
