SUBJECT: XML Indexing With Lucene: New Location For Package
DATE: 1 Feb 2002

You can now find our package for doing XML indexing with Lucene on the
ISOGEN web site:

http://www.isogen.com/papers/lucene_xml_indexing.html

The package (lucene_xml_indexing.zip) includes all the 3rd-party
libraries it depends on (Lucene, Xerces 1.4.4, junit).

This package is provided as-is and is not actively supported, but I do
want to know if you run into any problems using it.

Cheers,
