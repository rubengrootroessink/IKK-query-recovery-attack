SUBJECT: XML Lucene Indexing Package Updated
DATE: 15 May 2002

I have updated the demo Lucene XML indexing package at
<http://www.isogen.com/papers/lucene_xml_indexing.zip>. This new release
includes code improvements from Brandon Jockman and some slightly better
build and run scripts.

You should be able to unzip the package and run the
LuceneClient/runLuceneClient.bat script (on Windows) and it should just
work. If it doesn't, let me know.

Cheers,

Eliot
