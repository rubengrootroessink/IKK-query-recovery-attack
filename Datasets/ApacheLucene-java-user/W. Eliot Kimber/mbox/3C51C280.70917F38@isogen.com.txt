The XML indexing scheme we developed for Lucene here at ISOGEN (and
posted about late last year) provides more complete XML indexing than
Verity can provide because it is not limited by some of the constraints
inherent in Verity's zone mechanism. Our indexing approach is also
infinitely more flexible than Verity's (or any of other commercial
systems) because relatively simple Java code can be used to extend the
default indexing to optimize for specific DTDs or types of queries.

Also, Verity is, as far as I know, unable to index elements are
attributes that have "." (period) in their names because their indexers
always treat "." as a word separator. Doh.

Of the commercial full-text indexers that do XML indexing, my analysis
is that Verity does the best job, but it is still, in my opinion, not
sufficiently complete or flexible to be useful in production. Otherwise,
Verity is a full-text fine indexing system.
