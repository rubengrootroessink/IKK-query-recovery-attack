SUBJECT: How to rebuild index
DATE: 21 Jan 2011

Hi,
I am new to lucene. Recently I was assigned for some lucene related
workitems.
Now there is one problem. Before, we use StandardAnalyzer in our
application, and our application has been online for about two years.
Now, we must to write a Custom Analyzer to replace the StandarAnalyzer for
enhancement requirement.
But there are already much exists production data and the lucene
index(generated with StandardAnalyzer).
What I need to do if I change to use the new Custom Analyzer?
>From the book "Lucene In Action". I see follow sentence:
"If you’re changing analyzers, you should rebuild your index using the new
analyzer so that all documents are analyzed in the same manner."

But I don't know how to rebuild the exists index with a new Analyzer. I
can't find a API related to this.
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks In Advance.
