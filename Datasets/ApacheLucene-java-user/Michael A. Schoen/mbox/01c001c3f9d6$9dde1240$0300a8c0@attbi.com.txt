SUBJECT: problem with SearchFiles demo
DATE: 23 Feb 2004

I'm sure there's some obvious explanation for this that I'm missing -- I
can't get the SearchFiles demo class to work. I can successfully use the
IndexFiles class to index a directory, but searching doesn't work; I just
get a NullPointerException.

So I wrote my own Search class, which is basically just a slightly tweaked
version of SearchFiles. And I get a NullPointerException there as well. I
added a stack trace, which shows the exception coming from
IndexSearcher.explain().

Any ideas?

I've attached the source for Search.java, and below is the stack trace.

thanks,
Michael
