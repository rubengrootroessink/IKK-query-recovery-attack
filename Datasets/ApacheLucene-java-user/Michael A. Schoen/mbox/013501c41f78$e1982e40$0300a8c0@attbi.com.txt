So as Venu pointed out, sorting doesn't seem to help the problem. If we have
to walk the result set, access docs and dedupe using brute force, we're
better off w/ the standard order by relevance.

If you've got an example of this type of clustering done in a more efficient
way, that'd be great.

Any other ideas?
