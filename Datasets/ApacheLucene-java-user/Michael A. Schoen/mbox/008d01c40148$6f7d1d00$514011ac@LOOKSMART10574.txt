DATE: 3 Mar 2004

This recently submitted query parser for Plucene (the perl port of lucene)
seems very handy.

Does something similar already exist for Lucene? Any volunteers? It seems
like a pretty straightforward extension to MultiFieldQueryParser.

> NAME
>     Plucene::Plugin::WeightedQueryParser - Specify weights for unqualified
>     terms
>
> SYNOPSIS
>       use Plucene::Plugin::WeightedQueryParser;
>       my $parser = Plucene::WeightedQueryParser->new({
>               analyzer =>
Plucene::Plugin::Analyzer::PorterAnalyzer->new(),
>               weights  => {
>                 title => 5,
>                 subtitle => 2,
>                 body => 1
>               }
>       });
>       $parser->parse($q);
>
> DESCRIPTION
>     Quite often, you want unqualified search terms ("hello") to search in
>     either the title, the body or some other part of you document. The
usual
>     way to do this is to create another field, "content", and throw
>     everything in that, then make that the default field for unqualified
>     terms.
>
>     That's fine, until you want to add different weighting for terms - so
>     terms found in the title of a document come first, then those in the
>     subtitle, then the body of the document.
>
>     This module automatically remaps unqualified search terms, such as
>     "hello" to "(title:hello^5 OR subtitle:hello^2 OR body:hello^1)",
based
>     on the weights passed in to the constructor.
