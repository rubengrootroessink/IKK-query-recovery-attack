SUBJECT: Indexing Strategy for 20 million documents
DATE: 8 Oct 2004

I am a new user of Lucene.  I am looking to index over 20 million
documents (and a lot more someday) and am looking for ideas on the best
indexing/search strategy.  

Which will optimize the Lucene search, one index or multiple indexes?
Do I create multiple indexes and merge them all together?  Or do I
create multiple indexes and search on the multiple indexes?  

Any helpful ideas would be appreciated!
