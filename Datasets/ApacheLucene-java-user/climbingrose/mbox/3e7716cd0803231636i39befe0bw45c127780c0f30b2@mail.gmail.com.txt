SUBJECT: Implement a relaxed PhraseQuery?
DATE: 23 Mar 2008

Hi all,

I posted this in Solr mailing but then I thought it would be more
appropriate to have it here.

I thought many people would encounter the situation I'm having here.
Basically, we'd like to have a PhraseQuery with "minimum should match"
property similar to BooleanQuery. Consider the query "Senior Java
Developer":

1) I'd like to do a PhraseQuery on "Senior Java Developer" with a slop of
say 2, so that the query only matches documents with these words located in
proximity. I don't want to match documents like "Senior <Huge block of text>
Java <Huge block of Text> Developer".
2) I also want to relax PhraseQuery a bit so that it not only match "Senior
Java Developer"~2 but also matches "Java Developer"~2 but of course with a
lower score. I can programmatically generate on the combination but it's not
gonna be efficient if user issues query with many terms.

It looks like the only solution is to hack PhraseScorer and its subclasses.
Has anyone done this before? If yes, please share your experience.
