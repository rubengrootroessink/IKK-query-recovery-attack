SUBJECT: query separate by point
DATE: 9 Sep 2003

Hi all,

I use StandardAnalyzer to index and to search.

If I make a query like "comp.lang.javascript", it return no hit but if I make this query "comp.lang.javascript*",
it return the goods hits I want to have.

Anybody know how I could return the hits without having the * ?

Maybe changing the analyser?

Thanks in advance

SÃ©bastien
