SUBJECT: différents Analyzer for 2 fields
DATE: 14 Sep 2003

Hi,

I've an another question.

For indexing my documents I use this code :
writer = new IndexWriter(index, new StandardAnalyzer(), create);

I use 2 fields "content" and "title" but I would use différents Analyzer for this 2 fields
(one who could use numerical and the other not, for example)
Is there a way to do this?

thanks in advance

Sébastien
