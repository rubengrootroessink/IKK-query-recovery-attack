SUBJECT: AND instead OR for the search
DATE: 4 Aug 2003

Hi everybody,

When I make a search, for example : "Jakarta lucene"

The search engine interpret the query like "Jakarta OR lucene"

I wish this could be "Jakarta AND lucene" (like the most of internet search engine) because
the OR clause is not very intuitive for the users.

Could we use a method for using AND instead OR when we use Lucene?

Tanks for advance

SÃ©bastien
