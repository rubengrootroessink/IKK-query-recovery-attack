SUBJECT: How can i Tokenize money values?
DATE: 11 Aug 2006

Hello all!,
    How can i tokenize money values? 
    Example: $25000, u$s45000, etc, so that i can search for "$25000" or "$250*"
    I think de "StandardTokenizer" class is the responsible for tokenize the content of the
field based on the grammar generated by javaCC, the question is: I have to override the StandardTokenizer
or i can use Filter's to solve this problem?

Thank's in advance!
