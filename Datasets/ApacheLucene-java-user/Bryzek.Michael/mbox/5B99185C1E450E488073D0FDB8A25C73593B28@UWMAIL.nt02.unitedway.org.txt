We used Oracle interMedia/Text for search within the RDMS beginning with oracle 8i through
oracle 10g. Two primary reasons we switched to solr/lucene:

  * We saw random errors (< .1% of the time) when users ran full text search. We believe
the source of this error occurred during index update as users ran searches. Oracle support
and our team never resolved this issue. We prefer to update our data set 2-4 times per hour
and could never find a reliable way to do this with Oracle.

  * When we upgraded to Oracle 10g release 2, the frequency of these errors increased 10 fold
and necessitated the change to another solution (Oracle support again could not diagnose root
cause of our application errors). We first implemented Lucene, but then found Solr and have
been extremely pleased. Solr offers the benefit of a standard XML HTTP API which allows us
to expose search to all sorts of applications and partners with no additional effort.

We run oracle on redhat linux, so your mileage may vary. We also run standard edition one
now, but oracle text was made part of this edition a few years ago. 

In implementing, we've found a few other features that are quite nice:

  * If we change our indexing strategy (e.g. a new analyzer), we can stop the update process,
index our data in a separate environment, transfer the new index datafiles to production,
and restart the instance. You might be able to do full online rebuilds with Oracle Text, but
with lucene it just a non issue.

  * Indexing is fast

  * Scaling search separate from RDBMS is a real blessing

Hi -

I'm currently looking into adding full text search capabilities to our
site.  While some threads in this list had the same basic question (RDBMS
full-text versus lucene), their configurations and conderns were different.
Here's my configuration

* RDBMS is Enteprise Oracle 10g
* RAC-enabled RDMBS
* Dual fiber chanel RAID-5 configuration
* 2-node cluster
* 8GB RAM/per node
* Dual 3.6GHz Intel CPU/per node
* 99% of the content to be indexed is stored in our RDBMS
* Largest table size today 3 Billion (with a B) records
* Average table size 3 Million records

The question is, then, should I use Oracle 10g's full text capabilities or
lucene?

Since we have the oracle enteprise license, cost is not an issue (oracle
text comes with it).    I was able to create a demo using lucene in less
than 1/2 day, and we're looking towards creating the same demo using oracle
10g's full text search capabilities

Some ppl in this list migrated from RDBMS to lucene because of:
* speed - lucene is faster
* RDBMS server off load (someone reported they offloaded 70% of db server
work)
* cost (they didn't have the enteprise oracle license)
* index size - lucene indexes are smaller
* while some people had question with interMedia, I didn't find much
information with the newer Oracle 10g's full text search capabilties

Any thoughts?  Thanks in advance.
