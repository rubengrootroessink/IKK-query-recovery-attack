SUBJECT: Re: How to track database changes at run time to update index in Lucene ?
DATE: 11 Jan 2006

For changes in the database, you can:
- use the server side business object that also does the update of the BO in
the database, and which currently does also the indexing in lucene
- use the front-end (browser I presume if I see AJAX, which is nothing more
than XmlHttp), but would not be my preference ... (use servlet or bean or
... instead)
- use the database if it supports database triggers

But an update in the database will mean an delete and insert in Lucene, as
far as I know.
Remaining things (like push changed backend data to client) has nothing to
do with Lucene.

Kind regards,

Dick
