Hi Ian,

  Yes, I did implement Eric's suggestion last week, but couldn't help.
 I am using a demo program from Lucene.jar to test this, let me put a code here.

  doc.add(Field.Keyword("keywords", "MAIN BOARD"));
  while indexing

and for retrieving

 PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper analyzer = new PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper( new StandardAnalyzer() );
 analyzer.addAnalyzer( "keywords", new KeywordAnalyzer() );

/* QueryParser qp = new QueryParser(line,analyzer);
  qp.setLowercaseWildcardTerms(false);
  Query query = qp.parse(line, "keywords", analyzer);
*/
 Query query = QueryParser.parse(line, "keywords", analyzer);

  you can see Eric's suggestion implemented in commented line.

 am I doing something wrong here ? please let me know.

  thanks and regards

  Rahul Thakare..

used keywordAnalyzer, but wild card search is not coming up. Is there anything which I need
to do in addition or, wild card search is not possible with keyword field.
