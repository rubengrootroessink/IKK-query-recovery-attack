SUBJECT: searching in social networks
DATE: 25 Sep 2006

I am using lucene for simple flat searches. Now I have a requirement to 
do searches based on the object's connectivity with other objects. The 
way the searches are done in "social networks". Lets say I want to 
search for a query in only those objects which are within 3 degrees of 
connectivity to a given object.

Has any body tried this kind of feature with lucene? Any pointers will 
be appreciated.

thanks
sharad
