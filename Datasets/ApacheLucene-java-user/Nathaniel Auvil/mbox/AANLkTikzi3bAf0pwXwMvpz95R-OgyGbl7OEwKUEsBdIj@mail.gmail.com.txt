SUBJECT: Re: search for a string which begins with a '$' character
DATE: 2 Jul 2010

I am using this analyzer: @Analyzer(impl =
org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer.class)

"$" is not inlcluded in the STOP_WORDS for this analyzer.  Is there
somewhere else i should be looking?  When i use Luke with the
standardAnalyzer, it does not parse the query.  Is there a way to see why?
