SUBJECT: search for a string which begins with a '$' character
DATE: 1 Jul 2010

i am trying to search for a value which begins with a '$' or even sometimes
'$$'.  '$' is not listed as a special character and no matter what i try, i
can not get a search for $* to return anything.  Using Luke, i browse my
index and see several entries where the value exists with a leading '$'.
How can i search for these?
