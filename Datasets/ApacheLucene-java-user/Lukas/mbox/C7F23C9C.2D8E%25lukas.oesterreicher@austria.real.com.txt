Well, how would this look like in code?
Currently I have the prefix query like this:

BooleanQuery bQuery = new BooleanQuery();
PrefixQuery prefixQuery = new PrefixQuery(new Term("item.name", termText));
bQuery.add( prefixQuery, Occur.MUST);

I dont see any class named PrefixTerm.
I'd appreciate it if you could show me how it is done in java code.
