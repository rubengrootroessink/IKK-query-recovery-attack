SUBJECT: Combining PrefixQuery and FuzzyQuery
DATE: 19 Apr 2010

Hello.

Is it possible to combine PrefixQuery and FuzzyQuery?
The search on a term should both be fuzzy but also match with results that
jut begin with that token (or an approximation of that token).

If it is possible, can you give me an example on how to achieve this?

Currently I only use the PrefixQuery and performance is ok.
Would performance with such a combination be much worse?

I would not even need a complete fuzzy search, it would suffice
To have the matching be done without caring for cases (this I already have
present by using a modified WhitespaceTokenizer which filters
To lower cases) and with also matching characters where accents
Also match, so e would match é and è.

Finally, I would like to know how much sorting a string field
Which is not too long (containing track or album title) affects performance
Copared to not providing any sorting parameters.

Thanx in advance,
Lukas
