SUBJECT: Changing the Scoring api
DATE: 11 Sep 2006

Hi everyone,

 

I want to override the default scoring when it comes to queries
containing the OR operator.

 

For example if I got the following headlines in my index :

"Sun sues Microsoft"

"Microsoft want to buy Tiscali"

".NU domain sues Microsoft"

"The sun is shining"

"Sun brings antitrust suit against Microsoft"

 

 

Those documents have been boosted in desc fashion ("Sun sues Microsoft"

has higher calculated norm value then "Sun brings antirust suit against
Microsoft"), 

 

The similarity class that has been used has made the norm values to be
exactly as the boost value ( I have even modified the norm to be a float
so I won't loose precision ).

 

If I perform a search for: Microsoft OR Sun

 

The topranked results will almost certainly be:

 

Sun sues Microsoft

Sun Brings antitrust suit against Microsoft

....

 

I just want the documents returned like this:

"Sun sues Microsoft"

"Microsoft want to buy Tiscali"

".NU domain sues Microsoft"

"The sun is shining"

"Sun brings antitrust suit against Microsoft"

 

 

I have to get this to work since I'm indexing news material and the
customers are only interested in the newest articles ( so the date of
the article is being used as a boost factor).

 

Any ideas? My rank changes to lucene works as expected when it comes to
AND operator and single term queries.
