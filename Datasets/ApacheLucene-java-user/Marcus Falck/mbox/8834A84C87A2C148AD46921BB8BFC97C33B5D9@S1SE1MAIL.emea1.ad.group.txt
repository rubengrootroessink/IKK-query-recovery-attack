Sound very interesting. But the thing is that my system shouldn't benefit so much of this kind
of caching.
Since the searches are triggered by thousands of different companies that mainly searches
for their own products.

Well, the more RAM you have the better when it comes to Solr 
responsiveness, I'm sure.  But, Solr leverages some caching 
cleverness so the queries and filters used most frequently are in RAM 
and lesser used items get dropped from the cache and loaded 
dynamically.  Quite cool stuff!  I'm just beginning to leverage it 
myself and its working nicely.
