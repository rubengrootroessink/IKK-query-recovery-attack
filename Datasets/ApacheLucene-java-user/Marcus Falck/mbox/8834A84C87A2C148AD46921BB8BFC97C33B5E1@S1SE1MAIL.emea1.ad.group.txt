Thanks.
I preffer sorting. But I'm afraid that it won't be enough. 
How long time do you think it will take to rebuild the caches?
If I use a sort on the datefield and perform a query (with that sort) will it always rebuild
the whole cache or
just the cache for the actual hits?

My hunch is that sorting will be fine, but you'll want to warm up the 
caches before putting a new IndexSearcher into production use.  Solr 
does this by running a configurable set of queries against an index 
before swapping out the old IndexSearcher with a new warmed up one.

Solr's FunctionQuery (isn't it time we move this to the core of 
Lucene?! :) might be able to help you out in this situation, but it 
sounds like sorting is what you want to use, not scoring tweaks.
