However the BooleanQuery's disableCoord seems to make effect. 
But I still have the problem when I'm constructing queries with wildcards.

Hi Hoss,

No it wasn't any thing wrong with your suggestions except that they had landed in my junk
mail for some reason, stupid outlook.

However I haven't had any chance testing all of your suggestions but I already had implemented
my own similarity class that has the coord fixed to 1. And it doesn't work as excepted.
