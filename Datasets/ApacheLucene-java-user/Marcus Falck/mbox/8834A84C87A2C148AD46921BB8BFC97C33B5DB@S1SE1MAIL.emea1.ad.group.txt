Hi
Where can i read more about the lucene sort implementation?
Does there exist any documentation on the sorting except for the Lucene API docs?

If you have a hard requirement of instantly seeing any update, you
can't use Lucene.  That's more database-like functionallity. That's
why I asked.

That's pretty much a requirement for using Lucene to support a decent
query rate.

Probably a lot,

Depends on what you are sorting by... for an int/float 100M*4 or
800MB.  Big, but possible.

Depends on what you are sorting by, and how many different ways you
want to sort.  If it's a single sort criteria, you can use index-time
boosts.  If you can sort multiple ways, avoiding the fieldcache
probably won't help you because the time to retrieve the per-doc sort
info via termvectors or stored fields will take too long.
