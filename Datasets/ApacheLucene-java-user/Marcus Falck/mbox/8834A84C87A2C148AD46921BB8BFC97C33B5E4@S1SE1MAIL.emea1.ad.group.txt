Hmm.
Not sure that I understand exactly what you mean.
Doesn't your solution require me to add all documents in correct date range?
Since I will index articles from different systems I can't guarantee that all articles will
be added to the index in correct date order.

sort capabilites but quickly ran into large performance bottlenecks. So i figured since the
default sort is by relevance i would like to change the relevance so that we don't even need
to sort the documents. I guess alot of people at this mail list can give me valuable hints
about how to accomplish this!

the several systems,  the future plans is to buy content from different actors on the market
and index it up).

A HitCollector should help.  Matching documents are passed to a 
HitCollector in the order they were added to the index.  So if newer 
documents were added to your index later, then the newest N documents 
are simply the last N documents passed to the HitCollector. 

Could that work?
