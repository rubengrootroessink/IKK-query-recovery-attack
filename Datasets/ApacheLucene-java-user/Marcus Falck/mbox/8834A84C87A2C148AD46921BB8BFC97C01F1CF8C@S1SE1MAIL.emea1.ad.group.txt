SUBJECT: Are there any problems with the hits.length() in luc 1.4?
DATE: 30 Jun 2006

Hi,

 

I'm indexing around 200 million articles in lucene. I have for the
moment added around 600000 articles. 

 

Using this technique:

5000 docs in RAMDir

Flush RAMDir to FSDir to create segmentfile with 5000.

Mergefactor 10.

 

I'm searching using the multisearcher.

 

When I had around 490 000 docs all new documents appeared to be in the
index but the count for the word "kan" was just around 8000 hits.

When the large merge occurred at 500.000 docs the "kan" count increased
to 65000 hits.

 

Any ideas`?

 

/

Regards

Marcus
