SUBJECT: SV: Changing the scoring (newest doc date first)
DATE: 18 May 2006

Yes the default behavior (sort on relevance) is a form of sort. But that sort don't need to
access the field values which makes it alot faster.
 
Sorting on fields works good up to index sizes of a couple of gigabytes ( on a test machine
dual opteron 2 GB ram)

That's the same conclusion we came to... and how Solr came about.
If it is close enough to meeting your needs, it might make sense to collaborate.

so that we don't even need to sort the documents.

Documents sorted by relevance are still sorted.
How much slower is a sort on another field vs a sort on relevance (not
counting the first time)
