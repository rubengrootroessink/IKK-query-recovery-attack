SUBJECT: GetMoreDocs question
DATE: 31 Aug 2006

Hi,

 

I have some questions regarding the GetMoreDocs(50) call in the
constructors of the Hits class.

 

First off whats the purposes of this call?

 

Why do I have to make this call if I only want to get out a count of the
matching documents and don't want to reterive any document from the
index?

Can I do something so I don't cache up 100 docs when I'm just asking for
a count?

 

/

Regards

Marcus
