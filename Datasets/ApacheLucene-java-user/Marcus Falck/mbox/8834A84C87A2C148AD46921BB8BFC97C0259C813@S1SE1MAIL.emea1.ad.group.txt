SUBJECT: SV: SV: Changing the Scoring api
DATE: 13 Sep 2006

Example:

Enter query:
AllText:Microsoft
score: 0,01476238 2002-02-19 05:09:00(1000022578) Qwest pins recovery hopes on long-distance
score: 0,01476227 2002-02-19 05:07:00(1000022547) <B>Microsoft</B> ordered to
let states see Windows code

Enter query:
AllText:Microsoft OR AllText:IBM
score: 0,02949772 2002-02-19 01:07:00(1000022129) Massive debt and messy books
score: 0,02949705 2002-02-19 01:01:00(1000022033) Alberner Mythos

As you see the score is 0,014x for the search containing one term (which also equals the norm
value for those documents).

And 0.029x for the docs containing 2 terms. Which appears to be norm * 2.
How do I get rid of that * 2.

: However the BooleanQuery's disableCoord seems to make effect.
: But I still have the problem when I'm constructing queries with wildcards.

really? ... that's strange, WildcardQuery uses the disableCoord feature of
BooleanQuery.  Do you have an example of what you mean?

: already had implemented my own similarity class that has the coord fixed
: to 1. And it doesn't work as excepted.

are you setting your Similarity as the default on your IndexSearcher prior
to executing your Queries?
