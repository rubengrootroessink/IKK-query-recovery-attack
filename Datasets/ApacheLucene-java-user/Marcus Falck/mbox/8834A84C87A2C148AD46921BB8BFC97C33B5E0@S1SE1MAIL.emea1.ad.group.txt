Hi,
 
I will use Lucene to index 200 million documents (doc size 2kb -> 20 kb).
With the following requirements:
IndexSearcher needs to be created atleast every 5 minute.
The ranking/scoring/sorting will need to reply the hits ordered by date desc.
 
Will the sorting be good enough on a machine with 4GB of RAM? Since the cache will be destroyed
every time I open a new IndexSercher i need to know how long it will take to rebuild it (the
index is stored on a SAN).
 
Or do I have to change the scoring so I wont need to access the date field?
 
If i will have to change the scoring does anybody have any tips on where to begin?
 
/
Regards
Marcus
