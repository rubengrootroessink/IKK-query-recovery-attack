I am not sure about your solution. The function destroys the 
normalization of the document vector, I guess, and it may have a 
negative impact on the IR system. The function is a hack (from IR point 
of view) with many drawbacks, i.e.:

1) is "0.2" an ideal choice? what about 0.6, 0.1, or 0.25? What's better?
2) a man must analyze the pages, it costs money and time
3) how will you assign those values to FAQ, API, documentation, mail 
archives etc.? and what about HUB (central) pages?

It may be, that the function is designed for users who solve classic 
relation DB problems in Lucene (although I do not know why). On the 
other hand, it is not "manageable" for full-text system, I guess.
