In this case, I think that the operator would be evaluated as "an 
implication" and not "AND" (=1-(((1-q1)^p+(1-q2)^p )/2 )^(1/p)). 
Obviously, you have to use an filter to filter out false hits (in case 
of q1->q2, the formula is true when q1 is false, so it is not what you 
really need), but it is not an issue with the auxiliary index. On the 
other hand, it is a feeling and it needs a test, you are right.
