You can use it, but: if you need something special (snippets, coloring,
different URL mapping, handling of your local charset, etc. etc.) you must
include code from sandbox or write it from scratch AFAIK.

Lucene *can* index HTML pages, if you use programs which build Lucene 
index from HTML documents. The programs exist.

On the other hand, if you extend Lucene with your hacks, you will find out
that the model of Lucene is unknown and many parts are hard-coded. It
boosts speed, but it disallows future enhancements (I could name the
parts, I hope we do not start flamewar here).
