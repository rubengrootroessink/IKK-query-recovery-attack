1. 2 threads per request may improve speed up to 50%

2. Merger is hard coded

3. you cannot use different inverted lists in one index (i.e. pagerank and
doc_id instead of doc_id/prox_handle/freq/...), inverted lists do not
support multilevel skips (see MoZo papers about this topic)

4. you cannot implement dissemination + wrappers for internet servers 
which would serve as static barrels.

5. Document metadata cannot be stored as a programmer wants, he must
translate the object to a set of fields

6. Lucene cannot implement your own dynamization

....etc.
