That class cannot be used in Merger. RemoteSearchable is a class that
allows you to pass a query to another node, nothing less and nothing more
AFAIK.

I do not think so. It is all about the object model you use. If you are
not able to solve the simplest case, how can you distribute the engine
across the network? I do not mean the simple RMI gateways which marshall
parameters and send them through a network pipe, I mean the true system
that could beat google (and it is another topic...).

Moreover, I think that Lucene can do much more than you think Otis :). 
Egothor can do that, so why not Lucene?
