SUBJECT: Indexing HTML
DATE: 3 Dec 2002

I tried to use IndexHTML (demo) and Lucene 1.2 for indexing *.CZ, but
Lucene often falls to never-ending loop. I've analyzed my data, so I know
what file(s) sent Lucene down. I don't see anything special in the
file(s), so I think, that it can go throught parser to main Lucene
routines (and then the problem could be in Merger).

Could you help me, please?

One of the problematic files:

My program (based on Lucene demo):

Thank you very much.
