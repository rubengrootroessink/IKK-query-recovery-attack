you may improve indexing and searching. Indexing, because the merge
operation will lock just one thread and smaller part of an index while
other threads are still working;  searching, because you can distribute
the query to more barrels. In both cases you save up to 50% of time (I
assume mergefactor=2).

Because you cannot process local and/or remote barrels -- all must be
local in Lucene object model. That is the serious bug IMHO.

Read more about dissemination, metasearch engines (i.e. Savvysearch),
dDIRs (i.e. Harvest). BTW, let's go to a pub and we can talk til morning
:) (it is a serious offer, because I would like to know more about IR).

This example is about metasearch (the simplest case of dDIRs): Can Lucene
allow that a barrel (index segment?) is static and a query is solved via
wrapper, that sends the query ${QUERY} to
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=${QUERY} and then
reads the HTML output as a result?

I talked about metadata. When metadata object knows how to achieve its 
persistence, why would one translate anything to fields and then back?
Why would you touch the users metadata at all? You need flat fields for
indexing, and what's around -- it is not your problem :). Lucene is
something between CMS and CIS, you say that it's closer to CIS, but when
you need metadata in fields, you are closer to CMS IMHO.
