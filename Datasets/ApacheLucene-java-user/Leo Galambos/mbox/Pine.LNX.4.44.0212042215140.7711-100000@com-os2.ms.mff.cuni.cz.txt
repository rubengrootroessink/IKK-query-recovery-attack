Hi Ronnie!

I know about it and the exception is handled well (see log file below). I
have found a better example than 1529, try this:
http://com-os2.ms.mff.cuni.cz/bugs/f00034.txt This file cannot go throught
Lucene HTML parser (I have tried 1.2 and IBM JDK 1.3.1r3). The file is
specific, i.e. it has two titles, two base tags etc.

I have not debugger here, so I cannot find the line where is the bug. If
you try your magic, please, let me know about the patch. :) THX
