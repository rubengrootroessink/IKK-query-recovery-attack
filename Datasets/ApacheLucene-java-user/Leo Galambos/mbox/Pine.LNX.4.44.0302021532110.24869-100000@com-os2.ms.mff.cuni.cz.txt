I remember only one problem that is related to indexing phase - it is 
``optimize'' function. If you update your index, one cannot tell you if 
you must also call optimize() or not.

If you do not call it, it may slow down queries (I do not know how much,
but Otis told it). If you call it, it slows down the indexing phase (I
have tested it and it is significant).

AFAIK Lucene cannot tell you when the index becomes dirty so that you must 
call optimize. On the other hand it does not affect small indexes, where 
optimize() costs nothing.

Otis, I think that this still holds. Right?
