I am not Lucene developer, but:

1) Lucene uses the Vector model, if you want to use different model you 
must understand what you are doing and you must change similarity 
calculations. AFAIK you would set the normalization factor to a constant 
value (1.0 or so).

2) you are trying to search for DATA, not INFORMATION. It is a big
difference. For your task, you could rather use simpler engine that is
based on RDBMS and B+.
