SUBJECT: Re: Lucene not used on xml.apache.org -> pagerank
DATE: 17 May 2003

When a tool X is used for xml.apache.org (it is a web site, isn't it?), 
then the tool X must be evaluated as a web tool. This fact has no 
relevance to me, I think. ;-)

You talk about "generic tool", thus I start to read LuceneAPI. I guess, 
you cannot implement dozen features effectively, for instance, the 
pagerank that is discussed by us now.

Option 1: You could use setBoost, then the issue is modification of 
these values - pagerank is not a constant value.

Option 2: You could modify Similarity object, and upload the pagerank 
values from a separate DB. The issue is the handle you need to get the 
value. UID is volatile, so you must use other metadata values - it costs 
time. If you puzzle it out with UID directly (I do not see how), you 
have another issue in Merger, because it is hard-coded, thus you lost 
the joint between UID and other DB here.

Option 3: You could recalculate the pagerank to 1-10 values, and each 
value would establish a separate index. The issue is related to O/S. a) 
you compute hit lists concurrently, then Lucene needs a lot of file 
handles, and it may open DoS. b) you calculate the similarity 
sequentially, then you lost time during .tii/.tis lookup (you have to 
process 10x more barrels).

I may miss something, that's true, but I do not think, that the label 
"generic" automatically means "universal". That is the point.
