Can it read your index? See indexLocation in configuration.jsp

I agree with Erik, that you would rather use an application which is 
ready for use in a minute. IMHO Lucene is library/API and unless you are 
a JAVA developer, it does not fit your needs. Some applications are 
listed here:
http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/Java/Server-Side/Search_Engines/
Omit the Lucene link, else you will be in an endless loop... ;-)

If you must use Lucene, try to find something for you here:
http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/powered.html
You may be interested in i2a, but their demo (@24.9.177.111) is dead 
right now.

Cheers,
Leo
