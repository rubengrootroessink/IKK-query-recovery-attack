If you cannot use pagerank[tm][r][c], we'd talk about Kleinberg's or 
Bayesian alg., SALSA, PHITS, etc. And if you cannot utilize them (due to 
patents and laws), put up in another country, where freedom is not an 
empty word. ;-)

BTW: How would you like to handle semantic data structures? It is not 
only about web, but also about XML, mail archives, news, etc.
