SUBJECT: HTML saga continues...
DATE: 12 Dec 2002

So, I have tried this with Lucene:
1) original JavaCC LL(k) HTML parser
2) SWING's HTML parser

In case of (1) I could process about 300K of HTML documents. In case of 
(2) more than 400K.

But I cannot process complete collection (5M) and finish my hard stress
tests of Lucene.

Is there anyone who has HTML parser that really works with Lucene? :) If
you think that you have one, please let me know. I wanted to try Neko, but 
it looks complicated and I do not want to affect the results by ``robust'' 
parser.

THX
