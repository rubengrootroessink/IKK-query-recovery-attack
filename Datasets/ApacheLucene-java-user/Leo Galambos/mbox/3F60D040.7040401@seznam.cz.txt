You probably missed the start of our discussion - we are talking about 
this: "q1 -> q2" which means "NOT q1 OR q2", versus "q2 -> q1" which 
means "q1 OR NOT q2". It causes the issue, and it also shows why you 
cannot use the simple "AND", because "q1 AND q2" != "NOT q1 OR q2" != 
"q1 OR NOT q2".

BTW: I didn't see the logic formulas for many years, so it is without 
any guarantee ;-)
