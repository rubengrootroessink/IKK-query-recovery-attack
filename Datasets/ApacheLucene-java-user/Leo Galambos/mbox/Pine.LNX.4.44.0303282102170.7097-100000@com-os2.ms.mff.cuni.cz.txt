Otis,

I am not sure, if anything about constants is constant in non-constant IR 
systems :-)

I think, that the correct answer is O(t/k*(1+log_m(k)), where t is a time
you need to create&write one monolithic segment of k documents, m is
merge factor you use, and k is the number of documents which are already
in index. As you can see, the function grows with k.

Can you explain me, why addition of one document takes constant time?

Thank you
