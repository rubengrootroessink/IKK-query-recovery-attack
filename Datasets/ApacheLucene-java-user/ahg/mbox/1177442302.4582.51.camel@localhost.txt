SUBJECT: Straigtforward stemming example? Dictionary needed?
DATE: 24 Apr 2007

Hi, all,

I'm looking for a simple, straightforward example of how to use the
Snowball stemmer to make Lucene search results return all variants of
the terms searched for.

For example, if I search for "eat", I'd like Lucene to find "eating",
"eaten", "ate", etc.

In particular, I'm not clear on whether everything required to do this
is the contrib/snowball/ directory, or do I have to find an external
dictionary somewhere?

In summary: I just need a quick explanation as to what resources I need
and how to put them together.

(By the way, I'm actually looking to do this with Spanish rather than
English, but examples for any language would be great.)

Many thanks in advance,
Andrew Green
