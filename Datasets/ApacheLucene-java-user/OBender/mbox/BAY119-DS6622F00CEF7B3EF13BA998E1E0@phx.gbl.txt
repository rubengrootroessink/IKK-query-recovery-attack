Thanks, I think I got it.

Yes, you could even use the WhitespaceTokenizer and then look for the 
symbols in a token filter. You would get [you?] as a single token; your 
job in the token filter is then to store the [?] and return the [you]. 
The next time the token filter is called for the next token, you return 
the [?] that you stored previously.

If you're already using something that's grammar-based (such as 
StandardTokenizer) then you could add the "?" to the grammar as a 
separate token. If you can figure out how to do this from looking at the 
grammar file, then it's probably the simplest way.
