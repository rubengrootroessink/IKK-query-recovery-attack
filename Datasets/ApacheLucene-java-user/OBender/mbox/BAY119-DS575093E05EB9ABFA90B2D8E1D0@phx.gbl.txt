Robert,

I'm not sure you are correct on this one.

If I have a Hebrew phrase:
[טוֹב עֶרֶב]
Then first token that filter receives is:
[עֶרֶב] (0,5)
and the second is:
[טוֹב] (6,10)
Which means that it counts from right to left (words and indexes).

Am I missing something?

Obender, I don't think its as difficult as you think. Your filter does
not need to be aware of this issue at all.

In unicode, right-to-left languages are encoded in the data in logical order.
The rendering system is what converts it to display in right-to-left
for RTL languages.

For example in Arabic, "Robert 1234" displays as روبرت 1234
To your computer monitor, this looks like 1, 2, 3, 4, space, teh, reh,
beh, waw, reh

But the unicode text is reh, waw, beh, reh, teh, space, 1, 2, 3, 4.
