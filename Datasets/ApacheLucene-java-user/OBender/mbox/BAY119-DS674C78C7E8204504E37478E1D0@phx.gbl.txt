Obender, based on your previous comments (that you see text displayed
in the wrong order), I again recommend that you enable support for RTL
languages in your operating system, as I mentioned earlier... are you
using a Windows-based OS, this is not enabled by default!

I think you are seeing things in the incorrect order, and this is
causing confusion for you!
