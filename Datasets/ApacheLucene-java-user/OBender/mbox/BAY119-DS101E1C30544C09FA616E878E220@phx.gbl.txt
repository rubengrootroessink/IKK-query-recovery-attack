SUBJECT: strange issues with IRISH
DATE: 13 Jul 2009

Hi All,

 

I've came across very strange issue with Irish language.

I have the following set of strings in Irish:

 

ag an gcrosbhealach seo, 

Lean ar an mуrbhealach., 

Lean an bуthar seo., 

An bhfuil ... in am imeacht?, 

An ... sin an t-am ceart?

 

And here is a search string: an

 

Search returns nothing instead of all of those phrases. I'm using simple
analyzer but suspect that [an] is still ignored as a stop word for some
reason.

I've tried custom analyzer with the following code:

 

TokenStream ts = new WhitespaceTokenizer(reader);

ts = new LowerCaseFilter(ts);

return ts;

 

with no luck.

 

Any ideas?

 

Thanks.
