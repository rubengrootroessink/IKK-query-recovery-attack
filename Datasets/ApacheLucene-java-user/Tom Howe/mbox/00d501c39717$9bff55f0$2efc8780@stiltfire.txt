SUBJECT: Hierarchical document
DATE: 20 Oct 2003

Hi, 
I have a very hierarchical document structure where each level of the
hierarchy contains indexable information.  It looks like this:  

		Study -> 
			Section -> 
				DataFile -> 
					Variable.  

The goal is to create a situation where a user can execute a search at
any level and the search would include all of the information below it
in the hierarchy and retrieve the proper aggregated document.  In other
words, someone could search for a Study using word that appears in
several DataFiles in the study and a single study document could be
returned.  At the same time, someone could search for a DataFile and
each of the matching DataFile documents would be returned.  Is there a
good way to do this other than using multiple indexes? 

Thanks,
Tom
