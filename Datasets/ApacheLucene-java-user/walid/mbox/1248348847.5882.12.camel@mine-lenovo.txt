based on this, there are two options:
1- using the aramorph library
2- moving the code from trunk to the current release and using the
provided arabic analyzer

1- the library works very well in indexing, tokenizing, stemming and
everything, but causes memory leaks
2- the provided library has a very poor result compared to the aramorph
library.

Is there a plan to have better arabic support with full morphological
analysis support?
