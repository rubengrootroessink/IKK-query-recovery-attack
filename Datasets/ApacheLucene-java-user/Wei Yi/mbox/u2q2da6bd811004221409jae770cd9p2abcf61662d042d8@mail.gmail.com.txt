SUBJECT: It is possible to change the meaning of a match in lucene
DATE: 22 Apr 2010

Dear all,

I want to provide hierarchical matching in Lucene. For example,
in a document, there is a field and its value:

 transportation: vehicle

and suppose there is a class/subclass relationship saying that
car is a subclass of vehicle, and bus is a subclass of vehicle.

I want the query:
transportation: car
to match the document because car is a subclass of vehicle.

Is it possible to change the part where Lucene decide if a term is matched?
So I can take the subclass relationship into account?


Many thanks.
