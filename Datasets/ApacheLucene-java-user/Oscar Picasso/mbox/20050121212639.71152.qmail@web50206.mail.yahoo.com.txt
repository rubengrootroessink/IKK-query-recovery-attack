After my previous post I have made some further tests with multithreading and
effectively it randomly throw NullPointerExceptions and Lock exceptions when
reusing a closed IndexWriter.

My example was bad because based on a very simple single thread.

But wouldn't it be safer if IndexWriter rose immediatly an Exception when
trying to use its modifying methods after is has been closed?
