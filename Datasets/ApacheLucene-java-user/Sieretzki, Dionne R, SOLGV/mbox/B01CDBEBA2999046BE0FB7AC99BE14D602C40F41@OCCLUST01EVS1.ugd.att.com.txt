I had similar problems that were solved with this Analyzer:

 
    public TokenStream tokenStream(String field, final Reader reader) {

        // do not tokenize any field
        TokenStream t = new CharTokenizer(reader) {
            protected boolean isTokenChar(char c) {
                return true;
            }
        };

        //case insensitive search
        t = new LowerCaseFilter(t);
        return t;

    }

Thanks,
 
Rob

Make a custom Analyzer.  They are super simple to write.
Take pieces of WhitespaceAnalyzer and the Standard one.
