SUBJECT: Searching for hyphenated terms
DATE: 13 Mar 2003

I have seen some previous postings about "Escape woes" and "Hyphens not matching", but I haven't
seen any resolutions to an issue I've been trying to work out.  

I don't want my search field to be case sensitive, so I used StandardAnalyzer.  The search
field also has corresponding entries that may or may not contain hyphens or other special
characters. If the field is not tokenized, very few search terms result in matches.  It appears
that terms are only matched if a wildcard is used, such as:

Entered: ADOG  / Actual Query is: adog / No match on an exact term
Entered: ADOG* / Actual Query is: ADOG* /  Match found
Entered: AAA-ADOG / Actual Query is: aaa -adog / No match 
Entered: "AAA-ADOG" / Actual Query is: "aaa adog" / No match 
Entered: AAA?ADOG /  Actual Query is: aaa?adog / Match found
Entered: DOG.2  / Actual Query is: dog.2 / No match 
Entered: DOG?2 / Actual Query is: DOG?2 /  Match found


If the field is tokenized, then even more mixed results are produced.

Entered: ADOG / Actual Query is: adog / Match found for exact term
Entered: ADOG* / Acutal Query is: ADOG* / No match
Entered: AAA-ADOG / Actual Query is: aaa -adog / Match found
Entered: "AAA-ADOG" / Actual Query is: "aaa adog" / Match found
Entered: DOG.2 / Actual Query is: adog.2  / Match found
Entered: AAA-DOG-BBB / Actual Query is: aaa -dog -bbb / No match
Entered: " AAA-DOG-BBB" / Actual Query is: "aaa dog bbb" / No match
Entered: ADOG-I40 / Actual Query is: adog -i40 / Incorrect matches
Entered: "ADOG-I40" / Actual Query is: adog-i40 / Match found for exact term


Can anyone recommend the right Analyzer to use that isn't case sensitive and matches on both
hyphenated and non-hyphenated terms?
