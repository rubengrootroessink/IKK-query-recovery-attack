SUBJECT: Query which gives high score proportional to 'distinct term matches'
DATE: 30 Jun 2009


I have a index which has got fields like 

title :
content :

If I search for, lets say  obama fly ,  then the documents having obama and
fly should be given high scores irrespective of the number of times they may
occur. This requirement is for fields -  title and content.

The implementation which I did with a simple OR query will score high the
documents for e.g.
 having more occurrence of 'obama'  even if it has no occurrence  'fly' word
in it. The tf for 'obama' here in this case is more; so even if 'fly' word
is not present the document is scored higher.

Expected behaviour is that - 
(a)  documents having 'obama' and 'fly' both should be scored higher in
order of their tf .
(b)  documents having either of terms should be given scores but less than
those matched in (a)

I tried by overiding the the coord() in a Custom Similarity implementation
and boosting it if multiple terms match, but what I see is that coord() is
gets boosted even if same word matches in multiple fields (say obama is
present in title: and content: ).

Searching for solutions, I have not got any results which talk about similar
requirement... I guess I am not using right keywords....

Thanks
Chandrakant K.
