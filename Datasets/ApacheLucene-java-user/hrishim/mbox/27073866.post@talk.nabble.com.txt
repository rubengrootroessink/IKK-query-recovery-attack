SUBJECT: Term Frequency for phrases
DATE: 8 Jan 2010


Hi .
I have phrases like brain natriuretic peptide indexed as a single token
using Lucene.
When I calculate the term frequency for the same  the count is 0 since the
tokens from the text are indexed separately i.e. brain , natriuretic ,
peptide.
Is there a way to solve this problem and get the term frequency for the
entire phrase ?

Regards,
Hrishi
