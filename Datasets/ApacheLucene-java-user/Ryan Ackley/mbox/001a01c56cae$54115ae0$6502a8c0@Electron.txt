Michael,

Cool, looks nice. I downloaded the distribution and I notice that you are 
using several bsd-licensed libraries besides lucene including the 
textmining.org library. I couldn't find any acknowledgement of those 
libraries in your documentation. The Apache 2.0 license lets you just 
include a notice file in your distribution. It could be my fault for not 
looking hard enough.
