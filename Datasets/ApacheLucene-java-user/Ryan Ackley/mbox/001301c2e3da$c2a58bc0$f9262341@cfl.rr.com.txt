Eric,

The problem with antiword is that it is a native application. You must write
a class that uses JNI to access the native code. If you link your java code
with native code you have lost one of the biggest benefits of Java, platform
independence. I would suggest you use the library at http://textmining.org.
contrary to what David Spencer says, it should work on all documents created
with Word 97 or above. I have literally indexed 100,000s of unique documents
using my library.
