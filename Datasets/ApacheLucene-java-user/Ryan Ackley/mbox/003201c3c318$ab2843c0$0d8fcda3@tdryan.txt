I have written a library located at http://textmining.org that will extract
text from Word documents. I am the author of the Word library in POI btw.
This is just a lightweight version because I got sick of everyone asking how
to extract text from a Word document. If it doesn't work its because the
document is *not* from Word 97 or later or the file was fast-saved.
Everytime somebody has problems they send me their files and they turn out
to be RTF or Word 95 documents. You can check the format by opening the file
in Word then going to Save As. The format of the document will be in the
"Save as Type" dropdown. At least in my version of Word it does.
