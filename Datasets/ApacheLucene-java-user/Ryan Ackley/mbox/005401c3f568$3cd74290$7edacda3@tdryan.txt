Gee thanks, your so generous with your praise.

I would recommend the OpenOffice SDK if you don't mind "portable c". It
supports all the possible MS Office formats going back to the dark ages. It
has a built-in Java programming interface, you don't have to compile it
yourself using cygwin, and it has a huge team of developers working 40+
hours a week to squash any bugs.
