I have tried that approach and it works ok. You end up with a bunch of junk
in with the useful stuff. It can clutter up your index and make searching
slower. There are a lot of file formats that don't store all of the text as
sequential text so it won't work. PDF is one, I know that PowerPoint is
another.
