David,

The textmining.org stuff only works on Word97 and above. It should work with
no exceptions on any Word 97 doc. If you have any problems then it is from
an earlier version (most likely Word 6.0) or its not a word document. If
this isn't the case you need to email me so I can fix it and make it better
for the benefit of everyone. I plan on adding support for Word 6 in the
future.
