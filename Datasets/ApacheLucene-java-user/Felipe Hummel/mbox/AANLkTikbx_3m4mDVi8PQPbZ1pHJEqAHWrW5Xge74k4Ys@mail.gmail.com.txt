SUBJECT: Re: Search one index but use IDF from another?
DATE: 14 Mar 2011

In stackoverflow somebody answer me this:

You should be able to extend IndexReader and override the docFreq() methods
to provide whatever values you'd like. One thing this implementation can do
is open two IndexReader instances -- one for the small index and one for the
large index. All the methods are delegated to the small IndexReader, except
for docFreq(), which is delegated to the large index. You'll need to scale
the value returned, i.e.
int myNewDocFreq = (bigIndexReader.docFreq(t) /
bigIndexReader.maxDoc()) *smallIndexReader
.maxDoc()


It seems all right to me. Is that correct?
