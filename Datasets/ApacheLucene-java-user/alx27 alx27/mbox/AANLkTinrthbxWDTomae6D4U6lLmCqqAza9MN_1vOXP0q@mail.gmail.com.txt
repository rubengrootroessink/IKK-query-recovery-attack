SUBJECT: The best way to stop indexing quickly?
DATE: 10 May 2010

Hi all,

Imagine a situation: Lucene started indexing a huge file, and just after
this user demands the application to be shut down immediately. What would be
the recommended way of doing this, so that application shuts down within
seconds, but with least possible damage to the index?

best regards,
Alex
