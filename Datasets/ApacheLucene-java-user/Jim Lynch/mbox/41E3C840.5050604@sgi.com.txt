I would be tempted to index the text fields but not save them.  Since 
Lucene returns everything as Otis pointed out, it's inefficent to keep 
rarely used data in as content in the index.  Put the text fields in a 
database or a file tree somewhere and keep a pointer to it as a field in 
the index.  When you need the data just retrieve it from wherever using 
the saved pointer.
