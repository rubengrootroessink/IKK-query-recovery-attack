SUBJECT: Quick question about highlighting.
DATE: 7 Jan 2005

I've read as much as I could find on the highlighting that is now in the 
sandbox.  I didn't find the javadocs.  I found a link to them, but it 
redirected my to a cvs tree.

Do I assume that you have to store the content of the document for the 
highlighting to work?  Otherwise I don't see how it could work.

Thanks,
Jim.
