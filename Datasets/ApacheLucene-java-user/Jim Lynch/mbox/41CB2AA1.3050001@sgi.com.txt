Hi, Erik,

I've been perusing the mail list today and see your name often.  As well 
as visiting the web site advertising your book.  If we decide to go this 
way, I'll be sure to pick up a copy.

The FAQ number 41 on page 
http://lucene.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/faq/faqmanager.cgi?file=chapter.search&toc=faq 
implies a problem with searching and indexing at the same time, unless 
I'm misunderstanding what it says.

So it is kosher to download the source code before buying the book?  I 
tend not to do that for a couple of reasons, it doesn't seem right and 
frequently authors go out of their way to make sure it's not very useful 
without the book.   Not that I consider that unfair, mind you.  It's 
just a common practice from my experience.

Any way thanks for the info. 

So what you are saying if I can read between the lines and extrapolate 
from what I've read, is that I can create an index for each of my 
collections as I see fit, putting them in separate directories and when 
I need to search I can select a subset of the directories with the 
MultiSearcher.  Since the user selects which collections he wants to 
search from via checkboxes, I can build a list of searchables to pass to 
MultiSearcher.  However, looking at the javadocs I see Searchable is an 
interface.  Hm, I'll have to look at some code to see how that works.

Thanks, you've given me something to chew on.

Jim.

At the risk of  being politically incorrect, Merry Christmas to you 
all.  Not that I care a whit about political correctness.  8)
