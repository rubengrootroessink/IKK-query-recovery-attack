DATE: 7 Jan 2005

 From what I've read, if you want to have a choice, the easiest way is 
to index the documents twice. Once with stemming on and once with it off 
placing the results in two different indexes.  Then at query time, 
select which index you want to use based on whether you want stemming on 
or off.
