Hi, Paul,

I brought this point up a while back and didn't get a response.  I've 
found that I frequently get a "file not found" exception when searching 
at the same time an indexing and/or optimize operation is running.  I 
fixed it by trapping the exception and looping until it didn't fail.

Jim.
