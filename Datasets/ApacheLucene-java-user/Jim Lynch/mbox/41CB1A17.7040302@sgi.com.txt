SUBJECT: Multiple collections
DATE: 23 Dec 2004

I'm investigating search engines and have started to look at Lucene.  I 
have a couple of questions, however.  The faq seems to indicate we can't 
do searches and indexing at the same time.  Is that still true, given 
that the faq is a few years old now?  If so is there locking going on or 
do I have to do it myself?

We have currently about 4 million documents comprised of  about 16 
million terms.  This is currently broken up into about 50 different 
collections which are separate "databases".  Some of these collections 
are producted by a web crawler, some are produced by indexing a static 
file tree and some are produced via a feed from another system, which 
either adds new documents to a collection or replaces a document.  There 
are really 2 questions.  Is this too much data for Lucene?  And is there 
a way to keep separate collections (probably indexes) and search all 
(usually just a subset) of them at once?  I see the MultiSearcher object 
that may be the ticket, but IMHO javadocs leave a lot to be desired in 
the way of documentation.  They seem to completely leave out the "glue" 
and examples.

Thanks for any advice.

Jim.
