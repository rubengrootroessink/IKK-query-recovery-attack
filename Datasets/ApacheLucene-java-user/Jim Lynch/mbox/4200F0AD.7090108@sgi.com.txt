DATE: 2 Feb 2005

OK, the reference field was not parsed.  See:

          }else if(key.equals("reference") ) {
            reference = value;
            Field fReference = new Field("reference",value,true,true,false);
            doc.add(fReference);
On another examination of my program, the delete does seem to be 
working.  At least the delete returns a value of 1 saying it deleted one 
record.  However the search still keeps finding the old record.  I am 
doing an optimize after each index batch. 

Unfortuately the old record is still there even after I delete it.  So I 
deleted it and replaced it with the date in a different format to see if 
it was really replaced.  The date field indicates I've still got the old 
data in there for some reason.  Is data cached somewhere?
