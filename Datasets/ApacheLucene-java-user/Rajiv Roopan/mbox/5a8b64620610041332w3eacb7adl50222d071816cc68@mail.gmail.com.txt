SUBJECT: Spam filter for lucene project
DATE: 4 Oct 2006

Hello, I'm currently running a site which allows users to post. Lately posts
have been getting out of hand. I was wondering if anyone knows of an open
source spam filter that I can add to my project to scan the posts (which are
just plain text)  for spam?

thanks in advance.
Rajiv
