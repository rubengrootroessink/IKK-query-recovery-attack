Hello, I have an index of locations for example. I'm indexing one field
using SimpleAnalyzer.

doc1: albany ny
doc2: hudson ny
doc3: new york ny
doc4: new york mills ny

when I search for "new york ny" , the first result returned is always "new
york mills ny". Am I doing something incorrect?

thanks in advance,
rajiv
