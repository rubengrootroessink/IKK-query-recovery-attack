Hello,
   I was recently looking thru the lucene in action book and came across the
scoring formula. I was wondering if the formula has changed since the book
was written?

  Also was wondering if someone can breifly explain what the IDF(t) term in
the formula means? In the book it says that it's the inverse document
frequency of the term but doesn't explain beyond that?

thanks,
rajiv
