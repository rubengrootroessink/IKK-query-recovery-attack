Hello,
 I'm using the spring framework to define my indexsearcher and
indexwriter.   They are defined as persistent singletons in the
application.

I'm quite new to lucene and I realize that after updating an index
using IndexWriter you nead to re-create an instance of IndexSearcher
to search that newly updated index. I was wondering if anyone knew,
using spring, how to reload the IndexSearcher bean?

Thanks!
rajiv
