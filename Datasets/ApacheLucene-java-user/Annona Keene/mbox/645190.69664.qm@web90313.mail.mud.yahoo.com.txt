: So we reach a problem at extractTerms.  I get an explanation no problem

    ...

: I'm using the version of FunctionQuery from the JIRA attachment.

that seems like the heart of the problem ... i haven't looked at the
version in Jira for a while, but the version commited into Solr does
provide an implementation of extractTerms (not that it really comes into
play at all).  That's why Yonik put a note in the Jira version that it's
out of date.
