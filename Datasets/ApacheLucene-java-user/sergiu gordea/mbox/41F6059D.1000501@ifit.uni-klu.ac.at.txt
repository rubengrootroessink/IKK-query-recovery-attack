SUBJECT: Re: reading fields selectively
DATE: 25 Jan 2005


 Hi to all lucene developers,

 The "read fields selectively" feature would be a very useful for me.
Do you plan to include it in the next lucene realeases?
I can patch lucene, but I will need to do it each time I upgrade my version,
and probably I would need to run the unit tests,  and this  is just 
duplicated effort....

  I'm working on an application that uses lucene only to index 
information that we store in
the database and in external files. We perform the search with lucene to 
get the IDs of our
database records. The ID keyword field is the only one that we need to 
read from the index.
Each document may index a few txt, pdf, doc, html, ppt, or xls files, 
and some other database fields,
so .. the size of the lucene documents may be quite big.

  Writing  the ID as the first field in the index, and having the 
possibility to read only the ID from the index
will be a great performance improvement in our case (speed and memory 
usage).

  Another frecquenty met situation is to have an index with an ALL 
field, in order to perform the search easily,
and a few another separate fields, needed to get information from the 
index and to apply special constraints
(i.e. for extended search functionality).  Also in this case, the 
information from the ALL field won't be read, but
lucene will load it in the memory, and the memory usage will be at least 
twice bigger.

 Thanks for understanding,

 Sergiu
