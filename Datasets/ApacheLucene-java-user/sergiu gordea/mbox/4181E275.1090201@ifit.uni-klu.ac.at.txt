For the begining I suggest you to make a system.out.println(query);

and to see what is the difference between the 2 queries ....

  Sergiu

ahh.... I see now
you must to construct a PhraseQuery instead of TermQuery ...
The first one is PhraseQuery the second one that you construct with the 
term is TermQuery.
I suggest you to use QueryParser, the differemce in performance between 
your constructed query is just
the interpretation of regular expresion to find the type of the query. 
Using the QueryParser will ensure you that you won't
face problems that this one anymore.

    All the best,
