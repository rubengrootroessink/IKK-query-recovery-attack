I still don't understand what is wrong with the Idea of indexing the 
title in a separate field and searching with a Phrase query
+title:"Elections 2004" ?
I think that the real problem is that the title is not tokenized and the 
title contains more then "Elections 2004"

I think it is worthing to give a try to this solution.

Or maybe I don't understand the problem correctly ...

All the best,
