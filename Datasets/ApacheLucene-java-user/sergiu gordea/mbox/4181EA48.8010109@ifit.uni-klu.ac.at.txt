Yes that't what I wanted to suggest ...
The query parser work fine  if you add all types of query parser ... but 
it was not working correctly in the case of single tem.
Therefore I test this first and I create a Query by using the normal 
MultifieldQueryParser.
Maybe is not the best solution but it works perfect ... and I had to 
write just a few lines of code ....
