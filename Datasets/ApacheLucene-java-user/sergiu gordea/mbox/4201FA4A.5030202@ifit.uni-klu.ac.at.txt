I see,

In this case you can read line by line your HTML file and then write 
something like this:

String line;
int startPos, endPos;
StringBuffer text = new StringBuffer();
while((line = reader.readLine()) != null   ){
    startPos = line.indexOf(">");
    endPos = line.indexOf("<");
    if(startPos >0 && endPos > startPos)
          text.append(line.substring(startPos, endPos));
}

This is just a sample code that should work if you have just one tag per 
line in the HTML file.
This can be a start point for you.

  Hope it helps,

 Best,

 Sergiu
