As Erick suggested earlier, I think that keeping the information in the 
database and indentifying the new entries at database level is a better 
approach.
Indexing documents and optimizing the index on a that big index will be 
very time consuming information.
Also .. consider that in the future you would like to modify the 
structure of your index.

Think how much effort will be to split some fields in a few smaller 
parts. Or just to change the format of a field,
let's say you have a date in DDMMYY format and you need to change to 
YYYYMMDD.

And consider how much effort is needed to rebuild a completly new index 
from the database....

 Of course, your requirements may not ask to have the information stored 
in the database, and ... it is up to you to use a DB + Lucene index,

or just a Lucene index.


 Best,
