SUBJECT: QueryParser behaviour ..
DATE: 10 Feb 2006

  Hi all,

 I built a wrong query string "word1,word2,word3" instead of "word1 
word2 word3"
therefore I got a wrong query:  field:"word1 word2 word3" instead of  
field:word1 field:word2  field:word3.

 Is this an espected behaviour?
 I used Standard analyzer, probably therefore, the comas were replaced 
with spaces.
Indeded was no space between the words, just comas.

 Is this a bug? Does it make sense to indicate this situation through a 
Parse Exception?

 Best,

  Sergiu
