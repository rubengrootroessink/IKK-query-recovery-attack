SUBJECT: Re: QueryParser.parse() and Lucene1.4.1
DATE: 17 Sep 2004

Hi Polima,

 It seems to me that your query string is not correct ...

(A AND -(B))

AND = "+"
NOT = "-"

In lucene AND and NOT opperators are mapped internal to +/-,
(AND and NOT are supported only because they are comming from natural language)

so ...

A + - (B) makes no sense ...
