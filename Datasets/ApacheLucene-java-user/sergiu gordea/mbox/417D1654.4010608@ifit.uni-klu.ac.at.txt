SUBJECT: Re: Need advice: what Word/Excel/PowerPoint lib to use?
DATE: 25 Oct 2004


of course POI, for open source.
There are some commercial products based on POI also.

for WORD consider textmining.org
for XLS, POI does anything you need
for powerpoint  there is one commercial (it's about 1000$), but you can 
also find some source code in archives.

 All the best,

  Sergiu
