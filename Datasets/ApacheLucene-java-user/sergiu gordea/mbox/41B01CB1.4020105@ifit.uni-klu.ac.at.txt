... What about LockException? I tried to index objects in a thread and 
to use a IndexSearcher
to search objects, but I have had problems with this.
I tried to create a new  IndexSearcher object if  the index version  was 
changed, but unfortunately
I got some Lock Exceptions and FileNotFound Exceptions.

 If the answer number 3. is correct, then why did I get these exceptions.
