Exactly this is my question, why the QueryParser creates a Phrase query 
when he gets several tokens from analyzer
and not a BooleanQuery?

It was not this situation, the string was without quotes.... (String 
searchString =  "word1,word2,word3"; )
I just preserved java quotes to delimit the string.

Ok .. it is not the case of ParseException, should situations like this 
(change from TermQuery to PhraseQuery)
indicated in log files? I mean, this will help developers to debug their 
code easier.
