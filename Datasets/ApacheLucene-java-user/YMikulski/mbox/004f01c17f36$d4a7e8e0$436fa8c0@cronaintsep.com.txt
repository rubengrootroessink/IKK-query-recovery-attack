Hello!
I like to suggest making jsp custom tags to work with LUCENE.
I think it can be useful for many LUCENE users.
What do you think about it?
Is it interesting to LUCENE users and committers at all?

Best Regards,
   Yauheny Mikulski.

P.S.
Please, don't redirect me to Jakarta Taglibs.
My library is almost ready, and I've suggested it at Jakarta Taglibs, but
there is still no reply from committers.

I think,  the project committers are engaged in their taglibs,
and they are interested in implementation of their taglibs only.
