Would like to know, are you using a particular type of sort? Do you need to sort on relevance?
Can you shard and restrict your search to a limited set of indexes functionally?

Subject: RE: Scaling Lucene to 1bln docs

Hi Anshum,

I am already running with the 'setCompoundFile' option off. 
And thanks for pointing out mergeFactor. I had tried a higher mergeFactor couple of days ago,
but got an OOM, so I discarded it. Later I figured that OOM was because maxMergeDocs was unlimited
and I was using MMap. U r rigt, I should try a higher mergeFactor.

With regards to the multithreaded approach, I was considering creating 10 different threads
each indexing 100mln docs coupled with a Multisearcher to which I will feed these 10 indices.
Do you think this will improve performance.

And just FYI, I have latest reading for 1 bln docs. Indexing time is 2 hrs and search time
is 15 secs.. I can live with indexing time but the search time is highly unacceptable.

Help again.

Hi Shelly,
That seems like a reasonable data set size. I'd suggest you increase your
mergeFactor as a mergeFactor of 10 says, you are only buffering 10 docs in
memory before writing it to a file (and incurring I/O). You could actually
flush by RAM usage instead of a Doc count. Turn off using the Compound file
structure for indexing as it generally takes more time creating a cfs index.

Plus the time would not grow linearly as the larger the size of segments
get, the more time it'd take to add more docs and merge those together
intermittently.
You may also use a multithreaded approach in case reading the source takes
time in your case, though, the indexwriter would have to be shared among all
threads.
