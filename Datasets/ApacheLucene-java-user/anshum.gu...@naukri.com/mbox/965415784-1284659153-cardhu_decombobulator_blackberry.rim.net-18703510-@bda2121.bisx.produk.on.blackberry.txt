Try with multi valued field while indexing i.e. Add each sentence as a separate field(with
the same field name) to the same document. This would give you the results as you want.

Hello All: 

Can any one suggest me the best way to allow me to perform a sentence
specific phrase search? 

Eg: Let the indexed text be: 

If you are posting a question, please try search first. Your question may
have already been answered. Don't post repeatedly. Wait for a few days.
People will read your post by email.

Now if I search for the phrase 'post repeatedly Wait for a few', still I am
able to retrieve the document even though they are in different sentences.

Currently I am using StandardAnalyzer and this is how I am generating lucene
documents:

Field field = new Field(fieldName, validFieldValue, Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.ANALYZED);
document.add(field);

Is there a way to keep track of different sentences while indexing the
content.
Any hint would be appreciated. 
Thanks.
