SUBJECT: Impact of Term Vectors (was ApacheCon next week)
DATE: 13 Dec 2005

Good question. I was wondering about the impact of adding term vectors with
the various options. For example, is adding term vectors with both positions
and offsets a significant impact? Which current parts of lucene (including
contributions) take advantage of term vectors being present? I know that
Highlighter class can make use of them if present.

Well done, Grant.  Very informative.

Question on Term Vectors: with their inclusion in an index, have you noticed
any degradation in performance, either from a search effiiciency or
maintenance point-of-view?  Given the power of term vectors, if the perf
impact is negligible, I'm curious to the reasons why one would NOT include
term vectors in any and every index...

cheers,
j
