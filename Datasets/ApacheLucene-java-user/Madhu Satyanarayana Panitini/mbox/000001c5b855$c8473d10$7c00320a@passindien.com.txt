Hi Paul,

I agree with u "Analyzer is the magic word"
Lets look it in depth and clear, I would consider three parts in the
analyzer 

1. Tokenization (splitting of words)
2. Stopwords removal (depends up on the language)
3. stemming of the words (depends up on the language) 

First to start analyze we have split the text, for example I like split
the text wherever I find the following non alphabets 
"\s+|;|:|<|>|\^|~|=|--+|\+|\?|!|&|\$|@|\#|\'|`|"|_|\%|\*|,|\." 
That means I would like to split the text wherever I find
space,:,;,",',<,>,?,  etc....

And then we remove the stopwords and then stemming goes on.

Coming my question is clear now how Lucene splits the text? only when
ever it encounter the space between the words or it consider the non
alphabetic characters as well.

What is the whole grammar Standard analyzer has to split the words ?

Madhu,

Analyzer is the magic word here.

Lucene's StandardAnalyzer has a whole grammar to split words into 
tokens. There are many more analyzers, most of which are language 
specific (e.g. based the Snowball or Porter-stemmers, see contribs or 
javadoc of core).

For which language do wish to use that ?
