Hi all,
One more idea would be using cryptograms to differentiate between
languages, and then u can use the delete stopwords and apply stemming
for particular language.

Idea: Don't drop stopwords from the query - they aren't in the index for

the respective languages. However, you might get results from other 
languages..

It's the stemming that's difficult. You'd have to stem for each
language, 
and then do searches. But since you won't stem at all, this wouldn't be 
much of a problem in your case.

Maybe a language-selector drop-down would be nice?
