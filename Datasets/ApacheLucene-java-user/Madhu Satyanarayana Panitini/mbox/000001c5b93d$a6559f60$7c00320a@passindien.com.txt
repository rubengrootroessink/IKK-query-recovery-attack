SUBJECT: preserving document attributes
DATE: 14 Sep 2005


Hi all

I have text docs similar to the TREC format some think like this

<file>
<author>xxxxxxxx</author>
<publischer>yyyyyyyy</publischer>
<text>
Full text search with one or more keywords with advanced search
operators to enhance search has to be implemented. Advanced search with
document attributes like author, title, type and Meta keyword in
addition to the search term should be implemented.
</text>
</file>

with this type of doc I can index text between "<text>" tags, but I want
to preserve the data in the other tags as well like
<author>xxxxxxxx</author>
<publischer>yyyyyyyy</publischer>.

Because the user when searching for docs he will use author as atribute
for searching Doc,

Is there any possibility to index the author and publischer data and use
in the search.  please tell me how can I index and use in search.

And also please guide me with methods or references in IR  that use
attributes of DOC for search purpose.

Thanks in advance
Madhu
