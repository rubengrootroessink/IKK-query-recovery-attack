Do stemming algorithms take into consideration abbreviations too? Some
examples:

mg = milligrams
US = United States
CD = compact disc
vcr = video casette recorder

And, the next logical question, if stemming does not take care of
abbreviations, are there any solutions that include abbreviations inside
or outside of Lucene?

Thanks,

Kevin

Also if you can't wait, see page 2 of
http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/01/15/lucene.html

or the LIA e-book ;)
