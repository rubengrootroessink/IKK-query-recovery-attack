SUBJECT: Removing unnecessary characters from Queuery Terms
DATE: 29 Nov 2004

I am parsing very large files with "search terms" that will be submitted
to a Lucene Index. My current problem is that some of the terms have
some "special" characters in them that blow up when the phrase is
parsed. An example would be "My Search Phrase (alternate".  I won't be
adding any special Booleans or Clauses around the text.  

 

My basic line of code that build the Query object is ...

Query query = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(term.toLowerCase(), fields,
new StandardAnalyzer());

 

Thanks in advance for any input.
