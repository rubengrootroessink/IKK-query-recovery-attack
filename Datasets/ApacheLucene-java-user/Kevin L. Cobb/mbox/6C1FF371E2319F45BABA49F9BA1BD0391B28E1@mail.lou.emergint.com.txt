SUBJECT: Serialized Java Objects
DATE: 25 Aug 2005

I just had a thought this morning. Does Lucene have the ability to store
Serialized Java Objects for return during a search. I was thinking that
this would be a nifty way to package up all of the return values for a
search. Of course, I wouldn't expect the serialized objects would not be
searchable. 
 
Thanks,
