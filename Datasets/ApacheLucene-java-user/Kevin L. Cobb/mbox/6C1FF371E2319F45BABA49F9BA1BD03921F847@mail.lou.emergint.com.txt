Yeah. The last post got me to reading more about BooleanQuery and this
opend up the flood gates. 

A question on the heels of this one though. I have documents indexed in
multiple fields. Lets say Name, Synonym, and Definition. Lets say the
search phrase is "big green cat". What I'm building using the
BooleanQuery object is:

	+((Name:big Name:green Name:cat) (Synonym:big Synonym:green
Synonym:cat))
	(Definition:big Definition:green Definition:cat)) 

I'm getting too many 100% hits back when the search term is say "cat". I
want a Query that is more descerning, so that the term "cat" returns a
hit but less than 100%. The term "big green cat" should return 100%, the
term "big green" or "green big" should return something less than 100%
and then term "big" or "green" or "cat" something less that the previous
one. Hope this makes since. 

-Thanks, 

Kevin

Are you simply looking to use multiple terms in your search?  In that
case, simply use BooleanQuery instead of TermQuery.  QueryParser will
recognize strings like    foo AND bar    or    +foo +bar    and turn
that into a BooleanQuery for you.
