It well could be that I'm lacking in setting up my queries. Here's the
gist of what I'm trying to do, it a little pseudocode. 

1. inputs: 1) termToSearch 2) keywordField
2. Use MultiFieldQueryParser to build the query for the termToSearch in
the searchable fields
3. Use QueryParser to build the query for the keywordField (only one
field to search)
4. Can I combine these separate queries together into one?

Kevin -

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but how is this not a BooleanQuery with two
clauses?
