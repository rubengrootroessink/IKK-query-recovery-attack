I think your bottleneck is most likely the DB hit. I assume by 20000
products you mean 20000 distinct entries into the Lucene Index, i.e.
20000 rows in the DB to select from. 

I index about 1.5 million rows from a SQL Server 2000 database with
several fields for each entry and it finishes in about twenty minutes so
you should be able to index 20000 rows in a few seconds. 

Make sure your database table(s) are indexed appropriately according to
your select statements. Indexing correctly will be the biggest
performance improvement you will see. 

Best of luck.

Subject: Lucene bulk indexing

Hi,

I am sure this question must be raised before and maybe it has been even
answered. I would be grateful, if someone could point me in the right
direction or give their thoughts on this topic.

The problem:

I have approximately over 20000 products that I need to index. At the
moment I get X number of products at a time and index them. This process
takes about 26 minutes (Am indexing the database id, product name,
product description).

I was thinking of ways to make this indexing faster. For this I was
thinking about writing a threaded module that would index X number of
products simultaneously. For instance I could spawn (Number of
products/X) number of threads and do the indexing. I am guessing this
would be faster but by what factor would this be faster? (I understand
the writes to the index are synchronized by lucene).

Is there any other approach by which I could speed up the indexing?
Thoughts? Suggestions?

Thanks,
Mufaddal.
