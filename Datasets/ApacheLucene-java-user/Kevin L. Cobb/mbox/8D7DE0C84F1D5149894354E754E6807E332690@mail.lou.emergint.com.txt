I want to understand how Lucene uses stemming but can't find any
documentation on the Lucene site. I'll continue to google but hope that
this list can help narrow my search. I have several questions on the
subject currently but hesitate to list them here since finding a good
document on the subject may answer most of them. 

 

Thanks in advance for any pointers,

 

Kevin
