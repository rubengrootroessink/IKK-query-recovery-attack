SUBJECT: How lucene and nucth work together?
DATE: 22 Jun 2005

Hi!

We're trying to use nutch as web-spider and lucene as indexer and searcher.
Nutch and Lucene work good separately, but we do not succeed to link lucene to the index created
by nutch.
We've modified the file "configuring.jsp"  specifying in the "indexLocation" the index file
created by Nutch, but we obtain always 0 results in the result-list.

We don't find documentation about nutch and lucene work together.


Tanks for your help

Best Regards


Giovanni
