SUBJECT: Cypher - Natural Language to RDF/SeRQL for the Semantic Web
DATE: 31 Jul 2006

Hi All,

I thought our technology might interest the group.

Cypher is one of the first software program available which generates
metadata represention of natural language input. The program outputs RDF
graph and SeRQL query representations of a sentences, clauses, and phrases.
The Cypher framework provides a set of robust definition languages, which
can be used to extend and create grammars and lexicons. Cypher  programming
is fun and easy to do. The specifications are designed to allow a novice to
quickly and easily build transcoders for processing highly complex sentences
and phrases of any natural language, and to cover any vocabulary.

The free software and related documentation can be found at:

Enjoy,
