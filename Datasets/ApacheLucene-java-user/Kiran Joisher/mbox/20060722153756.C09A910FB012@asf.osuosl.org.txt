Hi,

 

I am trying to re-create index from scratch. But I get this exception. I
also close the IndexSearcher before doing this. 

 

java.io.IOException: Cannot delete deletable

        at org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.create(FSDirectory.java:195)

        at
org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.getDirectory(FSDirectory.java:144

)

 

 

Any help greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

--Kiran
