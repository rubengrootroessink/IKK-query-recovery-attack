You can use MultiFieldQueryParser

Something like this

Query query = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(new String[]{queryString,
queryString, queryString}, new String[]{ASSET_TITLE, ASSET_ARTICLE,
ASSET_DIRECTOR_NAMES }, new BooleanClause.Occur[]
{BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD,
BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD }, analyzer);
