Depends on what you mean by sections.
If your document divides up simply into fixed fields:
      <title>...</title>, <author>...</author> , <body>...</body>
or:  <part1>...</part1>, <part2>...</part2>, <part3>...</part3>
then you can make those into fields of your lucene index.

But if there aren't a fixed number of sections, then fields probably  
won't
work. Lucene doesn't itself handle nesting or inclusion, so finding
text within some arbitrary div or finding the div holding the text
is not so straightforward. However, lucene has a flexible notion
of what a 'document' is. ( Basically, it's whatever unit you feed
it as a document. ) So if this is what you need, you might be able
to make each <div> into a "document" rather than each file.

  If you were indexing a large TEI text and wanted to return a  
particular
chapter where the text was found, you could make each chapter a  
'document',
and each document would have indexed fields to store the common header
info as well as the file name containing the chapter.

  Lucene is great at finding documents, but not quite as good at finding
things IN documents. The index contains pointers to the terms, but  
they are
pointers to a token in the parsed token stream, so to find a  
character index
into a file, you have to (I believe) run the text thru the tokenizer  
again.
( But lucene API gives you access to everything, even if it's not  
simple or easy.
   I think there are some new features in the latest version that can  
make this
   sort of thing easier, but I haven't yet figured out how to use  
them. )

the difference

opentext.  )
