Dear Andrzej Bialecki

Can we change the field name in *.fnm directly by hand?

(note: this is a low-level hack, you can damage your index beyond repair).

Take a look at FieldInfos class, and how it creates the *.fnm file for
each segment. You can re-write these fnm files using new field names. In
case of compound indexes you will need to "explode" them first to a
non-compound format.

Make sure you write out these files using exactly the same order of
fields, otherwise you will end up in big trouble ;)
