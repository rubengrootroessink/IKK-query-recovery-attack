DATE: 10 Mar 2005

Hi folks,

I have a task when I need to read the query entered by the user, add to it many other terms
in a boolean expression and get the count of each clause in a different field.
for examples: if the user enters: red. i need to take red and generate the following query(red
AND blue) OR (red AND green) OR( red AND yellow).  i need to get a count of how many returned
documents contain (red AND blue) in the "url"(field), and the count in "contnet" and so on(I
have 5 different fields). i will have to do this for every clause in the query that i generate
and populate the results in an xml document.
if i just have one long query, is there a way to get the count from the Hits that way i want,
or shall i have multiple queries?
will termDocs and docFreq methods be helpful?.

thanks
