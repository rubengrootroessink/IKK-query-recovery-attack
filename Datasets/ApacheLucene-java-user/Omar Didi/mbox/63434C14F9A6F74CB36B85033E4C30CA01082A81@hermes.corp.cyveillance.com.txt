SUBJECT: problem while  merging two indexes
DATE: 11 May 2005

hey guys,

my application died while I was merging two indexes. acoording to my undestanding, if I just
delete the new files that have been created while I started merging, the index won't be affected.
is this true?. what will happen if i just restart the merging from where the application died?.
thanks,

omar
