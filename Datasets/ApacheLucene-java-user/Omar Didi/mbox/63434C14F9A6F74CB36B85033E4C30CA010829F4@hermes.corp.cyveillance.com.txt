I have used luke to look inside the index and i haven't found any numbers except for the fields
that were indexed as keywords. i have used the AnalyzerDemo class in LIA, I got the following
output:

Analyzing "welcome to the year 2005 yahoo123"
  WhitespaceAnalyzer:
    [welcome] [to] [the] [year] [2005] [yahoo123] 

  SimpleAnalyzer:
    [welcome] [to] [the] [year] [yahoo] 

  StopAnalyzer:
    [welcome] [year] [yahoo] 

  StandardAnalyzer:
    [welcome] [year] [2005] [yahoo123] 

  CyAnalyzer:
    [year] [2005] [yahoo123] 
the analyzer I am using doesn t discard numbers but I can t find them. any ideas??

Try the tips here: 
http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/AnalysisParalysis - you need to 
analyze your analyzer and ensure what you think was indexed actually 
was.  Also, look into using Luke - http://www.getopt.org/luke/ - to see 
what makes your index tick.

Yes.  That's just the nature of how it works.  Getting the analysis 
right is important stuff, and if you didn't index it, you can't search 
for it!

Feel free to share more details of your analyzer, and we'd be happy to 
"analyze" it.
