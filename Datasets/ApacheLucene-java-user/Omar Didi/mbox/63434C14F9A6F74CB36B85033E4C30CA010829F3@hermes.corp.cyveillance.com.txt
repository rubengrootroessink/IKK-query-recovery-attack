SUBJECT: RE: error when query contains numbers
DATE: 31 Mar 2005


the .toString() looks excactly like the query I enter: if I search for "yahoo AND 200" it
returns 0 hits. I am sure there are documents that have 200 hundreds in them. The analyzer
I am using is a custom analyzer that has a list of stop words. I don t know much about the
way data was indexed, I am just developing an aplication to search using the analyzer that
was used while indexing.
my concern now is if there is an error with the way the indexing was do I have to reindex
the documents?
thanks

What is the .toString of the Query object instance returned from 
QueryParser?  What Analyzer are you using?  How did you index the 
field(s) being queried?
