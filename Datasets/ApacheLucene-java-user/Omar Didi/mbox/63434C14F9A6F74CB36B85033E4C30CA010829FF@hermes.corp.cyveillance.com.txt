hi guys,

is it possible to filter the hits returned from a certain query?. for example if I have a
search like this:
	Query searchQuery = queryParser.parse( query );
	Hits  results = m_searcher.search( searchQuery );
is there a way to use the results and find out how many of the returned documents their url
ends with com, and how many ends with net and so on... without the need to form a new query?.
thanks.
