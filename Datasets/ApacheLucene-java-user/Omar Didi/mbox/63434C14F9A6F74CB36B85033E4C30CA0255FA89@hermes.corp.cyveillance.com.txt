you have two choices that I can think of:
1- before adding a document, check if it does't exist in the index. you can do this by querying
on a unique field if you have it .
2- you can index all your documents, and once the indexing is done you can dedupe. (Lucene
has built in methods that can help with this)


if your index doesn't have a unique key, you need to add one like the one you suggested.

That could work.

You will need a big sum though. MD5?
