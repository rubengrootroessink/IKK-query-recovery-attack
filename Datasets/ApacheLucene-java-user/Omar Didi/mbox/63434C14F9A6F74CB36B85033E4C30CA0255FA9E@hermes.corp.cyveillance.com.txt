We wrote ours for NetSearch to handle this specific issue. I suggest you
create a holder class to hold the IndexReader and IndexSearcher, this
can close them in the finalizer. Clients keep the holder until they are
finished and then discard it. When it is completely de-referenced it
will be closed. We also remove old indexes this way as well. Create a
factory class for the holder that knows when an index is being updated,
and creates new holders, when the index is not being updated it returns
the same one each time.

Hello,
 I'm using the spring framework to define my indexsearcher and
indexwriter.   They are defined as persistent singletons in the
application.

I'm quite new to lucene and I realize that after updating an index
using IndexWriter you nead to re-create an instance of IndexSearcher
to search that newly updated index. I was wondering if anyone knew,
using spring, how to reload the IndexSearcher bean?

Thanks!
rajiv
