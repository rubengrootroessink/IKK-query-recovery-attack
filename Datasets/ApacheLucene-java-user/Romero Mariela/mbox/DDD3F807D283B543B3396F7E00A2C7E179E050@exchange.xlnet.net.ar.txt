Hi all,

We are using Lucene to search business objects with simple queries, but
now we need advanced searchs. 

For example, we have a user object which has as indexed fields the id
and its function, and an account object which has as indexed fields its
id and the id of the owner user. 

	User	-> userId, function
	Account -> accountId , userId

Can we use Lucene to find the accounts of the users with a given
function??
