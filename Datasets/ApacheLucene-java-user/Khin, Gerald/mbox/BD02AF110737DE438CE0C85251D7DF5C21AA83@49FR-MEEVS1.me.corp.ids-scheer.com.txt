SUBJECT: How to get rid of unused fields?
DATE: 9 Jul 2009

Hi folks!

 

After deleting documents from the index it can happen that fields become
unused (i.e. no document has this field anymore). And
IndexReader.getFieldNames() still returns these unused fields, even
after optimizing the index. Is there any chance to get rid of these
unused fields?

 

Cheers,

Gerald
