SUBJECT: multiple words indexing
DATE: 18 Jul 2003

Is there any way in Lucene so that I can index multiple words as a single
term.

For example : "Jakarta Lucene" appears together in my document and I want it
to be indexed as a single term "Jakarta Lucene"  and not as two sperate
terms as "Jakarta" and "Lucene".

Thanks,
Gourav
