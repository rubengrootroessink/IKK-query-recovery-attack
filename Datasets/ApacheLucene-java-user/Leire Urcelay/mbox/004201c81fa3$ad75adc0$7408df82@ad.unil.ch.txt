SUBJECT: blank space before special characters
DATE: 5 Nov 2007

Hello, 

 

I have the following problem with my lucene index.

 

When indexing fields containing special characters (like &), a blank space
is inserted before the special character. For example: the content
"L'article" is indexed as "L &apos;" (with a blank space between 'L' and
'&amp;'). 

 

Is there any way to avoid that?

 

The characteristics of my field are the following: Indexed, Tokenized,
Stored and Term Vector.

 

Thanks in advance for your help,

 

Leire
