I am still struggling with sharing the index via samba.
The problem seems to come down to lucene not reading the new index files, or
at least not all of them.
It reads the following files at startup:
commit.lock (numopen=0)
segments read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=1)
_0.fnm read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=1)
_0.fdt read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=1)
_0.fdx read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=2)
_0.tis read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=3)
_0.tii read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=4)
_0.frq read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=4)
_0.prx read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=5)
_0.f1 read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=6)
and so forth.

But when the master index is changed, lucene seems to see that, but it only
reads the following files:
commit.lock (numopen=0)
segments read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=1)
_0.fnm read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=1)
_0.tii read=Yes write=Yes (numopen=4)

And after that the dreaded ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException appears, which
seems to make sense, since the new index is not read.

Any ideas, why not all files are reloaded?

Chris
