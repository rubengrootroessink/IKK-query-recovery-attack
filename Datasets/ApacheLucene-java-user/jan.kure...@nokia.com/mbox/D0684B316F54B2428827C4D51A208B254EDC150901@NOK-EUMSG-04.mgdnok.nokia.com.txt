SUBJECT: Holding and changing index wide information
DATE: 22 Jul 2010

Hi,

When using incremental updating via Solr, we want to know, which update is in the current
index. Each update has a number.
How can we store/change/retrieve this number with the index. We want to store it in the index
to replicate it to any slaves as well.

So basically can I store/change/retrieve a number index wide in lucen/Solr?
