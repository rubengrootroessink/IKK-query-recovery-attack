AFAIK, exchangeing the Collector is one of the last tricky parts which
is not solvable via the XML configuration. I recall talking to Mark a
while ago about reasons against replacing your Lucene app with Solr
and HitCollector / Collector came up during that. I think you need to
touch SolrIndexSearcher and maybe build your own QueryCompontent. Yet,
I am not a Solr expert so maybe Mark, Yonik or Chris could jump in
here?!
