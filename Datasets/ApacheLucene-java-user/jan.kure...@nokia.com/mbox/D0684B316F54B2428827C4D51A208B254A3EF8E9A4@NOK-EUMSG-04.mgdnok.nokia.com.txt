SUBJECT: Docs  with any score are collected in the Collector implementations
DATE: 2 Jun 2010

Hi,

Formerly the HitCollector stored only docs with score bigger than 0.0f. This check is not
implemented in any Collector implementation. Especially in the two implementation used by
solr: InOrderTopScoreDocCollector and OutOfOrderTopScoreDocCollector.

How to not collect documents with a score less or equal to 0.0f?
