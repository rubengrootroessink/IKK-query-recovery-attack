This may or may not be correct, but I am indexing it as a keyword because I provide a (required)
radio button on the add screen for the user to determine which category the document should
be assigned.  Then in the search, provide a dropdown that can be used in the advanced search
so that they can search only for a specific category of documents (like HowTo, Troubleshooting,
etc).

Mike, is there a reason why you're indexing "category" as keyword not text?
