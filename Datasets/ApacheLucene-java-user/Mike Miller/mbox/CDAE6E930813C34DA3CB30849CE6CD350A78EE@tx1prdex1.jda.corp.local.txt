Thanks for the quick response.  

Sorry for my lack of understanding, but I am learning!  Won't the query
parser still handle this query?  My limited understanding was that the
search call provides the 'all' field as default field for query terms in
the case where fields aren't specified.   Using the current code,
searches like author:Mike" and title:Lucene work fine.

You're using the query parser with the standard analyser. You should
construct a term query manually instead.
