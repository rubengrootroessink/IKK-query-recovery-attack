Thanks for your quick answer. I'm going to try the PhraseQuery as you 
propose.

But considering theses three examples :

document 1 =    "this is an example"
document 2 =    "this is an example of document"
document 3 =    "this is an other example"

i guess that a PhraseQuery, based on :

    +"this is an example"

and with setSlop(0) will match document1 AND also document2 ?

Does the PhraseQuery act as the SQL operator  LIKE  "%something_to_search%" 
or like the '=' SQL operator ?

I'm going to investigate.

Thanks again.

Philippe
