SUBJECT: Lucene Search with relational operators
DATE: 5 Feb 2008


Hi all,

When i do a search ( lucene ) with the combination of relational operators,
it does not get the required result.
ie, when the query is like  :: 

i) A and B or C,  it fetches the records for only (A and B) combination
rejecting C ( OR operator )
ii) A or B and C, it fetches the records for only (B and C) combination
rejecting A ( OR operator )

Why is that behaving tlike this ??
