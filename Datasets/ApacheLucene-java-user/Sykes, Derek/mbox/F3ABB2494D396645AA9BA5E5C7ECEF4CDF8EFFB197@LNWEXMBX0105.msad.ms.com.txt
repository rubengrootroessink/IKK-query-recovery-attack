SUBJECT: determining the type of a term - retrieving a payload
DATE: 13 Oct 2010

Hi there,

I'm currently trying to work out how I can determine the type (string/number/date/etc)of a
term.  I've not seen any off the shelf way to do it so am trying to store a payload against
each term that records the type.

I'm having a little trouble retrieving a payload I'd stored onto the term.  At the moment
I'm using the TypeAsPayloadTokenFilter, however I'll change this soon as it's not really what
I'm after.

I'm then getting a TermEnum from either reader.terms() or using a PrefixTermEnum.

For each term I want the payload from I'm running this function:

    private String getPayload(Term term) {
        String payload = null;
        try {
            TermPositions termPositions = reader.termPositions(term);
            termPositions.next();
            if (termPositions.isPayloadAvailable()) {
                byte[] payloadBytes = new byte[termPositions.getPayloadLength()];
                payloadBytes = termPositions.getPayload(payloadBytes, 0);
                payload = new String(payloadBytes);
                LOG.debug(payload);
            }
        }
        catch( IOException e) {
...

This never returns anything though.

Am I missing something here?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Derek
