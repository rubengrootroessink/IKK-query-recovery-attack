SUBJECT: help w/ phrase query
DATE: 13 Dec 2002

Hi All.....

I'm out of ideas on how to get the PhraseQuery to return any results.  I'm 
guessing I might not be indexing properly when the document data is being 
stored.  Is there any particular Field type that should be used.  I've tried 
both Field.Text(String, String) and Field.Text(String, Reader).

If Field type is irrelevant....any pointers on where to look next are 
appreciated.
