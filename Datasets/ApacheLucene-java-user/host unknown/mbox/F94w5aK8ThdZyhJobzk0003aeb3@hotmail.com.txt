SUBJECT: searching multiple indexex
DATE: 27 Mar 2003

Hi all,

I have a question.  I have 2 indexes (1 - continually growing, never deleted 
archive index.  2 - an index that is wiped and recreated daily.  These are 
completely disjoint sets of data)

I want/need to perform site-wide searches across both sets of data.  Is 
there a built in search mechanism that will allow me to search both indexes 
and return ordered hits?  Or am I going to have to do 2 independant searches 
then order the hits by score myself?

Thanks,
Dominic
