SUBJECT: prevent re-indexing
DATE: 9 Dec 2002

Hi all,

I have a rather large file system that I'm indexing (php/html files 
actually).  I'm reindexing on a daily basis, however I don't want/need to 
reindex 95+% of my files since they're not going to change.

Is there currently the capiblilty to look at the last modified date and 
check it against the file that has already been indexed before re-indexing 
the file?  Or is this something that needs to be implemented?

Thanks again,
Dominic

PS.  Thanks for the quick responses last time...the spider is starting to 
behave :-)
