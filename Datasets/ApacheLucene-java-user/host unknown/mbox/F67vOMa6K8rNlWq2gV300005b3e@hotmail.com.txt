SUBJECT: larm and lucene?
DATE: 9 Dec 2002

Has anyone out there sucessfully implemented the larm with lucene?

I have been pouring over the larm source (since there's no external 
documentation) with little success getting it to behave properly 
(controlling it's spidering behavior/paths transversed), much less luck in 
determining where I should throw my lucene hooks into the larm source.

Any suggestions or pointers appreciated.....
