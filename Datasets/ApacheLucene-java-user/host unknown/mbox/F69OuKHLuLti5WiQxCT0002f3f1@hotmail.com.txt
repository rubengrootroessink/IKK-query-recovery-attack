SUBJECT: RangeQuery Note
DATE: 17 Feb 2003

Hi All,

I've spent the weekend mulling over a problem I had with a RangeQuery over a 
Price field.  The problem was that prices can range from 1 to many digits 
(no cents, just dollars).  My searches were returning inconsistent results.  
After much debugging and playing around I found that 99 != 000099.  I've 
since converted all my prices to zero filled strings of length 8 and the 
searches are working properly.

Question/Comment:

Is this a bug in the sense that searching a range from 0 to 100 should 
return 99 (as opposed to 099)? if it isn't this might make a helpful note in 
the javadoc.

Have a great day,
Dominic
