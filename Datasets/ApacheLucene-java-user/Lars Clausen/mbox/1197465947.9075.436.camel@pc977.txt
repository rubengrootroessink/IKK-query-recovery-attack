Seems there's a reason we still use all this memory:
SegmentReader.fakeNorms() creates the full-size array for us anyway, so
the memory usage cannot be avoided as long as somebody asks for the
norms array at any point.  The solution is starting to look like a patch
that allows the norms array to be null and handles uses of it
appropriately.  Some of the code seems to consider this legal, but
others do not.
