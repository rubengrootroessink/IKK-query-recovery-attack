Tried the patch, and it failed to compile (plain Lucene compiled fine).
In the process, I looked at TermQuery and found that it'd be easier to
copy that code and just hardcode 1.0f for all norms.  Did that and ran
our test index of 50 million entries.  Instead of the 50-60MB it used
before, it is now down to 8-9MB.   For Yonik: This is measured using
jconsole.  Do you have a better tool? 

 I'll do a few more tests to see how it scales, but this is definitely
the way out for us.  Thanks for the cluons!
