SUBJECT: query parser and specific type of query
DATE: 24 Nov 2001

Hi,

I would like to know how to do the following using Lucene:
I index some file containing a string "king of spades" using stop analyzer.
The analyzer filters out "of" in the above string since it is not useful for searching
and indexes king and spades.
Its fine till this point.

Now i would like to search for the same string "king of spades".
My questions are,
1. If i want to generate a PhraseQuery from the QueryParser using StopAnalyzer, what should
be done?
2. If i want to generate a FuzzyQuery from the QueryParser using StopAnalyzer, what should
be done?

thanks for any help,

regards,
==Rahul==
