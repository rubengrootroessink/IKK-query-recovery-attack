SUBJECT: lucene index parser problem
DATE: 7 Sep 2004

Hi,

I have such a problem when creating lucene index for many html files:

It shows "aborted, expected<tagname>....<tagend>" for those html files
which contain java scripts. It seems it cannot parse the tags < \>.
Does anyone has any solution?

Thank you very very much...!!!

Ivy.
