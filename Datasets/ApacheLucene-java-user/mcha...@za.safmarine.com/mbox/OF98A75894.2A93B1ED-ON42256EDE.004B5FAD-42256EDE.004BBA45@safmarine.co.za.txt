SUBJECT: storing a directory (indexes) in a database   [Our Ref:CPTB5FAD]
DATE: 27 Jul 2004

hi there,

There seems to be lots of talk about storing Lucene directories in a 
relational DB, but I haven't found too many links.

I've looked at JDBCDirectory (http://ppinew.mnis.com/jdbcdirectory/) but 
get a NullPointerException when trying to get an index-reader on a newly 
created directory.

Has anyone else had success with JDBCDirectory?

Are there alternative implementation out there? 

thanks,
Manoj
