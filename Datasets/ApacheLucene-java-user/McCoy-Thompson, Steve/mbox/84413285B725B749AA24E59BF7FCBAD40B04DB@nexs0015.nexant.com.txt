Doug, 

Avi Rappaport of searchtools.com suggested I look at Lucene for my company's
search needs as well as for the backbone of a consulting process we are
developing.  On the surface, it looks promising.  I would very much like to
speak with you and can be reached either via e-mail or at 415-912-2186.

Regards,

Steve McCoy-Thompson
