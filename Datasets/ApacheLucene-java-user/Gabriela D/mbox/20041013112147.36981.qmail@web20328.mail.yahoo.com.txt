SUBJECT: WhitespaceAnalyzer Problem
DATE: 13 Oct 2004

I have been indexing my flat files (plain text documents) using 
WhitespaceAnalyzer, in order not to miss out any characters during tokenizing. 
The results are satisfactory when I use exact search criteria for 
searching. However, I am unable to get any results or hits when I use 
wildcard searching using "*" or "?". Why is this so? Any work around for 
this?
I am using Lucene 1.4 rc3. FYI, I am using same WhitespaceAnalyzer for 
both indexing as well as searching.
Please help.
Regards, Dera.
