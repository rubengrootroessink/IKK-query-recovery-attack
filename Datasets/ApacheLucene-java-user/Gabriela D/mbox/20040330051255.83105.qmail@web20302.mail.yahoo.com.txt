Dear All,

I have modified StandardTokenizer.jj to include many of special character in the token. However,
still the problem exists as the index does not include the characters ":,{,},(,)" and "%".
Can somebody help me as to what should I modify so that index will include words with these
special characters?

Your help is appreciated.

Thanks and Regards,

Harsha
