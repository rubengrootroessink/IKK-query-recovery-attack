I have found the following tools quite handy for what you mention. They 
offer fully Java based implementations of a number of machine learning 
principles which is very handy. There is also a book available to 
complement the WEKA toolkit.

http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ (WEKA - Machine learning toolkit)
http://www.nzdl.org/Kea/             (Keyphrase extraction using WEKA)
http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/%7Enzdl/textmining/index.html

The Keyphrase ExtrAction toolkit works quite well but relies on being 
seeded with known summary information to build patterns.

There are a number of papers on this topic which you can find at the 
above web sites.

Not sure if this is helpful but it may be a start.

regards

Geoff
