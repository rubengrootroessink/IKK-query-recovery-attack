SUBJECT: Re: Document.getBinaryValue returning null after upgrading to 2.4 for the data which was indexed using 2.3.1
DATE: 16 Dec 2008


Thanks for the response. I guess this is the problem, but not sure whether it
happens on optimize.

This is what happening exactly

the field is still present (not null) and is marked as binary, but the data
is not there - Field.getBinaryLength() returns 0.
