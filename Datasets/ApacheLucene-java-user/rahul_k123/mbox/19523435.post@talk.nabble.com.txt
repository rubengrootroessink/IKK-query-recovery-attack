what is the behaviour of IndexReader.current() if i modify the index
manually? Will it returns false?

One more question  

The index is on Linux

if my indexReader is open and some of the files in index are deleted, what
is the behaviour of this?

Will it give any exception like File Not found??

Any help is appreciated

Thanks
Rahul.
