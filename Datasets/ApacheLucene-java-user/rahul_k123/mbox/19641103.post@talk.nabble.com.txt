SUBJECT: Rsync causing search timeouts on master
DATE: 24 Sep 2008


Hi,

I am using snappuller to sync my slave with master, i am not using rsync
daemon, i am doing Rsync using remote shell.

When i am serving requests from the master when the snappuller is running
(after optimization, total index is arnd 4 gb it doing the transfer of whole
index), the performance is very bad actually causing timeouts.



Any ideas why this happens .


Any suggestions will help.


Thanks.
