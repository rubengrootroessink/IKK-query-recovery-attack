SUBJECT: Document.getBinaryValue returning null after upgrading to 2.4 for the data which was indexed using 2.3.1
DATE: 16 Dec 2008


The data was indexed using 2.3.1 as follows

 doc.add(new Field(Fields.DETAILS, byte[] bytes,
            Field.Store.YES));

When i reindex this particular item using 2.4 and when i try to retrive it,
it works fine.

Then for the items which were indexed using 2.3.1 and not reindexed using
2.4

the following call

doc.getBinaryValue(Fields.DETAILS)

is returning null.


So, except for the documents which were reindexed using 2.4 the search is
failing.



One more thing when i didn't reindex any of the documents using 2.4 , the
search worked fine using 2.4.


Any ideas why this is happening.
