Hi,

I modified the analyzer (it is now vegetarian and won't eat numbers anymore
:-) but I have hit a new problem. The parser won't accept a keyword to start
with a wildcard character. (*/12/2003) Any hints to solve this new issue?

Many thanks

Chris

Chris - the answer to this dilemma is here: http://wiki.apache.org/ 
jakarta-lucene/AnalysisParalysis

In short, the analyzer is eating the numbers as it was designed to do  
- you'll want to adjust the analyzer to achieve the indexing/ 
searching for numbers somehow.
