SUBJECT: free text search with numbers
DATE: 1 Jul 2005

Hi folks,

 

It is the first time that I implement a search with Lucene, so please don't
laugh if my question seam trivial.

When I enter some text in my free text search the query gets build correctly
but when I enter number (as string) the query parser seam to ignore them.
What am I doing wrong?

 

Query: org.apache.lucene.search.Query

Parser: org.apache.lucene.queryParser.MultiFieldQueryParser

 

 

Many thanks for your help

 

Chris
